<p>SED(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual SED(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sed - stream editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sed [-n] script[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sed [-n][-e script]...[-f
script_file]...[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sed utility is a stream editor that shall read one or
more text files, make editing changes according to a script
of editing commands, and write the results to standard
out&acirc; <br>
put. The script shall be obtained from either the script
operand string or a combination of the option-arguments from
the -e script and -f script_file options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The sed utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that the order of presentation of the -e
and <br>
-f options is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e script <br>
Add the editing commands specified by the script
option-argument to the end of the script of editing
commands. The script option-argument shall have the same
properties as <br>
the script operand, described in the OPERANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f script_file <br>
Add the editing commands in the file script_file to the end
of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Suppress the default output
(in which each line, after it is examined for editing, is
written to standard output). Only lines explicitly selected
for output are written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple -e and -f options may
be specified. All commands shall be added to the script in
the order specified, regardless of their origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file whose
contents are read and edited. If multiple file operands are
specified, the named files shall be read in the order
specified and the concatena&acirc; <br>
tion shall be edited. If no file operands are specified, the
standard input shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script A string to be used as
the script of editing commands. The application shall not
present a script that violates the restrictions of a text
file except that the final char&acirc; <br>
acter need not be a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files. The script_files named
by the -f option shall consist of editing commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of sed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for the
behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
collating elements within regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files), and the behavior of character classes within
regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The input files shall be written to standard output, with
the editing commands specified in the script applied. If the
-n option is specified, only those input lines selected by
<br>
the script shall be written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
The output files shall be text files whose formats are
dependent on the editing commands given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The script shall consist of editing commands of the
following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[address[,address]]function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where function represents a
single-character command verb from the list in Editing
Commands in sed, followed by any applicable arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command can be preceded by
&lt;blank&gt;s and/or semicolons. The function can be
preceded by &lt;blank&gt;s. These optional characters shall
have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In default operation, sed
cyclically shall append a line of input, less its
terminating &lt;newline&gt;, into the pattern space.
Normally the pattern space will be empty, unless a D <br>
command terminated the last cycle. The sed utility shall
then apply in sequence all commands whose addresses select
that pattern space, and at the end of the script copy the
pat&acirc; <br>
tern space to standard output (except when -n is specified)
and delete the pattern space. Whenever the pattern space is
written to standard output or a named file, sed shall <br>
immediately follow it with a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the editing commands use
a hold space to save all or part of the pattern space for
subsequent retrieval. The pattern and hold spaces shall each
be able to hold at least <br>
8192 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses in sed <br>
An address is either a decimal number that counts input
lines cumulatively across files, a &rsquo;$&rsquo; character
that addresses the last line of input, or a context address
(which con&acirc; <br>
sists of a BRE, as described in Regular Expressions in sed,
preceded and followed by a delimiter, usually a slash).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An editing command with no
addresses shall select every pattern space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An editing command with one
address shall select each pattern space that matches the
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An editing command with two
addresses shall select the inclusive range from the first
pattern space that matches the first address through the
next pattern space that matches the <br>
second. (If the second address is a number less than or
equal to the line number first selected, only one line shall
be selected.) Starting at the first line following the <br>
selected range, sed shall look again for the first address.
Thereafter, the process shall be repeated. Omitting either
or both of the address components in the following form <br>
produces undefined results:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[address[,address]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular Expressions in sed <br>
The sed utility shall support the BREs described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3,
Basic Regular Expressions, with the following additions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* In a context address, the
construction &quot; appears following a backslash, then it
shall be considered to be that literal character, which
shall not terminate the BRE. For example, in the context
address &quot;cfx&quot;, <br>
the second x stands for itself, so that the BRE is
&quot;abcxdef&quot; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The escape sequence &rsquo;0
shall match a &lt;newline&gt; embedded in the pattern space.
A literal &lt;newline&gt; shall not be used in the BRE of a
context address or in the substitute <br>
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If an RE is empty (that is, no
pattern is specified) sed shall behave as if the last RE
used in the last command applied (either as an address or as
part of a substitute com&acirc; <br>
mand) was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing Commands in sed <br>
In the following list of editing commands, the maximum
number of permissible addresses for each function is
indicated by [ 0addr], [ 1addr], or [ 2addr], representing
zero, one, <br>
or two addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument text shall consist
of one or more lines. Each embedded &lt;newline&gt; in the
text shall be preceded by a backslash. Other backslashes in
text shall be removed, and the <br>
following character shall be treated literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The r and w command verbs, and
the w flag to the s command, take an optional rfile (or
wfile) parameter, separated from the command verb letter or
flag by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s; <br>
implementations may allow zero separation as an
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument rfile or the
argument wfile shall terminate the editing command. Each
wfile shall be created before processing begins.
Implementations shall support at least ten <br>
wfile arguments in the script; the actual number (greater
than or equal to 10) that is supported by the implementation
is unspecified. The use of the wfile parameter shall cause
<br>
that file to be initially created, if it does not exist, or
shall replace the contents of an existing file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The b, r, s, t, w, y, and :
command verbs shall accept additional arguments. The
following synopses indicate which arguments shall be
separated from the command verbs by a sin&acirc; <br>
gle &lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The a and r commands schedule
text for later output. The text specified for the a command,
and the contents of the file specified for the r command,
shall be written to standard <br>
output just before the next attempt to fetch a line of input
when executing the N or n commands, or when reaching the end
of the script. If written when reaching the end of the <br>
script, and the -n option was not specified, the text shall
be written after copying the pattern space to standard
output. The contents of the file specified for the r command
<br>
shall be as of the time the output is written, not the time
the r command is applied. The text shall be output in the
order in which the a and r commands were applied to the <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command verbs other than {, a,
b, c, i, r, t, w, :, and # can be followed by a semicolon,
optional &lt;blank&gt;s, and another command verb. However,
when the s command verb is used <br>
with the w flag, following it with another command in this
manner produces undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A function can be preceded by
one or more &rsquo;!&rsquo; characters, in which case the
function shall be applied if the addresses do not select the
pattern space. Zero or more &lt;blank&gt;s <br>
shall be accepted before the first &rsquo;!&rsquo;
character. It is unspecified whether &lt;blank&gt;s can
follow a &rsquo;!&rsquo; character, and conforming
applications shall not follow a &rsquo;!&rsquo; character
<br>
with &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr] {function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} Execute a list of sed
functions only when the pattern space is selected. The list
of sed functions shall be surrounded by braces and separated
by &lt;newline&gt;s, and conform <br>
to the following rules. The braces can be preceded or
followed by &lt;blank&gt;s. The functions can be preceded by
&lt;blank&gt;s, but shall not be followed by &lt;blank&gt;s.
The &lt;right- <br>
brace&gt; shall be preceded by a &lt;newline&gt; and can be
preceded or followed by &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]a <br>
text Write text to standard output as described
previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]b [label]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Branch to the : function bearing
the label. If label is not specified, branch to the end of
the script. The implementation shall support labels
recognized as unique up to <br>
at least 8 characters; the actual length (greater than or
equal to 8) that shall be supported by the implementation is
unspecified. It is unspecified whether exceeding a <br>
label length causes an error or a silent truncation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]c <br>
text Delete the pattern space. With a 0 or 1 address or at
the end of a 2-address range, place text on the output and
start the next cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]d <br>
Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]D <br>
Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the
first &lt;newline&gt; and start the next cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]g <br>
Replace the contents of the pattern space by the contents of
the hold space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]G <br>
Append to the pattern space a &lt;newline&gt; followed by
the contents of the hold space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]h <br>
Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of
the pattern space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]H <br>
Append to the hold space a &lt;newline&gt; followed by the
contents of the pattern space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]i <br>
text Write text to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]l <br>
(The letter ell.) Write the pattern space to standard output
in a visually unambiguous form. The characters listed in the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, <br>
Table 5-1, Escape Sequences and Associated Actions&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo; shall be written as the
corresponding ( &rsquo;\&rsquo;, &rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;,,
&rsquo; escape sequence; the &rsquo;0 in that ta&acirc; <br>
ble is not applicable. Non-printable characters not in that
table shall be written as one three-digit octal number (with
a preceding backslash) for each byte in the char&acirc; <br>
acter (most significant byte first). If the size of a byte
on the system is greater than 9 bits, the format used for
non-printable characters is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long lines shall be folded, with
the point of folding indicated by writing a backslash
followed by a &lt;newline&gt;; the length at which folding
occurs is unspecified, but should be <br>
appropriate for the output device. The end of each line
shall be marked with a &rsquo;$&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]n <br>
Write the pattern space to standard output if the default
output has not been suppressed, and replace the pattern
space with the next line of input, less its terminating <br>
&lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no next line of input is
available, the n command verb shall branch to the end of the
script and quit without starting a new cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]N <br>
Append the next line of input, less its terminating
&lt;newline&gt;, to the pattern space, using an embedded
&lt;newline&gt; to separate the appended material from the
original mate&acirc; <br>
rial. Note that the current line number changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no next line of input is
available, the N command verb shall branch to the end of the
script and quit without starting a new cycle or copying the
pattern space to standard <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]p <br>
Write the pattern space to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]P <br>
Write the pattern space, up to the first &lt;newline&gt;, to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]q <br>
Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a
new cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]r rfile <br>
Copy the contents of rfile to standard output as described
previously. If rfile does not exist or cannot be read, it
shall be treated as if it were an empty file, causing <br>
no error condition.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]s/BRE/replacement/flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Substitute the replacement
string for instances of the BRE in the pattern space. Any
character other than backslash or &lt;newline&gt; can be
used instead of a slash to delimit <br>
the BRE and the replacement. Within the BRE and the
replacement, the BRE delimiter itself can be used as a
literal character if it is preceded by a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The replacement string shall be
scanned from beginning to end. An ampersand (
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; ) appearing in the replacement shall be
replaced by the string matching the BRE. The special <br>
meaning of &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; in this context can be
suppressed by preceding it by a backslash. The characters
&quot;0, where n is a digit, shall be replaced by the text
matched by the correspond&acirc; <br>
ing backreference expression. The special meaning of &quot;0
where n is a digit in this context, can be suppressed by
preceding it by a backslash. For each other backslash (
&rsquo;&acute; ) <br>
encountered, the following character shall lose its special
meaning (if any). The meaning of a &rsquo;&acute;
immediately followed by any character other than
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, &rsquo;&acute;, a digit, or the <br>
delimiter character used for this command, is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line can be split by
substituting a &lt;newline&gt; into it. The application
shall escape the &lt;newline&gt; in the replacement by
preceding it by a backslash. A substitution shall be <br>
considered to have been performed even if the replacement
string is identical to the string that it replaces. Any
backslash used to alter the default meaning of a subsequent
<br>
character shall be discarded from the BRE or the replacement
before evaluating the BRE or using the replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of flags shall be zero
or more of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n <br>
Substitute for the nth occurrence only of the BRE found
within the pattern space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g <br>
Globally substitute for all non-overlapping instances of the
BRE rather than just the first one. If both g and n are
specified, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p <br>
Write the pattern space to standard output if a replacement
was made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w wfile <br>
Write. Append the pattern space to wfile if a replacement
was made. A conforming application shall precede the wfile
argument with one or more &lt;blank&gt;s. If the w flag is
<br>
not the last flag value given in a concatenation of multiple
flag values, the results are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]t [label]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test. Branch to the : command
verb bearing the label if any substitutions have been made
since the most recent reading of an input line or execution
of a t. If label is <br>
not specified, branch to the end of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]w wfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Append (write) the pattern space
to wfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]x <br>
Exchange the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]y/string1/string2/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace all occurrences of
characters in string1 with the corresponding characters in
string2. If a backslash followed by an &rsquo;n&rsquo;
appear in string1 or string2, the two <br>
characters shall be handled as a single &lt;newline&gt;. If
the number of characters in string1 and string2 are not
equal, or if any of the characters in string1 appear more
<br>
than once, the results are undefined. Any character other
than backslash or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of
slash to delimit the strings. If the delimiter is not n,
<br>
within string1 and string2, the delimiter itself can be used
as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash. If
a backslash character is immediately followed by <br>
a backslash character in string1 or string2, the two
backslash characters shall be counted as a single literal
backslash character. The meaning of a backslash followed by
<br>
any character that is not &rsquo;n&rsquo;, a backslash, or
the delimiter character is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[0addr]:label <br>
Do nothing. This command bears a label to which the b and t
commands branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]= <br>
Write the following to standard output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d0, &lt;current line
number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[0addr] <br>
Ignore this empty command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[0addr]# <br>
Ignore the &rsquo;#&rsquo; and the remainder of the line
(treat them as a comment), with the single exception that if
the first two characters in the script are &quot;#n&quot;,
the default out&acirc; <br>
put shall be suppressed; this shall be the equivalent of
specifying -n on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Regular expressions match entire strings, not just
individual lines, but a &lt;newline&gt; is matched by
&rsquo;0 in a sed RE; a &lt;newline&gt; is not allowed by
the general definition of regu&acirc; <br>
lar expression in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Also note that
&rsquo;0 cannot be used to match a &lt;newline&gt; at the
end of an arbitrary input line; &lt;newline&gt;s appear in
the pattern space as <br>
a result of the N editing command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This sed script simulates the BSD cat -s command, squeezing
excess blank lines from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sed -n &rsquo; <br>
# Write non-empty lines. <br>
/./ { <br>
p <br>
d <br>
} <br>
# Write a single empty line, then look for more empty lines.

# Write the non-empty line before going back to search <br>

p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires implementations
to support at least ten distinct wfiles, matching historical
practice on many implementations. Implementations are <br>
encouraged to support more, but conforming applications
should not exceed this limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status codes specified
here are different from those in System V. System V returns
2 for garbled sed commands, but returns zero with its usage
message or if the input <br>
file could not be opened. The standard developers considered
this to be a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The manner in which the l
command writes non-printable characters was changed to avoid
the historical backspace-overstrike method, and other
requirements to achieve unambiguous <br>
output were added. See the RATIONALE for ed for details of
the format chosen, which is the same as that chosen for
sed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 requires implementations to provide pattern and
hold spaces of at least 8192 bytes, larger than the 4000
bytes spaces used by some historical <br>
implementations, but less than the 20480 bytes limit used in
an early proposal. Implementations are encouraged to
allocate dynamically larger pattern and hold spaces as
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The requirements for acceptance
of &lt;blank&gt;s and &lt;space&gt;s in command lines has
been made more explicit than in early proposals to describe
clearly the historical practice and to <br>
remove confusion about the phrase &quot;protect initial
blanks [sic] and tabs from the stripping that is done on
every script line&quot; that appears in much of the
historical documenta&acirc; <br>
tion of the sed utility description of text. (Not all
implementations are known to have stripped &lt;blank&gt;s
from text lines, although they all have allowed leading
&lt;blank&gt;s preced&acirc; <br>
ing the address on a command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The treatment of &rsquo;#&rsquo;
comments differs from the SVID which only allows a comment
as the first line of the script, but matches BSD-derived
implementations. The comment character is <br>
treated as a command, and it has the same properties in
terms of being accepted with leading &lt;blank&gt;s; the BSD
implementation has historically supported this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Early proposals required that a
script_file have at least one non-comment line. Some
historical implementations have behaved in unexpected ways
if this were not the case. The <br>
standard developers considered that this was incorrect
behavior and that application developers should not have to
avoid this feature. A correct implementation of this volume
of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 shall permit script_files that consist
only of comment lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Early proposals indicated that
if -e and -f options were intermixed, all -e options were
processed before any -f options. This has been changed to
process them in the order pre&acirc; <br>
sented because it matches historical practice and is more
intuitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The treatment of the p flag to
the s command differs between System V and BSD-based systems
when the default output is suppressed. In the two
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo a | sed
&rsquo;s/a/A/p&rsquo; <br>
echo a | sed -n &rsquo;s/a/A/p&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, BSD, System V documentation, and the SVID
indicate that the first example should write two lines with
A, whereas the second should write one. <br>
Some System V systems write the A only once in both examples
because the p flag is ignored if the -n option is not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a case of a diametrical
difference between systems that could not be reconciled
through the compromise of declaring the behavior to be
unspecified. The SVID/BSD/System V <br>
documentation behavior was adopted for this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* No known documentation for any
historic system describes the interaction between the p flag
and the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The selected behavior is more
correct as there is no technical justification for any
interaction between the p flag and the -n option. A
relationship between -n and the p flag <br>
might imply that they are only used together, but this
ignores valid scripts that interrupt the cyclical nature of
the processing through the use of the D, d, q, or branching
<br>
commands. Such scripts rely on the p suffix to write the
pattern space because they do not make use of the default
output at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Because the -n option makes
the p flag unnecessary, any interaction would only be useful
if sed scripts were written to run both with and without the
-n option. This is <br>
believed to be unlikely. It is even more unlikely that
programmers have coded the p flag expecting it to be
unnecessary. Because the interaction was not documented, the
like&acirc; <br>
lihood of a programmer discovering the interaction and
depending on it is further decreased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Finally, scripts that break
under the specified behavior produce too much output instead
of too little, which is easier to diagnose and correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The form of the substitute
command that uses the n suffix was limited to the first 512
matches in an early proposal. This limit has been removed
because there is no reason an <br>
editor processing lines of {LINE_MAX} length should have
this restriction. The command s/a/A/2047 should be able to
substitute the 2047th occurrence of a on a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The b, t, and : commands are
documented to ignore leading white space, but no mention is
made of trailing white space. Historical implementations of
sed assigned different loca&acirc; <br>
tions to the labels &rsquo;x&rsquo; and &quot;x &quot; .
This is not useful, and leads to subtle programming errors,
but it is historical practice, and changing it could
theoretically break working <br>
scripts. Implementors are encouraged to provide warning
messages about labels that are never used or jumps to labels
that do not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the sed ! and }
editing commands did not permit multiple commands on a
single line using a semicolon as a command delimiter.
Implementations are permitted, but not <br>
required, to support this extension.</p>
