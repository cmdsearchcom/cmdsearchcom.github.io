<p>JOBS(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual JOBS(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jobs - display status of jobs in the current session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jobs [-l| -p][job_id...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The jobs utility shall display the status of jobs that were
started in the current shell environment; see Shell
Execution Environment .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When jobs reports the
termination status of a job, the shell shall remove its
process ID from the list of those &quot;known in the current
shell execution environment&rsquo;&rsquo;; see
Asynchro&acirc; <br>
nous Lists .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The jobs utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (The letter ell.) Provide
more information about each job listed. This information
shall include the job number, current job, process group ID,
state, and the command <br>
that formed the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Display only the process IDs
for the process group leaders of the selected jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the jobs utility
shall display the status of all stopped jobs, running
background jobs and all jobs whose status has changed and
have not been reported by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">job_id Specifies the jobs for
which the status is to be displayed. If no job_id is given,
the status information for all jobs shall be displayed. The
format of job_id is <br>
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.203, Job Control Job ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of jobs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If the -p option is specified, the output shall consist of
one line for each process ID:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d0, &lt;process
ID&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if the -l option is
not specified, the output shall be a series of lines of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;[%d] %c %s %s0,
&lt;job-number&gt;, &lt;current&gt;, &lt;state&gt;,
&lt;command&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the fields shall be as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;current&gt; <br>
The character &rsquo;+&rsquo; identifies the job that would
be used as a default for the fg or bg utilities; this job
can also be specified using the job_id %+ or &quot;%%&quot;
. The character <br>
&rsquo;-&rsquo; identifies the job that would become the
default if the current default job were to exit; this job
can also be specified using the job_id %-. For other jobs,
this <br>
field is a &lt;space&gt;. At most one job can be identified
with &rsquo;+&rsquo; and at most one job can be identified
with &rsquo;-&rsquo; . If there is any suspended job, then
the current job shall <br>
be a suspended job. If there are at least two suspended
jobs, then the previous job also shall be a suspended
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;job-number&gt; <br>
A number that can be used to identify the process group to
the wait, fg, bg, and kill utilities. Using these utilities,
the job can be identified by prefixing the job num&acirc;
<br>
ber with &rsquo;%&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;state&gt; <br>
One of the following strings (in the POSIX locale):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running <br>
Indicates that the job has not been suspended by a signal
and has not exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Done <br>
Indicates that the job completed and returned exit status
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Done(code) <br>
Indicates that the job completed normally and that it exited
with the specified non-zero exit status, code, expressed as
a decimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped <br>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTSTP
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGTSTP)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates that the job was
suspended by the SIGTSTP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGSTOP)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates that the job was
suspended by the SIGSTOP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGTTIN)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates that the job was
suspended by the SIGTTIN signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGTTOU)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates that the job was
suspended by the SIGTTOU signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The implementation may
substitute the string Suspended in place of Stopped. If the
job was terminated by a signal, the format of &lt;state&gt;
is unspecified, but it shall be visibly <br>
distinct from all of the other &lt;state&gt; formats shown
here and shall indicate the name or description of the
signal causing the termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;command&gt; <br>
The associated command that was given to the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -l option is specified, a
field containing the process group ID shall be inserted
before the &lt;state&gt; field. Also, more processes in a
process group may be output on sepa&acirc; <br>
rate lines, using only the process ID and &lt;command&gt;
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The -p option is the only portable way to find out the
process group of a job because different implementations
have different strategies for defining the process group of
the <br>
job. Usage such as $( jobs -p) provides a way of referring
to the process group of the job in an
implementation-independent way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The jobs utility does not work
as expected when it is operating in its own utility
execution environment because that environment has no
applicable jobs to manipulate. See the <br>
APPLICATION USAGE section for bg . For this reason, jobs is
generally implemented as a shell regular built-in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Both &quot;%%&quot; and &quot;%+&quot; are used to refer to
the current job. Both forms are of equal validity-the
&quot;%%&quot; mirroring &quot;$$&quot; and &quot;%+&quot;
mirroring the output of jobs. Both forms reflect his&acirc;
<br>
torical practice of the KornShell and the C shell with job
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job control features
provided by bg, fg, and jobs are based on the KornShell. The
standard developers examined the characteristics of the C
shell versions of these utilities <br>
and found that differences exist. Despite widespread use of
the C shell, the KornShell versions were selected for this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to maintain a degree of
uni&acirc; <br>
formity with the rest of the KornShell features selected
(such as the very popular command line editing
features).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The jobs utility is not
dependent on the job control option, as are the seemingly
related bg and fg utilities because jobs is useful for
examining background jobs, regardless of <br>
the condition of job control. When the user has invoked a
set +m command and job control has been turned off, jobs can
still be used to examine the background jobs associated <br>
with that current session. Similarly, kill can then be used
to kill background jobs with kill% &lt;background job
number&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output for terminated jobs
is left unspecified to accommodate various historical
systems. The following formats have been witnessed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Killed( signal name)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. signal name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. signal name( coredump)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. signal description- core
dumped</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most users should be able to
understand these formats, although it means that
applications have trouble parsing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calculation of job IDs was
not described since this would suggest an implementation,
which may impose unnecessary restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an early proposal, a -n
option was included to &quot;Display the status of jobs that
have changed, exited, or stopped since the last status
report&quot;. It was removed because the <br>
shell always writes any changed status of jobs before each
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
