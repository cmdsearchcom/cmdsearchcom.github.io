<p>FORT77(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
FORT77(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fort77 - FORTRAN compiler (FORTRAN)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fort77 [-c][-g][-L directory]... [-O optlevel][-o
outfile][-s][-w] <br>
operand...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fort77 utility is the interface to the FORTRAN
compilation system; it shall accept the full FORTRAN-77
language defined by the ANSI X3.9-1978 standard. The system
conceptu&acirc; <br>
ally consists of a compiler and link editor. The files
referenced by operands are compiled and linked to produce an
executable file. It is unspecified whether the linking
occurs <br>
entirely within the operation of fort77; some
implementations may produce objects that are not fully
resolved until the file is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -c option is present, for
all pathname operands of the form file .f, the files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(basename pathname.f).o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shall be created or overwritten
as the result of successful compilation. If the -c option is
not specified, it is unspecified whether such .o files are
created or deleted for <br>
the file .f operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are no options that
prevent link editing (such as -c) and all operands compile
and link without error, the resulting executable file shall
be written into the file named <br>
by the -o option (if present) or to the file a.out. The
executable file shall be created as specified in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, except that the
<br>
file permissions shall be set to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and that the bits specified by
the umask of the process shall be cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The fort77 utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -l library operands have
the format of options, but their position within a list of
operands affects the order in which libraries are
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The order of specifying the
multiple -L options is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Conforming applications shall
specify each option separately; that is, grouping option
letters (for example, -cg) need not be recognized by all
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Suppress the link-edit phase
of the compilation, and do not remove any object files that
are produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Produce symbolic information
in the object or executable files; the nature of this
information is unspecified, and may be modified by
implementation-defined interactions <br>
with other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Produce object or executable
files, or both, from which symbolic and other information
not required for proper execution using the exec family of
functions defined in the <br>
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 has been
removed (stripped). If both -g and -s options are present,
the action taken is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Use the pathname outfile, instead of the default a.out, for
the executable file produced. If the -o option is present
with -c, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L directory <br>
Change the algorithm of searching for the libraries named in
-l operands to look in the directory named by the directory
pathname before looking in the usual places. <br>
Directories named in -L options shall be searched in the
specified order. At least ten instances of this option shall
be supported in a single fort77 command invocation. <br>
If a directory specified by a -L option contains a file
named libf.a, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O optlevel <br>
Specify the level of code optimization. If the optlevel
option-argument is the digit &rsquo;0&rsquo;, all special
code optimizations shall be disabled. If it is the digit
&rsquo;1&rsquo;, the <br>
nature of the optimization is unspecified. If the -O option
is omitted, the nature of the system&rsquo;s default
optimization is unspecified. It is unspecified whether code
gen&acirc; <br>
erated in the presence of the -O 0 option is the same as
that generated when -O is omitted. Other optlevel values may
be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Suppress warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple instances of -L options
can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
An operand is either in the form of a pathname or the form
-l library. At least one operand of the pathname form shall
be specified. The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.f The pathname of a FORTRAN
source file to be compiled and optionally passed to the link
editor. The filename operand shall be of this form if the -c
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.a A library of object files
typically produced by ar, and passed directly to the link
editor. Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
suffixes other than .a as <br>
denoting object file libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.o An object file produced
by fort77 -c and passed directly to the link editor.
Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
suffixes other than .o as denoting object <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The processing of other files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l library <br>
(The letter ell.) Search the library named:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">liblibrary.a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A library is searched when its
name is encountered, so the placement of a -l operand is
significant. Several standard libraries can be specified in
this manner, as described in <br>
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section. Implementations may
recognize implementation-defined suffixes other than .a as
denoting libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input file shall be one of the following: a text file
containing FORTRAN source code; an object file in the format
produced by fort77 -c; or a library of object files, in the
<br>
format produced by archiving zero or more object files,
using ar. Implementations may supply additional utilities
that produce files in these formats. Additional input files
are <br>
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &lt;tab&gt; encountered within
the first six characters on a line of source code shall
cause the compiler to interpret the following character as
if it were the seventh character on <br>
the line (that is, in column 7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of fort77:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Determine the pathname
that should override the default directory for temporary
files, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages. If more than one file operand ending in .f (or
possibly other unspecified suffixes) is given, for each such
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s:0, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may be written to allow
identification of the diagnostic message with the
appropriate input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility may produce warning
messages about certain conditions that do not warrant
returning an error (non-zero) exit value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Object files, listing files, and executable files shall be
produced in unspecified formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
Standard Libraries <br>
The fort77 utility shall recognize the following -l operand
for the standard library:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l f This library contains all
functions referenced in the ANSI X3.9-1978 standard. This
operand shall not be required to be present to cause a
search of this library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the absence of options that
inhibit invocation of the link editor, such as -c, the
fort77 utility shall cause the equivalent of a -l f operand
to be passed to the link editor <br>
as the last -l operand, causing it to be searched after all
other object files and libraries are loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unspecified whether the
library libf.a exists as a regular file. The implementation
may accept as -l operands names of objects that do not exist
as regular files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External Symbols <br>
The FORTRAN compiler and link editor shall support the
significance of external symbols up to a length of at least
31 bytes; case folding is permitted. The action taken upon
<br>
encountering symbols exceeding the implementation-defined
maximum symbol length is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler and link editor
shall support a minimum of 511 external symbols per source
or object file, and a minimum of 4095 external symbols
total. A diagnostic message is <br>
written to standard output if the implementation-defined
limit is exceeded; other actions are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful compilation or link
edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
When fort77 encounters a compilation error, it shall write a
diagnostic to standard error and continue to compile other
source code operands. It shall return a non-zero exit
sta&acirc; <br>
tus, but it is implementation-defined whether an object
module is created. If the link edit is unsuccessful, a
diagnostic message shall be written to standard error, and
fort77 <br>
shall exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following usage example compiles xyz.f and creates the
executable file foo:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fort77 -o foo xyz.f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example compiles
xyz.f and creates the object file xyz.o:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fort77 -c xyz.f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example compiles
xyz.f and creates the executable file a.out:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fort77 xyz.f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example compiles
xyz.f, links it with b.o, and creates the executable
a.out:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fort77 xyz.f b.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The name of this utility was chosen as fort77 to parallel
the renaming of the C compiler. The name f77 was not chosen
to avoid problems with historical implementations. The <br>
ANSI X3.9-1978 standard was selected as a normative
reference because the ISO/IEC version of FORTRAN-77 has been
superseded by the ISO/IEC 1539:1990 standard
(Fortran-90).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file inclusion and symbol
definition #define mechanisms used by the c99 utility were
not included in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001-even
though they are commonly imple&acirc; <br>
mented-since there is no requirement that the FORTRAN
compiler use the C preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -onetrip option was not
included in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, even though
many historical compilers support it, because it is derived
from FORTRAN-66; it is an <br>
anachronism that should not be perpetuated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some implementations produce
compilation listings. This aspect of FORTRAN has been left
unspecified because there was controversy concerning the
various methods proposed for <br>
implementing it: a -V option overlapped with historical
vendor practice and a naming convention of creating files
with .l suffixes collided with historical lex file naming
prac&acirc; <br>
tice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no -I option in this
version of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to specify a
directory for file inclusion. An INCLUDE directive has been
a part of the Fortran-90 <br>
discussions, but an interface supporting that standard is
not in the current scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is noted that many FORTRAN
compilers produce an object module even when compilation
errors occur; during a subsequent compilation, the compiler
may patch the object module <br>
rather than recompiling all the code. Consequently, it is
left to the implementor whether or not an object file is
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reference to MIL-STD-1753 was
removed from an early proposal in response to a request from
the POSIX FORTRAN-binding standard developers. It was not
the intention of the stan&acirc; <br>
dard developers to require certification of the FORTRAN
compiler, and IEEE Std 1003.9-1992 does not specify the
military standard or any special preprocessing requirements.
Fur&acirc; <br>
thermore, use of that document would have been inappropriate
for an international standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specification of
optimization has been subject to changes through early
proposals. At one time, -O and -N were Booleans: optimize
and do not optimize (with an unspecified <br>
default). Some historical practice led this to be changed
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O 0 No optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O 1 Some level of
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O n Other, unspecified levels
of optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not always clear whether
&quot;good code generation&quot; is the same thing as
optimization. Simple optimizations of local actions do not
usually affect the semantics of a program. <br>
The -O 0 option has been included to accommodate the very
particular nature of scientific calculations in a highly
optimized environment; compilers make errors. Some degree of
<br>
optimization is expected, even if it is not documented here,
and the ability to shut it off completely could be important
when porting an application. An implementation may treat
<br>
-O 0 as &quot;do less than normal&quot; if it wishes, but
this is only meaningful if any of the operations it performs
can affect the semantics of a program. It is highly
dependent on the <br>
implementation whether doing less than normal is logical. It
is not the intent of the -O 0 option to ask for inefficient
code generation, but rather to assure that any
semanti&acirc; <br>
cally visible optimization is suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specification of standard
library access is consistent with the C compiler
specification. Implementations are not required to have
/usr/lib/libf.a, as many historical imple&acirc; <br>
mentations do, but if not they are required to recognize f
as a token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External symbol size limits are
in normative text; conforming applications need to know
these limits. However, the minimum maximum symbol length
should be taken as a constraint <br>
on a conforming application, not on an implementation, and
consequently the action taken for a symbol exceeding the
limit is unspecified. The minimum size for the external
symbol <br>
table was added for similar reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
section clearly specifies the behavior of the compiler when
compilation or link-edit errors occur. The behavior of
several historical implementations <br>
was examined, and the choice was made to be silent on the
status of the executable, or a.out, file in the face of
compiler or linker errors. If a linker writes the executable
<br>
file, then links it on disk with lseek()s and write()s, the
partially linked executable file can be left on disk and its
execute bits turned off if the link edit fails. However,
<br>
if the linker links the image in memory before writing the
file to disk, it need not touch the executable file (if it
already exists) because the link edit fails. Since both <br>
approaches are historical practice, a conforming application
shall rely on the exit status of fort77, rather than on the
existence or mode of the executable file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -g and -s options are not
specified as mutually-exclusive. Historically these two
options have been mutually-exclusive, but because both are
so loosely specified, it seemed <br>
appropriate to leave their interaction unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The requirement that conforming
applications specify compiler options separately is to
reserve the multi-character option name space for
vendor-specific compiler options, which <br>
are known to exist in many historical implementations.
Implementations are not required to recognize, for example,
-gc as if it were -g -c; nor are they forbidden from doing
so. <br>
The SYNOPSIS shows all of the options separately to
highlight this requirement on applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Echoing filenames to standard
error is considered a diagnostic message because it would
otherwise be difficult to associate an error message with
the erring file. They are <br>
described with &quot;may&quot; to allow implementations to
use other methods of identifying files and to parallel the
description in c99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
A compilation system based on the ISO/IEC 1539:1990 standard
(Fortran-90) may be considered for a future version; it may
have a different utility name from fort77.</p>
