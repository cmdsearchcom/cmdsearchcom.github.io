<p>UUENCODE(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
UUENCODE(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
uuencode - encode a binary file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uuencode [-m][file] decode_pathname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The uuencode utility shall write an encoded version of the
named input file, or standard input if no file is specified,
to standard output. The output shall be encoded using one
<br>
of the algorithms described in the STDOUT section and shall
include the file access permission bits (in chmod octal or
symbolic notation) of the input file and the
decode_path&acirc; <br>
name, for re-creation of the file on another system that
conforms to this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The uuencode utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Encode the output using the
MIME Base64 algorithm described in STDOUT. If -m is not
specified, the historical algorithm described in STDOUT
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decode_pathname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pathname of the file into
which the uudecode utility shall place the decoded file.
Specifying a decode_pathname operand of /dev/stdout shall
indicate that uudecode is <br>
to use standard output. If there are characters in
decode_pathname that are not in the portable filename
character set the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of the file to
be encoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
Input files can be files of any type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of uuencode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
uuencode Base64 Algorithm <br>
The standard output shall be a text file (encoded in the
character set of the current locale) that begins with the
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;begin-base64 %s %s0,
&lt;mode&gt;, &lt;decode_pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and ends with the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;====0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases, the lines shall
have no preceding or trailing &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The encoding process represents
24-bit groups of input bits as output strings of four
encoded characters. Proceeding from left to right, a 24-bit
input group shall be formed by <br>
concatenating three 8-bit input groups. Each 24-bit input
group then shall be treated as four concatenated 6-bit
groups, each of which shall be translated into a single
digit in <br>
the Base64 alphabet. When encoding a bit stream via the
Base64 encoding, the bit stream shall be presumed to be
ordered with the most-significant bit first. That is, the
first <br>
bit in the stream shall be the high-order bit in the first
byte, and the eighth bit shall be the low-order bit in the
first byte, and so on. Each 6-bit group is used as an index
<br>
into an array of 64 printable characters, as shown in
uuencode Base64 Values .</p>

16 Q 33 h 50 y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The character referenced by the
index shall be placed in the output string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output stream (encoded
bytes) shall be represented in lines of no more than 76
characters each. All line breaks or other characters not
found in the table shall be ignored by <br>
decoding software (see uudecode ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special processing shall be
performed if fewer than 24 bits are available at the end of
a message or encapsulated part of a message. A full encoding
quantum shall always be com&acirc; <br>
pleted at the end of a message. When fewer than 24 input
bits are available in an input group, zero bits shall be
added (on the right) to form an integral number of 6-bit
groups. <br>
Output character positions that are not required to
represent actual input data shall be set to the character
&rsquo;=&rsquo; . Since all Base64 input is an integral
number of octets, only <br>
the following cases can arise:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The final quantum of encoding
input is an integral multiple of 24 bits; here, the final
unit of encoded output shall be an integral multiple of 4
characters with no &rsquo;=&rsquo; pad&acirc; <br>
ding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The final quantum of encoding
input is exactly 16 bits; here, the final unit of encoded
output shall be three characters followed by one
&rsquo;=&rsquo; padding character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The final quantum of encoding
input is exactly 8 bits; here, the final unit of encoded
output shall be two characters followed by two
&rsquo;=&rsquo; padding characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A terminating &quot;====&quot;
evaluates to nothing and denotes the end of the encoded
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uuencode Historical Algorithm
<br>
The standard output shall be a text file (encoded in the
character set of the current locale) that begins with the
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;begin %s %s0 &lt;mode&gt;,
&lt;decode_pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and ends with the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;end0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases, the lines shall
have no preceding or trailing &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm that shall be used
for lines in between begin and end takes three octets as
input and writes four characters of output by splitting the
input at six-bit intervals <br>
into four octets, containing data in the lower six bits
only. These octets shall be converted to characters by
adding a value of 0x20 to each octet, so that each octet is
in the <br>
range [0x20,0x5f], and then it shall be assumed to represent
a printable character in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
encoded character set. It then shall be translated into the
<br>
corresponding character codes for the codeset in use in the
current locale. (For example, the octet 0x41, representing
&rsquo;A&rsquo;, would be translated to &rsquo;A&rsquo; in
the current codeset, <br>
such as 0xc1 if it were EBCDIC.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the bits of two octets are
combined, the least significant bits of the first octet
shall be shifted left and combined with the most significant
bits of the second octet <br>
shifted right. Thus the three octets A, B, C shall be
converted into the four octets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x20 + (( A &gt;&gt; 2 ) &amp;
0x3F) <br>
0x20 + (((A &lt;&lt; 4) | ((B &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0xF)) &amp;
0x3F) <br>
0x20 + (((B &lt;&lt; 2) | ((C &gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 0x3)) &amp;
0x3F) <br>
0x20 + (( C ) &amp; 0x3F)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These octets then shall be
translated into the local character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each encoded line contains a
length character, equal to the number of characters to be
decoded plus 0x20 translated to the local character set as
described above, followed by the <br>
encoded characters. The maximum number of octets to be
encoded on each line shall be 45.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The file is expanded by 35 percent (each three octets become
four, plus control information) causing it to take longer to
transmit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since this utility is intended
to create files to be used for data interchange between
systems with possibly different codesets, and to represent
binary data as a text file, the <br>
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard was chosen for a midpoint in the
algorithm as a known reference point. The output from
uuencode is a text file on the local system. If the output
were <br>
in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard codeset, it might not be a
text file (at least because the &lt;newline&gt;s might not
match), and the goal of creating a text file would be
defeated. <br>
If this text file was then carried to another machine with
the same codeset, it would be perfectly compatible with that
system&rsquo;s uudecode. If it was transmitted over a mail
sys&acirc; <br>
tem or sent to a machine with a different codeset, it is
assumed that, as for every other text file, some translation
mechanism would convert it (by the time it reached a user on
<br>
the other system) into an appropriate codeset. This
translation only makes sense from the local codeset, not if
the file has been put into a ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
representa&acirc; <br>
tion first. Similarly, files processed by uuencode can be
placed in pax archives, intermixed with other text files in
the same codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
A new algorithm was added at the request of the
international community to parallel work in RFC 2045 (MIME).
As with the historical uuencode format, the Base64
Content-Transfer- <br>
Encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
octets in a form that is not humanly readable. A
65-character subset of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard is
used, enabling 6 <br>
bits to be represented per printable character. (The extra
65th character, &rsquo;=&rsquo;, is used to signify a
special processing function.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This subset has the important
property that it is represented identically in all versions
of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard, including US ASCII, and
all characters in the subset <br>
are also represented identically in all versions of EBCDIC.
The historical uuencode algorithm does not share this
property, which is the reason that a second algorithm was
added <br>
to the ISO POSIX-2 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string &quot;====&quot; was
used for the termination instead of the end used in the
original format because the latter is a string that could be
valid encoded input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an early draft, the -m option
was named -b (for Base64), but it was renamed to reflect its
relationship to the RFC 2045. A -u was also present to
invoke the default algorithm, <br>
but since this was not historical practice, it was omitted
as being unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the RATIONALE section in
uudecode for the derivation of the /dev/stdout symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
