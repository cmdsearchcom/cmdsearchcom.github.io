<p>UUX(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual UUX(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
uux - remote command execution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uux [-np] command-string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uux [-jnp] command-string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The uux utility shall gather zero or more files from various
systems, execute a shell pipeline (see Shell Commands ) on a
specified system, and then send the standard output of <br>
the command to a file on a specified system. Only the first
command of a pipeline can have a system-name! prefix. All
other commands in the pipeline shall be executed on the
sys&acirc; <br>
tem of the first command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following restrictions are
applicable to the shell pipeline processed by uux:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* In gathering files from
different systems, pathname expansion shall not be performed
by uux. Thus, a request such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uux &quot;c99
remsys!~/*.c&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would attempt to copy the file
named literally *.c to the local system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The redirection operators
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;,
&quot;&gt;|&quot;, and &quot;&gt;&amp;&quot; shall not be
accepted. Any use of these redirection operators shall cause
this utility to write an error message describ&acirc; <br>
ing the problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The reserved word ! cannot be
used at the head of the pipeline to modify the exit status.
(See the command-string operand description below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Alias substitution shall not
be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A filename can be specified as
for uucp; it can be an absolute pathname, a pathname
preceded by ~ name (which is replaced by the corresponding
login directory), a pathname speci&acirc; <br>
fied as ~/ dest ( dest is prefixed by the public directory
called PUBDIR; the actual location of PUBDIR is
implementation-defined), or a simple filename (which is
prefixed by uux <br>
with the current directory). See uucp for the details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The execution of commands on
remote systems shall take place in an execution directory
known to the uucp system. All files required for the
execution shall be put into this <br>
directory unless they already reside on that machine.
Therefore, the application shall ensure that non-local
filenames (without path or machine reference) are unique
within the <br>
uux request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The uux utility shall attempt to
get all files to the execution system. For files that are
output files, the application shall ensure that the filename
is escaped using parenthe&acirc; <br>
ses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remote system shall notify
the user by mail if the requested command on the remote
system was disallowed or the files were not accessible. This
notification can be turned off <br>
by the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typical implementations of this
utility require a communications line configured to use the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 11,
General Terminal Inter&acirc; <br>
face, but other communications means may be used. On systems
where there are no available communications means (either
temporarily or permanently), this utility shall write an
<br>
error message describing the problem and exit with a
non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The uux utility cannot guarantee
support for all character encodings in all circumstances.
For example, transmission data may be restricted to 7 bits
by the underlying network, <br>
8-bit data and filenames need not be portable to
non-internationalized systems, and so on. Under these
circumstances, it is recommended that only characters
defined in the <br>
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International Reference Version
(equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of characters be used and
that only characters defined in the portable filename
char&acirc; <br>
acter set be used for naming files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The uux utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Make the standard input to
uux the standard input to the command-string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Write the job identification
string to standard output. This job identification can be
used by uustat to obtain the status or terminate a job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not notify the user if the
command fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command-string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A string made up of one or more
arguments that are similar to normal command arguments,
except that the command and any filenames can be prefixed by
system-name!. A null <br>
system-name shall be interpreted as the local system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall not be used unless the
&rsquo;-&rsquo; or -p option is specified; in those cases,
the standard input shall be made the standard input of the
command-string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
Input files shall be selected according to the contents of
command-string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of uux:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The standard output shall not be used unless the -j option
is specified; in that case, the job identification string
shall be written to standard output in the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;jobid&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Output files shall be created or written, or both, according
to the contents of command-string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -n is not used, mail files
shall be modified following any command or file-access
failures on the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Note that, for security reasons, many installations limit
the list of commands executable on behalf of an incoming
request from uux. Many sites permit little more than the
<br>
receipt of mail via uux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any characters special to the
command interpreter should be quoted either by quoting the
entire command-string or quoting the special characters as
individual arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As noted in uucp, shell pattern
matching notation characters appearing in pathnames are
expanded on the appropriate local system. This is done under
the control of local settings <br>
of LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE . Thus, care should be taken when
using bracketed filename patterns, as collation and typing
rules may vary from one system to another. Also be aware
<br>
that certain types of expression (that is, equivalence
classes, character classes, and collating symbols) need not
be supported on non-internationalized systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following command gets file1 from system a and file2
from system b, executes diff on the local system, and puts
the results in file.diff in the local PUBDIR directory. (
<br>
PUBDIR is the uucp public directory on the local
system.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uux &quot;!diff a!/usr/file1
b!/a4/file2 &gt;!~/file.diff&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command fails
because uux places all files copied to a system in the same
working directory. Although the files xyz are from two
different systems, their file&acirc; <br>
names are the same and conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uux &quot;!diff a!/usr1/xyz
b!/usr2/xyz &gt;!~/xyz.diff&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The following command
succeeds (assuming diff is permitted on system a) because
the file local to system a is not copied to the working
directory, and hence does not conflict <br>
with the file from system c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uux &quot;a!diff a!/usr/xyz
c!/usr/xyz &gt;!~/xyz.diff&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
