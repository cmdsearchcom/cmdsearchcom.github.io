<p>DU(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual DU(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
du - estimate file space usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
du [-a | -s][-kx][-H | -L][file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
By default, the du utility shall write to standard output
the size of the file space allocated to, and the size of the
file space allocated to each subdirectory of, the file <br>
hierarchy rooted in each of the specified files. By default,
when a symbolic link is encountered on the command line or
in the file hierarchy, du shall count the size of the
sym&acirc; <br>
bolic link (rather than the file referenced by the link),
and shall not follow the link to another portion of the file
hierarchy. The size of the file space allocated to a file
<br>
of type directory shall be defined as the sum total of space
allocated to all files in the file hierarchy rooted in the
directory plus the space allocated to the directory <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When du cannot stat() files or
stat() or read directories, it shall report an error
condition and the final exit status is affected. Files with
multiple links shall be counted <br>
and written for only one entry. The directory entry that is
selected in the report is unspecified. By default, file
sizes shall be written in 512-byte units, rounded up to the
<br>
next 512-byte unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The du utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a In addition to the default
output, report the size of each file not of type directory
in the file hierarchy rooted in the specified file.
Regardless of the presence of the <br>
-a option, non-directories given as file operands shall
always be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H If a symbolic link is
specified on the command line, du shall count the size of
the file or file hierarchy referenced by the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Write the files sizes in
units of 1024 bytes, rather than the default 512-byte
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L If a symbolic link is
specified on the command line or encountered during the
traversal of a file hierarchy, du shall count the size of
the file or file hierarchy refer&acirc; <br>
enced by the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Instead of the default
output, report only the total sum for each of the specified
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x When evaluating file sizes,
evaluate only those files that have the same device as the
file specified by the file operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
mutually-exclusive options -H and -L shall not be considered
an error. The last option specified shall determine the
behavior of the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file The pathname of a file
whose size is to be written. If no file is specified, the
current directory shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of du:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The output from du shall consist of the amount of space
allocated to a file and the name of the file, in the
following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d %s0, &lt;size&gt;,
&lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and
maintains compatibility with ls and other utilities in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. This does not mandate that
the <br>
file system itself be based on 512-byte blocks. The -k
option was added as a compromise measure. It was agreed by
the standard developers that 512 bytes was the best default
<br>
unit because of its complete historical consistency on
System V (versus the mixed 512/1024-byte usage on BSD
systems), and that a -k option to switch to 1024-byte units
was a <br>
good compromise. Users who prefer the 1024-byte quantity can
easily alias du to du -k without breaking the many
historical scripts relying on the 512-byte units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b option was added to an
early proposal to provide a resolution to the situation
where System V and BSD systems give figures for file sizes
in blocks, which is an implemen&acirc; <br>
tation-defined concept. (In common usage, the block size is
512 bytes for System V and 1024 bytes for BSD systems.)
However, -b was later deleted, since the default was
eventu&acirc; <br>
ally decided as 512-byte units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical file systems provided
no way to obtain exact figures for the space allocation
given to files. There are two known areas of inaccuracies in
historical file systems: <br>
cases of indirect blocks being used by the file system or
sparse files yielding incorrectly high values. An indirect
block is space used by the file system in the storage of the
<br>
file, but that need not be counted in the space allocated to
the file. A sparse file is one in which an lseek() call has
been made to a position beyond the end of the file and <br>
data has subsequently been written at that point. A file
system need not allocate all the intervening zero-filled
blocks to such a file. It is up to the implementation to
define <br>
exactly how accurate its methods are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a and -s options were
mutually-exclusive in the original version of du. The POSIX
Shell and Utilities description is implied by the language
in the SVID where -s is <br>
described as causing &quot;only the grand total&quot; to be
reported. Some systems may produce output for -sa, but a
Strictly Conforming POSIX Shell and Utilities Application
cannot use <br>
that combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a and -s options were
adopted from the SVID except that the System V behavior of
not listing non-directories explicitly given as operands,
unless the -a option is specified, <br>
was considered a bug; the BSD-based behavior (report for all
operands) is mandated. The default behavior of du in the
SVID with regard to reporting the failure to read files (it
<br>
produces no messages) was considered counter-intuitive, and
thus it was specified that the POSIX Shell and Utilities
default behavior shall be to produce such messages. These
<br>
messages can be turned off with shell redirection to achieve
the System V behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -x option is historical
practice on recent BSD systems. It has been adopted by this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 because there was no other
historical method of limiting <br>
the du search to a single file hierarchy. This limitation of
the search is necessary to make it possible to obtain file
space usage information about a file system on which other
<br>
file systems are mounted, without having to resort to a
lengthy find and awk script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
