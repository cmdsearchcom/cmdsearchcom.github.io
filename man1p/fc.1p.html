<p>FC(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual FC(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fc - process the command history list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fc [-r][-e editor] [first[last]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc -l[-nr] [first[last]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc -s[old=new][first]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fc utility shall list, or shall edit and re-execute,
commands previously entered to an interactive sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command history list shall
reference commands by number. The first number in the list
is selected arbitrarily. The relationship of a number to its
command shall not change <br>
except when the user logs in and no other process is
accessing the list, at which time the system may reset the
numbering to start the oldest retained command at another
number <br>
(usually 1). When the number reaches an
implementation-defined upper limit, which shall be no
smaller than the value in HISTSIZE or 32767 (whichever is
greater), the shell may <br>
wrap the numbers, starting the next command with a lower
number (usually 1). However, despite this optional wrapping
of numbers, fc shall maintain the time-ordering sequence of
<br>
the commands. For example, if four commands in sequence are
given the numbers 32766, 32767, 1 (wrapped), and 2 as they
are executed, command 32767 is considered the command
pre&acirc; <br>
vious to 1, even though its number is higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When commands are edited (when
the -l option is not specified), the resulting lines shall
be entered at the end of the history list and then
re-executed by sh. The fc command <br>
that caused the editing shall not be entered into the
history list. If the editor returns a non-zero exit status,
this shall suppress the entry into the history list and the
com&acirc; <br>
mand re-execution. Any command line variable assignments or
redirection operators used with fc shall affect both the fc
command itself as well as the command that results; for <br>
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc -s -- -1 2&gt;/dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reinvokes the previous command,
suppressing standard error for both fc and the previous
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The fc utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e editor <br>
Use the editor named by editor to edit the commands. The
editor string is a utility name, subject to search via the
PATH variable (see the Base Definitions volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables). The
value in the FCEDIT variable shall be used as a default when
-e is not specified. If FCEDIT is null or unset, <br>
ed shall be used as the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (The letter ell.) List the
commands rather than invoking an editor on them. The
commands shall be written in the sequence indicated by the
first and last operands, as <br>
affected by -r, with each command preceded by the command
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Suppress command numbers when
listing with -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Reverse the order of the
commands listed (with -l) or edited (with neither -l nor
-s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Re-execute the command
without invoking an editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first, last <br>
Select the commands to list or edit. The number of previous
commands that can be accessed shall be determined by the
value of the HISTSIZE variable. The value of first or <br>
last or both shall be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+]number <br>
A positive number representing a command number; command
numbers can be displayed with the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-number <br>
A negative decimal number representing the command that was
executed number of commands previously. For example, -1 is
the immediately previous command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string <br>
A string indicating the most recently entered command that
begins with that string. If the old= new operand is not also
specified with -s, the string form of the first op&acirc;
<br>
erand cannot contain an embedded equal sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the synopsis form with -s
is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If first is omitted, the
previous command shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the synopsis forms without
-s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If last is omitted, last shall
default to the previous command when -l is specified;
otherwise, it shall default to first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If first and last are both
omitted, the previous 16 commands shall be listed or the
previous single command shall be edited (based on the -l
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If first and last are both
present, all of the commands from first to last shall be
edited (without -l) or listed (with -l). Editing multiple
commands shall be accom&acirc; <br>
plished by presenting to the editor all of the commands at
one time, each command starting on a new line. If first
represents a newer command than last, the commands <br>
shall be listed or edited in reverse sequence, equivalent to
using -r. For example, the following commands on the first
line are equivalent to the corresponding com&acirc; <br>
mands on the second:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc -r 10 20 fc 30 40 <br>
fc 20 10 fc -r 40 30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* When a range of commands is
used, it shall not be an error to specify first or last
values that are not in the history list; fc shall substitute
the value representing <br>
the oldest or newest command in the list, as appropriate.
For example, if there are only ten commands in the history
list, numbered 1 to 10:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc -l <br>
fc 1 99</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shall list and edit,
respectively, all ten commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old=new <br>
Replace the first occurrence of string old in the commands
to be re-executed by the string new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of fc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FCEDIT This variable, when
expanded by the shell, shall determine the default value for
the -e editor option&rsquo;s editor option-argument. If
FCEDIT is null or unset, ed shall be <br>
used as the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTFILE <br>
Determine a pathname naming a command history file. If the
HISTFILE variable is not set, the shell may attempt to
access or create a file .sh_history in the directory <br>
referred to by the HOME environment variable. If the shell
cannot obtain both read and write access to, or create, the
history file, it shall use an unspecified mechanism <br>
that allows the history to operate properly. (References to
history &quot;file&quot; in this section shall be understood
to mean this unspecified mechanism in such cases.) An
imple&acirc; <br>
mentation may choose to access this variable only when
initializing the history file; this initialization shall
occur when fc or sh first attempt to retrieve entries from,
<br>
or add entries to, the file, as the result of commands
issued by the user, the file named by the ENV variable, or
implementation-defined system start-up files. In some <br>
historical shells, the history file is initialized just
after the ENV file has been processed. Therefore, it is
implementation-defined whether changes made to HISTFILE <br>
after the history file has been initialized are effective.
Implementations may choose to disable the history list
mechanism for users with appropriate privileges who do <br>
not set HISTFILE ; the specific circumstances under which
this occurs are implementation-defined. If more than one
instance of the shell is using the same history file, it
<br>
is unspecified how updates to the history file from those
shells interact. As entries are deleted from the history
file, they shall be deleted oldest first. It is
unspec&acirc; <br>
ified when history file entries are physically removed from
the history file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTSIZE <br>
Determine a decimal number representing the limit to the
number of previous commands that are accessible. If this
variable is unset, an unspecified default greater than or
<br>
equal to 128 shall be used. The maximum number of commands
in the history list is unspecified, but shall be at least
128. An implementation may choose to access this vari&acirc;
<br>
able only when initializing the history file, as described
under HISTFILE. Therefore, it is unspecified whether changes
made to HISTSIZE after the history file has been <br>
initialized are effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
When the -l option is used to list commands, the format of
each command in the list shall be as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d%s0, &lt;line
number&gt;, &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both the -l and -n options
are specified, the format of each command shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &lt;command&gt; consists
of more than one line, the lines after the first shall be
displayed as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0,
&lt;continued-command&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion of the
listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the exit status shall
be that of the commands executed by fc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Since editors sometimes use file descriptors as integral
parts of their editing, redirecting their file descriptors
as part of the fc command can produce unexpected results.
For <br>
example, if vi is the FCEDIT editor, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc -s | more</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">does not work correctly on many
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users on windowing systems may
want to have separate history files for each window by
setting HISTFILE as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTFILE=$HOME/.sh_hist$$</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
This utility is based on the fc built-in of the
KornShell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal specified the
-e option as [-e editor [ old = new ]], which is not
historical practice. Historical practice in fc of either [-e
editor ] or [-e - [ old = new ]] <br>
is acceptable, but not both together. To clarify this, a new
option -s was introduced replacing the [-e -]. This resolves
the conflict and makes fc conform to the Utility Syntax <br>
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTFILE <br>
Some implementations of the KornShell check for the
superuser and do not create a history file unless HISTFILE
is set. This is done primarily to avoid creating unlinked
<br>
files in the root file system when logging in during
single-user mode. HISTFILE must be set for the superuser to
have history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTSIZE <br>
Needed to limit the size of history files. It is the intent
of the standard developers that when two shells share the
same history file, commands that are entered in one <br>
shell shall be accessible by the other shell. Because of the
difficulties of synchronization over a network, the exact
nature of the interaction is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initialization process for
the history file can be dependent on the system start-up
files, in that they may contain commands that effectively
preempt the settings the user <br>
has for HISTFILE and HISTSIZE. For example, function
definition commands are recorded in the history file. If the
system administrator includes function definitions in some
sys&acirc; <br>
tem start-up file called before the ENV file, the history
file is initialized before the user can influence its
characteristics. In some historical shells, the history file
is <br>
initialized just after the ENV file has been processed.
Because of these situations, the text requires the
initialization process to be implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consideration was given to
omitting the fc utility in favor of the command line editing
feature in sh. For example, in vi editing mode, typing
&quot;&lt;ESC&gt; v&quot; is equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR=vi fc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the fc utility allows
the user the flexibility to edit multiple commands
simultaneously (such as fc 10 20) and to use editors other
than those supported by sh for com&acirc; <br>
mand line editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the KornShell, the alias r
(&lsquo;&lsquo;re-do&quot;) is preset to fc -e - (equivalent
to the POSIX fc -s). This is probably an easier command name
to remember than fc (&lsquo;&lsquo;fix command&quot;), but
<br>
it does not meet the Utility Syntax Guidelines. Renaming fc
to hist or redo was considered, but since this description
closely matches historical KornShell practice already, such
<br>
a renaming was seen as gratuitous. Users are free to create
aliases whenever odd historical names such as fc, awk, cat,
grep, or yacc are standardized by POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command numbers have no ordering
effects; they are like serial numbers. The -r option and
-number operand address the sequence of command execution,
regardless of serial num&acirc; <br>
bers. So, for example, if the command number wrapped back to
1 at some arbitrary point, there would be no ambiguity
associated with traversing the wrap point. For example, if
the <br>
command history were:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32766: echo 1 <br>
32767: echo 2 <br>
1: echo 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the number -2 refers to command
32767 because it is the second previous command, regardless
of serial number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
