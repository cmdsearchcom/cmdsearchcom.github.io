<p>COMPRESS(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
COMPRESS(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
compress - compress data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
compress [-fv][-b bits][file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compress [-cfv][-b
bits][file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The compress utility shall attempt to reduce the size of the
named files by using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Lempel-Ziv is US Patent
4464650, issued to William Eastman, Abraham Lempel, Jacob
Ziv, Martin Cohn on August 7th, 1984, and assigned to Sperry
Corporation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression is
covered by US Patent 4558302, issued to Terry A. Welch on
December 10th, 1985, and assigned to Sperry Corporation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems not supporting
adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding algorithm, the input files shall
not be changed and an error value greater than two shall be
returned. Except when the output <br>
is to the standard output, each file shall be replaced by
one with the extension .Z. If the invoking process has
appropriate privileges, the ownership, modes, access time,
and <br>
modification time of the original file are preserved. If
appending the .Z to the filename would make the name exceed
{NAME_MAX} bytes, the command shall fail. If no files are
<br>
specified, the standard input shall be compressed to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The compress utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bits <br>
Specify the maximum number of bits to use in a code. For a
conforming application, the bits argument shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 &lt;= bits &lt;= 14</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The implementation may allow
bits values of greater than 14. The default is 14, 15, or
16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Cause compress to write to
the standard output; the input file is not changed, and no
.Z files are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force compression of file,
even if it does not actually reduce the size of the file, or
if the corresponding file .Z file already exists. If the -f
option is not given, <br>
and the process is not running in the background, the user
is prompted as to whether an existing file .Z file should be
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Write the percentage
reduction of each file to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
If file operands are specified, the input files contain the
data to be compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of compress:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If no file operands are specified, or if a file operand is
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, or if the -c option is specified, the
standard output contains the compressed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic and
prompt messages and the output from -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
The output files shall contain the compressed output. The
format of compressed files is unspecified and interchange of
such files between implementations (including access via
<br>
unspecified file sharing mechanisms) is not required by IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 One or more files were not
compressed because they would have increased in size (and
the -f option was not specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;2 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
The input file shall remain unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of
the input, the number of bits per code, and the distribution
of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code
<br>
or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally
much better than that achieved by Huffman coding or adaptive
Huffman coding ( compact), and takes less time to
compute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although compress strictly
follows the default actions upon receipt of a signal or when
an error occurs, some unexpected results may occur. In some
implementations it is likely <br>
that a partially compressed file is left in place, alongside
its uncompressed input file. Since the general operation of
compress is to delete the uncompressed file only after <br>
the .Z file has been successfully filled, an application
should always carefully check the exit status of compress
before arbitrarily deleting files that have like-named
neigh&acirc; <br>
bors with .Z suffixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The limit of 14 on the bits
option-argument is to achieve portability to all systems
(within the restrictions imposed by the lack of an explicit
published file format). Some <br>
implementations based on 16-bit architectures cannot support
15 or 16-bit uncompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
