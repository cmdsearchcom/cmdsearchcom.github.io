<p>MAILX(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual MAILX(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mailx - process messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Send Mode <br>
mailx [-s subject] address...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Receive Mode <br>
mailx -e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailx [-HiNn][-F][-u user]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailx -f[-HiNn][-F][file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mailx utility provides a message sending and receiving
facility. It has two major modes, selected by the options
used: Send Mode and Receive Mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that do not support
the User Portability Utilities option, an application using
mailx shall have the ability to send messages in an
unspecified manner (Send Mode). <br>
Unless the first character of one or more lines is tilde (
&rsquo;~&rsquo; ), all characters in the input message shall
appear in the delivered message, but additional characters
may be <br>
inserted in the message before it is retrieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems supporting the User
Portability Utilities option, mail-receiving capabilities
and other interactive features, Receive Mode, described
below, also shall be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send Mode <br>
Send Mode can be used by applications or users to send
messages from the text in standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Receive Mode <br>
Receive Mode is more oriented towards interactive users.
Mail can be read and sent in this interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reading mail, mailx
provides commands to facilitate saving, deleting, and
responding to messages. When sending mail, mailx allows
editing, reviewing, and other modification <br>
of the message as it is entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incoming mail shall be stored in
one or more unspecified locations for each user,
collectively called the system mailbox for that user. When
mailx is invoked in Receive Mode, the <br>
system mailbox shall be the default place to find new mail.
As messages are read, they shall be marked to be moved to a
secondary file for storage, unless specific action is <br>
taken. This secondary file is called the mbox and is
normally located in the directory referred to by the HOME
environment variable (see MBOX in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section <br>
for a description of this file). Messages shall remain in
this file until explicitly removed. When the -f option is
used to read mail messages from secondary files, messages
<br>
shall be retained in those files unless specifically
removed. All three of these locations-system mailbox, mbox,
and secondary file-are referred to in this section as simply
<br>
&quot;mailboxes&quot;, unless more specific identification
is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The mailx utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported. (Only the -s subject option shall be required on
all systems. The other options are required only on systems
supporting the User Porta&acirc; <br>
bility Utilities option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Test for the presence of mail
in the system mailbox. The mailx utility shall write nothing
and exit with a successful return code if there is mail to
read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Read messages from the file
named by the file operand instead of the system mailbox.
(See also folder.) If no file operand is specified, read
messages from mbox instead of <br>
the system mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Record the message in a file
named after the first recipient. The name is the login-name
portion of the address found first on the To: line in the
mail header. Overrides <br>
the record variable, if set (see Internal Variables in mailx
.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Write a header summary
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore interrupts. (See also
ignore.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not initialize from the
system default start-up file. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not write an initial
header summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s subject <br>
Set the Subject header field to subject. All characters in
the subject string shall appear in the delivered message.
The results are unspecified if subject is longer than <br>
{LINE_MAX} - 10 bytes or contains a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Read the system mailbox of the login name user. This shall
only be successful if the invoking user has the appropriate
privileges to read the system mailbox of that user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address <br>
Addressee of message. When -n is specified and no user
start-up files are accessed (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section), the user or application shall ensure this is an
<br>
address to pass to the mail delivery system. Any system or
user start-up files may enable aliases (see alias under
Commands in mailx ) that may modify the form of address <br>
before it is passed to the mail delivery system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
read instead of the system mailbox when -f is specified. The
meaning of the file option-argument shall be affected by the
contents of the folder <br>
internal variable; see Internal Variables in mailx .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
When mailx is invoked in Send Mode (the first synopsis
line), standard input shall be the message to be delivered
to the specified addresses. When in Receive Mode, user
commands <br>
shall be accepted from stdin. If the User Portability
Utilities option is not supported, standard input lines
beginning with a tilde ( &rsquo;~&rsquo; ) character produce
unspecified <br>
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the User Portability
Utilities option is supported, then in both Send and Receive
Modes, standard input lines beginning with the escape
character (usually tilde ( &rsquo;~&rsquo; )) shall <br>
affect processing as described in Command Escapes in mailx
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
When mailx is used as described by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, the file option-argument (see the -f option)
and the mbox shall be text files containing mail messages,
<br>
formatted as described in the OUTPUT FILES section. The
nature of the system mailbox is unspecified; it need not be
a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of mailx:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEAD Determine the pathname of
the file in which to save partial messages in case of
interrupts or delivery errors. The default shall be
dead.letter in the directory named by <br>
the HOME variable. The behavior of mailx in saving partial
messages is unspecified if the User Portability Utilities
option is not supported and DEAD is not defined with <br>
the value /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR Determine the name of a
utility to invoke when the edit (see Commands in mailx ) or
~e (see Command Escapes in mailx ) command is used. The
default editor is unspecified. <br>
On XSI-conformant systems it is ed. The effects of this
variable are unspecified if the User Portability Utilities
option is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Determine the pathname of
the user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files) and the handling of case-insensitive address
and header-field comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME <br>
Determine the format and contents of the date and time
strings written by mailx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTER Determine a string
representing the command for writing the contents of the
folder directory to standard output when the folders command
is given (see folders in Commands <br>
in mailx ). Any string acceptable as a command_string
operand to the sh -c command shall be valid. If this
variable is null or not set, the output command shall be ls.
<br>
The effects of this variable are unspecified if the User
Portability Utilities option is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILRC Determine the pathname of
the start-up file. The default shall be .mailrc in the
directory referred to by the HOME environment variable. The
behavior of mailx is unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied if the User Portability Utilities option is not
supported and MAILRC is not defined with the value
/dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBOX Determine a pathname of the
file to save messages from the system mailbox that have been
read. The exit command shall override this function, as
shall saving the message <br>
explicitly in another file. The default shall be mbox in the
directory named by the HOME variable. The effects of this
variable are unspecified if the User Portability <br>
Utilities option is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER Determine a string
representing an output filtering or pagination command for
writing the output to the terminal. Any string acceptable as
a command_string operand to the <br>
sh -c command shall be valid. When standard output is a
terminal device, the message output shall be piped through
the command if the mailx internal variable crt is set <br>
to a value less the number of lines in the message; see
Internal Variables in mailx . If the PAGER variable is null
or not set, the paginator shall be either more or <br>
another paginator utility documented in the system
documentation. The effects of this variable are unspecified
if the User Portability Utilities option is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL Determine the name of a
preferred command interpreter. The default shall be sh. The
effects of this variable are unspecified if the User
Portability Utilities option is <br>
not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM If the internal variable
screen is not specified, determine the name of the terminal
type to indicate in an unspecified manner the number of
lines in a screenful of head&acirc; <br>
ers. If TERM is not set or is set to null, an unspecified
default terminal type shall be used and the value of a
screenful is unspecified. The effects of this variable are
<br>
unspecified if the User Portability Utilities option is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ This variable may determine
the timezone used to calculate date and time strings written
by mailx. If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified default
timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VISUAL Determine a pathname of a
utility to invoke when the visual command (see Commands in
mailx ) or ~v command-escape (see Command Escapes in mailx )
is used. If this variable <br>
is null or not set, the full-screen editor shall be vi. The
effects of this variable are unspecified if the User
Portability Utilities option is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
When mailx is in Send Mode and standard input is not a
terminal, it shall take the standard action for all
signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Receive Mode, or in Send Mode
when standard input is a terminal, if a SIGINT signal is
received:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If in command mode, the
current command, if there is one, shall be aborted, and a
command-mode prompt shall be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If in input mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If ignore is set, mailx shall
write &quot;@0, discard the current input line, and continue
processing, bypassing the message-abort mechanism described
in item 2b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If the interrupt was received
while sending mail, either when in Receive Mode or in Send
Mode, a message shall be written, and another subsequent
interrupt, with no other <br>
intervening characters typed, shall be required to abort the
mail message. If in Receive Mode and another interrupt is
received, a command-mode prompt shall be written. <br>
If in Send Mode and another interrupt is received, mailx
shall terminate with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases listed in item b,
if the message is not empty:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i. If save is enabled and the
file named by DEAD can be created, the message shall be
written to the file named by DEAD. If the file exists, the
message shall be <br>
written to replace the contents of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ii. If save is not enabled, or
the file named by DEAD cannot be created, the message shall
not be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mailx utility shall take the
standard action for all other signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
In command and input modes, all output, including prompts
and messages, shall be written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Various mailx commands and command escapes can create or add
to files, including the mbox, the dead-letter file, and
secondary mailboxes. When mailx is used as described in this
<br>
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, these files shall be text
files, formatted as follows: line beginning with
From&lt;space&gt; <br>
[one or more header-lines; see Commands in mailx ] <br>
empty line <br>
[zero or more body lines <br>
empty line] <br>
[line beginning with From&lt;space&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where each message begins with
the From &lt;space&gt; line shown, preceded by the beginning
of the file or an empty line. (The From &lt;space&gt; line
is considered to be part of the message <br>
header, but not one of the header-lines referred to in
Commands in mailx ; thus, it shall not be affected by the
discard, ignore, or retain commands.) The formats of the
remain&acirc; <br>
der of the From &lt;space&gt; line and any additional header
lines are unspecified, except that none shall be empty. The
format of a message body line is also unspecified, except
that <br>
no line following an empty line shall start with From
&lt;space&gt;; mailx shall modify any such user-entered
message body lines (following an empty line and beginning
with From <br>
&lt;space&gt;) by adding one or more characters to precede
the &rsquo;F&rsquo; ; it may add these characters to From
&lt;space&gt; lines that are not preceded by an empty
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a message from the system
mailbox or entered by the user is not a text file, it is
implementation-defined how such a message is stored in files
written by mailx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The entire EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section shall apply only to
implementations supporting the User Portability Utilities
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mailx utility cannot
guarantee support for all character encodings in all
circumstances. For example, inter-system mail may be
restricted to 7-bit data by the underlying net&acirc; <br>
work, 8-bit data need not be portable to
non-internationalized systems, and so on. Under these
circumstances, it is recommended that only characters
defined in the <br>
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International Reference Version
(equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of characters be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When mailx is invoked using one
of the Receive Mode synopsis forms, it shall write a page of
header-summary lines (if -N was not specified and there are
messages, see below), <br>
followed by a prompt indicating that mailx can accept
regular commands (see Commands in mailx ); this is termed
command mode. The page of header-summary lines shall contain
the <br>
first new message if there are new messages, or the first
unread message if there are unread messages, or the first
message. When mailx is invoked using the Send Mode synopsis
<br>
and standard input is a terminal, if no subject is specified
on the command line and the asksub variable is set, a prompt
for the subject shall be written. At this point, mailx <br>
shall be in input mode. This input mode shall also be
entered when using one of the Receive Mode synopsis forms
and a reply or new message is composed using the reply,
Reply, <br>
followup, Followup, or mail commands and standard input is a
terminal. When the message is typed and the end of the
message is encountered, the message shall be passed to the
<br>
mail delivery software. Commands can be entered by beginning
a line with the escape character (by default, tilde (
&rsquo;~&rsquo; )) followed by a single command letter and
optional argu&acirc; <br>
ments. See Commands in mailx for a summary of these
commands. It is unspecified what effect these commands will
have if standard input is not a terminal when a message is
<br>
entered using either the Send Mode synopsis, or the Read
Mode commands reply, Reply, followup, Followup, or mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: For notational
convenience, this section uses the default escape character,
tilde, in all references and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At any time, the behavior of
mailx shall be governed by a set of environmental and
internal variables. These are flags and valued parameters
that can be set and cleared via the <br>
mailx set and unset commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular commands are of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[command] [msglist] [argument
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no command is specified in
command mode, next shall be assumed. In input mode, commands
shall be recognized by the escape character, and lines not
treated as commands shall be <br>
taken as input for the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In command mode, each message
shall be assigned a sequential number, starting with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All messages have a state that
shall affect how they are displayed in the header summary
and how they are retained or deleted upon termination of
mailx. There is at any time the <br>
notion of a current message, which shall be marked by a
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; at the beginning of a line in the header
summary. When mailx is invoked using one of the Receive Mode
synopsis forms, <br>
the current message shall be the first new message, if there
is a new message, or the first unread message if there is an
unread message, or the first message if there are any <br>
messages, or unspecified if there are no messages in the
mailbox. Each command that takes an optional list of
messages (msglist) or an optional single message (message)
on which <br>
to operate shall leave the current message set to the
highest-numbered message of the messages specified, unless
the command deletes messages, in which case the current
message <br>
shall be set to the first undeleted message (that is, a
message not in the deleted state) after the highest-numbered
message deleted by the command, if one exists, or the first
<br>
undeleted message before the highest-numbered message
deleted by the command, if one exists, or to an unspecified
value if there are no remaining undeleted messages. All
messages <br>
shall be in one of the following states:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new The message is present in
the system mailbox and has not been viewed by the user or
moved to any other state. Messages in state new when mailx
quits shall be retained in <br>
the system mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unread The message has been
present in the system mailbox for more than one invocation
of mailx and has not been viewed by the user or moved to any
other state. Messages in state <br>
unread when mailx quits shall be retained in the system
mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read The message has been
processed by one of the following commands: ~f, ~m, ~F, ~M,
copy, mbox, next, pipe, print, Print, top, type, Type,
undelete. The delete, dp, and dt <br>
commands may also cause the next message to be marked as
read, depending on the value of the autoprint variable.
Messages that are in the system mailbox and in state read
<br>
when mailx quits shall be saved in the mbox, unless the
internal variable hold was set. Messages that are in the
mbox or in a secondary mailbox and in state read when <br>
mailx quits shall be retained in their current location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deleted <br>
The message has been processed by one of the following
commands: delete, dp, dt. Messages in state deleted when
mailx quits shall be deleted. Deleted messages shall be <br>
ignored until mailx quits or changes mailboxes or they are
specified to the undelete command; for example, the message
specification / string shall only search the subject <br>
lines of messages that have not yet been deleted, unless the
command operating on the list of messages is undelete. No
deleted message or deleted message header shall be <br>
displayed by any mailx command other than undelete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preserved <br>
The message has been processed by a preserve command. When
mailx quits, the message shall be retained in its current
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saved The message has been
processed by one of the following commands: save or write.
If the current mailbox is the system mailbox, and the
internal variable keepsave is set, <br>
messages in the state saved shall be saved to the file
designated by the MBOX variable (see the ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES section). If the current mailbox is the system
mail&acirc; <br>
box, messages in the state saved shall be deleted from the
current mailbox, when the quit or file command is used to
exit the current mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header-summary line for each
message shall indicate the state of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many commands take an optional
list of messages ( msglist) on which to operate, which
defaults to the current message. A msglist is a list of
message specifications separated by <br>
&lt;blank&gt;s, which can include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Message number n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ The next undeleted message, or
the next deleted message for the undelete command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The next previous undeleted
message, or the next previous deleted message for the
undelete command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. The current message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ The first undeleted message,
or the first deleted message for the undelete command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ The last message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* All messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n-m An inclusive range of
message numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address <br>
All messages from address; any address as shown in a header
summary shall be matchable in this form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/string <br>
All messages with string in the subject line (case
ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:c All messages of type c, where
c shall be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d <br>
Deleted messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n <br>
New messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o <br>
Old messages (any not in state read or new).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r <br>
Read messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u <br>
Unread messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other commands take an optional
message ( message) on which to operate, which defaults to
the current message. All of the forms allowed for msglist
are also allowed for message, <br>
but if more than one message is specified, only the first
shall be operated on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other arguments are usually
arbitrary strings whose usage depends on the command
involved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start-Up in mailx <br>
At start-up time, mailx shall take the following steps in
sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Establish all variables at
their stated default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Process command line options,
overriding corresponding default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Import any of the DEAD,
EDITOR, MBOX, LISTER , PAGER, SHELL, or VISUAL variables
that are present in the environment, overriding the
corresponding default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Read mailx commands from an
unspecified system start-up file, unless the -n option is
given, to initialize any internal mailx variables and
aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Process the start-up file of
mailx commands named in the user MAILRC variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most regular mailx commands are
valid inside start-up files, the most common use being to
set up initial display options and alias lists. The
following commands shall be invalid <br>
in the start-up file: !, edit, hold, mail, preserve, reply,
Reply, shell, visual, Copy, followup, and Followup. Any
errors in the start-up file shall either cause mailx to
termi&acirc; <br>
nate with a diagnostic message and a non-zero status or to
continue after writing a diagnostic message, ignoring the
remainder of the lines in the start-up file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A blank line in a start-up file
shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Variables in mailx <br>
The following variables are internal mailx variables. Each
internal variable can be set via the mailx set command at
any time. The unset and set no name commands can be used to
<br>

mailx concerning filenames and quoting shall also apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defaults specified here may
be changed by the implementation-defined system start-up
file unless the user specifies the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allnet All network names whose
login name components match shall be treated as identical.
This shall cause the msglist message specifications to

save command when saving to mbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ask, asksub <br>
Prompt for a subject line on outgoing mail if one is not
specified on the command line with the -s option. The ask
and asksub forms are synonyms; the system shall refer to
<br>
asksub and noasksub in its messages, but shall accept ask
and noask as user input to mean asksub and noasksub. It
shall not be possible to set both ask and noasksub, or <br>

filename with this directory <br>
name to obtain the real pathname. If directory does not
start with a slash ( &rsquo;/&rsquo; ), the contents of HOME
shall be prefixed to it. The default shall be nofolder. If
folder <br>
is unset or set to null, user-specified filenames beginning
with &rsquo;+&rsquo; shall refer to files in the current
directory that begin with the literal &rsquo;+&rsquo;
character. See also out&acirc; <br>
folder below. The folder value need not affect the
processing of the files named in MBOX and DEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">header Enable writing of the

default shall be header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hold Preserve all messages that

the login name of the user from the recipient list when
replying to a message or sending to a group. The default
shall be nometoo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onehop When responding to a
message that was originally sent to several recipients, the
other recipient addresses are normally forced to be relative
to the originating author&rsquo;s <br>
machine for the response. This flag disables alteration of
the recipients&rsquo; addresses, improving efficiency in a
network where all machines can send directly to all other
<br>
machines (that is, one hop away). The default shall be
noonehop.</p>

screen is not specified, a value based on the terminal type
identified by the TERM <br>
environment variable, the window size, the baud rate, or
some combination of these shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendwait <br>
Wait for the background mailer to finish before returning.
The default shall be nosendwait.</p>

between paired double-quotes ( &quot;&quot; ) or
single-quotes ( &rsquo;&rsquo; ); any white space, shell

enclosing quotes shall be discarded and the following
character treated literally as part of the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the following exit
values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion; note
that this status implies that all messages were sent, but it
gives no assurances that any of them were actually
delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
When in input mode (Receive Mode) or Send Mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If an error is encountered
processing a command escape (see Command Escapes in mailx ),
a diagnostic message shall be written to standard error, and
the message being composed <br>
may be modified, but this condition shall not prevent the
message from being sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Other errors shall prevent the
sending of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in command mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Delivery of messages to remote systems requires the
existence of communication paths to such systems. These need
not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input lines are limited to
{LINE_MAX} bytes, but mailers between systems may impose
more severe line-length restrictions. This volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does not place any <br>
restrictions on the length of messages handled by mailx, and
for delivery of local messages the only limitations should
be the normal problems of available disk space for the <br>
target mail file. When sending messages to external
machines, applications are advised to limit messages to less
than 100000 bytes because some mail gateways impose message-
<br>
length restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the system mailbox
is intentionally unspecified. Not all systems implement
system mailboxes as flat files, particularly with the advent
of multimedia mail messages. <br>
Some system mailboxes may be multiple files, others records
in a database. The internal format of the messages
themselves is specified with the historical format from
Version 7, <br>
but only after the messages have been saved in some file
other than the system mailbox. This was done so that many
historical applications expecting text-file mailboxes are
not <br>
broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some new formats for messages
can be expected in the future, probably including binary
data, bit maps, and various multimedia objects. As described
here, mailx is not prohibited <br>
from handling such messages, but it must store them as text
files in secondary mailboxes (unless some extension, such as
a variable or command line option, is used to change the
<br>
stored format). Its method of doing so is
implementation-defined and might include translating the
data into text file-compatible or readable form or omitting
certain portions of <br>
the message from the stored output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The discard and ignore commands
are not inverses of the retain command. The retain command
discards all header-fields except those explicitly retained.
The discard command keeps <br>
all header-fields except those explicitly discarded. If
headers exist on the retained header list, discard and
ignore commands are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The standard developers felt strongly that a method for
applications to send messages to specific users was
necessary. The obvious example is a batch utility, running
non-inter&acirc; <br>
actively, that wishes to communicate errors or results to a
user. However, the actual format, delivery mechanism, and
method of reading the message are clearly beyond the scope
<br>
of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intent of this command is to
provide a simple, portable interface for sending messages
non-interactively. It merely defines a &quot;front-end&quot;
to the historical mail system. It is <br>
suggested that implementations explicitly denote the sender
and recipient in the body of the delivered message. Further
specification of formats for either the message envelope
<br>
or the message itself were deliberately not made, as the
industry is in the midst of changing from the current
standards to a more internationalized standard and it is
probably <br>
incorrect, at this time, to require either one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations are encouraged
to conform to the various delivery mechanisms described in
the CCITT X.400 standards or to the equivalent Internet
standards, described in Internet <br>
Request for Comment (RFC) documents RFC 819, RFC 822, RFC
920, RFC 921, and RFC 1123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many historical systems modified
each body line that started with From by prefixing the
&rsquo;F&rsquo; with &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; . It is unnecessary,
but allowed, to do that when the string does not follow <br>
a blank line because it cannot be confused with the next
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The edit and visual commands
merely edit the specified messages in a temporary file. They
do not modify the contents of those messages in the mailbox;
such a capability could be <br>
added as an extension, such as by using different command
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restriction on a subject
line being {LINE_MAX}-10 bytes is based on the historical
format that consumes 10 bytes for Subject: and the trailing
&lt;newline&gt;. Many historical <br>
mailers that a message may encounter on other systems are
not able to handle lines that long, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the utilities logger and
lp, mailx admittedly is difficult to test. This was not
deemed sufficient justification to exclude this utility from
this volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. It is also arguable that it is, in
fact, testable, but that the tests themselves are not
portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When mailx is being used by an
application that wishes to receive the results as if none of
the User Portability Utilities option features were
supported, the DEAD environment <br>
variable must be set to /dev/null. Otherwise, it may be
subject to the file creations described in mailx
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS. Similarly, if the MAILRC environment
variable is not <br>
set to /dev/null, historical versions of mailx and Mail read
initialization commands from a file before processing
begins. Since the initialization that a user specifies could
<br>
alter the contents of messages an application is trying to
send, such applications must set MAILRC to /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description of LC_TIME uses
&quot;may affect&quot; because many historical
implementations do not or cannot manipulate the date and
time strings in the incoming mail headers. Some <br>
headers found in incoming mail do not have enough
information to determine the timezone in which the mail
originated, and, therefore, mailx cannot convert the date
and time <br>
strings into the internal form that then is parsed by
routines like strftime() that can take LC_TIME settings into
account. Changing all these times to a user-specified format
is <br>
allowed, but not required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The paginator selected when
PAGER is null or unset is partially unspecified to allow the
System V historical practice of using pg as the default.
Bypassing the pagination func&acirc; <br>
tion, such as by declaring that cat is the paginator, would
not meet with the intended meaning of this description.
However, any &quot;portable user&quot; would have to set
PAGER explic&acirc; <br>
itly to get his or her preferred paginator on all systems.
The paginator choice was made partially unspecified, unlike
the VISUAL editor choice (mandated to be vi) because most
<br>
historical pagers follow a common theme of user input,
whereas editors differ dramatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to specify addresses as
cc (carbon copy) or bcc (blind carbon copy) were considered
to be format details and were omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A zero exit status implies that
all messages were sent, but it gives no assurances that any
of them were actually delivered. The reliability of the
delivery mechanism is unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied and is an appropriate marketing distinction between
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to conform to the
Utility Syntax Guidelines, a solution was required to the
optional file option-argument to -f. By making file an
operand, the guidelines are satisfied <br>
and users remain portable. However, it does force
implementations to support usage such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailx -fin mymail.box</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The no name method of unsetting
variables is not present in all historical systems, but it
is in System V and provides a logical set of commands
corresponding to the format of <br>
the display of options from the mailx set command without
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ask and asksub variables are
the names selected by BSD and System V, respectively, for
the same feature. They are synonyms in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mailx echo command was not
documented in the BSD version and has been omitted here
because it is not obviously useful for interactive
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default prompt on the System
V mailx is a question mark, on BSD Mail an ampersand. Since
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 chose the mailx name, it
kept the System V <br>
default, assuming that BSD users would not have difficulty
with this minor incompatibility (that they can
override).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meanings of r and R are
reversed between System V mailx and SunOS Mail. Once again,
since this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 chose the mailx
name, it kept the System V <br>
default, but allows the SunOS user to achieve the desired
results using flipr, an internal variable in System V mailx,
although it has not been documented in the SVID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The indentprefix variable, the
retain and unalias commands, and the ~F and ~M command
escapes were adopted from 4.3 BSD Mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version command was not
included because no sufficiently general specification of
the version information could be devised that would still be
useful to a portable user. This <br>
command name should be used by suppliers who wish to provide
version information about the mailx command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;implementation-specific (unspecified) system start-up
file&quot; historically has been named /etc/mailx.rc, but
this specific name and location are not required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intent of the wording for
the next command is that if any command has already
displayed the current message it should display a following
message, but, otherwise, it should <br>
display the current message. Consider the command
sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next 3 <br>
delete 3 <br>
next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the autoprint option was
not set. The normative text specifies that the second next
command should display a message following the third
message, because even though the <br>
current message has not been displayed since it was set by
the delete command, it has been displayed since the current
message was anything other than message number 3. This does
<br>
not always match historical practice in some
implementations, where the command file address followed by
next (or the default command) would skip the message for
which the user <br>
had searched.</p>
