<p>RM(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual RM(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rm - remove directory entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rm [-fiRr] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The rm utility shall remove the directory entry specified by
each file argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either of the files dot or
dot-dot are specified as the basename portion of an operand
(that is, the final pathname component), rm shall write a
diagnostic message to standard <br>
error and do nothing more with such operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file the following
steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the file does not
exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If the -f option is not
specified, rm shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. Go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If file is of type directory,
the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If neither the -R option nor
the -r option is specified, rm shall write a diagnostic
message to standard error, do nothing more with file, and go
on to any remaining <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If the -f option is not
specified, and either the permissions of file do not permit
writing and the standard input is a terminal or the -i
option is specified, rm shall <br>
write a prompt to standard error and read a line from the
standard input. If the response is not affirmative, rm shall
do nothing more with the current file and go on to <br>
any remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. For each entry contained in
file, other than dot or dot-dot, the four steps listed here
(1 to 4) shall be taken with the entry as if it were a file
operand. The rm util&acirc; <br>
ity shall not traverse directories by following symbolic
links into other parts of the hierarchy, but shall remove
the links themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. If the -i option is
specified, rm shall write a prompt to standard error and
read a line from the standard input. If the response is not
affirmative, rm shall do nothing <br>
more with the current file, and go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If file is not of type
directory, the -f option is not specified, and either the
permissions of file do not permit writing and the standard
input is a terminal or the -i <br>
option is specified, rm shall write a prompt to the standard
error and read a line from the standard input. If the
response is not affirmative, rm shall do nothing more with
<br>
the current file and go on to any remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the current file is a
directory, rm shall perform actions equivalent to the
rmdir() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 called with a <br>
pathname of the current file used as the path argument. If
the current file is not a directory, rm shall perform
actions equivalent to the unlink() function defined in the
<br>
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 called with
a pathname of the current file used as the path
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this fails for any reason, rm
shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
nothing more with the current file, and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rm utility shall be able to
descend to arbitrary depths in a file hierarchy, and shall
not fail due to path length limitations (unless an operand
specified by the user <br>
exceeds system limitations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The rm utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not prompt for
confirmation. Do not write diagnostic messages or modify the
exit status in the case of nonexistent operands. Any
previous occurrences of the -i option <br>
shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Prompt for confirmation as
described previously. Any previous occurrences of the -f
option shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Remove file hierarchies. See
the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Equivalent to -R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a directory
entry to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used to read an input line in
response to each prompt specified in the STDOUT section.
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of rm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for the
behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
collating elements used in the extended regular expression
defined for the <br>
yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments) <br>
and the behavior of character classes within regular
expressions used in the extended regular expression defined
for the yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES
cate&acirc; <br>
gory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative
responses that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
Prompts shall be written to standard error under the
conditions specified in the DESCRIPTION and OPTIONS
sections. The prompts shall contain the file pathname, but
their format <br>
is otherwise unspecified. The standard error also shall be
used for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All of the named directory
entries for which rm performed actions equivalent to the
rmdir() or unlink() functions were removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The rm utility is forbidden to remove the names dot and
dot-dot in order to avoid the consequences of inadvertently
doing something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm -r .*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some implementations do not
permit the removal of the last link to an executable binary
file that is being executed; see the [EBUSY] error in the
unlink() function defined in the <br>
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Thus, the
rm utility can fail to remove such files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option causes rm to
prompt and read the standard input even if the standard
input is not a terminal, but in the absence of -i the mode
prompting is not done when the stan&acirc; <br>
dard input is not a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm a.out core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes the directory entries:
a.out and core.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm -Rf junk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes the directory junk and
all its contents, without prompting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
For absolute clarity, paragraphs (2b) and (3) in the
DESCRIPTION of rm describing the behavior when prompting for
confirmation, should be interpreted in the following
manner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ((NOT f_option) AND <br>
((not_writable AND input_is_terminal) OR i_option))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact format of the
interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature
of the contents of prompts are specified because
implementations may desire more descriptive <br>
prompts than those used on historical implementations.
Therefore, an application not using the -f option, or using
the -i option, relies on the system to provide the most
suit&acirc; <br>
able dialog directly with the user, based on the behavior
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option is historical
practice on all known systems. The synonym -R option is
provided for consistency with the other utilities in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 that <br>
provide options requesting recursive descent through the
file hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior of the -f option in
historical versions of rm is inconsistent. In general, along
with &quot;forcing&quot; the unlink without prompting for
permission, it always causes diag&acirc; <br>
nostic messages to be suppressed and the exit status to be
unmodified for nonexistent operands and files that cannot be
unlinked. In some versions, however, the -f option
sup&acirc; <br>
presses usage messages and system errors as well.
Suppressing such messages is not a service to either shell
scripts or users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is less clear that error
messages regarding files that cannot be unlinked (removed)
should be suppressed. Although this is historical practice,
this volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not permit the -f option to
suppress such messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When given the -r and -i
options, historical versions of rm prompt the user twice for
each directory, once before removing its contents and once
before actually attempting to <br>
delete the directory entry that names it. This allows the
user to &quot;prune&quot; the file hierarchy walk.
Historical versions of rm were inconsistent in that some did
not do the former <br>
prompt for directories named on the command line and others
had obscure prompting behavior when the -i option was
specified and the permissions of the file did not permit
writ&acirc; <br>
ing. The POSIX Shell and Utilities rm differs little from
historic practice, but does require that prompts be
consistent. Historical versions of rm were also inconsistent
in that <br>
prompts were done to both standard output and standard
error. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that
prompts be done to standard error, for consistency with cp
and mv, <br>
and to allow historical extensions to rm that provide an
option to list deleted files on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rm utility is required to
descend to arbitrary depths so that any file hierarchy may
be deleted. This means, for example, that the rm utility
cannot run out of file descrip&acirc; <br>
tors during its descent (that is, if the number of file
descriptors is limited, rm cannot be implemented in the
historical fashion where one file descriptor is used per
directory <br>
level). Also, rm is not permitted to fail because of path
length restrictions, unless an operand specified by the user
is longer than {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rm utility removes symbolic
links themselves, not the files they refer to, as a
consequence of the dependence on the unlink() functionality,
per the DESCRIPTION. When remov&acirc; <br>
ing hierarchies with -r or -R, the prohibition on following
symbolic links has to be made explicit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
