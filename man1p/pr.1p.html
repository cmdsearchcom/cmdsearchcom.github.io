<p>PR(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual PR(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pr - print files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pr [+page][-column][-adFmrt][-e[char][ gap]][-h
header][-i[char][gap]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-l lines][-n[char][width]][-o
offset][-s[char]][-w width][-fp] <br>
[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pr utility is a printing and pagination filter. If
multiple input files are specified, each shall be read,
formatted, and written to standard output. By default, the
input <br>
shall be separated into 66-line pages, each with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A 5-line header that includes
the page number, date, time, and the pathname of the
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A 5-line trailer consisting of
blank lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If standard output is associated
with a terminal, diagnostic messages shall be deferred until
the pr utility has completed processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When options specifying
multi-column output are specified, output text columns shall
be of equal width; input lines that do not fit into a text
column shall be truncated. By <br>
default, text columns shall be separated with at least one
&lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The pr utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that: the page option has a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; delimiter; <br>
page and column can be multi-digit numbers; some of the
option-arguments are optional; and some of the
option-arguments cannot be specified as separate arguments
from the preced&acirc; <br>
ing option letter. In particular, the -s option does not
allow the option letter to be separated from its argument,
and the options -e, -i, and -n require that both arguments,
if <br>
present, not be separated from the option letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported. In the following option descriptions, column,
lines, offset, page, and width are positive decimal
integers; gap is a non-negative deci&acirc; <br>
mal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+page Begin output at page
number page of the formatted input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-column <br>
Produce multi-column output that is arranged in column
columns (the default shall be 1) and is written down each
column in the order in which the text is received from the
<br>
input file. This option should not be used with -m. The
options -e and -i shall be assumed for multiple text-column
output. Whether or not text columns are produced with <br>
identical vertical lengths is unspecified, but a text column
shall never exceed the length of the page (see the -l
option). When used with -t, use the minimum number of <br>
lines to write the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Modify the effect of the -
column option so that the columns are filled across the page
in a round-robin order (for example, when column is 2, the
first input line heads <br>
column 1, the second heads column 2, the third is the second
line in column 1, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Produce output that is
double-spaced; append an extra &lt;newline&gt; following
every &lt;newline&gt; found in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e[char][gap]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expand each input &lt;tab&gt; to
the next greater column position specified by the formula n*
gap+1, where n is an integer &gt; 0. If gap is zero or is
omitted, it shall default to <br>
8. All &lt;tab&gt;s in the input shall be expanded into the
appropriate number of &lt;space&gt;s. If any non-digit
character, char, is specified, it shall be used as the input
&lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Use a &lt;form-feed&gt; for
new pages, instead of the default behavior that uses a
sequence of &lt;newline&gt;s. Pause before beginning the
first page if the standard output is asso&acirc; <br>
ciated with a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Use a &lt;form-feed&gt; for
new pages, instead of the default behavior that uses a
sequence of &lt;newline&gt;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h header <br>
Use the string header to replace the contents of the file
operand in the page header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i[char][gap] <br>
In output, replace multiple &lt;space&gt;s with &lt;tab&gt;s
wherever two or more adjacent &lt;space&gt;s reach column
positions gap+1, 2* gap+1, 3* gap+1, and so on. If gap is
zero or is <br>
omitted, default tab settings at every eighth column
position shall be assumed. If any non-digit character, char,
is specified, it shall be used as the output
&lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l lines <br>
Override the 66-line default and reset the page length to
lines. If lines is not greater than the sum of both the
header and trailer depths (in lines), the pr utility <br>
shall suppress both the header and trailer, as if the -t
option were in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Merge files. Standard output
shall be formatted so the pr utility writes one line from
each file specified by a file operand, side by side into
text columns of equal fixed <br>
widths, in terms of the number of column positions.
Implementations shall support merging of at least nine file
operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[char][width]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provide width-digit line
numbering (default for width shall be 5). The number shall
occupy the first width column positions of each text column
of default output or each <br>
line of -m output. If char (any non-digit character) is
given, it shall be appended to the line number to separate
it from whatever follows (default for char is a
&lt;tab&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o offset <br>
Each line of output shall be preceded by offset
&lt;space&gt;s. If the -o option is not specified, the
default offset shall be zero. The space taken is in addition
to the output <br>
line width (see the -w option below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Pause before beginning each
page if the standard output is directed to a terminal ( pr
shall write an &lt;alert&gt; to standard error and wait for
a &lt;carriage-return&gt; to be read <br>
on /dev/tty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Write no diagnostic reports
on failure to open files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s[char] <br>
Separate text columns by the single character char instead
of by the appropriate number of &lt;space&gt;s (default for
char shall be &lt;tab&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Write neither the five-line
identifying header nor the five-line trailer usually
supplied for each page. Quit writing after the last line of
each file without spacing to <br>
the end of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w width <br>
Set the width of the line to width column positions for
multiple text-column output only. If the -w option is not
specified and the -s option is not specified, the default
<br>
width shall be 72. If the -w option is not specified and the
-s option is specified, the default width shall be 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For single column output, input
lines shall not be truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
written. If no file operands are specified, or if a file
operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the standard input shall be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo; . See
the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file /dev/tty shall be used
to read responses required by the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of pr:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files) and which characters are defined as printable
(character class print). Non-printable characters are still
written to standard output, but are not counted for <br>
the purpose for column-width and line-length
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME <br>
Determine the format of the date and time for use in writing
header lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
to calculate date and time strings written in header lines.
If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
If pr receives an interrupt while writing to a terminal, it
shall flush all accumulated error messages to the screen
before terminating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The pr utility output shall be a paginated version of the
original file (or files). This pagination shall be
accomplished using either &lt;form-feed&gt;s or a sequence
of &lt;newline&gt;s, <br>
as controlled by the -F or -f option. Page headers shall be
generated unless the -t option is specified. The page
headers shall be of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;0s %s Page %d0, &lt;output
of date&gt;, &lt;file&gt;, &lt;page number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the POSIX locale, the
&lt;output of date&gt; field, representing the date and time
of last modification of the input file (or the current date
and time if the input file is standard <br>
input), shall be equivalent to the output of the following
command as it would appear if executed at the given
time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &quot;+%b %e %H:%M
%Y&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">without the trailing
&lt;newline&gt;, if the page being written is from standard
input. If the page being written is not from standard input,
in the POSIX locale, the same format shall <br>
be used, but the time used shall be the modification time of
the file corresponding to file instead of the current time.
When the LC_TIME locale category is not set to the POSIX
<br>
locale, a different format and order of presentation of this
field may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the standard input is used
instead of a file operand, the &lt;file&gt; field shall be
replaced by a null string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -h option is specified,
the &lt;file&gt; field shall be replaced by the header
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and
for alerting the terminal when -p is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Print a numbered list of all files in the current
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls -a | pr -n -h &quot;Files in
$(pwd).&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Print file1 and file2 as a
double-spaced, three-column listing headed by &quot;file
list&rsquo;&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pr -3d -h &quot;file list&quot;
file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Write file1 on file2,
expanding tabs to columns 10, 19, 28, ...:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pr -e9 -t &lt;file1
&gt;file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
This utility is one of those that does not follow the
Utility Syntax Guidelines because of its historical origins.
The standard developers could have added new options that
<br>
obeyed the guidelines (and marked the old options
obsolescent) or devised an entirely new utility; there are
examples of both actions in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. <br>
Because of its widespread use by historical applications,
the standard developers decided to exempt this version of pr
from many of the guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations are required to
accept option-arguments to the -h, -l, -o, and -w options
whether presented as part of the same argument or as a
separate argument to pr, as sug&acirc; <br>
gested by the Utility Syntax Guidelines. The -n and -s
options, however, are specified as in historical practice
because they are frequently specified without their optional
<br>
arguments. If a &lt;blank&gt; were allowed before the
option-argument in these cases, a file operand could
mistakenly be interpreted as an option-argument in
historical applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text about the minimum
number of lines in multi-column output was included to
ensure that a best effort is made in balancing the length of
the columns. There are known his&acirc; <br>
torical implementations in which, for example, 60-line files
are listed by pr -2 as one column of 56 lines and a second
of 4. Although this is not a problem when a full page with
<br>
headers and trailers is produced, it would be relatively
useless when used with -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations of
the pr utility have differed in the action taken for the -f
option. BSD uses it as described here for the -F option;
System V uses it to change <br>
trailing &lt;newline&gt;s on each page to a
&lt;form-feed&gt; and, if standard output is a TTY device,
sends an &lt;alert&gt; to standard error and reads a line
from /dev/tty before the first <br>
page. There were strong arguments from both sides of this
issue concerning historical practice and as a result the -F
option was added. XSI-conformant systems support the System
<br>
V historical actions for the -f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;output of date&gt; field
in the -l format is specified only for the POSIX locale. As
noted, the format can be different in other locales. No
mechanism for defining this is <br>
present in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, as the
appropriate vehicle is a message catalog; that is, the
format should be specified as a &quot;message&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
