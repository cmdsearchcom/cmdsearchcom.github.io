<p>LS(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual LS(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ls - list directory contents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ls [-CFRacdilqrtu1][-H | -L ][-fgmnopsx][file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For each operand that names a file of a type other than
directory or symbolic link to a directory, ls shall write
the name of the file as well as any requested, associated
infor&acirc; <br>
mation. For each operand that names a file of type
directory, ls shall write the names of files contained
within the directory as well as any requested, associated
information. <br>
If one of the -d, -F, or -l options are specified, and one
of the -H or -L options are not specified, for each operand
that names a file of type symbolic link to a directory, ls
<br>
shall write the name of the file as well as any requested,
associated information. If none of the -d, -F, or -l options
are specified, or the -H or -L options are specified, for
<br>
each operand that names a file of type symbolic link to a
directory, ls shall write the names of files contained
within the directory as well as any requested, associated
infor&acirc; <br>
mation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no operands are specified, ls
shall write the contents of the current directory. If more
than one operand is specified, ls shall write non-directory
operands first; it shall <br>
sort directory and non-directory operands separately
according to the collating sequence in the current
locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ls utility shall detect
infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited
directory that is an ancestor of the last file encountered.
When it detects an infinite loop, <br>
ls shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and
shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ls utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Write multi-text-column
output with entries sorted down the columns, according to
the collating sequence. The number of text columns and the
column separator characters <br>
are unspecified, but should be adapted to the nature of the
output device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Do not follow symbolic links
named as operands unless the -H or -L options are specified.
Write a slash ( &rsquo;/&rsquo; ) immediately after each
pathname that is a directory, an <br>
asterisk ( &rsquo;*&rsquo; ) after each that is executable,
a vertical bar ( &rsquo;|&rsquo; ) after each that is a
FIFO, and an at sign ( &rsquo;@&rsquo; ) after each that is
a symbolic link. For other file <br>
types, other symbols may be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H If a symbolic link
referencing a file of type directory is specified on the
command line, ls shall evaluate the file information and
file type to be those of the file ref&acirc; <br>
erenced by the link, and not the link itself; however, ls
shall write the name of the link itself and not the file
referenced by the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Evaluate the file information
and file type for all symbolic links (whether named on the
command line or encountered in a file hierarchy) to be those
of the file refer&acirc; <br>
enced by the link, and not the link itself; however, ls
shall write the name of the link itself and not the file
referenced by the link. When -L is used with -l, write the
<br>
contents of symbolic links in the long format (see the
STDOUT section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Recursively list
subdirectories encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Write out all directory
entries, including those whose names begin with a period (
&rsquo;.&rsquo; ). Entries beginning with a period shall not
be written out unless explicitly refer&acirc; <br>
enced, the -a option is supplied, or an
implementation-defined condition shall cause them to be
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Use time of last modification
of the file status information (see &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; in
the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001)
instead of last modification of the <br>
file itself for sorting ( -t) or writing ( -l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not follow symbolic links
named as operands unless the -H or -L options are specified.
Do not treat directories differently than other types of
files. The use of -d <br>
with -R produces unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force each argument to be
interpreted as a directory and list the name found in each
slot. This option shall turn off -l, -t, -s, and -r, and
shall turn on -a; the order <br>
is the order in which entries appear in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g The same as -l, except that
the owner shall not be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i For each file, write the
file&rsquo;s file serial number (see stat() in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (The letter ell.) Do not
follow symbolic links named as operands unless the -H or -L
options are specified. Write out in long format (see the
STDOUT section). When -l <br>
(ell) is specified, -1 (one) shall be assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Stream output format; list
files across the page, separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The same as -l, except that
the owner&rsquo;s UID and GID numbers shall be written,
rather than the associated character strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o The same as -l, except that
the group shall not be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Write a slash (
&rsquo;/&rsquo; ) after each filename if that file is a
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Force each instance of
non-printable filename characters and &lt;tab&gt;s to be
written as the question-mark ( &rsquo;?&rsquo; ) character.
Implementations may provide this option by <br>
default if the output is to a terminal device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Reverse the order of the sort
to get reverse collating sequence or oldest first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Indicate the total number of
file system blocks consumed by each file displayed. The
block size is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Sort with the primary key
being time modified (most recently modified first) and the
secondary key being filename in the collating sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Use time of last access (see
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;) instead of last modification of the file
for sorting ( -t) or writing ( -l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The same as -C, except that
the multi-text-column output is produced with entries sorted
across, rather than down, the columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 (The numeric digit one.)
Force output to be one entry per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
options in the following mutually-exclusive pairs shall not
be considered an error: -C and -l (ell), -m and -l (ell), -x
and -l (ell), -C and <br>
-1 (one), -H and -L, -c and -u. The last option specified in
each pair shall determine the output format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
written. If the file specified is not found, a diagnostic
message shall be output on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
Determine the user&rsquo;s preferred column position width
for writing multiple text-column output. If this variable
contains a string representing a decimal integer, the ls
<br>
utility shall calculate how many pathname text columns to
write (see -C) based on the width provided. If COLUMNS is
not set or invalid, an implementation-defined number of <br>
column positions shall be assumed, based on the
implementation&rsquo;s knowledge of the output device. The
column width chosen to write the names of files in any given
directory <br>
shall be constant. Filenames shall not be truncated to fit
into the multiple text-column output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for
character collation information in determining the pathname
collation sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments) <br>
and which characters are defined as printable (character
class print).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME <br>
Determine the format and contents for date and time strings
written by ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone for
date and time strings written by ls. If TZ is unset or null,
an unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The default format shall be to list one entry per line to
standard output; the exceptions are to terminals or when one
of the -C, -m, or -x options is specified. If the output
<br>
is to a terminal, the format is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -m is specified, the format
used shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s, %s, ...0,
&lt;filename1&gt;, &lt;filename2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the largest number of
filenames shall be written without exceeding the length of
the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -i option is specified,
the file&rsquo;s file serial number (see &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;)
shall be written in the following format before any other
output for the corresponding entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u &quot;, &lt;file serial
number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -l option is specified
without -L, the following information shall be written:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s %u %s %s %u %s %s0,
&lt;file mode&gt;, &lt;number of links&gt;, <br>
&lt;owner name&gt;, &lt;group name&gt;, &lt;number of bytes
in the file&gt;, <br>
&lt;date and time&gt;, &lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file is a symbolic link,
this information shall be about the link itself and the
&lt;pathname&gt; field shall be of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s -&gt; %s&quot;,
&lt;pathname of link&gt;, &lt;contents of link&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both -l and -L are specified,
the following information shall be written:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s %u %s %s %u %s %s0,
&lt;file mode&gt;, &lt;number of links&gt;, <br>
&lt;owner name&gt;, &lt;group name&gt;, &lt;number of bytes
in the file&gt;, <br>
&lt;date and time&gt;, &lt;pathname of link&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where all fields except
&lt;pathname of link&gt; shall be for the file resolved from
the symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -g, -n, and -o options use
the same format as -l, but with omitted items and their
associated &lt;blank&gt;s. See the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both the preceding -l forms,
if &lt;owner name&gt; or &lt;group name&gt; cannot be
determined, or if -n is given, they shall be replaced with
their associated numeric values using the <br>
format %u .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;date and time&gt; field
shall contain the appropriate date and timestamp of when the
file was last modified. In the POSIX locale, the field shall
be the equivalent of the out&acirc; <br>
put of the following date command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &quot;+%b %e
%H:%M&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the file has been modified in
the last six months, or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &quot;+%b %e %Y&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(where two &lt;space&gt;s are
used between %e and %Y ) if the file has not been modified
in the last six months or if the modification date is in the
future, except that, in both <br>
cases, the final &lt;newline&gt; produced by date shall not
be included and the output shall be as if the date command
were executed at the time of the last modification date of
the <br>
file rather than the current time. When the LC_TIME locale
category is not set to the POSIX locale, a different format
and order of presentation of this field may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file is a character
special or block special file, the size of the file may be
replaced with implementation-defined information associated
with the device in question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pathname was specified as
a file operand, it shall be written as specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file mode written under the
-l, -g, -n, and -o options shall consist of the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%c%s%s%s%c&quot;,
&lt;entry type&gt;, &lt;owner permissions&gt;, <br>
&lt;group permissions&gt;, &lt;other permissions&gt;, <br>
&lt;optional alternate access method flag&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;optional alternate
access method flag&gt; shall be a single &lt;space&gt; if
there is no alternate or additional access control method
associated with the file; otherwise, a print&acirc; <br>
able character shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;entry type&gt; character
shall describe the type of file, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Block special file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Character special file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l (ell) <br>
Symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p FIFO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations may add other
characters to this list to represent other
implementation-defined file types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next three fields shall be
three characters each:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;owner permissions&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions for the file owner
class (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 4.4, File Access Permissions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;group permissions&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions for the file group
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;other permissions&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions for the file other
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each field shall have three
character positions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If &rsquo;r&rsquo;, the file
is readable; if &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the file is not
readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If &rsquo;w&rsquo;, the file
is writable; if &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the file is not
writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The first of the following
that applies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S <br>
If in &lt;owner permissions&gt;, the file is not executable
and set-user-ID mode is set. If in &lt;group
permissions&gt;, the file is not executable and set-group-ID
mode is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s <br>
If in &lt;owner permissions&gt;, the file is executable and
set-user-ID mode is set. If in &lt;group permissions&gt;,
the file is executable and set-group-ID mode is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T <br>
If in &lt;other permissions&gt; and the file is a directory,
search permission is not granted to others, and the
restricted deletion flag is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t <br>
If in &lt;other permissions&gt; and the file is a directory,
search permission is granted to others, and the restricted
deletion flag is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x <br>
The file is executable or the directory is searchable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- <br>
None of the attributes of &rsquo;S&rsquo;, &rsquo;s&rsquo;,
&rsquo;T&rsquo;, &rsquo;t&rsquo;, or &rsquo;x&rsquo;
applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations may add other
characters to this list for the third character position.
Such additions shall, however, be written in lowercase if
the file is executable or <br>
searchable, and in uppercase if it is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the -l, -g, -n, -o, or
-s options is specified, each list of files within the
directory shall be preceded by a status line indicating the
number of file system blocks <br>
occupied by files in the directory in 512-byte units,
rounded up to the next integral number of units, if
necessary. In the POSIX locale, the format shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;total %u0, &lt;number of
units in the directory&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one directory, or a
combination of non-directory files and directories are
written, either as a result of specifying multiple operands,
or the -R option, each list <br>
of files within a directory shall be preceded by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1s:0, &lt;directory
name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this string is the first
thing to be written, the first &lt;newline&gt; shall not be
written. This output shall precede the number of units in
the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s option is given, each
file shall be written with the number of blocks used by the
file. Along with -C, -1, -m, or -x, the number and a
&lt;space&gt; shall precede the file&acirc; <br>
name; with -g, -l, -n, or -o, they shall precede each line
describing a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Many implementations use the equal sign ( &rsquo;=&rsquo; )
to denote sockets bound to the file system for the -F
option. Similarly, many historical implementations use the
&rsquo;s&rsquo; character to <br>
denote sockets as the entry type characters for the -l
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is difficult for an
application to use every part of the file modes field of ls
-l in a portable manner. Certain file types and executable
bits are not guaranteed to be <br>
exactly as shown, as implementations may have extensions.
Applications can use this field to pass directly to a user
printout or prompt, but actions based on its contents should
<br>
generally be deferred, instead, to the test utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of ls (with the -l
and related options) contains information that logically
could be used by utilities such as chmod and touch to
restore files to a known state. How&acirc; <br>
ever, this information is presented in a format that cannot
be used directly by those utilities or be easily translated
into a format that can be used. A character has been added
<br>
to the end of the permissions string so that applications at
least have an indication that they may be working in an area
they do not understand instead of assuming that they can
<br>
translate the permissions string into something that can be
used. Future issues or related documents may define one or
more specific characters to be used based on different <br>
standard additional or alternative access control
mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with many of the utilities
that deal with filenames, the output of ls for multiple
files or in one of the long listing formats must be used
carefully on systems where file&acirc; <br>
names can contain embedded white space. Systems and system
administrators should institute policies and user training
to limit the use of such filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of disk blocks
occupied by the file that it reports varies depending on
underlying file system type, block size units reported, and
the method of calculating the num&acirc; <br>
ber of blocks. On some file system types, the number is the
actual number of blocks occupied by the file (counting
indirect blocks and ignoring holes in the file); on others
it <br>
is calculated based on the file size (usually making an
allowance for indirect blocks, but ignoring holes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
An example of a small directory tree being fully listed with
ls -laRF a in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">total 11 <br>
drwxr-xr-x 3 hlj prog 64 Jul 4 12:07 ./ <br>
drwxrwxrwx 4 hlj prog 3264 Jul 4 12:09 ../ <br>
drwxr-xr-x 2 hlj prog 48 Jul 4 12:07 b/ <br>
-rwxr--r-- 1 hlj prog 572 Jul 4 12:07 foo*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a/b: <br>
total 4 <br>
drwxr-xr-x 2 hlj prog 48 Jul 4 12:07 ./ <br>
drwxr-xr-x 3 hlj prog 64 Jul 4 12:07 ../ <br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 hlj prog 700 Jul 4 12:07 bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Some historical implementations of the ls utility show all
entries in a directory except dot and dot-dot when a
superuser invokes ls without specifying the -a option. When
&quot;nor&acirc; <br>
mal&quot; users invoke ls without specifying -a, they should
not see information about any files with names beginning
with a period unless they were named as file operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations are expected to
traverse arbitrary depths when processing the -R option. The
only limitation on depth should be based on running out of
physical storage for keep&acirc; <br>
ing track of untraversed directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -1 (one) option was
historically found in BSD and BSD-derived implementations
only. It is required in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
so that conforming applications <br>
might ensure that output is one entry per line, even if the
output is to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generally, this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 is silent about what happens when options
are given multiple times. In the cases of -C, -l, and -1,
however, it does specify the <br>
results of these overlapping options. Since ls is one of the
most aliased commands, it is important that the
implementation perform intuitively. For example, if the
alias were:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias ls=&quot;ls -C&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the user typed ls -1,
single-text-column output should result, not an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BSD ls provides a -A option
(like -a, but dot and dot-dot are not written out). The
small difference from -a did not seem important enough to
require both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations may make -q the
default for terminals to prevent trojan horse attacks on
terminals with special escape sequences. This is not
required because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some control characters may be
useful on some terminals; for example, a system might write
them as &quot; 01&quot; or &quot;^A&quot; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Special behavior for terminals
is not relevant to applications portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal specified that
the optional alternate access method flag had to be
&rsquo;+&rsquo; if there was an alternate access method used
on the file or &lt;space&gt; if there was not. <br>
This was changed to be &lt;space&gt; if there is not and a
single printable character if there is. This was done for
three reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. There are historical
implementations using characters other than &rsquo;+&rsquo;
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. There are implementations
that vary this character used in that position to
distinguish between various alternate access methods in
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The standard developers did
not want to preclude future specifications that might need a
way to specify more than one alternate access method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nonetheless, implementations
providing a single alternate access method are encouraged to
use &rsquo;+&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an early proposal, the units
used to specify the number of blocks occupied by files in a
directory in an ls -l listing were implementation-defined.
This was because BSD sys&acirc; <br>
tems have historically used 1024-byte units and System V
systems have historically used 512-byte units. It was
pointed out by BSD developers that their system has used
512-byte <br>
units in some places and 1024-byte units in other places.
(System V has consistently used 512.) Therefore, this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 usually specifies 512. Future <br>
releases of BSD are expected to consistently provide 512
bytes as a default with a way of specifying 1024-byte units
where appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;date and time&gt; field
in the -l format is specified only for the POSIX locale. As
noted, the format can be different in other locales. No
mechanism for defining this is <br>
present in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, as the
appropriate vehicle is a messaging system; that is, the
format should be specified as a &quot;message&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
The -s uses implementation-defined units and cannot be used
portably; it may be withdrawn in a future version.</p>
