<p>NOHUP(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual NOHUP(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nohup - invoke a utility immune to hangups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nohup utility [argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The nohup utility shall invoke the utility named by the
utility operand with arguments supplied as the argument
operands. At the time the named utility is invoked, the
SIGHUP <br>
signal shall be set to be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the standard output is a
terminal, all output written by the named utility to its
standard output shall be appended to the end of the file
nohup.out in the current directory. <br>
If nohup.out cannot be created or opened for appending, the
output shall be appended to the end of the file nohup.out in
the directory specified by the HOME environment variable.
<br>
If neither file can be created or opened for appending,
utility shall not be invoked. If a file is created, the
file&rsquo;s permission bits shall be set to S_IRUSR |
S_IWUSR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the standard error is a
terminal, all output written by the named utility to its
standard error shall be redirected to the same file
descriptor as the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utility <br>
The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If the utility
operand names any of the special built-in utilities in
Special Built-In Utilities, the results are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
Any string to be supplied as an argument when invoking the
utility named by the utility operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of nohup:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Determine the pathname of
the user&rsquo;s home directory: if the output file
nohup.out cannot be created in the current directory, the
nohup utility shall use the directory <br>
named by HOME to create the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the search path
that is used to locate the utility to be invoked. See the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8,
Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
The nohup utility shall take the standard action for all
signals except that SIGHUP shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If the standard output is not a terminal, the standard
output of nohup shall be the standard output generated by
the execution of the utility specified by the operands.
Other&acirc; <br>
wise, nothing shall be written to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
If the standard output is a terminal, a message shall be
written to the standard error, indicating the name of the
file to which the output is being appended. The name of the
<br>
file shall be either nohup.out or $HOME/nohup.out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
If the standard output is a terminal, all output written by
the named utility to the standard output and standard error
is appended to the file nohup.out, which is created if it
<br>
does not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 The utility specified by
utility was found but could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 An error occurred in the
nohup utility or the utility specified by utility could not
be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the exit status of
nohup shall be that of the utility specified by the utility
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The command, env, nice, nohup, time, and xargs utilities
have been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs
so that applications can distinguish &quot;failure to find a
util&acirc; <br>
ity&quot; from &quot;invoked utility exited with an error
indication&quot;. The value 127 was chosen because it is not
commonly used for other meanings; most utilities use small
values for <br>
&quot;normal error conditions&quot; and the values above 128
can be confused with termination due to receipt of a signal.
The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate
that the <br>
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differentiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is <br>
based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts
to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when
any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
It is frequently desirable to apply nohup to pipelines or
lists of commands. This can be done by placing pipelines and
command lists in a single file; this file can then be <br>
invoked as a utility, and the nohup applies to everything in
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the following
command can be used to apply nohup to a complex command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nohup sh -c
&rsquo;complex-command-line&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The 4.3 BSD version ignores SIGTERM and SIGHUP, and if
./nohup.out cannot be used, it fails instead of trying to
use $HOME/nohup.out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The csh utility has a built-in
version of nohup that acts differently from the nohup
defined in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term utility is used, rather
than command, to highlight the fact that shell compound
commands, pipelines, special built-ins, and so on, cannot be
used directly. However, <br>
utility includes user application programs and shell
scripts, not just the standard utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical versions of the nohup
utility use default file creation semantics. Some more
recent versions use the permissions specified here as an
added security precaution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical implementations
ignore SIGQUIT in addition to SIGHUP; others ignore SIGTERM.
An early proposal allowed, but did not require, SIGQUIT to
be ignored. Several <br>
reviewers objected that nohup should only modify the
handling of SIGHUP as required by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
