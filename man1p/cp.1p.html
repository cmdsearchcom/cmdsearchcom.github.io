<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cp - copy files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cp [-fip] source_file target_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp [-fip] source_file ...
target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp -R [-H | -L | -P][-fip]
source_file ... target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp -r [-H | -L | -P][-fip]
source_file ... target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The first synopsis form is denoted by two operands, neither
of which are existing files of type directory. The cp
utility shall copy the contents of source_file (or, if <br>
source_file is a file of type symbolic link, the contents of
the file referenced by source_file) to the destination path
named by target_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second synopsis form is
denoted by two or more operands where the -R or -r options
are not specified and the first synopsis form is not
applicable. It shall be an error if <br>
any source_file is a file of type directory, if target does
not exist, or if target is a file of a type defined by the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, but is
<br>
not a file of type directory. The cp utility shall copy the
contents of each source_file (or, if source_file is a file
of type symbolic link, the contents of the file referenced
<br>
by source_file) to the destination path named by the
concatenation of target, a slash character, and the last
component of source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third and fourth synopsis
forms are denoted by two or more operands where the -R or -r
options are specified. The cp utility shall copy each file
in the file hierarchy <br>
rooted in each source_file to a destination path named as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If target exists and is a file
of type directory, the name of the corresponding destination
path for each file in the file hierarchy shall be the
concatenation of target, a <br>
slash character, and the pathname of the file relative to
the directory containing source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If target does not exist and
two operands are specified, the name of the corresponding
destination path for source_file shall be target; the name
of the corresponding destina&acirc; <br>
tion path for all other files in the file hierarchy shall be
the concatenation of target, a slash character, and the
pathname of the file relative to source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It shall be an error if target
does not exist and more than two operands are specified, or
if target exists and is a file of a type defined by the
System Interfaces volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, but is not a file of type
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following description,
the term dest_file refers to the file named by the
destination path. The term source_file refers to the file
that is being copied, whether specified <br>
as an operand or a file in a file hierarchy rooted in a
source_file operand. If source_file is a file of type
symbolic link:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If neither the -R nor -r
options were specified, cp shall take actions based on the
type and contents of the file referenced by the symbolic
link, and not by the symbolic link <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the -R option was
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If none of the options -H, -L,
nor -P were specified, it is unspecified which of -H, -L, or
-P will be used as a default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the -H option was
specified, cp shall take actions based on the type and
contents of the file referenced by any symbolic link
specified as a source_file operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the -L option was
specified, cp shall take actions based on the type and
contents of the file referenced by any symbolic link
specified as a source_file operand or any <br>
symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the -P option was
specified, cp shall copy any symbolic link specified as a
source_file operand and any symbolic links encountered
during traversal of a file hierarchy, <br>
and shall not follow any symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the -r option was
specified, the behavior is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each source_file, the
following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If source_file references the
same file as dest_file, cp may write a diagnostic message to
standard error; it shall do nothing more with source_file
and shall go on to any <br>
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If source_file is of type
directory, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If neither the -R or -r
options were specified, cp shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with source_file, and go
on to any remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If source_file was not
specified as an operand and source_file is dot or dot-dot,
cp shall do nothing more with source_file and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. If dest_file exists and it is
a file type not specified by the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the behavior is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. If dest_file exists and it is
not of type directory, cp shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with source_file or any
files below <br>
source_file in the file hierarchy, and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e. If the directory dest_file
does not exist, it shall be created with file permission
bits set to the same value as those of source_file, modified
by the file creation mask <br>
of the user if the -p option was not specified, and then
bitwise-inclusively OR&rsquo;ed with S_IRWXU. If dest_file
cannot be created, cp shall write a diagnostic message to
<br>
standard error, do nothing more with source_file, and go on
to any remaining files. It is unspecified if cp attempts to
copy files in the file hierarchy rooted in <br>
source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f. The files in the directory
source_file shall be copied to the directory dest_file,
taking the four steps (1 to 4) listed here with the files as
source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g. If dest_file was created, its
file permission bits shall be changed (if necessary) to be
the same as those of source_file, modified by the file
creation mask of the user <br>
if the -p option was not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h. The cp utility shall do
nothing more with source_file and go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If source_file is of type
regular file, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If dest_file exists, the
following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i. If the -i option is in
effect, the cp utility shall write a prompt to the standard
error and read a line from the standard input. If the
response is not affirmative, <br>
cp shall do nothing more with source_file and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ii. A file descriptor for
dest_file shall be obtained by performing actions equivalent
to the open() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 called using dest_file as the path
argument, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY and
O_TRUNC as the oflag argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iii. If the attempt to obtain a
file descriptor fails and the -f option is in effect, cp
shall attempt to remove the file by performing actions
equivalent to the unlink() <br>
function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 called using dest_file as the path argument. If
this attempt succeeds, cp shall continue <br>
with step 3b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If dest_file does not exist,
a file descriptor shall be obtained by performing actions
equivalent to the open() function defined in the System
Interfaces volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 called using dest_file as the path
argument, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY and
O_CREAT as the oflag argument. The file permission bits of
<br>
source_file shall be the mode argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. If the attempt to obtain a
file descriptor fails, cp shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with source_file, and go
on to any remaining <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. The contents of source_file
shall be written to the file descriptor. Any write errors
shall cause cp to write a diagnostic message to standard
error and continue to step <br>
3e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e. The file descriptor shall be
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f. The cp utility shall do
nothing more with source_file. If a write error occurred in
step 3d, it is unspecified if cp continues with any
remaining files. If no write <br>
error occurred in step 3d, cp shall go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Otherwise, the following
steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If the -r option was
specified, the behavior is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If the -R option was
specified, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i. The dest_file shall be
created with the same file type as source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ii. If source_file is a file of
type FIFO, the file permission bits shall be the same as
those of source_file, modified by the file creation mask of
the user if the -p <br>
option was not specified. Otherwise, the permissions, owner
ID, and group ID of dest_file are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this creation fails for any
reason, cp shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with source_file, and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iii. If source_file is a file of
type symbolic link, the pathname contained in dest_file
shall be the same as the pathname contained in
source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this fails for any reason, cp
shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
nothing more with source_file, and go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the implementation provides
additional or alternate access control mechanisms (see the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
4.4, File Access Permissions), <br>
their effect on copies of files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The cp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f If a file descriptor for a
destination file cannot be obtained, as described in step
3.a.ii., attempt to unlink the destination file and
proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Take actions based on the
type and contents of the file referenced by any symbolic
link specified as a source_file operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Write a prompt to standard
error before copying to any existing destination file. If
the response from the standard input is affirmative, the
copy shall be attempted; oth&acirc; <br>
erwise, it shall not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Take actions based on the
type and contents of the file referenced by any symbolic
link specified as a source_file operand or any symbolic
links encountered during traver&acirc; <br>
sal of a file hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Take actions on any symbolic
link specified as a source_file operand or any symbolic link
encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Duplicate the following
characteristics of each source file in the corresponding

fails for any reason, cp shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The user ID and group ID. If
this duplication fails for any reason, it is unspecified
whether cp writes a diagnostic message to standard

the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits. Other, implementation-defined,
bits may be duplicated as well. If this duplication fails

shall write a diagnostic message to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user ID or the group ID
cannot be duplicated, the file permission bits S_ISUID and
S_ISGID shall be cleared. If these bits are present in the
source file but are not <br>
duplicated in the destination file, it is unspecified
whether cp writes a diagnostic message to standard

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If cp is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, files
or file hierarchies may be only partially copied and files
and directories may have incorrect permissions or access
<br>
and modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The difference between -R and -r is in the treatment by cp
of file types other than regular and directory. The original
-r flag, for historic reasons, does not handle special <br>
files any differently from regular files, but always reads
the file and copies its contents. This has obvious problems
in the presence of special file types; for example,
charac&acirc; <br>
ter devices, FIFOs, and sockets. The -R option is intended
to recreate the file hierarchy and the -r option supports
historical practice. It was anticipated that a future
version <br>
of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 would deprecate the
-r option, and for that reason, there has been no attempt to
fix its behavior with respect to FIFOs or other file types
<br>
where copying the file is clearly wrong. However, some
implementations support -r with the same abilities as the -R
defined in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. To
accommodate <br>
them as well as systems that do not, the differences between
-r and -R are implementation-defined. Implementations may
make them identical. The -r option is marked
obsolescent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set-user-ID and set-group-ID
bits are explicitly cleared when files are created. This is
to prevent users from creating programs that are set-user-ID
or set-group-ID to them <br>
when copying files or to make set-user-ID or set-group-ID
files accessible to new groups of users. For example, if a
file is set-user-ID and the copy has a different group ID
<br>
than the source, a new group of users has execute permission
to a set-user-ID program than did previously. In particular,
this is a problem for superusers copying users&rsquo;
trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The -i option exists on BSD systems, giving applications and
users a way to avoid accidentally removing files when
copying. Although the 4.3 BSD version does not prompt if the
<br>
standard input is not a terminal, the standard developers
decided that use of -i is a request for interaction, so when
the destination path exists, the utility takes instructions
<br>
from whatever responds on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact format of the
interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature
of the contents of prompts are specified because
implementations may desire more descriptive <br>
prompts than those used on historical implementations.
Therefore, an application using the -i option relies on the
system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the
<br>
user, based on the behavior specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option is historical
practice on BSD systems, duplicating the time of last data
modification and time of last access. This volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 extends it to <br>
preserve the user and group IDs, as well as the file
permissions. This requirement has obvious problems in that
the directories are almost certainly modified after being
copied. <br>
This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that the
modification times be preserved. The statement that the
order in which the characteristics are duplicated is
unspecified is <br>
to permit implementations to provide the maximum amount of
security for the user. Implementations should take into
account the obvious security issues involved in setting the
<br>
owner, group, and mode in the wrong order or creating files
with an owner, group, or mode different from the final
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unspecified whether cp
writes diagnostic messages when the user and group IDs
cannot be set due to the widespread practice of users using
-p to duplicate some portion of <br>
the file characteristics, indifferent to the duplication of
others. Historic implementations only write diagnostic
messages on errors other than [EPERM].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option is historical
practice on BSD and BSD-derived systems, copying file
hierarchies as opposed to single files. This functionality
is used heavily in historical appli&acirc; <br>
cations, and its loss would significantly decrease
consensus. The -R option was added as a close synonym to the
-r option, selected for consistency with all other options
in this <br>
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 that do recursive directory
descent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a failure occurs during the
copying of a file hierarchy, cp is required to attempt to
copy files that are on the same level in the hierarchy or
above the file where the <br>
failure occurred. It is unspecified if cp shall attempt to
copy files below the file where the failure occurred (which
cannot succeed in any case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions, owners, and groups
of created special file types have been deliberately left as
implementation-defined. This is to allow systems to satisfy
special requirements (for <br>
example, allowing users to create character special devices,
but requiring them to be owned by a certain group). In
general, it is strongly suggested that the permissions,
owner, <br>
and group be the same as if the user had run the historical
mknod, ln, or other utility to create the file. It is also
probable that additional privileges are required to create
<br>
block, character, or other implementation-defined special
file types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the -p option
explicitly requires that all set-user-ID and set-group-ID
permissions be discarded if any of the owner or group IDs
cannot be set. This is to keep <br>
users from unintentionally giving away special privilege
when copying programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating regular files,
historical versions of cp use the mode of the source file as
modified by the file mode creation mask. Other choices would
have been to use the mode <br>
of the source file unmodified by the creation mask or to use
the same mode as would be given to a new file created by the
user (plus the execution bits of the source file) and <br>
then modify it by the file mode creation mask. In the
absence of any strong reason to change historic practice, it
was in large part retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating directories,
historical versions of cp use the mode of the source
directory, plus read, write, and search bits for the owner,
as modified by the file mode creation <br>
mask. This is done so that cp can copy trees where the user
has read permission, but the owner does not. A side effect
is that if the file creation mask denies the owner
permis&acirc; <br>
sions, cp fails. Also, once the copy is done, historical
versions of cp set the permissions on the created directory
to be the same as the source directory, unmodified by the
<br>
file creation mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior has been modified
so that cp is always able to create the contents of the
directory, regardless of the file creation mask. After the
copy is done, the permissions <br>
are set to be the same as the source directory, as modified
by the file creation mask. This latter change from
historical behavior is to prevent users from accidentally
creating <br>
directories with permissions beyond those they would
normally set and for consistency with the behavior of cp in
creating files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not a requirement that cp
detect attempts to copy a file to itself; however,
implementations are strongly encouraged to do so. Historical
implementations have detected the <br>
attempt in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two methods of copying
subtrees in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. The other
method is described as part of the pax utility (see pax ).
Both methods are histori&acirc; <br>
cal practice. The cp utility provides a simpler, more
intuitive interface, while pax offers a finer granularity of
control. Each provides additional functionality to the
other; <br>
in particular, pax maintains the hard-link structure of the
hierarchy, while cp does not. It is the intention of the
standard developers that the results be similar (using
appro&acirc; <br>
priate option combinations in both utilities). The results
are not required to be identical; there seemed insufficient
gain to applications to balance the difficulty of
implemen&acirc; <br>
tations having to guarantee that the results would be
exactly identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wording allowing cp to copy
a directory to implementation-defined file types not
specified by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 is provided so that imple&acirc; <br>
mentations supporting symbolic links are not required to
prohibit copying directories to symbolic links. Other
extensions to the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 <br>
file types may need to use this loophole as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
The -r option may be removed; use -R instead.</p>
