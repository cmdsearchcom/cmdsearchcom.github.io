<p>C99(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual C99(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
c99 - compile standard C programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
c99 [-c][-D name[=value]]...[-E][-g][-I directory] ... [-L
directory] <br>
... [-o outfile][-Ooptlevel][-s][-U name]... operand ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The c99 utility is an interface to the standard C
compilation system; it shall accept source code conforming
to the ISO C standard. The system conceptually consists of a
compiler <br>
and link editor. The files referenced by operands shall be
compiled and linked to produce an executable file. (It is
unspecified whether the linking occurs entirely within the
<br>
operation of c99; some implementations may produce objects
that are not fully resolved until the file is executed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -c option is specified,
for all pathname operands of the form file .c, the
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(basename pathname .c).o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shall be created as the result
of successful compilation. If the -c option is not
specified, it is unspecified whether such .o files are
created or deleted for the file .c oper&acirc; <br>
ands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are no options that
prevent link editing (such as -c or -E), and all operands
compile and link without error, the resulting executable
file shall be written according to <br>
the -o outfile option (if present) or to the file a.out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The executable file shall be
created as specified in File Read, Write, and Creation,
except that the file permission bits shall be set to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the bits specified by the
umask of the process shall be cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The c99 utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -l library operands have
the format of options, but their position within a list of
operands affects the order in which libraries are
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The order of specifying the -I
and -L options is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Conforming applications shall
specify each option separately; that is, grouping option
letters (for example, -cO) need not be recognized by all
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Suppress the link-edit phase
of the compilation, and do not remove any object files that
are produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Produce symbolic information
in the object or executable files; the nature of this
information is unspecified, and may be modified by
implementation-defined interactions <br>
with other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Produce object or executable
files, or both, from which symbolic and other information
not required for proper execution using the exec family
defined in the System Inter&acirc; <br>
faces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 has been removed
(stripped). If both -g and -s options are present, the
action taken is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Use the pathname outfile, instead of the default a.out, for
the executable file produced. If the -o option is present
with -c or -E, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name[=value]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define name as if by a
C-language #define directive. If no = value is given, a
value of 1 shall be used. The -D option has lower precedence
than the -U option. That is, if <br>
name is used in both a -U and a -D option, name shall be
undefined regardless of the order of the options. Additional
implementation-defined names may be provided by the <br>
compiler. Implementations shall support at least 2048 bytes
of -D definitions and 256 names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Copy C-language source files
to standard output, expanding all preprocessor directives;
no compilation shall be performed. If any operand is not a
text file, the effects <br>
are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
Change the algorithm for searching for headers whose names
are not absolute pathnames to look in the directory named by
the directory pathname before looking in the usual <br>
places. Thus, headers whose names are enclosed in
double-quotes ( &quot;&quot; ) shall be searched for first
in the directory of the file with the #include line, then in
directories <br>
named in -I options, and last in the usual places. For
headers whose names are enclosed in angle brackets (
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; ), the header shall be searched for
only in directories <br>
named in -I options and then in the usual places.
Directories named in -I options shall be searched in the
order specified. Implementations shall support at least ten
<br>
instances of this option in a single c99 command
invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L directory <br>
Change the algorithm of searching for the libraries named in
the -l objects to look in the directory named by the
directory pathname before looking in the usual places. <br>
Directories named in -L options shall be searched in the
order specified. Implementations shall support at least ten
instances of this option in a single c99 command invo&acirc;
<br>
cation. If a directory specified by a -L option contains
files named libc.a, libm.a, libl.a, or liby.a, the results
are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O optlevel <br>
Specify the level of code optimization. If the optlevel
option-argument is the digit &rsquo;0&rsquo;, all special
code optimizations shall be disabled. If it is the digit
&rsquo;1&rsquo;, the <br>
nature of the optimization is unspecified. If the -O option
is omitted, the nature of the system&rsquo;s default
optimization is unspecified. It is unspecified whether code
gen&acirc; <br>
erated in the presence of the -O 0 option is the same as
that generated when -O is omitted. Other optlevel values may
be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U name <br>
Remove any initial definition of name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple instances of the -D,
-I, -U, and -L options can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
An operand is either in the form of a pathname or the form
-l library. The application shall ensure that at least one
operand of the pathname form is specified. The following
op&acirc; <br>
erands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.c A C-language source file
to be compiled and optionally linked. The application shall
ensure that the operand is of this form if the -c option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.a A library of object files
typically produced by the ar utility, and passed directly to
the link editor. Implementations may recognize
implementation-defined suffixes other <br>
than .a as denoting object file libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.o An object file produced
by c99 -c and passed directly to the link editor.
Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
suffixes other than .o as denoting object <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The processing of other files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l library <br>
(The letter ell.) Search the library named:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">liblibrary.a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A library shall be searched when
its name is encountered, so the placement of a -l operand is
significant. Several standard libraries can be specified in
this manner, as <br>
described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
suffixes other than .a as denoting libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input file shall be one of the following: a text file
containing a C-language source program, an object file in
the format produced by c99 -c, or a library of object files,
<br>
in the format produced by archiving zero or more object
files, using ar. Implementations may supply additional
utilities that produce files in these formats. Additional
input <br>
file formats are implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of c99:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Provide a pathname that
should override the default directory for temporary files,
if any. On XSI-conforming systems, provide a pathname that
shall override the default <br>
directory for temporary files, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If more than one file operand ending in .c (or possibly
other unspecified suffixes) is given, for each such
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s:0, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may be written. These messages,
if written, shall precede the processing of each input file;
they shall not be written to the standard output if they are
written to the standard <br>
error, as described in the STDERR section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -E option is specified,
the standard output shall be a text file that represents the
results of the preprocessing stage of the language; it may
contain extra information <br>
appropriate for subsequent compilation passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages. If more than one file operand ending in .c (or
possibly other unspecified suffixes) is given, for each such
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s:0, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may be written to allow
identification of the diagnostic and warning messages with
the appropriate input file. These messages, if written,
shall precede the processing of each <br>
input file; they shall not be written to the standard error
if they are written to the standard output, as described in
the STDOUT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility may produce warning
messages about certain conditions that do not warrant
returning an error (non-zero) exit value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Object files or executable files or both are produced in
unspecified formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
Standard Libraries <br>
The c99 utility shall recognize the following -l operands
for standard libraries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l c This operand shall make
visible all functions referenced in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, with the possible exception
of those functions listed as <br>
residing in &lt;aio.h&gt;, &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;,
&lt;complex.h&gt;, &lt;fenv.h&gt;, &lt;math.h&gt;,
&lt;mqueue.h&gt;, &lt;netdb.h&gt;, &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;,
&lt;pthread.h&gt;, &lt;sched.h&gt;, &lt;semaphore.h&gt;,
&lt;spawn.h&gt;, <br>
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;, pthread_kill(), and pthread_sigmask()
in &lt;signal.h&gt;, &lt;trace.h&gt;, functions marked as
extensions other than as part of the MF or MPR extensions in
<br>
&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;, functions marked as ADV in
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;, and functions marked as CS, CPT, and TMR in
&lt;time.h&gt;. This operand shall not be required to be
present to cause a <br>
search of this library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l l This operand shall make
visible all functions required by the C-language output of
lex that are not made available through the -l c
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l pthread <br>
This operand shall make visible all functions referenced in
&lt;pthread.h&gt; and pthread_kill() and pthread_sigmask()
referenced in &lt;signal.h&gt;. An implementation may search
<br>
this library in the absence of this operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l m This operand shall make
visible all functions referenced in &lt;math.h&gt;,
&lt;complex.h&gt;, and &lt;fenv.h&gt;. An implementation may
search this library in the absence of this operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l rt This operand shall make
visible all functions referenced in &lt;aio.h&gt;,
&lt;mqueue.h&gt;, &lt;sched.h&gt;, &lt;semaphore.h&gt;, and
&lt;spawn.h&gt;, functions marked as extensions other than
as part <br>
of the MF or MPR extensions in &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;, functions
marked as ADV in &lt;fcntl.h&gt;, and functions marked as
CS, CPT, and TMR in &lt;time.h&gt;. An implementation may
search this <br>
library in the absence of this operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l trace <br>
This operand shall make visible all functions referenced in
&lt;trace.h&gt;. An implementation may search this library
in the absence of this operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l xnet <br>
This operand makes visible all functions referenced in
&lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;, &lt;netdb.h&gt;, &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;,
and &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;. An implementation may search this
library in the <br>
absence of this operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l y This operand shall make
visible all functions required by the C-language output of
yacc that are not made available through the -l c
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the absence of options that
inhibit invocation of the link editor, such as -c or -E, the
c99 utility shall cause the equivalent of a -l c operand to
be passed to the link edi&acirc; <br>
tor as the last -l operand, causing it to be searched after
all other object files and libraries are loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unspecified whether the
libraries libc.a, libm.a, librt.a, libpthread.a, libl.a,
liby.a, or libxnet.a exist as regular files. The
implementation may accept as -l operands <br>
names of objects that do not exist as regular files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External Symbols <br>
The C compiler and link editor shall support the
significance of external symbols up to a length of at least
31 bytes; the action taken upon encountering symbols
exceeding the <br>
implementation-defined maximum symbol length is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler and link editor
shall support a minimum of 511 external symbols per source
or object file, and a minimum of 4095 external symbols in
total. A diagnostic message <br>
shall be written to the standard output if the
implementation-defined limit is exceeded; other actions are
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Programming Environments <br>
All implementations shall support one of the following
programming environments as a default. Implementations may
support more than one of the following programming
environments. <br>
Applications can use sysconf() or getconf to determine which
programming environments are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table: Programming Environments:

_POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG &gt;=32 &gt;=64 &gt;=64 &gt;=64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All implementations shall
support one or more environments where the widths of the
following types are no greater than the width of type long:
blksize_t, cc_t, mode_t, nfds_t, <br>
pid_t, ptrdiff_t, size_t, speed_t, ssize_t, suseconds_t,
tcflag_t, useconds_t, wchar_t, wint_t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The executable files created
when these environments are selected shall be in a proper
format for execution by the exec family of functions. Each
environment may be one of the <br>
ones in Programming Environments: Type Sizes, or it may be
another environment. The names for the environments that
meet this requirement shall be output by a getconf command
<br>
using the _POSIX_V6_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS argument. If more
than one environment meets the requirement, the names of all
such environments shall be output on separate lines. Any
<br>
of these names can then be used in a subsequent getconf
command to obtain the flags specific to that environment
with the following suffixes added as appropriate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_CFLAGS <br>
To get the C compiler flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_LDFLAGS <br>
To get the linker/loader flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_LIBS To get the libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This requirement may be removed
in a future version of IEEE Std 1003.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this utility processes a
file containing a function called main(), it shall be
defined with a return type equivalent to int. Using return
from the initial call to main() <br>
shall be equivalent (other than with respect to language
scope issues) to calling exit() with the returned value.
Reaching the end of the initial call to main() shall be
equiva&acirc; <br>
lent to calling exit(0). The implementation shall not
declare a prototype for this function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations provide
configuration strings for C compiler flags, linker/loader
flags, and libraries for each supported environment. When an
application needs to use a specific <br>
programming environment rather than the implementation
default programming environment while compiling, the
application shall first verify that the implementation
supports the <br>
desired environment. If the desired programming environment
is supported, the application shall then invoke c99 with the
appropriate C compiler flags as the first options for the
<br>
compile, the appropriate linker/loader flags after any other
options but before any operands, and the appropriate
libraries at the end of the operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conforming applications shall
not attempt to link together object files compiled for
different programming models. Applications shall also be
aware that binary data placed in <br>
shared memory or in files might not be recognized by
applications built for other programming models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful compilation or link
edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
When c99 encounters a compilation error that causes an
object file not to be created, it shall write a diagnostic
to standard error and continue to compile other source code
op&acirc; <br>
erands, but it shall not perform the link phase and return a
non-zero exit status. If the link edit is unsuccessful, a
diagnostic message shall be written to standard error and
<br>
c99 exits with a non-zero status. A conforming application
shall rely on the exit status of c99, rather than on the
existence or mode of the executable file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Since the c99 utility usually creates files in the current
directory during the compilation process, it is typically
necessary to run the c99 utility in a directory in which a
<br>
file can be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems providing POSIX
Conformance (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 2, Conformance), c99 is required only
with the C-Language Development <br>
option; XSI-conformant systems always provide c99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical implementations
have created .o files when -c is not specified and more than
one source file is given. Since this area is left
unspecified, the application cannot <br>
rely on .o files being created, but it also must be prepared
for any related .o files that already exist being deleted at
the completion of the link edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical implementations
have permitted -L options to be interspersed with -l
operands on the command line. For an application to compile
consistently on systems that do <br>
not behave like this, it is necessary for a conforming
application to supply all -L options before any of the -l
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is the possible
implication that if a user supplies versions of the standard
functions (before they would be encountered by an implicit
-l c or explicit -l m), that those <br>
versions would be used in place of the standard versions.
There are various reasons this might not be true (functions
defined as macros, manipulations for clean name space, and
<br>
so on), so the existence of files named in the same manner
as the standard libraries within the -L directories is
explicitly stated to produce unspecified behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the functions specified
in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 may
be made visible by implementations when the Standard C
Library is searched. Conforming <br>
applications must explicitly request searching the other
standard libraries when functions made visible by those
libraries are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following usage example compiles foo.c and creates
the executable file foo:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 -o foo foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following usage example
compiles foo.c and creates the object file foo.o:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 -c foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following usage example
compiles foo.c and creates the executable file a.out:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following usage example
compiles foo.c, links it with bar.o, and creates the
executable file a.out. It may also create and leave
foo.o:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 foo.c bar.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following example shows
how an application using threads interfaces can test for
support of and use a programming environment supporting
32-bit int, long, and pointer <br>
types and an off_t type using at least 64 bits:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ $(getconf
_POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG) != &quot;-1&quot; ] <br>
then <br>
c99 $(getconf POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_CFLAGS)
-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 $(getconf POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS)
foo.c -o foo $(getconf POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_LIBS) -l
pthread <br>
else <br>
echo ILP32_OFFBIG programming environment not supported <br>
exit 1 <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The following examples
clarify the use and interactions of -L options and -l
operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider the case in which
module a.c calls function f() in library libQ.a, and module
b.c calls function g() in library libp.a. Assume that both
libraries reside in /a/b/c. The <br>
command line to compile and link in the desired way is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q
b.c -l p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case the -l Q operand
need only precede the first -l p operand, since both libQ.a
and libp.a reside in the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple -L operands can be used
when library name collisions occur. Building on the previous
example, suppose that the user wants to use a new libp.a, in
/a/a/a, but still wants <br>
f() from /a/b/c/libQ.a:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 -L /a/a/a -L /a/b/c main.o
a.c -l Q b.c -l p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the linker
searches the -L options in the order specified, and finds
/a/a/a/libp.a before /a/b/c/libp.a when resolving references
for b.c. The order of the -l <br>
operands is still important, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The following example shows
how an application can use a programming environment where
the widths of the following types: blksize_t, cc_t, mode_t,
nfds_t, pid_t, ptrdiff_t, <br>
size_t, speed_t, ssize_t, suseconds_t, tcflag_t, useconds_t,
wchar_t, wint_t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are no greater than the width of
type long:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># First choose one of the listed
environments ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ... if there are no additional
constraints, the first one will do: <br>
CENV=$(getconf _POSIX_V6_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS | head -n
l)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ... or, if an environment that
supports large files is preferred, <br>
# look for names that contain &quot;OFF64&quot; or
&quot;OFFBIG&quot;. (This chooses <br>
# the last one in the list if none match.) <br>
for CENV in $(getconf _POSIX_V6_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS) <br>
do <br>
case $CENV in <br>
*OFF64*|*OFFBIG*) break ;; <br>
esac <br>
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># The chosen environment name
can now be used like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 $(getconf ${CENV}_CFLAGS) -D
_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L $(getconf ${CENV}_LDFLAGS) foo.c -o
foo $(getconf ${CENV}_LIBS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The c99 utility is based on the c89 utility originally
introduced in the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the changes from c89
include the modification to the contents of the Standard
Libraries section to account for new headers and options;
for example, &lt;spawn.h&gt; added to <br>
the -l rt operand, and the -l trace operand added for the
Tracing functions.</p>
