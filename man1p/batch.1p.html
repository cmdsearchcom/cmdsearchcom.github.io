<p>BATCH(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual BATCH(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
batch - schedule commands to be executed in a batch
queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
batch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The batch utility shall read commands from standard input
and schedule them for execution in a batch queue. It shall
be the equivalent of the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at -q b -m now</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where queue b is a special at
queue, specifically for batch jobs. Batch jobs shall be
submitted to the batch queue with no time constraints and
shall be run by the system using <br>
algorithms, based on unspecified factors, that may vary with
each invocation of batch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users shall be permitted to use
batch if their name appears in the file
/usr/lib/cron/at.allow. If that file does not exist, the
file /usr/lib/cron/at.deny shall be checked to <br>
determine whether the user shall be denied access to batch.
If neither file exists, only a process with the appropriate
privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only <br>
at.deny exists and is empty, global usage shall be
permitted. The at.allow and at.deny files shall consist of
one user name per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be a text file consisting of
commands acceptable to the shell command language described
in Shell Command Language .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The text files /usr/lib/cron/at.allow and
/usr/lib/cron/at.deny shall contain zero or more user names,
one per line, of users who are, respectively, authorized or
denied access <br>
to the at and batch utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of batch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME <br>
Determine the format and contents for date and time strings
written by batch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL Determine the name of a
command interpreter to be used to invoke the at-job. If the
variable is unset or null, sh shall be used. If it is set to
a value other than a name <br>
for sh, the implementation shall do one of the following:
use that shell; use sh; use the login shell from the user
database; any of the preceding accompanied by a warning <br>
diagnostic about which was chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone. The
job shall be submitted for execution at the time specified
by timespec or -t time relative to the timezone specified by
the TZ variable. If <br>
timespec specifies a timezone, it overrides TZ. If timespec
does not specify a timezone and TZ is unset or null, an
unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
When standard input is a terminal, prompts of unspecified
format for each line of the user input described in the
STDIN section may be written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The following shall be written to standard error when a job
has been successfully submitted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;job %s at %s0, at_job_id,
&lt;date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where date shall be equivalent
in format to the output of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date +&quot;%a %b %e %T
%Y&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The date and time written shall
be adjusted so that they appear in the timezone of the user
(as determined by the TZ variable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither this, nor warning
messages concerning the selection of the command
interpreter, are considered a diagnostic that changes the
exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostic messages, if any,
shall be written to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
The job shall not be scheduled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
It may be useful to redirect standard output within the
specified commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. This sequence can be used at a terminal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">batch <br>
sort &lt; file &gt;outfile <br>
EOT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. This sequence, which
demonstrates redirecting standard error to a pipe, is useful
in a command procedure (the sequence of output redirection
specifications is significant):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">batch &lt;&lt; <br>
! diff file1 file2 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;outfile | mailx mygroup
<br>
!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Early proposals described batch in a manner totally
separated from at, even though the historical model treated
it almost as a synonym for at -qb. A number of features were
added <br>
to list and control batch work separately from those in at.
Upon further reflection, it was decided that the benefit of
this did not merit the change to the historical
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option was included on
the equivalent at command because it is historical practice
to mail results to the submitter, even if all job-produced
output is redirected. As <br>
explained in the RATIONALE for at, the now keyword submits
the job for immediate execution (after scheduling delays),
despite some historical systems where at now would have been
<br>
considered an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
