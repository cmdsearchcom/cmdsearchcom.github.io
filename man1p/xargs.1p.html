<p>XARGS(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual XARGS(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xargs - construct argument lists and invoke utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xargs [-t][-p]][-E eofstr][-I replstr][-L number][-n number
[-x]] <br>
[-s size][utility [argument...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xargs utility shall construct a command line consisting
of the utility and argument operands specified followed by
as many arguments read in sequence from standard input as
<br>
fit in length and number constraints specified by the
options. The xargs utility shall then invoke the constructed
command line and wait for its completion. This sequence
shall <br>
be repeated until one of the following occurs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An end-of-file condition is
detected on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The logical end-of-file string
(see the -E eofstr option) is found on standard input after
double-quote processing, apostrophe processing, and
backslash escape processing (see <br>
next paragraph).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An invocation of a constructed
command line returns an exit status of 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application shall ensure
that arguments in the standard input are separated by
unquoted &lt;blank&gt;s, unescaped &lt;blank&gt;s, or
&lt;newline&gt;s. A string of zero or more non-double-quote
<br>
( &rsquo; )&rsquo; characters and non- &lt;newline&gt;s can
be quoted by enclosing them in double-quotes. A string of
zero or more non-apostrophe ( &rsquo;&quot; ) characters and
non- &lt;newline&gt;s can be <br>
quoted by enclosing them in apostrophes. Any unquoted
character can be escaped by preceding it with a backslash.
The utility named by utility shall be executed one or more
times <br>
until the end-of-file is reached or the logical end-of file
string is found. The results are unspecified if the utility
named by utility attempts to read from its standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated command line
length shall be the sum of the size in bytes of the utility
name and each argument treated as strings, including a null
byte terminator for each of <br>
these strings. The xargs utility shall limit the command
line length such that when the command line is invoked, the
combined argument and environment lists (see the exec family
<br>
of functions in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001) shall not exceed {ARG_MAX}-2048 bytes. Within
this constraint, if neither the -n nor the -s option is
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, the default command line length shall be at least
{LINE_MAX}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The xargs utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E eofstr <br>
Use eofstr as the logical end-of-file string. If -E is not
specified, it is unspecified whether the logical end-of-file
string is the underscore character ( &rsquo;_&rsquo; ) or
the <br>
end-of-file string capability is disabled. When eofstr is
the null string, the logical end-of-file string capability
shall be disabled and underscore characters shall be <br>
taken literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I replstr <br>
Insert mode: utility is executed for each line from standard
input, taking the entire line as a single argument,
inserting it in arguments for each occurrence of replstr.
<br>
A maximum of five arguments in arguments can each contain
one or more instances of replstr. Any &lt;blank&gt;s at the
beginning of each line shall be ignored. Constructed
argu&acirc; <br>
ments cannot grow larger than 255 bytes. Option -x shall be
forced on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L number <br>
The utility shall be executed for each non-empty number
lines of arguments from standard input. The last invocation
of utility shall be with fewer lines of arguments if <br>
fewer than number remain. A line is considered to end with
the first &lt;newline&gt; unless the last character of the
line is a &lt;blank&gt;; a trailing &lt;blank&gt; signals
continuation <br>
to the next non-empty line, inclusive. The -L and -n options
are mutually-exclusive; the last one specified shall take
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n number <br>
Invoke utility using as many standard input arguments as
possible, up to number (a positive decimal integer)
arguments maximum. Fewer arguments shall be used if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The command line length
accumulated exceeds the size specified by the -s option (or
{LINE_MAX} if there is no -s option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The last iteration has fewer
than number, but not zero, operands remaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Prompt mode: the user is
asked whether to execute utility at each invocation. Trace
mode ( -t) is turned on to write the command instance to be
executed, followed by a <br>
prompt to standard error. An affirmative response read from
/dev/tty shall execute the command; otherwise, that
particular invocation of utility shall be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size <br>
Invoke utility using as many standard input arguments as
possible yielding a command line length less than size (a
positive decimal integer) bytes. Fewer arguments shall <br>
be used if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The total number of arguments
exceeds that specified by the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The total number of lines
exceeds that specified by the -L option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* End-of-file is encountered on
standard input before size bytes are accumulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values of size up to at least
{LINE_MAX} bytes shall be supported, provided that the
constraints specified in the DESCRIPTION are met. It shall
not be considered an error if a <br>
value larger than that supported by the implementation or
exceeding the constraints specified in the DESCRIPTION is
given; xargs shall use the largest value it supports within
<br>
the constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Enable trace mode. Each
generated command line shall be written to standard error
just prior to invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Terminate if a command line
containing number arguments (see the -n option above) or
number lines (see the -L option above) will not fit in the
implied or specified size <br>
(see the -s option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utility <br>
The name of the utility to be invoked, found by search path
using the PATH environment variable, described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter <br>
8, Environment Variables. If utility is omitted, the default
shall be the echo utility. If the utility operand names any
of the special built-in utilities in Special <br>
Built-In Utilities, the results are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
An initial option or operand for the invocation of
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be a text file. The results are
unspecified if an end-of-file condition is detected
immediately following an escaped &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The file /dev/tty shall be used to read responses required
by the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of xargs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for the
behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
collating elements used in the extended regular expression
defined for the <br>
yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files) and the behavior of character classes used in
the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative
responses and that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the location of
utility, as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and
the -t and -p options. If the -t option is specified, the
utility and its constructed argument list shall be written
<br>
to standard error, as it will be invoked, prior to
invocation. If -p is specified, a prompt of the following
format shall be written (in the POSIX locale):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;?...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at the end of the line of the
output from -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All invocations of utility
returned exit status zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1-125 A command line meeting the
specified requirements could not be assembled, one or more
of the invocations of utility returned a non-zero exit
status, or some other error <br>
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 The utility specified by
utility was found but could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 The utility specified by
utility could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If a command line meeting the specified requirements cannot
be assembled, the utility cannot be invoked, an invocation
of the utility is terminated by a signal, or an invocation
<br>
of the utility exits with exit status 255, the xargs utility
shall write a diagnostic message and exit without processing
any remaining input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The 255 exit status allows a utility being used by xargs to
tell xargs to terminate if it knows no further invocations
using the current data stream will succeed. Thus, utility
<br>
should explicitly exit with an appropriate value to avoid
accidentally returning with 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that input is parsed as
lines; &lt;blank&gt;s separate arguments. If xargs is used
to bundle output of commands like find dir -print or ls into
commands to be executed, unexpected <br>
results are likely if any filenames contain any
&lt;blank&gt;s or &lt;newline&gt;s. This can be fixed by
using find to call a script that converts each file found
into a quoted string that <br>
is then piped to xargs. Note that the quoting rules used by
xargs are not the same as in the shell. They were not made
consistent here because existing applications depend on the
<br>
current rules and the shell syntax is not fully compatible
with it. An easy rule that can be used to transform any
string into a quoted form that xargs interprets correctly is
to <br>
precede each character in the string with a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On implementations with a large
value for {ARG_MAX}, xargs may produce command lines longer
than {LINE_MAX}. For invocation of utilities, this is not a
problem. If xargs is being <br>
used to create a text file, users should explicitly set the
maximum command line length with the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command, env, nice, nohup,
time, and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit
code 127 if an error occurs so that applications can
distinguish &quot;failure to find a util&acirc; <br>
ity&quot; from &quot;invoked utility exited with an error
indication&quot;. The value 127 was chosen because it is not
commonly used for other meanings; most utilities use small
values for <br>
&quot;normal error conditions&rsquo;&rsquo; and the values
above 128 can be confused with termination due to receipt of
a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to
indicate that the <br>
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differentiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is <br>
based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts
to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when
any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following command combines the output of the
parenthesised commands onto one line, which is then written
to the end-of-file log:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(logname; date; printf &quot;%s0
&quot;$0 $*&quot;) | xargs &gt;&gt;log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command invokes
diff with successive pairs of arguments originally typed as
command line arguments (assuming there are no embedded
&lt;blank&gt;s in the elements of <br>
the original argument list):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;%s0 &quot;$*&quot;
| xargs -n 2 -x diff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. In the following commands,
the user is asked which files in the current directory are
to be archived. The files are archived into arch; a, one at
a time, or b, many at a <br>
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. ls | xargs -p -L 1 ar -r
arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. ls | xargs -p -L 1 | xargs ar
-r arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The following executes with
successive pairs of arguments originally typed as command
line arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo $* | xargs -n 2 diff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. On XSI-conformant systems,
the following moves all files from directory $1 to directory
$2, and echoes each move command just before doing it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls $1 | xargs -I {} -t mv $1/{}
$2/{}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The xargs utility was usually found only in System V-based
systems; BSD systems included an apply utility that provided
functionality similar to xargs -n number. The SVID lists
<br>
xargs as a software development extension. This volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not share the view that it is used
only for development, and therefore it is not optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The classic application of the
xargs utility is in conjunction with the find utility to
reduce the number of processes launched by a simplistic use
of the find -exec combination. <br>
The xargs utility is also used to enforce an upper limit on
memory required to launch a process. With this basis in
mind, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 selected only the
<br>
minimal features required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the 255 exit status is
mostly an accident of historical implementations, it allows
a utility being used by xargs to tell xargs to terminate if
it knows no further invo&acirc; <br>
cations using the current data stream shall succeed. Any
non-zero exit status from a utility falls into the 1-125
range when xargs exits. There is no statement of how the
various <br>
non-zero utility exit status codes are accumulated by xargs.
The value could be the addition of all codes, their highest
value, the last one received, or a single value such as <br>
1. Since no algorithm is arguably better than the others,
and since many of the standard utilities say little more
(portably) than &quot;pass/fail&quot;, no new algorithm was
invented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several other xargs options were
withdrawn because simple alternatives already exist within
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. For example, the -i
replstr option can be just as <br>
efficiently performed using a shell for loop. Since xargs
calls an exec function with each input line, the -i option
does not usually exploit the grouping capabilities of
xargs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The requirement that xargs never
produces command lines such that invocation of utility is
within 2048 bytes of hitting the POSIX exec {ARG_MAX}
limitations is intended to guar&acirc; <br>
antee that the invoked utility has room to modify its
environment variables and command line arguments and still
be able to invoke another utility. Note that the minimum
<br>
{ARG_MAX} allowed by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 is 4096 bytes and the minimum value allowed
by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is 2048 bytes;
there&acirc; <br>
fore, the 2048 bytes difference seems reasonable. Note,
however, that xargs may never be able to invoke a utility if
the environment passed in to xargs comes close to using <br>
{ARG_MAX} bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version of xargs required by
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is required to wait for
the completion of the invoked command before invoking
another command. This was done <br>
because historical scripts using xargs assumed sequential
execution. Implementations wanting to provide parallel
operation of the invoked utilities are encouraged to add an
<br>
option enabling parallel invocation, but should still wait
for termination of all of the children before xargs
terminates normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option was omitted from
the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard in the belief that the eofstr
option-argument was recognized only when it was on a line by
itself and before quote <br>
and escape processing were performed, and that the logical
end-of-file processing was only enabled if a -e option was
specified. In that case, a simple sed script could be used
<br>
to duplicate the -e functionality. Further investigation
revealed that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The logical end-of-file string
was checked for after quote and escape processing, making a
sed script that provided equivalent functionality much more
difficult to write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The default was to perform
logical end-of-file processing with an underscore as the
logical end-of-file string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To correct this
misunderstanding, the -E eofstr option was adopted from the
X/Open Portability Guide. Users should note that the
description of the -E option matches historical <br>
documentation of the -e option (which was not adopted
because it did not support the Utility Syntax Guidelines),
by saying that if eofstr is the null string, logical
end-of-file <br>
processing is disabled. Historical implementations of xargs
actually did not disable logical end-of-file processing;
they treated a null argument found in the input as a logical
<br>
end-of-file string. (A null string argument could be
generated using single or double quotes ( &rsquo;&rsquo; or
&quot;&quot; ). Since this behavior was not documented
historically, it is considered <br>
to be a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
