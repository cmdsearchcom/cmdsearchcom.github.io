<p>JOIN(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual JOIN(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
join - relational database operator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
join [-a file_number | -v file_number][-e string][-o
list][-t char] <br>
[-1 field][-2 field] file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The join utility shall perform an equality join on the files
file1 and file2. The joined files shall be written to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The join field is a field in
each file on which the files are compared. The join utility
shall write one line in the output for each pair of lines in
file1 and file2 that have <br>
identical join fields. The output line by default shall
consist of the join field, then the remaining fields from
file1, then the remaining fields from file2. This format can
be <br>
changed by using the -o option (see below). The -a option
can be used to add unmatched lines to the output. The -v
option can be used to output only unmatched lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files file1 and file2 shall
be ordered in the collating sequence of sort -b on the
fields on which they shall be joined, by default the first
in each line. All selected out&acirc; <br>
put shall be written in the same collating sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default input field
separators shall be &lt;blank&gt;s. In this case, multiple
separators shall count as one field separator, and leading
separators shall be ignored. The default <br>
output field separator shall be a &lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field separator and
collating sequence can be changed by using the -t option
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the same key appears more
than once in either file, all combinations of the set of
remaining fields in file1 and the set of remaining fields in
file2 are output in the order <br>
of the lines encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input files are not in
the appropriate collating sequence, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The join utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a file_number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Produce a line for each
unpairable line in file file_number, where file_number is 1
or 2, in addition to the default output. If both -a1 and -a2
are specified, all <br>
unpairable lines shall be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e string <br>
Replace empty output fields in the list selected by -o with
the string string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o list <br>
Construct the output line to comprise the fields specified
in list, each element of which shall have one of the
following two forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. file_number.field, where
file_number is a file number and field is a decimal integer
field number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. 0 (zero), representing the
join field</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The elements of list shall be
either comma-separated or &lt;blank&gt;-separated, as
specified in Guideline 8 of the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Util&acirc; <br>
ity Syntax Guidelines. The fields specified by list shall be
written for all selected output lines. Fields selected by
list that do not appear in the input shall be treated as
<br>
empty output fields. (See the -e option.) Only specifically
requested fields shall be written. The application shall
ensure that list is a single command line argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t char <br>
Use character char as a separator, for both input and
output. Every appearance of char in a line shall be
significant. When this option is specified, the collating
<br>
sequence shall be the same as sort without the -b
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v file_number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of the default output,
produce a line only for each unpairable line in file_number,
where file_number is 1 or 2. If both -v1 and -v2 are
specified, all unpairable <br>
lines shall be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 field <br>
Join on the fieldth field of file 1. Fields are decimal
integers starting with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 field <br>
Join on the fieldth field of file 2. Fields are decimal
integers starting with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file1, file2 <br>
A pathname of a file to be joined. If either of the file1 or
file2 operands is &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the standard input shall
be used in its place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if the file1 or file2
operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo; . See the INPUT FILES
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of join:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale of the
collating sequence join expects to have been used when the
input files were sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The join utility output shall be a concatenation of selected
character fields. When the -o option is not specified, the
output shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s%s%s0, &lt;join
field&gt;, &lt;other file1 fields&gt;, <br>
&lt;other file2 fields&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the join field is not the
first field in a file, the &lt;other file fields&gt; for
that file shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;fields preceding join
field&gt;, &lt;fields following join field&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -o option is specified,
the output format shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;concatenation of
fields&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the concatenation of
fields is described by the -o option, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For either format, each field
(except the last) shall be written with its trailing
separator character. If the separator is the default (
&lt;blank&gt;s), a single &lt;space&gt; shall be <br>
written after each field (except the last).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were output
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Pathnames consisting of numeric digits or of the form
string.string should not be specified directly following the
-o list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The -o 0 field essentially selects the union of the join
fields. For example, given file phone:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!Name Phone Number <br>
Don +1 123-456-7890 <br>
Hal +1 234-567-8901 <br>
Yasushi +2 345-678-9012</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and file fax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!Name Fax Number <br>
Don +1 123-456-7899 <br>
Keith +1 456-789-0122 <br>
Yasushi +2 345-678-9011</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(where the large expanses of
white space are meant to each represent a single
&lt;tab&gt;), the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join -t &quot;&lt;tab&gt;&quot;
-a 1 -a 2 -e &rsquo;(unknown)&rsquo; -o 0,1.2,2.2 phone
fax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would produce:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!Name Phone Number Fax Number
<br>
Don +1 123-456-7890 +1 123-456-7899 <br>
Hal +1 234-567-8901 (unknown) <br>
Keith (unknown) +1 456-789-0122 <br>
Yasushi +2 345-678-9012 +2 345-678-9011</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple instances of the same
key will produce combinatorial results. The following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fa: <br>
a x <br>
a y <br>
a z <br>
fb: <br>
a p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a x p <br>
a y p <br>
a z p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fa: <br>
a b c <br>
a d e <br>
fb: <br>
a w x <br>
a y z <br>
a o p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a b c w x <br>
a b c y z <br>
a b c o p <br>
a d e w x <br>
a d e y z <br>
a d e o p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The -e option is only effective when used with -o because,
unless specific fields are identified using -o, join is not
aware of what fields might be empty. The exception to this
<br>
is the join field, but identifying an empty join field with
the -e string is not historical practice and some scripts
might break if this were changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 0 field in the -o list was
adopted from the Tenth Edition version of join to satisfy
international objections that the join in the base documents
does not support the &quot;full <br>
join&quot; or &quot;outer join&quot; described in relational
database literature. Although it has been possible to
include a join field in the output (by default, or by field
number using -o), <br>
the join field could not be included for an unpaired line
selected by -a. The -o 0 field essentially selects the union
of the join fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sort of outer join was not
possible with the join commands in the base documents. The
-o 0 field was chosen because it is an upwards-compatible
change for applications. An <br>
alternative was considered: have the join field represent
the union of the fields in the files (where they are
identical for matched lines, and one or both are null for
unmatched <br>
lines). This was not adopted because it would break some
historical applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ability to specify file2 as
- is not historical practice; it was added for
completeness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v option is not historical
practice, but was considered necessary because it permitted
the writing of only those lines that do not match on the
join field, as opposed to the <br>
-a option, which prints both lines that do and do not match.
This additional facility is parallel with the -v option of
grep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical implementations
have been encountered where a blank line in one of the input
files was considered to be the end of the file; the
description in this volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not cite this as an allowable
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
