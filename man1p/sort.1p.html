<p>SORT(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual SORT(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sort - sort, merge, or sequence check text files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sort [-m][-o output][-bdfinru][-t char][-k keydef]...
[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -c [-bdfinru][-t char][-k
keydef][file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sort utility shall perform one of the following
functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Sort lines of all the named
files together and write the result to the specified
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Merge lines of all the named
(presorted) files together and write the result to the
specified output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Check that a single input
file is correctly presorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparisons shall be based on
one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input (or,
if no sort keys are specified, the entire line up to, but
not including, the terminat&acirc; <br>
ing &lt;newline&gt;), and shall be performed using the
collating sequence of the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The sort utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, and the -k keydef option should follow the -b,
-d, <br>
-f, -i, -n, and -r options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Check that the single input
file is ordered as specified by the arguments and the
collating sequence of the current locale. No output shall be
produced; only the exit code <br>
shall be affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Merge only; the input file
shall be assumed to be already sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output <br>
Specify the name of an output file to be used instead of the
standard output. This file can be the same as one of the
input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Unique: suppress all but one
in each set of lines having equal keys. If used with the -c
option, check that there are no lines with duplicate keys,
in addition to check&acirc; <br>
ing that the input file is sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall
override the default ordering rules. When ordering options
appear independent of any key field specifications, the
requested field ordering rules <br>
shall be applied globally to all sort keys. When attached to
a specific key (see -k), the specified ordering options
shall override all global ordering options for that key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Specify that only
&lt;blank&gt;s and alphanumeric characters, according to the
current setting of LC_CTYPE, shall be significant in
comparisons. The behavior is undefined for a <br>
sort key to which -i or -n also applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Consider all lowercase
characters that have uppercase equivalents, according to the
current setting of LC_CTYPE, to be the uppercase equivalent
for the purposes of com&acirc; <br>
parison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore all characters that
are non-printable, according to the current setting of
LC_CTYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Restrict the sort key to an
initial numeric string, consisting of optional
&lt;blank&gt;s, optional minus sign, and zero or more digits
with an optional radix character and <br>
thousands separators (as defined in the current locale),
which shall be sorted by arithmetic value. An empty digit
string shall be treated as zero. Leading zeros and <br>
signs on zeros shall not affect ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Reverse the sense of
comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The treatment of field
separators can be altered using the options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Ignore leading &lt;blank&gt;s
when determining the starting and ending positions of a
restricted sort key. If the -b option is specified before
the first -k option, it shall be <br>
applied to all -k options. Otherwise, the -b option can be
attached independently to each -k field_start or field_end
option-argument (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t char <br>
Use char as the field separator character; char shall not be
considered to be part of a field (although it can be
included in a sort key). Each occurrence of char shall be
<br>
significant (for example, &lt;char&gt;&lt;char&gt; delimits
an empty field). If -t is not specified, &lt;blank&gt;s
shall be used as default field separators; each maximal
non-empty <br>
sequence of &lt;blank&gt;s that follows a non- &lt;blank&gt;
shall be a field separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sort keys can be specified using
the options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keydef <br>
The keydef argument is a restricted sort key field
definition. The format of this definition is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">field_start[type][,field_end[type]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where field_start and field_end
define a key field restricted to a portion of the line (see
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section), and type is a modifier
from the list of characters <br>
&rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;f&rsquo;,
&rsquo;i&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo;, &rsquo;r&rsquo; . The
&rsquo;b&rsquo; modifier shall behave like the -b option,
but shall apply only to the field_start or field_end to
which it is attached. The other modi&acirc; <br>
fiers shall behave like the corresponding options, but shall
apply only to the key field to which they are attached; they
shall have this effect if specified with field_start, <br>
field_end, or both. If any modifier is attached to a
field_start or to a field_end, no option shall apply to
either. Implementations shall support at least nine
occurrences of <br>
the -k option, which shall be significant in command line
order. If no -k option is specified, a default sort key of
the entire line shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there are multiple key
fields, later keys shall be compared only after all earlier
keys compare equal. Except when the -u option is specified,
lines that otherwise compare <br>
equal shall be ordered as if none of the options -d, -f, -i,
-n, or -k were present (but with -r still in effect, if it
was specified) and with all bytes in the lines significant
<br>
to the comparison. The order in which lines that still
compare equal are written is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
sorted, merged, or checked. If no file operands are
specified, or if a file operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the
standard input shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo; . See
the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files, except that the sort
utility shall add a &lt;newline&gt; to the end of a file
ending with an incomplete last line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of sort:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for
ordering rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files) and the behavior of character classification
for the -b, -d, -f, -i, and -n options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for the
definition of the radix character and thousands separator
for the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Unless the -o or -c options are in effect, the standard
output shall contain the sorted input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages. A
warning message about correcting an incomplete last line of
an input file may be generated, but need not affect the <br>
final exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
If the -o option is in effect, the sorted input shall be
written to the file output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The notation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k
field_start[type][,field_end[type]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shall define a key field that
begins at field_start and ends at field_end inclusive,
unless field_start falls beyond the end of the line or after
field_end, in which case the key <br>
field is empty. A missing field_end shall mean the last
character of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A field comprises a maximal
sequence of non-separating characters and, in the absence of
option -t, any preceding field separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field_start portion of the
keydef option-argument shall have the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">field_number[.first_character]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fields and characters within
fields shall be numbered starting with 1. The field_number
and first_character pieces, interpreted as positive decimal
integers, shall specify the <br>
first character to be used as part of a sort key. If
.first_character is omitted, it shall refer to the first
character of the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field_end portion of the
keydef option-argument shall have the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">field_number[.last_character]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field_number shall be as
described above for field_start. The last_character piece,
interpreted as a non-negative decimal integer, shall specify
the last character to be <br>
used as part of the sort key. If last_character evaluates to
zero or .last_character is omitted, it shall refer to the
last character of the field specified by field_number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -b option or b type
modifier is in effect, characters within a field shall be
counted from the first non- &lt;blank&gt; in the field.
(This shall apply separately to first_char&acirc; <br>
acter and last_character.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were output
successfully, or -c was specified and the input file was
correctly sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Under the -c option, the file
was not ordered as specified, or if the -c and -u options
were both specified, two input lines were found with equal
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The default value for -t, &lt;blank&gt;, has different
properties from, for example, -t &quot;&lt;space&gt;&quot;.
If a line contains:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the following treatment would
occur with default separation as opposed to specifically
selecting a &lt;space&gt;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Field Default -t
&quot;&lt;space&gt;&quot; <br>
1 &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo empty <br>
2 empty empty <br>
3 empty foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The leading field separator
itself is included in a field when -t is not used. For
example, this command returns an exit status of zero,
meaning the input was already sorted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -c -k 2 &lt;&lt;eof <br>
y&lt;tab&gt;b <br>
x&lt;space&gt;a <br>
eof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(assuming that a &lt;tab&gt;
precedes the &lt;space&gt; in the current collating
sequence). The field separator is not included in a field
when it is explicitly set via -t. This is histori&acirc;
<br>
cal practice and allows usage such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -t &quot;|&quot; -k 2n
&lt;&lt;eof <br>
Atlanta|425022|Georgia <br>
Birmingham|284413|Alabama <br>
Columbia|100385|South Carolina <br>
eof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the second field can be
correctly sorted numerically without regard to the
non-numeric field separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wording in the OPTIONS
section clarifies that the -b, -d, -f, -i, -n, and -r
options have to come before the first sort key specified if
they are intended to apply to all <br>
specified keys. The way it is described in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 matches historical practice, not
historical documentation. The results are unspecified if
these <br>
options are specified after a -k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option might not work as
expected in locales where there is not a one-to-one mapping
between an uppercase and a lowercase letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following command sorts the contents of infile with
the second field as the sort key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -k 2,2 infile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command sorts,
in reverse order, the contents of infile1 and infile2,
placing the output in outfile and using the second character
of the second field as the <br>
sort key (assuming that the first character of the second
field is the field separator):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -r -o outfile -k 2.2,2.2
infile1 infile2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The following command sorts
the contents of infile1 and infile2 using the second non-
&lt;blank&gt; of the second field as the sort key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -k 2.2b,2.2b infile1
infile2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The following command prints
the System V password file (user database) sorted by the
numeric user ID (the third colon-separated field):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -t : -k 3,3n
/etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The following command prints
the lines of the already sorted file infile, suppressing all
but one occurrence of lines having the same third field:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -um -k 3.1,3.0 infile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Examples in some historical documentation state that options
-um with one input file keep the first in each set of lines
with equal keys. This behavior was deemed to be an
imple&acirc; <br>
mentation artifact and was not standardized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -z option was omitted; it is
not standard practice on most systems and is inconsistent
with using sort to sort several files individually and then
merge them together. The <br>
text concerning -z in historical documentation appeared to
require implementations to determine the proper buffer
length during the sort phase of operation, but not during
the <br>
merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -y option was omitted
because of non-portability. The -M option, present in System
V, was omitted because of non-portability in international
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An undocumented -T option exists
in some implementations. It is used to specify a directory
for intermediate files. Implementations are encouraged to
support the use of the <br>
TMPDIR environment variable instead of adding an option to
support this functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -k option was added to
satisfy two objections. First, the zero-based counting used
by sort is not consistent with other utility conventions.
Second, it did not meet syntax <br>
guideline requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical documentation
indicates that &quot;setting -n implies -b&quot;. The
description of -n already states that optional leading
&lt;blank&gt;s are tolerated in doing the comparison. If -b
<br>
is enabled, rather than implied, by -n, this has unusual
side effects. When a character offset is used in a column of
numbers (for example, to sort modulo 100), that offset is
<br>
measured relative to the most significant digit, not to the
column. Based upon a recommendation from the author of the
original sort utility, the -b implication has been omitted
<br>
from this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, and an application
wishing to achieve the previously mentioned side effects has
to code the -b flag explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
