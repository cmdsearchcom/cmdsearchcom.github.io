<p>RENICE(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
RENICE(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
renice - set nice values of running processes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
renice -n increment [-g | -p | -u] ID ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The renice utility shall request that the nice values (see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
3.239, Nice Value) of one or more running processes be <br>
changed. By default, the applicable processes are specified
by their process IDs. When a process group is specified (see
-g), the request shall apply to all processes in the <br>
process group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nice value shall be bounded
in an implementation-defined manner. If the requested
increment would raise or lower the nice value of the
executed utility beyond implementa&acirc; <br>
tion-defined limits, then the limit whose value was exceeded
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user is reniced, the
request applies to all processes whose saved set-user-ID
matches the user ID corresponding to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of which options are
supplied or any other factor, renice shall not alter the
nice values of any process unless the user requesting such a
change has appropriate priv&acirc; <br>
ileges to do so for the specified process. If the user lacks
appropriate privileges to perform the requested action, the
utility shall return an error status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The saved set-user-ID of the
user&rsquo;s process shall be checked instead of its
effective user ID when renice attempts to determine the user
ID of the process in order to determine <br>
whether the user has appropriate privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The renice utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Interpret all operands as
unsigned decimal integer process group IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n increment <br>
Specify how the nice value of the specified process or
processes is to be adjusted. The increment option-argument
is a positive or negative decimal integer that shall be <br>
used to modify the nice value of the specified process or
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Positive increment values shall
cause a lower nice value. Negative increment values may
require appropriate privileges and shall cause a higher nice
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Interpret all operands as
unsigned decimal integer process IDs. The -p option is the
default if no options are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Interpret all operands as
users. If a user exists with a user name equal to the
operand, then the user ID of that user is used in further
processing. Otherwise, if the op&acirc; <br>
erand represents an unsigned decimal integer, it shall be
used as the numeric user ID of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID A process ID, process group
ID, or user name/user ID, depending on the option
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of renice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Adjust the nice value so that process IDs 987 and 32
would have a lower nice value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renice -n 5 -p 987 32</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Adjust the nice value so that
group IDs 324 and 76 would have a higher nice value, if the
user has the appropriate privileges to do so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renice -n -4 -g 324 76</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Adjust the nice value so that
numeric user ID 8 and user sas would have a lower nice
value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renice -n 4 -u 8 sas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useful nice value increments on
historical systems include 19 or 20 (the affected processes
run only when nothing else in the system attempts to run)
and any negative number (to <br>
make processes run faster).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The gid, pid, and user specifications do not fit either the
definition of operand or option-argument. However, for
clarity, they have been included in the OPTIONS section,
<br>
rather than the OPERANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of nice value is
not intended to suggest that all processes in a system have
priorities that are comparable. Scheduling policy extensions
such as the realtime <br>
priorities in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 make the notion of a single underlying priority
for all scheduling policies problematic. Some
implementations <br>
may implement the nice-related features to affect all
processes on the system, others to affect just the general
time-sharing activities implied by this volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, and others may have no effect at all.
Because of the use of &quot;implementation-defined&quot; in
nice and renice, a wide range of implementation strategies
are pos&acirc; <br>
sible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Originally, this utility was
written in the historical manner, using the term &quot;nice
value&quot;. This was always a point of concern with users
because it was never intuitively obvious <br>
what this meant. With a newer version of renice, which used
the term &quot;system scheduling priority&quot;, it was
hoped that novice users could better understand what this
utility was <br>
meant to do. Also, it would be easier to document what the
utility was meant to do. Unfortunately, the addition of the
POSIX realtime scheduling capabilities introduced the
con&acirc; <br>
cepts of process and thread scheduling priorities that were
totally unaffected by the nice/ renice utilities or the
nice()/ setpriority() functions. Continuing to use the term
<br>
&quot;system scheduling priority&rsquo;&rsquo; would have
incorrectly suggested that these utilities and functions
were indeed affecting these realtime priorities. It was
decided to revert to the <br>
historical term &quot;nice value&quot; to reference this
unrelated process attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although this utility has use by
system administrators (and in fact appears in the system
administration portion of the BSD documentation), the
standard developers considered <br>
that it was very useful for individual end users to control
their own processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
