<p>MESG(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual MESG(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mesg - permit or deny messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mesg [y|n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mesg utility shall control whether other users are
allowed to send messages via write, talk, or other utilities
to a terminal device. The terminal device affected shall be
<br>
determined by searching for the first terminal in the
sequence of devices associated with standard input, standard
output, and standard error, respectively. With no arguments,
<br>
mesg shall report the current state without changing it.
Processes with appropriate privileges may be able to send
messages to the terminal independent of the current
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported in the POSIX
locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y Grant permission to other
users to send messages to the terminal device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Deny permission to other users
to send messages to the terminal device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of mesg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written (by mesg)
to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If no operand is specified, mesg shall display the current
terminal state in an unspecified format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Receiving messages is
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Receiving messages is not
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The mechanism by which the message status of the terminal is
changed is unspecified. Therefore, unspecified actions may
cause the status of the terminal to change after mesg has
<br>
successfully completed. These actions may include, but are
not limited to: another invocation of the mesg utility,
login procedures; invocation of the stty utility, invocation
of <br>
the chmod utility or chmod() function, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The terminal changed by mesg is that associated with the
standard input, output, or error, rather than the
controlling terminal for the session. This is because users
logged in <br>
more than once should be able to change any of their login
terminals without having to stop the job running in those
sessions. This is not a security problem involving the
termi&acirc; <br>
nals of other users because appropriate privileges would be
required to affect the terminal of another user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method of checking each of
the first three file descriptors in sequence until a
terminal is found was adopted from System V.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file /dev/tty is not
specified for the terminal device because it was thought to
be too restrictive. Typical environment changes for the n
operand are that write permissions <br>
are removed for others and group from the appropriate
device. It was decided to leave the actual description of
what is done as unspecified because of potential differences
<br>
between implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format for standard output
is unspecified because of differences between historical
implementations. This output is generally not useful to
shell scripts (they can use the <br>
exit status), so exact parsing of the output is
unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
