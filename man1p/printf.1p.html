PRINTF(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
printf - write formatted output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
printf format[argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The printf utility shall write formatted operands to the
standard output. The argument operands shall be formatted
under control of the format operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format A string describing the
format to use to write the remaining operands. See the
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
The strings to be written to standard output, under the
control of format. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of printf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for numeric
formatting. It shall affect the format of numbers written
using the e, E, f, g, and G conversion specifier characters
(if supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The format operand shall be used as the format string
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 5, File Format Notation with the
following excep&acirc; <br>
tions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A &lt;space&gt; in the format
string, in any context other than a flag of a conversion
specification, shall be treated as an ordinary character
that is copied to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. A &rsquo; &rsquo; character
in the format string shall be treated as a &rsquo; &rsquo;
character, not as a &lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. In addition to the escape
sequences shown in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 5, File&rsquo;, &rsquo;&rsquo;, Format
Notation ( &rsquo;\&rsquo;, &rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;,,
&rsquo;0, &rsquo; <br>
&rsquo;, &quot;dd&quot;, where ddd is a one, two, or
three-digit octal number, shall be written as a byte with
the numeric value specified by the octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The implementation shall not
precede or follow output from the d or u conversion
specifiers with &lt;blank&gt;s not specified by the format
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The implementation shall not
precede output from the o conversion specifier with zeros
not specified by the format operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The e, E, f, g, and G
conversion specifiers need not be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. An additional conversion
specifier character, b, shall be supported as follows. The
argument shall be taken to be a string that may contain
backslash-escape sequences. The <br>
following backslash-escape sequences shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The escape sequences listed in
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
5, File Format Notation (&rsquo;, &rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;,
&rsquo;\&rsquo;, &rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;,, &rsquo;0, &rsquo;
<br>
which shall be converted to the characters they
represent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* &quot; ddd&quot;, where ddd is
a zero, one, two, or three-digit octal number that shall be
converted to a byte with the numeric value specified by the
octal number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* sequence &rsquo; any
additional characters in the format operand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interpretation of a
backslash followed by any other sequence of characters is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bytes from the converted string
shall be written until the end of the string or the number
of bytes indicated by the precision specification is
reached. If the precision is omit&acirc; <br>
ted, it shall be taken to be infinite, so all bytes up to
the end of the converted string shall be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. For each conversion
specification that consumes an argument, the next argument
operand shall be evaluated and converted to the appropriate
type for the conversion as speci&acirc; <br>
fied below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. The format operand shall be
reused as often as necessary to satisfy the argument
operands. Any extra c or s conversion specifiers shall be
evaluated as if a null string argu&acirc; <br>
ment were supplied; other extra conversion specifications
shall be evaluated as if a zero argument were supplied. If
the format operand contains no conversion specifications
<br>
and argument operands are present, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. If a character sequence in
the format operand begins with a &rsquo;%&rsquo; character,
but does not form a valid conversion specification, the
behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument operands shall be
treated as strings if the corresponding conversion specifier
is b, c, or s ; otherwise, it shall be evaluated as a C
constant, as described by the <br>
ISO C standard, with the following extensions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A leading plus or minus sign
shall be allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the leading character is a
single-quote or double-quote, the value shall be the numeric
value in the underlying codeset of the character following
the single-quote or dou&acirc; <br>
ble-quote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an argument operand cannot be
completely converted into an internal value appropriate to
the corresponding conversion specification, a diagnostic
message shall be written to <br>
standard error and the utility shall not exit with a zero
exit status, but shall continue processing any remaining
operands and shall write the value accumulated at the time
the <br>
error was detected to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not considered an error if
an argument operand is not completely used for a c or s
conversion or if a string operand&rsquo;s first or second
character is used to get the numeric <br>
value of a character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The floating-point formatting conversion specifications of
printf() are not required because all arithmetic in the
shell is integer arithmetic. The awk utility performs
float&acirc; <br>
ing-point calculations and provides its own printf function.
The bc utility can perform arbitrary-precision
floating-point arithmetic, but does not provide extensive
formatting <br>
capabilities. (This printf utility cannot really be used to
format bc output; it does not support arbitrary precision.)
Implementations are encouraged to support the floating- <br>
point conversions as an extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this printf utility,
like the printf() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 on which it is based, makes
no special provision for <br>
dealing with multi-byte characters when using the %c
conversion specification or when a precision is specified in
a %b or %s conversion specification. Applications should be
<br>
extremely cautious using either of these features when there
are multi-byte characters in the character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No provision is made in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 which allows field widths and
precisions to be specified as &rsquo;*&rsquo; since the
&rsquo;*&rsquo; can be replaced directly in the format <br>
operand using shell variable substitution. Implementations
can also provide this feature as an extension if they so
choose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hexadecimal character constants
as defined in the ISO C standard are not recognized in the
format operand because there is no consistent way to detect
the end of the constant. <br>
Octal character constants are limited to, at most, three
octal digits, but hexadecimal character constants are only
terminated by a non-hex-digit character. In the ISO C
stan&acirc; <br>
dard, the &quot;##&quot; concatenation operator can be used
to terminate a constant and follow it with a hexadecimal
character to be written. In the shell, concatenation occurs
before the <br>
printf utility has a chance to parse the end of the
hexadecimal constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The %b conversion specification
is not part of the ISO C standard; it has been added here as
a portable way to process backslash escapes expanded in
string operands as provided <br>
by the echo utility. See also the APPLICATION USAGE section
of echo for ways to use printf as a replacement for all of
the traditional versions of the echo utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an argument cannot be parsed
correctly for the corresponding conversion specification,
the printf utility is required to report an error. Thus,
overflow and extraneous charac&acirc; <br>
ters at the end of an argument being used for a numeric
conversion shall be reported as errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To alert the user and then print and read a series of
prompts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;Please fill in the
following: 0ame: &quot; <br>
read name <br>
printf &quot;Phone number: &quot; <br>
read phone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To read out a list of right and
wrong answers from a file, calculate the percentage
correctly, and print them out. The numbers are
right-justified and separated by a single <br>
&lt;tab&gt;. The percentage is written to one decimal place
of accuracy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while read right wrong ; do <br>
percent=$(echo
&quot;scale=1;($right*100)/($right+$wrong)&quot; | bc) <br>
printf &quot;%2d right%2d wrong(%s%%)0 $right $wrong
$percent <br>
done &lt; database_file <br>
The command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;%5d%4d0 1 21 321
4321 54321</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 21 <br>
3214321 <br>
54321 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the format operand is
used three times to print all of the given strings and that
a &rsquo;0&rsquo; was supplied by printf to satisfy the last
%4d conversion specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The printf utility is required
to notify the user when conversion errors are detected while
producing numeric output; thus, the following results would
be expected on an imple&acirc; <br>
mentation with 32-bit twos-complement integers when %d is
specified as the format operand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument Output Diagnostic
Output <br>
5a 5 printf: &quot;5a&quot; not completely converted <br>
9999999999 2147483647 printf: &quot;9999999999&quot;
arithmetic overflow <br>
-9999999999 -2147483648 printf: &quot;-9999999999&quot;
arithmetic overflow <br>
ABC 0 printf: &quot;ABC&quot; expected numeric value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The diagnostic message format is
not specified, but these examples convey the type of
information that should be reported. Note that the value
shown on standard output is what <br>
would be expected as the return value from the strtol()
function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001. A similar correspondence exists between %u
<br>
and strtoul() and %e, %f, and %g (if the implementation
supports floating-point conversions) and strtod().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a locale using the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard as the underlying codeset, the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;%d0 3 +3 -3
&acute;3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Numeric value of constant
3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Numeric value of constant
3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 Numeric value of constant
-3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">51 Numeric value of the
character &rsquo;3&rsquo; in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
codeset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">43 Numeric value of the
character &rsquo;+&rsquo; in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
codeset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">45 Numeric value of the
character &rsquo;-&rsquo; in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
codeset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in a locale with
multi-byte characters, the value of a character is intended
to be the value of the equivalent of the wchar_t
representation of the character as <br>
described in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The printf utility was added to provide functionality that
has historically been provided by echo. However, due to
irreconcilable differences in the various versions of echo
<br>
extant, the version has few special features, leaving those
to this new printf utility, which is based on one in the
Ninth Edition system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section
almost exactly matches the printf() function in the ISO C
standard, although it is described in terms of the file
format notation in the Base <br>
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 5, File
Format Notation.</p>
