<p>TOUCH(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual TOUCH(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
touch - change file access and modification times</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
touch [-acm][ -r ref_file| -t time] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The touch utility shall change the modification times,
access times, or both of files. The modification time shall
be equivalent to the value of the st_mtime member of the
stat <br>
structure for a file, as described in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001; the access time shall be
equivalent to the value of st_atime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time used can be specified
by the -t time option-argument, the corresponding time
fields of the file referenced by the -r ref_file
option-argument, or the date_time operand, <br>
as specified in the following sections. If none of these are
specified, touch shall use the current time (the value
returned by the equivalent of the time() function defined in
<br>
the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file operand, touch
shall perform actions equivalent to the following functions
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If file does not exist, a
creat() function call is made with the file operand used as
the path argument and the value of the bitwise-inclusive OR
of S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, <br>
S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH used as the mode
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The utime() function is
called with the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The file operand is used as
the path argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. The utimbuf structure members
actime and modtime are determined as described in the
OPTIONS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The touch utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Change the access time of
file. Do not change the modification time unless -m is also
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Do not create a specified
file if it does not exist. Do not write any diagnostic
messages concerning this condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Change the modification time
of file. Do not change the access time unless -a is also
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r ref_file <br>
Use the corresponding time of the file named by the pathname
ref_file instead of the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t time <br>
Use the specified time instead of the current time. The
option-argument shall be a decimal number of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where each two digits represents
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MM <br>
The month of the year [01,12].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DD <br>
The day of the month [01,31].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh <br>
The hour of the day [00,23].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mm <br>
The minute of the hour [00,59].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CC <br>
The first two digits of the year (the century).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YY <br>
The second two digits of the year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SS <br>
The second of the minute [00,60].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both CC and YY shall be
optional. If neither is given, the current year shall be
assumed. If YY is specified, but CC is not, CC shall be
derived as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If YY is: CC becomes: <br>
[69,99] 19 <br>
[00,68] 20</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: <br>
It is expected that in a future version of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 the default century inferred from a 2-digit year
will change. (This would apply to all commands accepting a
<br>
2-digit year as input.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting time shall be
affected by the value of the TZ environment variable. If the
resulting time value precedes the Epoch, touch shall exit
immediately with an error sta&acirc; <br>
tus. The range of valid times past the Epoch is
implementation-defined, but it shall extend to at least the
time 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 2038,
Coordinated Uni&acirc; <br>
versal Time. Some implementations may not be able to
represent dates beyond January 18, 2038, because they use
signed int as a time holder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The range for SS is [00,60]
rather than [00,59] because of leap seconds. If SS is 60,
and the resulting time, as affected by the TZ environment
variable, does not refer to a leap <br>
second, the resulting time shall be one second after a time
where SS is 59. If SS is not given a value, it is assumed to
be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the -a nor -m options
were specified, touch shall behave as if both the -a and -m
options were specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file whose
times shall be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of touch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone to be
used for interpreting the time option-argument. If TZ is
unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The utility executed
successfully and all requested changes were made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The interpretation of time is taken to be seconds since the
Epoch (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 4.14, Seconds Since the Epoch). It
should be <br>
noted that implementations conforming to the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 do not take leap
seconds into account when computing seconds since the Epoch.
When <br>
SS=60 is used, the resulting time always refers to 1 plus
seconds since the Epoch for a time when SS=59.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the -t time
option-argument specifies values in 1969, the access time
and modification time fields are defined in terms of seconds
since the Epoch (00:00:00 on 1 January <br>
1970 UTC). Therefore, depending on the value of TZ when
touch is run, there is never more than a few valid hours in
1969 and there need not be any valid times in 1969.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One ambiguous situation occurs
if -t time is not specified, -r ref_file is not specified,
and the first operand is an eight or ten-digit decimal
number. A portable script can <br>
avoid this problem by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch -- file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch ./file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The functionality of touch is described almost entirely
through references to functions in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. In this way, there is no
duplica&acirc; <br>
tion of effort required for describing such side effects as
the relationship of user IDs to the user database,
permissions, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some significant
differences between the touch utility in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 and those in System V and BSD systems. They
are upwards-compatible for <br>
historical applications from both implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. In System V, an ambiguity
exists when a pathname that is a decimal number leads the
operands; it is treated as a time value. In BSD, no time
value is allowed; files may only <br>
be touched to the current time. The -t time construct solves
these problems for future conforming applications (note that
the -t option is not historical practice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The inclusion of the century
digits, CC, is also new. Note that a ten-digit time value is
treated as if YY, and not CC, were specified. The caveat
about the range of dates <br>
following the Epoch was included as recognition that some
implementations are not able to represent dates beyond 18
January 2038 because they use signed int as a time
holder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option was added because
several comments requested this capability. This option was
named -f in an early proposal, but was changed because the
-f option is used in the <br>
BSD version of touch with a different meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least one historical
implementation of touch incremented the exit code if -c was
specified and the file did not exist. This volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 requires exit status <br>
zero if no errors occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
Applications should use the -r or -t options.</p>
