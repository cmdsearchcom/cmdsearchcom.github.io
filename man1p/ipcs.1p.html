<p>IPCS(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual IPCS(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipcs - report XSI interprocess communication facilities
status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipcs [-qms][-a | -bcopt]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ipcs utility shall write information about active
interprocess communication facilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without options, information
shall be written in short format for message queues, shared
memory segments, and semaphore sets that are currently
active in the system. Otherwise, <br>
the information that is displayed is controlled by the
options specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ipcs facility supports the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ipcs utility accepts the
following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Write information about
active message queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Write information about
active shared memory segments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Write information about
active semaphore sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -q, -m, or -s are specified,
only information about those facilities shall be written. If
none of these three are specified, information about all
three shall be written sub&acirc; <br>
ject to the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Use all print options. (This
is a shorthand notation for -b, -c, -o, -p, and -t.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Write information on maximum
allowable size. (Maximum number of bytes in messages on
queue for message queues, size of segments for shared
memory, and number of semaphores <br>
in each set for semaphores.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Write creator&rsquo;s user
name and group name; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Write information on
outstanding usage. (Number of messages on queue and total
number of bytes in messages on queue for message queues, and
number of processes attached to <br>
shared memory segments.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Write process number
information. (Process ID of the last process to send a
message and process ID of the last process to receive a
message on message queues, process ID <br>
of the creating process, and process ID of the last process
to attach or detach on shared memory segments.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Write time information. (Time
of the last control operation that changed the access
permissions for all facilities, time of the last msgsnd()
and msgrcv() operations on <br>
message queues, time of the last shmat() and shmdt()
operations on shared memory, and time of the last semop()
operation on semaphores.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
* The group database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The user database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ipcs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone for
the date and time strings written by ipcs. If TZ is unset or
null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
An introductory line shall be written with the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;IPC status from %s as of
%s0, &lt;source&gt;, &lt;date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;source&gt; indicates
the source used to gather the statistics and &lt;date&gt; is
the information that would be produced by the date command
when invoked in the POSIX locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ipcs utility then shall
create up to three reports depending upon the -q, -m, and -s
options. The first report shall indicate the status of
message queues, the second report <br>
shall indicate the status of shared memory segments, and the
third report shall indicate the status of semaphore
sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the corresponding facility is
not installed or has not been used since the last reboot,
then the report shall be written out in the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s facility not in
system.0, &lt;facility&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;facility&gt; is
Message Queue, Shared Memory, or Semaphore, as appropriate.
If the facility has been installed and has been used since
the last reboot, column headings sepa&acirc; <br>
rated by one or more spaces and followed by a
&lt;newline&gt; shall be written as indicated below followed
by the facility name written out using the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s:0, &lt;facility&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;facility&gt; is
Message Queues, Shared Memory, or Semaphores, as
appropriate. On the second and third reports the column
headings need not be written if the last column head&acirc;
<br>
ings written already provide column headings for all
information in that report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The column headings provided in
the first column below and the meaning of the information in
those columns shall be given in order below; the letters in
parentheses indicate the <br>
options that shall cause the corresponding column to appear;
&quot;all&quot; means that the column shall always appear.
Each column is separated by one or more &lt;space&gt;s. Note
that these <br>
options only determine what information is provided for each
report; they do not determine which reports are written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T (all) <br>
Type of facility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q <br>
Message queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m <br>
Shared memory segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s <br>
Semaphore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This field is a single character
written using the format %c .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID (all) <br>
The identifier for the facility entry. This field shall be
written using the format %d .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY (all) <br>
The key used as an argument to msgget(), semget(), or
shmget() to create the facility entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: <br>
The key of a shared memory segment is changed to IPC_PRIVATE
when the segment has been removed until all processes
attached to the segment detach it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This field shall be written
using the format 0x%x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODE (all) <br>
The facility access modes and flags. The mode shall consist
of 11 characters that are interpreted as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first character shall
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S <br>
If a process is waiting on a msgsnd() operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- <br>
If the above is not true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second character shall
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R <br>
If a process is waiting on a msgrcv() operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C or - <br>
If the associated shared memory segment is to be cleared
when the first attach operation is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- <br>
If none of the above is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next nine characters shall
be interpreted as three sets of three bits each. The first
set refers to the owner&rsquo;s permissions; the next to
permissions of others in the user&acirc; <br>
group of the facility entry; and the last to all others.
Within each set, the first character indicates permission to
read, the second character indicates permission to write or
<br>
alter the facility entry, and the last character is a minus
sign ( &rsquo;-&rsquo; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permissions shall be
indicated as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r <br>
If read permission is granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w <br>
If write permission is granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a <br>
If alter permission is granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- <br>
If the indicated permission is not granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first character following
the permissions specifies if there is an alternate or
additional access control method associated with the
facility. If there is no alternate or <br>
additional access control method associated with the
facility, a single &lt;space&gt; shall be written;
otherwise, another printable character is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OWNER (all) <br>
The user name of the owner of the facility entry. If the
user name of the owner is found in the user database, at
least the first eight column positions of the name shall

be only written out for message queues:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATOR (a,c) <br>
The user name of the creator of the facility entry. If the
user name of the creator is found in the user database, at
