<p>SET(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual SET(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
set - set or unset options and positional parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
set [-abCefmnuvx][-h][-o option][argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set [+abCefmnuvx][+h][+o
option][argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -- [argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set +o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If no options or arguments are specified, set shall write
the names and values of all shell variables in the collation
sequence of the current locale. Each name shall start on a
<br>
separate line, using the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s=%s0, &lt;name&gt;,
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value string shall be
written with appropriate quoting; see the description of
shell quoting in Quoting . The output shall be suitable for
reinput to the shell, setting or <br>
resetting, as far as possible, the variables that are
currently set; read-only variables cannot be reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When options are specified, they
shall set or unset attributes of the shell, as described
below. When arguments are specified, they cause positional
parameters to be set or <br>
unset, as described below. Setting or unsetting attributes
and positional parameters are not necessarily related
actions, but they can be combined in a single invocation of
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set special built-in shall
support the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines except that options
can be specified with <br>
either a leading hyphen (meaning enable the option) or plus
sign (meaning disable it) unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations shall support
the options in the following list in both their hyphen and
plus-sign forms. These options can also be specified as
options to sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a When this option is on, the
export attribute shall be set for each variable to which an
assignment is performed; see the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, <br>
Section 4.21, Variable Assignment. If the assignment
precedes a utility name in a command, the export attribute
shall not persist in the current execution environment <br>
after the utility completes, with the exception that
preceding one of the special built-in utilities causes the
export attribute to persist after the built-in has
com&acirc; <br>
pleted. If the assignment does not precede a utility name in
the command, or if the assignment is a result of the
operation of the getopts or read utilities, the export <br>
attribute shall persist until the variable is unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b This option shall be
supported if the implementation supports the User
Portability Utilities option. It shall cause the shell to
notify the user asynchronously of back&acirc; <br>
ground job completions. The following message is written to
standard error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;[%d]%c %s%s0,
&lt;job-number&gt;, &lt;current&gt;, &lt;status&gt;,
&lt;job-name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the fields shall be as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;current&gt; <br>
The character &rsquo;+&rsquo; identifies the job that would
be used as a default for the fg or bg utilities; this job
can also be specified using the job_id &quot;%+&quot; or
&quot;%%&quot; . The charac&acirc; <br>
ter &rsquo;-&rsquo; identifies the job that would become the
default if the current default job were to exit; this job
can also be specified using the job_id &quot;%-&quot; . For
other jobs, <br>
this field is a &lt;space&gt;. At most one job can be
identified with &rsquo;+&rsquo; and at most one job can be
identified with &rsquo;-&rsquo; . If there is any suspended
job, then the current job <br>
shall be a suspended job. If there are at least two
suspended jobs, then the previous job also shall be a
suspended job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;job-number&gt; <br>
A number that can be used to identify the process group to
the wait, fg, bg, and kill utilities. Using these utilities,
the job can be identified by prefixing the job num&acirc;
<br>
ber with &rsquo;%&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;status&gt; <br>
Unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;job-name&gt; <br>
Unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the shell notifies the user
a job has been completed, it may remove the job&rsquo;s
process ID from the list of those known in the current shell
execution environment; see Asyn&acirc; <br>
chronous Lists . Asynchronous notification shall not be
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C (Uppercase C.) Prevent
existing files from being overwritten by the shell&rsquo;s
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; redirection operator (see Redirecting
Output ); the &quot;&gt;|&quot; redirection operator shall
over&acirc; <br>
ride this noclobber option for an individual file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e When this option is on, if a
simple command fails for any of the reasons listed in
Consequences of Shell Errors or returns an exit status value
&gt;0, and is not part of the <br>
compound list following a while, until, or if keyword, and
is not a part of an AND or OR list, and is not a pipeline
preceded by the ! reserved word, then the shell shall <br>
immediately exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f The shell shall disable
pathname expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Locate and remember utilities
invoked by functions as those functions are defined (the
utilities are normally located when the function is
executed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m This option shall be
supported if the implementation supports the User
Portability Utilities option. All jobs shall be run in their
own process groups. Immediately before <br>
the shell issues a prompt after completion of the background
job, a message reporting the exit status of the background
job shall be written to standard error. If a fore&acirc;
<br>
ground job stops, the shell shall write a message to
standard error to that effect, formatted as described by the
jobs utility. In addition, if a job changes status other
<br>
than exiting (for example, if it stops for input or output
or is stopped by a SIGSTOP signal), the shell shall write a
similar message immediately prior to writing the <br>
next prompt. This option is enabled by default for
interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The shell shall read commands
but does not execute them; this can be used to check for
shell script syntax errors. An interactive shell may ignore
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Write the current settings of
the options to standard output in an unspecified format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+o Write the current option
settings to standard output in a format that is suitable for
reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same
options settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is supported if the
system supports the User Portability Utilities option. It
shall set various options, many of which shall be equivalent
to the single option <br>
letters. The following values of option shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allexport <br>
Equivalent to -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errexit <br>
Equivalent to -e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreeof <br>
Prevent an interactive shell from exiting on end-of-file.
This setting prevents accidental logouts when
&lt;control&gt;-D is entered. A user shall explicitly exit
to leave the <br>
interactive shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor <br>
Equivalent to -m. This option is supported if the system
supports the User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noclobber <br>
Equivalent to -C (uppercase C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noglob <br>
Equivalent to -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noexec <br>
Equivalent to -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nolog <br>
Prevent the entry of function definitions into the command
history; see Command History List .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify <br>
Equivalent to -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nounset <br>
Equivalent to -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
Equivalent to -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vi <br>
Allow shell command line editing using the built-in vi
editor. Enabling vi mode shall disable any other command
line editing mode provided as an implementation
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It need not be possible to set
vi mode on for certain block-mode terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xtrace <br>
Equivalent to -x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u The shell shall write a
message to standard error when it tries to expand a variable
that is not set and immediately exit. An interactive shell
shall not exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v The shell shall write its
input to standard error as it is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The shell shall write to
standard error a trace for each command after it expands the
command and before it executes it. It is unspecified whether
the command that turns <br>
tracing off is traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default for all these
options shall be off (unset) unless stated otherwise in the
description of the option or unless the shell was invoked
with them on; see sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining arguments shall be
assigned in order to the positional parameters. The special
parameter &rsquo;#&rsquo; shall be set to reflect the number
of positional parameters. All posi&acirc; <br>
tional parameters shall be unset before any new values are
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special argument
&quot;--&quot; immediately following the set command name
can be used to delimit the arguments if the first argument
begins with &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;, or to
prevent inadvertent <br>
listing of all shell variables when there are no arguments.
The command set -- without argument shall unset all
positional parameters and set the special parameter
&rsquo;#&rsquo; to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Write out all variables and their values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set $1, $2, and $3 and set
&quot;$#&quot; to 3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set c a b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turn on the -x and -v
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -xv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unset all positional
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set $1 to the value of x, even
if it begins with &rsquo;-&rsquo; or &rsquo;+&rsquo; :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -- &quot;$x&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the positional parameters to
the expansion of x, even if x expands with a leading
&rsquo;-&rsquo; or &rsquo;+&rsquo; :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -- $x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The set -- form is listed specifically in the SYNOPSIS even
though this usage is implied by the Utility Syntax
Guidelines. The explanation of this feature removes any
ambiguity <br>
about whether the set -- form might be misinterpreted as
being equivalent to set without any options or arguments.
The functionality of this form has been adopted from the
Korn&acirc; <br>
Shell. In System V, set -- only unsets parameters if there
is at least one argument; the only way to unset all
parameters is to use shift. Using the KornShell version
should not <br>
affect System V scripts because there should be no reason to
issue it without arguments deliberately; if it were issued
as, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -- &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and there were in fact no
arguments resulting from &quot;$@&quot;, unsetting the
parameters would have no result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set + form in early
proposals was omitted as being an unnecessary duplication of
set alone and not widespread historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The noclobber option was changed
to allow set -C as well as the set -o noclobber option. The
single-letter version was added so that the historical
&quot;$-&quot; paradigm would not be <br>
broken; see Special Parameters .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h flag is related to
command name hashing and is only required on XSI-conformant
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following set flags were
omitted intentionally with the following rationale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k The -k flag was originally
added by the author of the Bourne shell to make it easier
for users of pre-release versions of the shell. In early
versions of the Bourne shell <br>
the construct set name= value had to be used to assign
values to shell variables. The problem with -k is that the
behavior affects parsing, virtually precluding writing <br>
any compilers. To explain the behavior of -k, it is
necessary to describe the parsing algorithm, which is
implementation-defined. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -k; echo name=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -k <br>
echo name=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">behave differently. The
interaction with functions is even more complex. What is
more, the -k flag is never needed, since the command line
could have been reordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The -t flag is hard to
specify and almost never used. The only known use could be
done with here-documents. Moreover, the behavior with ksh
and sh differs. The reference <br>
page says that it exits after reading and executing one
command. What is one command? If the input is date; date, sh
executes both date commands while ksh does only the <br>
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consideration was given to
rewriting set to simplify its confusing syntax. A specific
suggestion was that the unset utility should be used to
unset options instead of using the <br>
non- getopt() -able + option syntax. However, the conclusion
was reached that the historical practice of using + option
was satisfactory and that there was no compelling reason
<br>
to modify such widespread historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o option was adopted from
the KornShell to address user needs. In addition to its
generally friendly interface, -o is needed to provide the vi
command line editing mode, for <br>
which historical practice yields no single-letter option
name. (Although it might have been possible to invent such a
letter, it was recognized that other editing modes would be
<br>
developed and -o provides ample name space for describing
such extensions.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations are
inconsistent in the format used for -o option status
reporting. The +o format without an option-argument was
added to allow portable access to the <br>
options that can be saved and then later restored using, for
instance, a dot script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, sh did trace the
command set +x, but ksh did not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ignoreeof setting prevents
accidental logouts when the end-of-file character (typically
&lt;control&gt;-D) is entered. A user shall explicitly exit
to leave the interactive shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set -m option was added to
apply only to the UPE because it applies primarily to
interactive use, not shell script applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ability to do asynchronous
notification became available in the 1988 version of the
KornShell. To have it occur, the user had to issue the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &quot;jobs -n&quot; CLD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C shell provides two
different levels of an asynchronous notification capability.
The environment variable notify is analogous to what is done
in set -b or set -o notify. <br>
When set, it notifies the user immediately of background job
completions. When unset, this capability is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other notification ability
comes through the built-in utility notify. The syntax
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify [%job ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By issuing notify with no
operands, it causes the C shell to notify the user
asynchronously when the state of the current job changes. If
given operands, notify asynchronously <br>
informs the user of changes in the states of the specified
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add asynchronous notification
to the POSIX shell, neither the KornShell extensions to
trap, nor the C shell notify environment variable seemed
appropriate ( notify is not a <br>
proper POSIX environment variable name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set -b option was selected
as a compromise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The notify built-in was
considered to have more functionality than was required for
simple asynchronous notification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
