When an asynchronous list (see <i>Asynchronous Lists</i> ) is started by the
  shell, the process ID of the last command in each element of the asynchronous
  list shall become known in the current shell execution environment; see
  <i>Shell Execution Environment</i> .
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <i>wait</i> utility is invoked with no operands, it shall wait until all
  process IDs known to the invoking shell have terminated and exit with a zero
  exit status.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If one or more <i>pid</i> operands are specified that represent known process
  IDs, the <i>wait</i> utility shall wait until all of them have terminated. If
  one or more <i>pid</i> operands are specified that represent unknown process
  IDs, <i>wait</i> shall treat them as if they were known process IDs that
  exited with exit status 127. The exit status returned by the <i>wait</i>
  utility shall be the exit status of the process requested by the last
  <i>pid</i> operand.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The known process IDs are applicable only for invocations of <i>wait</i> in the
  current shell execution environment.

If one or more operands were specified, all of them have terminated or were not

  shall be greater than 128 and shall be distinct from the exit status generated
  by other signals, but the exact value is unspecified. (See the <i>kill</i>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
On most implementations, <i>wait</i> is a shell built-in. If it is called in a
  subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
  following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>(wait)</b>
<b>nohup wait ...</b>
<b>find . -exec wait ... \;</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
it returns immediately because there are no known process IDs to wait for in
  those environments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Historical implementations of interactive shells have discarded the exit status
  of terminated background processes before each shell prompt. Therefore, the
  status of background processes was usually lost unless it terminated while
  <i>wait</i> was waiting for it. This could be a serious problem when a job
  that was expected to run for a long time actually terminated quickly with a
  syntax or initialization error because the exit status returned was usually
  zero if the requested process ID was not found. This volume of
  IEEE&#x00A0;Std&#x00A0;1003.1-2001 requires the implementation to keep the
  status of terminated jobs available until the status is requested, so that
  scripts like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>j1&amp;</b>
<b>p1=$!</b>
<b>j2&amp;</b>
<b>wait $p1</b>
<b>echo Job 1 exited with status $?</b>
<b>wait $!</b>
<b>echo Job 2 exited with status $?</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
work without losing status on any of the jobs. The shell is allowed to discard
  the status of any process if it determines that the application cannot get the
  process ID for that process from the shell. It is also required to remember
  only {CHILD_MAX} number of processes in this way. Since the only way to get
  the process ID from the shell is by using the <b>'!'</b> shell parameter, the
  shell is allowed to discard the status of an asynchronous list if
  <b>&quot;$!&quot;</b> was not referenced before another asynchronous list was
  started. (This means that the shell only has to keep the status of the last
  asynchronous list started if the application did not reference
  <b>&quot;$!&quot;</b> . If the implementation of the shell is smart enough to
  determine that a reference to <b>&quot;$!&quot;</b> was not saved anywhere
  that the application can retrieve it later, it can use this information to
  trim the list of saved information. Note also that a successful call to
  <i>wait</i> with no operands discards the exit status of all asynchronous
  lists.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the exit status of <i>wait</i> is greater than 128, there is no way for the
  application to know if the waited-for process exited with that value or was
  killed by a signal. Since most utilities exit with small values, there is
  seldom any ambiguity. Even in the ambiguous cases, most applications just need
  to know that the asynchronous job failed; it does not matter whether it
  detected an error and failed or was killed and did not complete its job
  normally.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Although the exact value used when a process is terminated by a signal is
  unspecified, if it is known that a signal terminated a process, a script can
  still reliably determine which signal by using <i>kill</i> as shown by the
  following script:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>sleep 1000&amp;</b>
<b>pid=$!</b>
<b>kill -kill $pid</b>
<b>wait $pid</b>
<b>echo $pid was terminated by a SIG$(kill -l $?) signal.</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the following sequence of commands is run in less than 31 seconds:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>sleep 257 | sleep 31 &amp;</b>
<b>jobs -l %%</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
either of the following commands returns the exit status of the second
  <i>sleep</i> in the pipeline:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>wait</b> <i>&lt;pid of sleep 31&gt;</i><b>wait %%</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="selflink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
The description of <i>wait</i> does not refer to the <i>waitpid</i>() function
  from the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#x00A0;Std&#x00A0;1003.1-2001
  because that would needlessly overspecify this interface. However, the wording
  means that <i>wait</i> is required to wait for an explicit process when it is
  given an argument so that the status information of other processes is not
  consumed. Historical implementations use the <i>wait</i>() function defined in
  the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#x00A0;Std&#x00A0;1003.1-2001 until
  <i>wait</i>() returns the requested process ID or finds that the requested
  process does not exist. Because this means that a shell script could not
  reliably get the status of all background children if a second background job
  was ever started before the first job finished, it is recommended that the
  <i>wait</i> utility use a method such as the functionality provided by the
  <i>waitpid</i>() function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ability to wait for multiple <i>pid</i> operands was adopted from the
  KornShell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This new functionality was added because it is needed to determine the exit
  status of any asynchronous list accurately. The only compatibility problem
  that this change creates is for a script like
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>while sleep 60 do</b>
<b>    job&amp; echo Job started $(date) as $!  done</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which causes the shell to monitor all of the jobs started until the script
  terminates or runs out of memory. This would not be a problem if the loop did
  not reference <b>&quot;$!&quot;</b> or if the script would occasionally
  <i>wait</i> for jobs it started.
