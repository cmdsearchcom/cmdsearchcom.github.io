<p>TAIL(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual TAIL(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tail - copy the last part of a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tail [-f][ -c number| -n number][file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The tail utility shall copy its input file to the standard
output beginning at a designated place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copying shall begin at the point
in the file indicated by the -c number or -n number options.
The option-argument number shall be counted in units of
lines or bytes, according to <br>
the options -n and -c. Both line and byte counts start from
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tails relative to the end of the
file may be saved in an internal buffer, and thus may be
limited in length. Such a buffer, if any, shall be no
smaller than {LINE_MAX}*10 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The tail utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c number <br>
The application shall ensure that the number option-argument
is a decimal integer whose sign affects the location in the
file, measured in bytes, to begin the copying:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sign Copying Starts <br>
+ Relative to the beginning of the file. <br>
- Relative to the end of the file. <br>
none Relative to the end of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The origin for counting shall be
1; that is, -c +1 represents the first byte of the file, -c
-1 the last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f If the input file is a
regular file or if the file operand specifies a FIFO, do not
terminate after the last line of the input file has been
copied, but read and copy fur&acirc; <br>
ther bytes from the input file when they become available.
If no file operand is specified and standard input is a
pipe, the -f option shall be ignored. If the input file <br>
is not a FIFO, pipe, or regular file, it is unspecified
whether or not the -f option shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n number <br>
This option shall be equivalent to -c number, except the
starting location in the file shall be measured in lines
instead of bytes. The origin for counting shall be 1; <br>
that is, -n +1 represents the first line of the file, -n -1
the last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither -c nor -n is
specified, -n 10 shall be assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of an input
file. If no file operands are specified, the standard input
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
If the -c option is specified, the input file can contain
arbitrary data; otherwise, the input file shall be a text
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of tail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The designated portion of the input file shall be written to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The -c option should be used with caution when the input is
a text file containing multi-byte characters; it may produce
output that does not start on a character boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the input file to tail
can be any type, the results might not be what would be
expected on some character special device files or on file
types not described by the Sys&acirc; <br>
tem Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Since this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not specify the block
size used when doing input, tail need not read all of the
data <br>
from devices that only perform block transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The -f option can be used to monitor the growth of a file
that is being written by some other process. For example,
the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tail -f fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints the last ten lines of the
file fred, followed by any lines that are appended to fred
between the time tail is initiated and killed. As another
example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tail -f -c 15 fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints the last 15 bytes of the
file fred, followed by any bytes that are appended to fred
between the time tail is initiated and killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
This version of tail was created to allow conformance to the
Utility Syntax Guidelines. The historical -b option was
omitted because of the general non-portability of
block-sized <br>
units of text. The -c option historically meant
&quot;characters&quot;, but this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 indicates that it means &quot;bytes&quot;. This
was selected to allow reasonable <br>
implementations when multi-byte characters are possible; it
was not named -b to avoid confusion with the historical
-b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The origin of counting both
lines and bytes is 1, matching all widespread historical
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restriction on the internal
buffer is a compromise between the historical System V
implementation of 4096 bytes and the BSD 32768 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option has been
implemented as a loop that sleeps for 1 second and copies
any bytes that are available. This is sufficient, but if
more efficient methods of determining <br>
when new data are available are developed, implementations
are encouraged to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical documentation
indicates that tail ignores the -f option if the input file
is a pipe (pipe and FIFO on systems that support FIFOs). On
BSD-based systems, this has been <br>
true; on System V-based systems, this was true when input
was taken from standard input, but it did not ignore the -f
flag if a FIFO was named as the file operand. Since the -f
<br>
option is not useful on pipes and all historical
implementations ignore -f if no file operand is specified
and standard input is a pipe, this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 <br>
requires this behavior. However, since the -f option is
useful on a FIFO, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 also
requires that if standard input is a FIFO or a FIFO is
named, <br>
the -f option shall not be ignored. Although historical
behavior does not ignore the -f option for other file types,
this is unspecified so that implementations are allowed to
<br>
ignore the -f option if it is known that the file cannot be
extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was changed to the current
form based on comments noting that -c was almost never used
without specifying a number and that there was no need to
specify -l if -n number was <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
