<p>TIME(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual TIME(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
time - time a simple command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
time [-p] utility [argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The time utility shall invoke the utility named by the
utility operand with arguments supplied as the argument
operands and write a message to standard error that lists
timing <br>
statistics for the utility. The message shall include the
following information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The elapsed (real) time
between invocation of utility and its termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The User CPU time, equivalent
to the sum of the tms_utime and tms_cutime fields returned
by the times() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 for the process in which utility is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The System CPU time,
equivalent to the sum of the tms_stime and tms_cstime fields
returned by the times() function for the process in which
utility is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The precision of the timing
shall be no less than the granularity defined for the size
of the clock tick unit on the system, but the results shall
be reported in terms of stan&acirc; <br>
dard time units (for example, 0.02 seconds, 00:00:00.02,
1m33.75s, 365.21 seconds), not numbers of clock ticks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When time is used as part of a
pipeline, the times reported are unspecified, except when it
is the sole command within a grouping command (see Grouping
Commands ) in that pipe&acirc; <br>
line. For example, the commands on the left are unspecified;
those on the right report on utilities a and c,
respectively:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time a | b | c { time a } | b |
c <br>
a | b | time c a | b | (time c)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The time utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Write the timing output to
standard error in the format shown in the STDERR
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utility <br>
The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If the utility
operand names any of the special built-in utilities in
Special Built-In Utilities, the results are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
Any string to be supplied as an argument when invoking the
utility named by the utility operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic and informative messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for numeric
formatting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the search path
that shall be used to locate the utility to be invoked; see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
8, Environment Vari&acirc; <br>
ables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used to write the timing
statistics. If -p is specified, the following format shall
be used in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;real %f0ser %f0ys %f0,
&lt;real seconds&gt;, &lt;user seconds&gt;, <br>
&lt;system seconds&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where each floating-point number
shall be expressed in seconds. The precision used may be
less than the default six digits of %f, but shall be
sufficiently precise to accommodate <br>
the size of the clock tick on the system (for example, if
there were 60 clock ticks per second, at least two digits
shall follow the radix character). The number of digits
fol&acirc; <br>
lowing the radix character shall be no less than one, even
if this always results in a trailing zero. The
implementation may append white space and additional
information follow&acirc; <br>
ing the format shown here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If the utility utility is invoked, the exit status of time
shall be the exit status of utility; otherwise, the time
utility shall exit with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1-125 An error occurred in the
time utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 The utility specified by
utility was found but could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 The utility specified by
utility could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The command, env, nice, nohup, time, and xargs utilities
have been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs
so that applications can distinguish &quot;failure to find a
util&acirc; <br>
ity&quot; from &quot;invoked utility exited with an error
indication&quot;. The value 127 was chosen because it is not
commonly used for other meanings; most utilities use small
values for <br>
&quot;normal error conditions&quot; and the values above 128
can be confused with termination due to receipt of a signal.
The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate
that the <br>
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differentiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is <br>
based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts
to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when
any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
It is frequently desirable to apply time to pipelines or
lists of commands. This can be done by placing pipelines and
command lists in a single file; this file can then be <br>
invoked as a utility, and the time applies to everything in
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the following
command can be used to apply time to a complex command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time sh -c
&rsquo;complex-command-line&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
When the time utility was originally proposed to be included
in the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard, questions were raised
about its suitability for inclusion on the grounds that it
<br>
was not useful for conforming applications,
specifically:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The underlying CPU definitions
from the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
are vague, so the numeric output could not be compared
accurately between systems or <br>
even between invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The creation of portable
benchmark programs was outside the scope this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, time does fit in the
scope of user portability. Human judgement can be applied to
the analysis of the output, and it could be very useful in
hands-on debugging of appli&acirc; <br>
cations or in providing subjective measures of system
performance. Hence it has been included in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default output format has
been left unspecified because historical implementations
differ greatly in their style of depicting this numeric
output. The -p option was invented <br>
to provide scripts with a common means of obtaining this
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the KornShell, time is a
shell reserved word that can be used to time an entire
pipeline, rather than just a simple command. The POSIX
definition has been worded to allow this <br>
implementation. Consideration was given to invalidating this
approach because of the historical model from the C shell
and System V shell. However, since the System V time <br>
utility historically has not produced accurate results in
pipeline timing (because the constituent processes are not
all owned by the same parent process, as allowed by POSIX),
<br>
it did not seem worthwhile to break historical KornShell
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term utility is used, rather
than command, to highlight the fact that shell compound
commands, pipelines, special built-ins, and so on, cannot be
used directly. However, <br>
utility includes user application programs and shell
scripts, not just the standard utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
