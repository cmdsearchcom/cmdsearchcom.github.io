<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The operands string1 and string2 (if specified) define two
arrays of characters. The constructs in the following list
can be used to specify characters or single-character
col&acirc; <br>
lating elements. If any of the constructs result in
multi-character collating elements, tr shall exclude,
without a diagnostic, those multi-character elements from
the resulting <br>
array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">character <br>
Any character not described by one of the conventions below
shall represent itself. O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tal sequences can be used to
represent characters with specific coded values. An octal
sequence shall consist of a backslash followed by the
longest sequence of one, <br>
two, or three-octal-digit characters (01234567). The
sequence shall cause the value whose encoding is represented
by the one, two, or three-digit octal integer to be <br>
placed into the array. If the size of a byte on the system
is greater than nine bits, the valid escape sequence used to
represent a byte is implementation-defined. Multi- <br>
byte characters require multiple, concatenated escape
sequences of this type, including the leading &rsquo;&acute;
for each byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The backslash-escape sequences
in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Table 5-1, Escape Sequences and Associated Actions (
&rsquo;\&rsquo;, &rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;,, &rsquo;0,&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo; shall be supported. The results of
using <br>
&rsquo; any other character, other than an octal digit,
following the backslash are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c-c In the POSIX locale, this
construct shall represent the range of collating elements
between the range endpoints (as long as neither endpoint is
an octal sequence of the <br>
form nlusive, as defined by the collation sequence. The
characters or collating elements in the range shall be
placed in the array in ascending collation <br>
sequence. If the second endpoint precedes the starting
endpoint in the collation sequence, it is unspecified
whether the range of collating elements is empty, or this
con&acirc; <br>
struct is treated as invalid. In locales other than the
POSIX locale, this construct has unspecified behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either or both of the range
endpoints are octal sequences of the form eific coded values
between the two range endpoints, inclu&acirc; <br>
sive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:class: <br>
Represents all characters belonging to the defined character
class, as defined by the current setting of the LC_CTYPE
locale category. The following character class names <br>
shall be accepted when specified in string1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alnum blank digit lower punct
upper <br>
alpha cntrl graph print space xdigit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, character class
expressions of the form [: name:] shall be recognized in
those locales where the name keyword has been given a
charclass definition in the LC_CTYPE <br>
category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When both the -d and -s options
are specified, any of the character class names shall be
accepted in string2. Otherwise, only character class names
lower or upper are valid in <br>
string2 and then only if the corresponding character class (
upper and lower, respectively) is specified in the same
relative position in string1. Such a specification shall be
<br>
interpreted as a request for case conversion. When [:
lower:] appears in string1 and [: upper:] appears in
string2, the arrays shall contain the characters from the
toupper map&acirc; <br>
ping in the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. When [:
upper:] appears in string1 and [: lower:] appears in
string2, the arrays shall contain the characters from the
<br>
tolower mapping in the LC_CTYPE category of the current
locale. The first character from each mapping pair shall be
in the array for string1 and the second character from each
<br>
mapping pair shall be in the array for string2 in the same
relative position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except for case conversion, the
characters specified by a character class expression shall
be placed in the array in an unspecified order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the name specified for class
does not define a valid character class in the current
locale, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=equiv= <br>
Represents all characters or collating elements belonging to
the same equivalence class as equiv, as defined by the
current setting of the LC_COLLATE locale category. An <br>
equivalence class expression shall be allowed only in
string1, or in string2 when it is being used by the combined
-d and -s options. The characters belonging to the <br>
equivalence class shall be placed in the array in an
unspecified order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x*n Represents n repeated
occurrences of the character x. Because this expression is
used to map multiple characters to one, it is only valid
when it occurs in string2. If n <br>
is omitted or is zero, it shall be interpreted as large
enough to extend the string2-based sequence to the length of
the string1-based sequence. If n has a leading zero, <br>
it shall be interpreted as an octal value. Otherwise, it
shall be interpreted as a decimal value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -d option is not
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Each input character found in
the array specified by string1 shall be replaced by the
character in the same relative position in the array
specified by string2. When the array <br>
specified by string2 is shorter that the one specified by
string1, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the -C option is specified,
the complements of the characters specified by string1 (the
set of all characters in the current character set, as
defined by the current set&acirc; <br>
ting of LC_CTYPE, except for those actually specified in the
string1 operand) shall be placed in the array in ascending
collation sequence, as defined by the current setting <br>
of LC_COLLATE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the -c option is specified,
the complement of the values specified by string1 shall be
placed in the array in ascending order by binary value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Because the order in which
characters specified by character class expressions or
equivalence class expressions is undefined, such expressions
should only be used if the <br>
intent is to map several characters into one. An exception
is case conversion, as described previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -d option is
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Input characters found in the
array specified by string1 shall be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* When the -C option is
specified with -d, all characters except those specified by
string1 shall be deleted. The contents of string2 are
ignored, unless the -s option is also <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* When the -c option is
specified with -d, all values except those specified by
string1 shall be deleted. The contents of string2 shall be
ignored, unless the -s option is also <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The same string cannot be used
for both the -d and the -s option; when both options are
specified, both string1 (used for deletion) and string2
(used for squeezing) shall be <br>
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -s option is specified,
after any deletions or translations have taken place,
repeated sequences of the same character shall be replaced
by one occurrence of the same <br>
character, if the character is found in the array specified
by the last operand. If the last operand contains a
character class, such as the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr -s
&rsquo;[:space:]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the last operand&rsquo;s array
shall contain all of the characters in that character class.
However, in a case conversion, as described previously, such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr -s &rsquo;[:upper:]&rsquo;
&rsquo;[:lower:]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the last operand&rsquo;s array
shall contain only those characters defined as the second
characters in each of the toupper or tolower character
pairs, as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty string used for string1
or string2 produces undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input was processed
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
If necessary, string1 and string2 can be quoted to avoid
pattern matching by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an ordinary digit
(representing itself) is to follow an octal sequence, the
octal sequence must use the full three digits to avoid
ambiguity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When string2 is shorter than
string1, a difference results between historical System V
and BSD systems. A BSD system pads string2 with the last
character found in string2. Thus, <br>
it is possible to do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr 0123456789 d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which would translate all digits
to the letter &rsquo;d&rsquo; . Since this area is
specifically unspecified in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, both the BSD and System V behaviors are <br>
allowed, but a conforming application cannot rely on the BSD
behavior. It would have to code the example in the following
way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr 0123456789
&rsquo;[d*]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be noted that, despite
similarities in appearance, the string operands used by tr
are not regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike some historical
implementations, this definition of the tr utility correctly
processes NUL characters in its input stream. NUL characters
can be stripped by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr -d &rsquo; 00&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following example creates a list of all words in
file1 one per line in file2, where a word is taken to be a
maximal string of letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr -cs &quot;[:alpha:]&quot;
&quot;[0]&quot; &lt;file1 &gt;file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The next example translates
all lowercase characters in file1 to uppercase and writes
the results to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr &quot;[:lower:]&quot;
&quot;[:upper:]&quot; &lt;file1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. This example uses an
equivalence class to identify accented variants of the base
character &rsquo;e&rsquo; in file1, which are stripped of
diacritical marks and written to file2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr &quot;[=e=]&quot; e &lt;file1
&gt;file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
In some early proposals, an explicit option -n was added to
disable the historical behavior of stripping NUL characters
from the input. It was considered that automatically <br>
stripping NUL characters from the input was not correct
functionality. However, the removal of -n in a later
proposal does not remove the requirement that tr correctly
process <br>
NUL characters in its input stream. NUL characters can be
stripped by using tr -d &rsquo; 00&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations of tr
differ widely in syntax and behavior. For example, the BSD
version has not needed the bracket characters for the
repetition sequence. The tr <br>
utility syntax is based more closely on the System V and
XPG3 model while attempting to accommodate historical BSD
implementations. In the case of the short string2 padding,
the <br>
decision was to unspecify the behavior and preserve System V
and XPG3 scripts, which might find difficulty with the BSD
method. The assumption was made that BSD users of tr have
<br>
to make accommodations to meet the syntax defined here.
Since it is possible to use the repetition sequence to
duplicate the desired behavior, whereas there is no simple
way to <br>
achieve the System V method, this was the correct, if not
desirable, approach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of octal values to
specify control characters, while having historical
precedents, is not portable. The introduction of escape
sequences for control characters should <br>
provide the necessary portability. It is recognized that
this may cause some historical scripts to break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal included
support for multi-character collating elements. It was
pointed out that, while tr does employ some syntactical
elements from REs, the aim of tr is <br>
quite different; ranges, for example, do not have a similar
meaning (&lsquo;&lsquo;any of the chars in the range
matches&quot;, versus &quot;translate each character in the
range to the output coun&acirc; <br>
terpart&quot;). As a result, the previously included support
for multi-character collating elements has been removed.
What remains are ranges in current collation order (to
support, <br>
for example, accented characters), character classes, and
equivalence classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In XPG3 the [: class:] and [=
equiv=] conventions are shown with double brackets, as in RE
syntax. However, tr does not implement RE principles; it
just borrows part of the syn&acirc; <br>
tax. Consequently, [: class:] and [= equiv=] should be
regarded as syntactical elements on a par with [ x* n],
which is not an RE bracket expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard developers will
consider changes to tr that allow it to translate characters
between different character encodings, or they will consider
providing a new utility to <br>
accomplish this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On historical System V systems,
a range expression requires enclosing square-brackets, such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr &rsquo;[a-z]&rsquo;
&rsquo;[A-Z]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, BSD-based systems did
not require the brackets, and this convention is used here
to avoid breaking large numbers of BSD scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr a-z A-Z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preceding System V script
will continue to work because the brackets, treated as
regular characters, are translated to themselves. However,
any System V script that relied on <br>
&quot;a-z&quot; representing the three characters
&rsquo;a&rsquo;, &rsquo;-&rsquo;, and &rsquo;z&rsquo; have
to be rewritten as &quot;az-&quot; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard
had a -c option that behaved similarly to the -C option, but
did not supply functionality equivalent to the -c option
specified in <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. This meant that historical practice of
being able to specify tr -d200-377 (which would delete all
bytes with the top bit set) would have no effect <br>
because, in the C locale, bytes with the values octal 200 to
octal 377 are not characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The earlier version also said
that octal sequences referred to collating elements and
could be placed adjacent to each other to specify multi-byte
characters. However, it was <br>
noted that this caused ambiguities because tr would not be
able to tell whether adjacent octal sequences were intending
to specify multi-byte characters or multiple single byte
<br>
characters. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies that octal
sequences always refer to single byte binary values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
