<p>FIND(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual FIND(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
find - find files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
find [-H | -L] path ... [operand_expression ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The find utility shall recursively descend the directory
hierarchy from each file specified by path, evaluating a
Boolean expression composed of the primaries described in
the <br>
OPERANDS section for each file encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The find utility shall be able
to descend to arbitrary depths in a file hierarchy and shall
not fail due to path length limitations (unless a path
operand specified by the appli&acirc; <br>
cation exceeds {PATH_MAX} requirements).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The find utility shall detect
infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited
directory that is an ancestor of the last file encountered.
When it detects an infinite loop, <br>
find shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and
shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The find utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Cause the file information
and file type evaluated for each symbolic link encountered
on the command line to be those of the file referenced by
the link, and not the link <br>
itself. If the referenced file does not exist, the file
information and type shall be for the link itself. File
information for all symbolic links not on the command line
<br>
shall be that of the link itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Cause the file information
and file type evaluated for each symbolic link to be those
of the file referenced by the link, and not the link
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
mutually-exclusive options -H and -L shall not be considered
an error. The last option specified shall determine the
behavior of the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path operand is a pathname
of a starting point in the directory hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first argument that starts
with a &rsquo;-&rsquo;, or is a &rsquo;!&rsquo; or a
&rsquo;(&rsquo;, and all subsequent arguments shall be
interpreted as an expression made up of the following
primaries and opera&acirc; <br>
tors. In the descriptions, wherever n is used as a primary
argument, it shall be interpreted as a decimal integer
optionally preceded by a plus ( &rsquo;+&rsquo; ) or minus (
&rsquo;-&rsquo; ) sign, as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+n More than n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Exactly n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Less than n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following primaries shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary shall evaluate as
true if the basename of the filename being examined matches
pattern using the pattern matching notation described in
Pattern Matching Nota&acirc; <br>
tion .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nouser <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a
user ID for which the getpwuid() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (or <br>
equivalent) returns NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nogroup <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a
group ID for which the getgrgid() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (or <br>
equivalent) returns NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xdev The primary shall always
evaluate as true; it shall cause find not to continue
descending past directories that have a different device ID
( st_dev, see the stat() func&acirc; <br>
tion defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001). If any -xdev primary is specified, it shall
apply to the entire expression even if the -xdev primary
<br>
would not normally be evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prune The primary shall always
evaluate as true; it shall cause find not to descend the
current pathname if it is a directory. If the -depth primary
is specified, the -prune <br>
primary shall have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-perm [-]mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode argument is used to
represent file mode bits. It shall be identical in format to
the symbolic_mode operand described in chmod(), and shall be
interpreted as fol&acirc; <br>
lows. To start, a template shall be assumed with all file
mode bits cleared. An op symbol of &rsquo;+&rsquo; shall set
the appropriate mode bits in the template; &rsquo;-&rsquo;
shall clear the <br>
appropriate bits; &rsquo;=&rsquo; shall set the appropriate
mode bits, without regard to the contents of process&rsquo;
file mode creation mask. The op symbol of &rsquo;-&rsquo;
cannot be the first <br>
character of mode; this avoids ambiguity with the optional
leading hyphen. Since the initial mode is all bits off,
there are not any symbolic modes that need to use
&rsquo;-&rsquo; as <br>
the first character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the hyphen is omitted, the
primary shall evaluate as true when the file permission bits
exactly match the value of the resulting template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if mode is prefixed
by a hyphen, the primary shall evaluate as true if at least
all the bits in the resulting template are set in the file
permission bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-perm [-]onum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the hyphen is omitted, the
primary shall evaluate as true when the file permission bits
exactly match the value of the octal number onum and only
the bits corresponding <br>
to the octal mask 07777 shall be compared. (See the
description of the octal mode in chmod().) Otherwise, if
onum is prefixed by a hyphen, the primary shall evaluate as
<br>
true if at least all of the bits specified in onum that are
also set in the octal mask 07777 are set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-type c <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the type of the file
is c, where c is &rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;c&rsquo;,
&rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;l&rsquo;, &rsquo;p&rsquo;,
&rsquo;f&rsquo;, or &rsquo;s&rsquo; for block special file,
character special file, directory, <br>
symbolic link, FIFO, regular file, or socket,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-links n <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file has n
links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-user uname <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to
the user uname. If uname is a decimal integer and the
getpwnam() (or equivalent) function does not return a valid
<br>
user name, uname shall be interpreted as a user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-group gname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary shall evaluate as
true if the file belongs to the group gname. If gname is a
decimal integer and the getgrnam() (or equivalent) function
does not return a <br>
valid group name, gname shall be interpreted as a group
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size n[c] <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file size in
bytes, divided by 512 and rounded up to the next integer, is
n. If n is followed by the character &rsquo;c&rsquo;, the
size <br>
shall be in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-atime n <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file access time
subtracted from the initialization time, divided by 86400
(with any remainder discarded), is n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ctime n <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the time of last
change of file status information subtracted from the
initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder
dis&acirc; <br>
carded), is n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtime n <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file modification
time subtracted from the initialization time, divided by
86400 (with any remainder discarded), is n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exec utility_name [argument
...] ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exec utility_name [argument
...] <br>
{} +</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The end of the primary
expression shall be punctuated by a semicolon or by a plus
sign. Only a plus sign that follows an argument containing
the two characters &quot;{}&quot; shall <br>
punctuate the end of the primary expression. Other uses of
the plus sign shall not be treated as special.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the primary expression is
punctuated by a semicolon, the utility utility_name shall be
invoked once for each pathname and the primary shall
evaluate as true if the utility <br>
returns a zero value as exit status. A utility_name or
argument containing only the two characters &quot;{}&quot;
shall be replaced by the current pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the primary expression is
punctuated by a plus sign, the primary shall always evaluate
as true, and the pathnames for which the primary is
evaluated shall be aggregated into <br>
sets. The utility utility_name shall be invoked once for
each set of aggregated pathnames. Each invocation shall
begin after the last pathname in the set is aggregated, and
shall <br>
be completed before the find utility exits and before the
first pathname in the next set (if any) is aggregated for
this primary, but it is otherwise unspecified whether the
<br>
invocation occurs before, during, or after the evaluations
of other primaries. If any invocation returns a non-zero
value as exit status, the find utility shall return a
non-zero <br>
exit status. An argument containing only the two characters
&quot;{}&quot; shall be replaced by the set of aggregated
pathnames, with each pathname passed as a separate argument
to the <br>
invoked utility in the same order that it was aggregated.
The size of any set of two or more pathnames shall be
limited such that execution of the utility does not cause
the <br>
system&rsquo;s {ARG_MAX} limit to be exceeded. If more than
one argument containing only the two characters
&quot;{}&quot; is present, the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a utility_name or argument
string contains the two characters &quot;{}&quot;, but not
just the two characters &quot;{}&quot;, it is
implementation-defined whether find replaces those two
charac&acirc; <br>
ters or uses the string without change. The current
directory for the invocation of utility_name shall be the
same as the current directory when the find utility was
started. If <br>
the utility_name names any of the special built-in utilities
(see Special Built-In Utilities ), the results are
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ok utility_name [argument ...]
;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ok primary shall be
equivalent to -exec, except that the use of a plus sign to
punctuate the end of the primary expression need not be
supported, and find shall <br>
request affirmation of the invocation of utility_name using
the current file as an argument by writing to standard error
as described in the STDERR section. If the <br>
response on standard input is affirmative, the utility shall
be invoked. Otherwise, the command shall not be invoked and
the value of the -ok operand shall be false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print The primary shall always
evaluate as true; it shall cause the current pathname to be
written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newer file <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the modification time
of the current file is more recent than the modification
time of the file named by the pathname file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth The primary shall always
evaluate as true; it shall cause descent of the directory
hierarchy to be done so that all entries in a directory are
acted on before the direc&acirc; <br>
tory itself. If a -depth primary is not specified, all
entries in a directory shall be acted on after the directory
itself. If any -depth primary is specified, it shall <br>
apply to the entire expression even if the -depth primary
would not normally be evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primaries can be combined
using the following operators (in order of decreasing
precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( expression ) <br>
True if expression is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! expression <br>
Negation of a primary; the unary NOT operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression [-a] expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conjunction of primaries; the
AND operator is implied by the juxtaposition of two
primaries or made explicit by the optional -a operator. The
second expression shall not <br>
be evaluated if the first expression is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression -o expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternation of primaries; the OR
operator. The second expression shall not be evaluated if
the first expression is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no expression is present,
-print shall be used as the expression. Otherwise, if the
given expression does not contain any of the primaries
-exec, -ok, or -print, the given <br>
expression shall be effectively replaced by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( given_expression ) -print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -user, -group, and -newer
primaries each shall evaluate their respective arguments
only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
If the -ok primary is used, the response shall be read from
the standard input. An entire line shall be read as the
response. Otherwise, the standard input shall not be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of find:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for the
behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
collating elements used in the pattern matching notation for
the -n option and in <br>
the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
This variable determines the locale for the interpretation
of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters
<br>
in arguments), the behavior of character classes within the
pattern matching notation used for the -n option, and the
behavior of character classes within regular expres&acirc;
<br>
sions used in the extended regular expression defined for
the yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative
responses that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the location of
the utility_name for the -exec and -ok primaries, as
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment <br>
Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The -print primary shall cause the current pathnames to be
written to standard output. The format shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;path&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The -ok primary shall write a prompt to standard error
containing at least the utility_name to be invoked and the
current pathname. In the POSIX locale, the last non-
&lt;blank&gt; in <br>
the prompt shall be &rsquo;?&rsquo; . The exact format used
is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the standard error
shall be used only for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All path operands were
traversed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
When used in operands, pattern matching notation,
semicolons, opening parentheses, and closing parentheses are
special to the shell and must be quoted (see Quoting ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bit that is traditionally
used for sticky (historically 01000) is specified in the
-perm primary using the octal number argument form. Since
this bit is not defined by this <br>
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, applications must not assume
that it actually refers to the traditional sticky bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following commands are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . <br>
find . -print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They both write out the entire
directory hierarchy from the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -name tmp -o -name
&rsquo;*.xx&rsquo; -atime +7 -exec rm {} ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes all files named tmp or
ending in .xx that have not been accessed for seven or more
24-hour periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . -perm -o+w,+s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints ( -print is assumed) the
names of all files in or below the current directory, with
all of the file permission bits S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and
S_IWOTH set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . -name SCCS -prune -o
-print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursively prints pathnames of
all files in the current directory and below, but skips
directories named SCCS and files in them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . -print -name SCCS
-prune</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">behaves as in the previous
example, but prints the names of the SCCS directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The following command is
roughly equivalent to the -nt extension to test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ -n &quot;$(find file1
-prune -newer file2)&quot; ]; then <br>
printf %s\n &quot;file1 is newer than file2&quot; <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. The descriptions of -atime,
-ctime, and -mtime use the terminology n &quot;86400 second
periods (days)&quot;. For example, a file accessed at 23:59
is selected by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . -atime -1 -print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at 00:01 the next day (less than
24 hours later, not more than one day ago); the midnight
boundary between days has no effect on the 24-hour
calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The -a operator was retained as an optional operator for
compatibility with historical shell scripts, even though it
is redundant with expression concatenation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The descriptions of the
&rsquo;-&rsquo; modifier on the mode and onum arguments to
the -perm primary agree with historical practice on BSD and
System V implementations. System V and BSD doc&acirc; <br>
umentation both describe it in terms of checking additional
bits; in fact, it uses the same bits, but checks for having
at least all of the matching bits set instead of having <br>
exactly the matching bits set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact format of the
interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature
of the contents of prompts are specified because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Implementations may desire
more descriptive prompts than those used on historical
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Since the historical prompt
strings do not terminate with &lt;newline&gt;s, there is no
portable way for another program to interact with the
prompts of this utility via pipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore, an application using
this prompting option relies on the system to provide the
most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on the
general guidelines specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -name file operand was
changed to use the shell pattern matching notation so that
find is consistent with other utilities using pattern
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -size operand refers to the
size of a file, rather than the number of blocks it may
occupy in the file system. The intent is that the st_size
field defined in the System <br>
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 should be used,
not the st_blocks found in historical implementations. There
are at least two reasons for this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. In both System V and BSD,
find only uses st_size in size calculations for the operands
specified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. (BSD uses
st_blocks only when pro&acirc; <br>
cessing the -ls primary.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Users usually think of file
size in terms of bytes, which is also the unit used by the
ls utility for the output from the -l option. (In both
System V and BSD, ls uses <br>
st_size for the -l option size field and uses st_blocks for
the ls -s calculations. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
does not specify ls -s.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The descriptions of -atime,
-ctime, and -mtime were changed from the SVID description of
n &quot;days&rsquo;&rsquo; to &quot;24-hour periods&quot;.
The description is also different in terms of the exact <br>
timeframe for the n case (versus the +n or -n), but it
matches all known historical implementations. It refers to
one 86400 second period in the past, not any time from the
<br>
beginning of that period to the current time. For example,
-atime 3 is true if the file was accessed any time in the
period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations do
not modify &quot;{}&quot; when it appears as a substring of
an -exec or -ok utility_name or argument string. There have
been numerous user requests for this <br>
extension, so this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 allows the
desired behavior. At least one recent implementation does
support this feature, but encountered several problems in
<br>
managing memory allocation and dealing with multiple
occurrences of &quot;{}&quot; in a string while it was being
developed, so it is not yet required behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming the presence of -print
was added to correct a historical pitfall that plagues
novice users, it is entirely upwards-compatible from the
historical System V find utility. <br>
In its simplest form ( find directory), it could be confused
with the historical BSD fast find. The BSD developers agreed
that adding -print as a default expression was the
cor&acirc; <br>
rect decision and have added the fast find functionality
within a new utility called locate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the -L option was
implemented using the primary -follow. The -H and -L options
were added for two reasons. First, they offer a finer
granularity of control and con&acirc; <br>
sistency with other programs that walk file hierarchies.
Second, the -follow primary always evaluated to true. As
they were historically really global variables that took
effect <br>
before the traversal began, some valid expressions had
unexpected results. An example is the expression -print -o
-follow. Because -print always evaluates to true, the
standard <br>
order of evaluation implies that -follow would never be
evaluated. This was never the case. Historical practice for
the -follow primary, however, is not consistent. Some
imple&acirc; <br>
mentations always follow symbolic links on the command line
whether -follow is specified or not. Others follow symbolic
links on the command line only if -follow is specified. <br>
Both behaviors are provided by the -H and -L options, but
scripts using the current -follow primary would be broken if
the -follow option is specified to work either way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the -L option resolves all
symbolic links and the -type l primary is true for symbolic
links that still exist after symbolic links have been
resolved, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find -L . -type l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints a list of symbolic links
reachable from the current directory that do not resolve to
accessible files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A feature of SVR4&rsquo;s find
utility was the -exec primary&rsquo;s + terminator. This
allowed filenames containing special characters (especially
&lt;newline&gt;s) to be grouped together without <br>
the problems that occur if such filenames are piped to
xargs. Other implementations have added other ways to get
around this problem, notably a -print0 primary that wrote
file&acirc; <br>
names with a null byte terminator. This was considered here,
but not adopted. Using a null terminator meant that any
utility that was going to process find&rsquo;s -print0
output had <br>
to add a new option to parse the null terminators it would
now be reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-exec ... {} +&quot;
syntax adopted was a result of IEEE PASC Interpretation
1003.2 #210. It should be noted that this is an incompatible
change to the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 stan&acirc; <br>
dard. For example, the following command prints all files
with a &rsquo;-&rsquo; after their name if they are regular
files, and a &rsquo;+&rsquo; otherwise:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -type f -exec echo {} -
&rsquo;;&rsquo; -o -exec echo {} + &rsquo;;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The change invalidates usage
like this. Even though the previous standard stated that
this usage would work, in practice many did not support it
and the standard developers felt <br>
it better to now state that this was not allowable.</p>
