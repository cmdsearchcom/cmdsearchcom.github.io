<p>DIFF(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual DIFF(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
diff - compare two files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
diff [-c| -e| -f| -C n][-br] file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The diff utility shall compare the contents of file1 and
file2 and write to standard output a list of changes
necessary to convert file1 into file2. This list should be
minimal. <br>
No output shall be produced if the files are identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The diff utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Cause any amount of white
space at the end of a line to be treated as a single
&lt;newline&gt; (that is, the white-space characters
preceding the &lt;newline&gt; are ignored) and <br>
other strings of white-space characters, not including
&lt;newline&gt;s, to compare equal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Produce output in a form that
provides three lines of context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C n Produce output in a form
that provides n lines of context (where n shall be
interpreted as a positive decimal integer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Produce output in a form
suitable as input for the ed utility, which can then be used
to convert file1 into file2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Produce output in an
alternative form, similar in format to -e, but not intended
to be suitable as input for the ed utility, and in the
opposite order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Apply diff recursively to
files and directories of the same name when file1 and file2
are both directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file1, file2 <br>
A pathname of a file to be compared. If either the file1 or
file2 operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the standard input shall
be used in its place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both file1 and file2 are
directories, diff shall not compare block special files,
character special files, or FIFO special files to any files
and shall not compare regular <br>
files to directories. Further details are as specified in
Diff Directory Comparison Format . The behavior of diff on
other file types is implementation-defined when found in
<br>
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only one of file1 and file2
is a directory, diff shall be applied to the non-directory
file and the file contained in the directory file with a
filename that is the same as <br>
the last component of the non-directory file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if one of the file1 or
file2 operands references standard input. See the INPUT
FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files may be of any type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of diff:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME <br>
Determine the locale for affecting the format of file
timestamps written with the -C and -c options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
for calculating file timestamps written with the -C and -c
options. If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified default
timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Diff Directory Comparison Format <br>
If both file1 and file2 are directories, the following
output formats shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the POSIX locale, each file
that is present in only one directory shall be reported
using the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Only in %s: %s0,
&lt;directory pathname&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the POSIX locale,
subdirectories that are common to the two directories may be
reported with the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Common subdirectories: %s
and %s0, &lt;directory1 pathname&gt;, <br>
&lt;directory2 pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file common to the two
directories if the two files are not to be compared, the
following format shall be used in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File %s is a %s while file
%s is a %s0, &lt;directory1 pathname&gt;, <br>
&lt;file type of directory1 pathname&gt;, &lt;directory2
pathname&gt;, <br>
&lt;file type of directory2 pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file common to the two
directories, if the files are compared and are identical, no
output shall be written. If the two files differ, the
following format is written:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;diff %s %s %s0,
&lt;diff_options&gt;, &lt;filename1&gt;,
&lt;filename2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;diff_options&gt; are
the options as specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All directory pathnames listed
in this section shall be relative to the original command
line arguments. All other names of files listed in this
section shall be filenames (path&acirc; <br>
name components).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff Binary Output Format <br>
In the POSIX locale, if one or both of the files being
compared are not text files, an unspecified format shall be
used that contains the pathnames of two files being compared
<br>
and the string &quot;differ&quot; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both files being compared are
text files, depending on the options specified, one of the
following formats shall be used to write the
differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff Default Output Format <br>
The default (without -e, -f, -c, or -C options) diff utility
output shall contain lines of these forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%da%d0, &lt;num1&gt;,
&lt;num2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%da%d,%d0, &lt;num1&gt;,
&lt;num2&gt;, &lt;num3&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%dd%d0, &lt;num1&gt;,
&lt;num2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d,%dd%d0, &lt;num1&gt;,
&lt;num2&gt;, &lt;num3&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%dc%d0, &lt;num1&gt;,
&lt;num2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d,%dc%d0, &lt;num1&gt;,
&lt;num2&gt;, &lt;num3&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%dc%d,%d0, &lt;num1&gt;,
&lt;num2&gt;, &lt;num3&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d,%dc%d,%d0,
&lt;num1&gt;, &lt;num2&gt;, &lt;num3&gt;, &lt;num4&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These lines resemble ed
subcommands to convert file1 into file2. The line numbers
before the action letters shall pertain to file1; those
after shall pertain to file2. Thus, by <br>
exchanging a for d and reading the line in reverse order,
one can also determine how to convert file2 into file1. As
in ed, identical pairs (where num1= num2) are abbreviated as
<br>
a single number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following each of these lines,
diff shall write to standard output all lines affected in
the first file using the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;&lt; %s&quot;,
&lt;line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and all lines affected in the
second file using the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;&gt; %s&quot;,
&lt;line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are lines affected in
both file1 and file2 (as with the c subcommand), the changes
are separated with a line consisting of three hyphens:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;---0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff -e Output Format <br>
With the -e option, a script shall be produced that shall,
when provided as input to ed, along with an appended w
(write) command, convert file1 into file2. Only the a
(append), <br>
c (change), d (delete), i (insert), and s (substitute)
commands of ed shall be used in this script. Text lines,
except those consisting of the single character period (
&rsquo;.&rsquo; ), <br>
shall be output as they appear in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff -f Output Format <br>
With the -f option, an alternative format of script shall be
produced. It is similar to that produced by -e, with the
following differences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It is expressed in reverse
sequence; the output of -e orders changes from the end of
the file to the beginning; the -f from beginning to end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The command form
&lt;lines&gt; &lt;command-letter&gt; used by -e is reversed.
For example, 10c with -e would be c10 with -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The form used for ranges of
line numbers is &lt;space&gt;-separated, rather than
comma-separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff -c or -C Output Format <br>
With the -c or -C option, the output format shall consist of
affected lines along with surrounding lines of context. The
affected lines shall show which ones need to be deleted <br>
or changed in file1, and those added from file2. With the -c
option, three lines of context, if available, shall be
written before and after the affected lines. With the -C
<br>
option, the user can specify how many lines of context are
written. The exact format follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name and last modification
time of each file shall be output in the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*** %s %s0, file1,
&lt;file1 timestamp&gt; <br>
&quot;--- %s %s0, file2, &lt;file2 timestamp&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each &lt;file&gt; field shall be
the pathname of the corresponding file being compared. The
pathname written for standard input is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the POSIX locale, each
&lt;timestamp&gt; field shall be equivalent to the output
from the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &quot;+%a %b %e %T
%Y&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">without the trailing
&lt;newline&gt;, executed at the time of last modification
of the corresponding file (or the current time, if the file
is standard input).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, the following output
formats shall be applied for every set of changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, a line shall be written
in the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;***************0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, the range of lines in
file1 shall be written in the following format if the range
contains two or more lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*** %d,%d ****0,
&lt;beginning line number&gt;, &lt;ending line
number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the following format
otherwise:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*** %d ****0, &lt;ending
line number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ending line number of an
empty range shall be the number of the preceding line, or 0
if the range is at the start of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, the affected lines along
with lines of context (unaffected lines) shall be written.
Unaffected lines shall be written in the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; %s&quot;,
&lt;unaffected_line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deleted lines shall be written
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;- %s&quot;,
&lt;deleted_line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed lines shall be written
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;! %s&quot;,
&lt;changed_line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, the range of lines in
file2 shall be written in the following format if the range
contains two or more lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--- %d,%d ----0,
&lt;beginning line number&gt;, &lt;ending line
number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the following format
otherwise:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--- %d ----0, &lt;ending
line number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, lines of context and
changed lines shall be written as described in the previous
formats. Lines added from file2 shall be written in the
following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;+ %s&quot;,
&lt;added_line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No differences were found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Differences were found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
If lines at the end of a file are changed and other lines
are added, diff output may show this as a delete and add, as
a change, or as a change and add; diff is not expected to
<br>
know which happened and users should not care about the
difference in output as long as it clearly shows the
differences between the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If dir1 is a directory containing a directory named x, dir2
is a directory containing a directory named x, dir1/x and
dir2/x both contain files named date.out, and dir2/x
con&acirc; <br>
tains a file named y, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff -r dir1 dir2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">could produce output similar
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common subdirectories: dir1/x
and dir2/x <br>
Only in dir2/x: y <br>
diff -r dir1/x/date.out dir2/x/date.out <br>
1c1 <br>
&lt; Mon Jul 2 13:12:16 PDT 1990 <br>
--- <br>
&gt; Tue Jun 19 21:41:39 PDT 1990</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The -h option was omitted because it was insufficiently
specified and does not add to applications portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations
employ algorithms that do not always produce a minimum list
of differences; the current language about making every
effort is the best this volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 can do, as there is no metric that
could be employed to judge the quality of implementations
against any and all file contents. The statement &quot;This
list <br>
should be minimal&rsquo;&rsquo; clearly implies that
implementations are not expected to provide the following
output when comparing two 100-line files that differ in only
one character on a <br>
single line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1,100c1,100 <br>
all 100 lines from file1 preceded with &quot;&lt; &quot;
<br>
--- <br>
all 100 lines from file2 preceded with &quot;&gt; &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Only in&quot; messages
required when the -r option is specified are not used by
most historical implementations if the -e option is also
specified. It is required here because it <br>
provides useful information that must be provided to update
a target directory hierarchy to match a source hierarchy.
The &quot;Common subdirectories&quot; messages are written
by System V <br>
and 4.3 BSD when the -r option is specified. They are
allowed here but are not required because they are reporting
on something that is the same, not reporting a difference,
and <br>
are not needed to update a target hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option, which writes
output in a format using lines of context, has been
included. The format is useful for a variety of reasons,
among them being much improved readabil&acirc; <br>
ity and the ability to understand difference changes when
the target file has line numbers that differ from another
similar, but slightly different, copy. The patch utility is
<br>
most valuable when working with difference listings using
the context format. The BSD version of -c takes an optional
argument specifying the amount of context. Rather than <br>
overloading -c and breaking the Utility Syntax Guidelines
for diff, the standard developers decided to add a separate
option for specifying a context diff with a specified amount
<br>
of context ( -C). Also, the format for context diffs was
extended slightly in 4.3 BSD to allow multiple changes that
are within context lines from each other to be merged <br>
together. The output format contains an additional four
asterisks after the range of affected lines in the first
filename. This was to provide a flag for old programs (like
old <br>
versions of patch) that only understand the old context
format. The version of context described here does not
require that multiple changes within context lines be
merged, but <br>
it does not prohibit it either. The extension is
upwards-compatible, so any vendors that wish to retain the
old version of diff can do so by adding the extra four
asterisks (that <br>
is, utilities that currently use diff and understand the new
merged format will also understand the old unmerged format,
but not vice versa).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The substitute command was added
as an additional format for the -e option. This was added to
provide implementations with a way to fix the classic
&quot;dot alone on a line&quot; bug <br>
present in many versions of diff. Since many implementations
have fixed this bug, the standard developers decided not to
standardize broken behavior, but rather to provide the <br>
necessary tool for fixing the bug. One way to fix this bug
is to output two periods whenever a lone period is needed,
then terminate the append command with a period, and then
<br>
use the substitute command to convert the two periods into
one period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BSD-derived -r option was
added to provide a mechanism for using diff to compare two
file system trees. This behavior is useful, is standard
practice on all BSD-derived sys&acirc; <br>
tems, and is not easily reproducible with the find
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The requirement that diff not
compare files in some circumstances, even though they have
the same name, is based on the actual output of historical
implementations. The message <br>
specified here is already in use when a directory is being
compared to a non-directory. It is extended here to preclude
the problems arising from running into FIFOs and other <br>
files that would cause diff to hang waiting for input with
no indication to the user that diff was hung. In most common
usage, diff -r should indicate differences in the file <br>
hierarchies, not the difference of contents of devices
pointed to by the hierarchies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many early implementations of
diff require seekable files. Since the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 supports named pipes, the
standard developers decided that <br>
such a restriction was unreasonable. Note also that the
allowed filename - almost always refers to a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No directory search order is
specified for diff. The historical ordering is, in fact, not
optimal, in that it prints out all of the differences at the
current level, including <br>
the statements about all common subdirectories before
recursing into those subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;diff %s %s %s0,
&lt;diff_options&gt;, &lt;filename1&gt;,
&lt;filename2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">does not vary by locale because
it is the representation of a command, not an English
sentence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
