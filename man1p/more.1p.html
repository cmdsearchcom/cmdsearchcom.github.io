<p>MORE(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual MORE(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
more - display files on a page-by-page basis</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
more [-ceisu][-n number][-p command][-t tagstring][file
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The more utility shall read files and either write them to
the terminal on a page-by-page basis or filter them to
standard output. If standard output is not a terminal
device, <br>
all input files shall be copied to standard output in their
entirety, without modification, except as specified for the
-s option. If standard output is a terminal device, the <br>
files shall be written a number of lines (one screenful) at
a time under the control of user commands. See the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain block-mode terminals do
not have all the capabilities necessary to support the
complete more definition; they are incapable of accepting
commands that are not terminated <br>
with a &lt;newline&gt;. Implementations that support such
terminals shall provide an operating mode to more in which
all commands can be terminated with a &lt;newline&gt; on
those termi&acirc; <br>
nals. This mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Shall be documented in the
system documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Shall, at invocation, inform
the user of the terminal deficiency that requires the
&lt;newline&gt; usage and provide instructions on how this
warning can be suppressed in future <br>
invocations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Shall not be required for
implementations supporting only fully capable terminals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Shall not affect commands
already requiring &lt;newline&gt;s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Shall not affect users on the
capable terminals from using more as described in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The more utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c If a screen is to be written
that has no lines in common with the current screen, or more
is writing its first screen, more shall not scroll the
screen, but instead shall <br>
redraw each line of the screen in turn, from the top of the
screen to the bottom. In addition, if more is writing its
first screen, the screen shall be cleared. This <br>
option may be silently ignored on devices with insufficient
terminal capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e By default, more shall exit
immediately after writing the last line of the last file in
the argument list. If the -e option is specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If there is only a single
file in the argument list and that file was completely
displayed on a single screen, more shall exit immediately
after writing the last line <br>
of that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Otherwise, more shall exit
only after reaching end-of-file on the last file in the
argument list twice without an intervening operation. See
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Perform pattern matching in
searches without regard to case; see the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.2, Regular
Expression General Requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n number <br>
Specify the number of lines per screenful. The number
argument is a positive decimal integer. The -n option shall
override any values obtained from any other source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p command <br>
Each time a screen from a new file is displayed or
redisplayed (including as a result of more commands; for
example, :p), execute the more command(s) in the command
argu&acirc; <br>
ments in the order specified, as if entered by the user
after the first screen has been displayed. No intermediate
results shall be displayed (that is, if the command is a
<br>
movement to a screen different from the normal first screen,
only the screen resulting from the command shall be
displayed.) If any of the commands fail for any reason, an
<br>
informational message to this effect shall be written, and
no further commands specified using the -p option shall be
executed for this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Behave as if consecutive
empty lines were a single empty line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tagstring <br>
Write the screenful of the file containing the tag named by
the tagstring argument. See the ctags utility. The tags
feature represented by -t tagstring and the :t command <br>
is optional. It shall be provided on any system that also
provides a conforming implementation of ctags; otherwise,
the use of -t produces undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filename resulting from the
-t option shall be logically added as a prefix to the list
of command line files, as if specified by the user. If the
tag named by the tagstring <br>
argument is not found, it shall be an error, and more shall
take no further action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the tag specifies a line
number, the first line of the display shall contain the
beginning of that line. If the tag specifies a pattern, the
first line of the display shall <br>
contain the beginning of the matching text from the first
line of the file that contains that pattern. If the line
does not exist in the file or matching text is not found, an
<br>
informational message to this effect shall be displayed, and
more shall display the default screen as if -t had not been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both the -t tagstring and -p
command options are given, the -t tagstring shall be
processed first; that is, the file and starting line for the
display shall be as specified by <br>
-t, and then the -p more command shall be executed. If the
line (matching text) specified by the -t command does not
exist (is not found), no -p more command shall be executed
<br>
for this file at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Treat a &lt;backspace&gt; as
a printable control character, displayed as an
implementation-defined character sequence (see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section), suppressing <br>
backspacing and the special handling that produces
underlined or standout mode text on some terminal types.
Also, do not ignore a &lt;carriage-return&gt; at the end of
a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of an input
file. If no file operands are specified, the standard input
shall be used. If a file is &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the standard
input shall be read at that point in the <br>
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is &rsquo;-&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files being examined shall be text files. If
standard output is a terminal, standard error shall be used
to read commands from the user. If standard output is a
termi&acirc; <br>
nal, standard error is not readable, and command input is
needed, more may attempt to obtain user commands from the
controlling terminal (for example, /dev/tty); otherwise,
more <br>
shall terminate with an error indicating that it was unable
to read user commands. If standard output is not a terminal,
no error shall result if standard error cannot be opened
<br>
for reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of more:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
Override the system-selected horizontal display line size.
See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Chapter 8, Environment Variables for valid values and <br>
results when it is unset or null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR Used by the v command to
select an editor. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for the
behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
collating elements within regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files) and the behavior of character classes within
regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINES Override the
system-selected vertical screen size, used as the number of
lines in a screenful. See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environ&acirc; <br>
ment Variables for valid values and results when it is unset
or null. The -n option shall take precedence over the LINES
variable for determining the number of lines in a <br>
screenful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MORE Determine a string
containing options described in the OPTIONS section preceded
with hyphens and &lt;blank&gt;-separated as on the command
line. Any command line options shall <br>
be processed after those in the MORE variable, as if the
command line were:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more $MORE options operands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MORE variable shall take
precedence over the TERM and LINES variables for determining
the number of lines in a screenful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM Determine the name of the
terminal type. If this variable is unset or null, an
unspecified default terminal type is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The standard output shall be used to write the contents of
the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and
user commands (see the INPUT FILES section), and, if
standard output is a terminal device, to write a prompting
<br>
string. The prompting string shall appear on the screen line
below the last line of the file displayed in the current
screenful. The prompt shall contain the name of the file
<br>
currently being examined and shall contain an end-of-file
indication and the name of the next file, if any, when
prompting at the end-of-file. If an error or informational
mes&acirc; <br>
sage is displayed, it is unspecified whether it is contained
in the prompt. If it is not contained in the prompt, it
shall be displayed and then the user shall be prompted for a
<br>
continuation character, at which point another message or
the user prompt may be displayed. The prompt is otherwise
unspecified. It is unspecified whether informational
messages <br>
are written for other user commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The following section describes the behavior of more when
the standard output is a terminal device. If the standard
output is not a terminal device, no options other than -s
<br>
shall have any effect, and all input files shall be copied
to standard output otherwise unmodified, at which time more
shall exit without further action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of lines available
per screen shall be determined by the -n option, if present,
or by examining values in the environment (see the
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section). If <br>
neither method yields a number, an unspecified number of
lines shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum number of lines
written shall be one less than this number, because the
screen line after the last line written shall be used to
write a user prompt and user input. <br>
If the number of lines in the screen is less than two, the
results are undefined. It is unspecified whether user input
is permitted to be longer than the remainder of the single
<br>
line where the prompt has been written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of columns available
per line shall be determined by examining values in the
environment (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section), with a
default value as described in <br>
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines that are longer than the
display shall be folded; the length at which folding occurs
is unspecified, but should be appropriate for the output
device. Folding may occur <br>
between glyphs of single characters that take up multiple
display columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When standard output is a
terminal and -u is not specified, more shall treat
&lt;backspace&gt;s and &lt;carriage-return&gt;s
specially:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A character, followed first by
a sequence of n &lt;backspace&gt;s (where n is the same as
the number of column positions that the character occupies),
then by n underscore charac&acirc; <br>
ters ( &rsquo;_&rsquo; ), shall cause that character to be
written as underlined text, if the terminal type supports
that. The n underscore characters, followed first by n
&lt;backspace&gt;s, <br>
then any character with n column positions, shall also cause
that character to be written as underlined text, if the
terminal type supports that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A sequence of n
&lt;backspace&gt;s (where n is the same as the number of
column positions that the previous character occupies) that
appears between two identical printable charac&acirc; <br>
ters shall cause the first of those two characters to be
written as emboldened text (that is, visually brighter,
standout mode, or inverse-video mode), if the terminal type
<br>
supports that, and the second to be discarded. Immediately
subsequent occurrences of &lt;backspace&gt;/ character pairs
for that same character shall also be discarded. (For
exam&acirc; s i n g l e e m <br>
ple, the sequence &quot;ab&rsquo; .) o l d e n e d
&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The more utility shall
logically discard all other &lt;backspace&gt;s from the line
as well as the character which precedes them, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A &lt;carriage-return&gt; at
the end of a line shall be ignored, rather than being
written as a non-printable character, as described in the
next paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is implementation-defined how
other non-printable characters are written. Implementations
should use the same format that they use for the ex print
command; see the OPTIONS <br>
section within the ed utility. It is unspecified whether a
multi-column character shall be separated if it crosses a
display line boundary; it shall not be discarded. The
behav&acirc; <br>
ior is unspecified if the number of columns on the display
is less than the number of columns any single character in
the line being displayed would occupy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When each new file is displayed
(or redisplayed), more shall write the first screen of the
file. Once the initial screen has been written, more shall
prompt for a user command. <br>
If the execution of the user command results in a screen
that has lines in common with the current screen, and the
device has sufficient terminal capabilities, more shall
scroll <br>
the screen; otherwise, it is unspecified whether the screen
is scrolled or redrawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all files but the last
(including standard input if no file was specified, and for
the last file as well, if the -e option was not specified),
when more has written the last <br>
line in the file, more shall prompt for a user command. This
prompt shall contain the name of the next file as well as an
indication that more has reached end-of-file. If the <br>
user command is f, &lt;control&gt;-F, &lt;space&gt;, j,
&lt;newline&gt;, d, &lt;control&gt;-D, or s, more shall
display the next file. Otherwise, if displaying the last
file, more shall exit. Otherwise, <br>
more shall execute the user command specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several of the commands
described in this section display a previous screen from the
input stream. In the case that text is being taken from a
non-rewindable stream, such as a <br>
pipe, it is implementation-defined how much backwards motion
is supported. If a command cannot be executed because of a
limitation on backwards motion, an error message to this
<br>
effect shall be displayed, the current screen shall not
change, and the user shall be prompted for another
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command cannot be performed
because there are insufficient lines to display, more shall
alert the terminal. If a command cannot be performed because
there are insufficient <br>
lines to display or a / command fails: if the input is the
standard input, the last screen in the file may be
displayed; otherwise, the current file and screen shall not
change, <br>
and the user shall be prompted for another command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interactive commands in the
following sections shall be supported. Some commands can be
preceded by a decimal integer, called count in the following
descriptions. If not <br>
specified with the command, count shall default to 1. In the
following descriptions, pattern is a basic regular
expression, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
<br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Regular
Expressions. The term &quot;examine&quot; is historical
usage meaning &quot;open the file for viewing&rsquo;&rsquo;;
for example, more foo would be <br>
expressed as examining file foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following descriptions,
unless otherwise specified, line is a line in the more
display, not a line from the file being examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following descriptions,
the current position refers to two things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The position of the current
line on the screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The line number (in the file)
of the current line on the screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually, the line on the screen
corresponding to the current position is the third line on
the screen. If this is not possible (there are fewer than
three lines to display or <br>
this is the first page of the file, or it is the last page
of the file), then the current position is either the first
or last line on the screen as described later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write a summary of these
commands and other implementation-defined commands. The
behavior shall be as if the more utility were executed with
the -e option on a file that con&acirc; <br>
tained the summary information. The user shall be prompted
as described earlier in this section when end-of-file is
reached. If the user command is one of those specified to

tinue to the next file, more shall return to the file and
screen state from which the h command was executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat the previous search for
countth line containing the last pattern (or not containing
the last pattern, if the previous search was &quot;/!&quot;
or &quot;?!&quot; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat Search in Reverse <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[count]N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat the search in the
opposite direction of the previous search for the countth
line containing the last pattern (or not containing the last
pattern, if the previous search <br>
was &quot;/!&quot; or &quot;?!&quot; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine New File <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:e [filename]&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine a new file. If the
filename argument is not specified, the current file (see
the :n and :p commands below) shall be re-examined. The
filename shall be subjected to the <br>
process of shell word expansions (see Word Expansions ); if
more than a single pathname results, the effects are
unspecified. If filename is a number sign ( &rsquo;#&rsquo;
), the previ&acirc; <br>
ously examined file shall be re-examined. If filename is not
accessible for any reason (including that it is a
non-seekable file), an error message to this effect shall be
dis&acirc; <br>
played and the current file and screen shall not change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine Next File <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[count]:n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine the next file. If a
number count is specified, the countth next file shall be
examined. If filename refers to a non-seekable file, the
results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine Previous File <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[count]:p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine the previous file. If a
number count is specified, the countth previous file shall
be examined. If filename refers to a non-seekable file, the
results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go to Tag <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:t tagstring&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file containing the tag
named by the tagstring argument is not the current file,
examine the file, as if the :e command was executed with
that file as the argument. Other&acirc; <br>
wise, or in addition, display the screenful beginning with
the tag, as described for the -t option (see the OPTIONS
section). If the ctags utility is not supported by the
sys&acirc; <br>
tem, the use of :t produces undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoke Editor <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoke an editor to edit the
current file being examined. If standard input is being
examined, the results are unspecified. The name of the
editor shall be taken from the envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable EDITOR , or shall default to vi. If the
last pathname component in EDITOR is either vi or ex, the
editor shall be invoked with a -c linenumber command line
argu&acirc; <br>
ment, where linenumber is the line number of the file line
containing the display line currently displayed as the first
line of the screen. It is implementation-defined whether
<br>
line-setting options are passed to editors other than vi and
ex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the editor exits, more
shall resume with the same file and screen as when the
editor was invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display Position <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= <br>
&lt;control&gt;-G</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write a message for which the
information references the first byte of the line after the
last line of the file on the screen. This message shall
include the name of the file <br>
currently being examined, its number relative to the total
number of files there are to examine, the line number in the
file, the byte number and the total bytes in the file, and
<br>
what percentage of the file precedes the current position.
If more is reading from standard input, or the file is
shorter than a single screen, the line number, the byte
number, <br>
the total bytes, and the percentage need not be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit <br>
Synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q <br>
:q <br>
ZZ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If an error is encountered accessing a file when using the
:n command, more shall attempt to examine the next file in
the argument list, but the final exit status shall be <br>
affected. If an error is encountered accessing a file via
the :p command, more shall attempt to examine the previous
file in the argument list, but the final exit status shall
<br>
be affected. If an error is encountered accessing a file via
the :e command, more shall remain in the current file and
the final exit status shall not be affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
When the standard output is not a terminal, only the -s
filter-modification option is effective. This is based on
historical practice. For example, a typical implementation
of <br>
man pipes its output through more -s to squeeze excess white
space for terminal users. When man is piped to lp, however,
it is undesirable for this squeezing to happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The -p allows arbitrary commands to be executed at the start
of each file. Examples are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more -p G file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine each file starting with
its last screenful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more -p 100 file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine each file starting with
line 100 in the current position (usually the third line, so
line 98 would be the first line written).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more -p /100 file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine each file starting with
the first line containing the string &quot;100&quot; in the
current position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The more utility, available in BSD and BSD-derived systems,
was chosen as the prototype for the POSIX file display
program since it is more widely available than either the
pub&acirc; <br>
lic-domain program less or than pg, a pager provided in
System V. The 4.4 BSD more is the model for the features
selected; it is almost fully upwards-compatible from the 4.3
BSD <br>
version in wide use and has become more amenable for vi
users. Several features originally derived from various file
editors, found in both less and pg, have been added to this
<br>
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 as they have proved extremely
popular with users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are inconsistencies
between more and vi that result from historical practice.
For example, the single-character commands h, f, b, and
&lt;space&gt; are screen movers in more, but <br>
cursor movers in vi. These inconsistencies were maintained
because the cursor movements are not applicable to more and
the powerful functionality achieved without the use of the
<br>
control key justifies the differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tags interface has been
included in a program that is not a text editor because it
promotes another degree of consistent operation with vi. It
is conceivable that the paging <br>
environment of more would be superior for browsing source
code files in some circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operating mode referred to
for block-mode terminals effectively adds a &lt;newline&gt;
to each Synopsis line that currently has none. So, for
example, d &lt;newline&gt; would page one <br>
screenful. The mode could be triggered by a command line
option, environment variable, or some other method. The
details are not imposed by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 <br>
because there are so few systems known to support such
terminals. Nevertheless, it was considered that all systems
should be able to support more given the exception cited for
<br>
this small community of terminals because, in comparison to
vi, the cursor movements are few and the command set
relatively amenable to the optional &lt;newline&gt;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some versions of more provide a
shell escaping mechanism similar to the ex ! command. The
standard developers did not consider that this was necessary
in a paginator, particu&acirc; <br>
larly given the wide acceptance of multiple window terminals
and job control features. (They chose to retain such
features in the editors and mailx because the shell
interaction <br>
also gives an opportunity to modify the editing buffer,
which is not applicable to more.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p (position) option
replaces the + command because of the Utility Syntax
Guidelines. In early proposals, it took a pattern argument,
but historical less provided the more <br>
general facility of a command. It would have been desirable
to use the same -c as ex and vi, but the letter was already
in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text stating &quot;from a
non-rewindable stream ... implementations may limit the
amount of backwards motion supported&quot; would allow an
implementation that permitted no backwards <br>
motion beyond text already on the screen. It was not
possible to require a minimum amount of backwards motion
that would be effective for all conceivable device types.
The imple&acirc; <br>
mentation should allow the user to back up as far as
possible, within device and reasonable memory allocation
constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, non-printable
characters were displayed using the ARPA standard mappings,
which are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Printable characters are left
alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Control characters less than
177 are represented as followed by the character offset from
the &rsquo;@&rsquo; character in the ASCII map; for example,
07 is represented as &rsquo;G&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. 177 is represented as
followed by &rsquo;?&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The display of characters having
their eighth bit set was less standard. Existing
implementations use hex (0x00), octal ( 00), and a meta-bit
display. (The latter displayed <br>
characters with their eighth bit set as the two characters
&quot;M-&quot;, followed by the seven-bit display as
described previously.) The latter probably has the best
claim to historical <br>
practice because it was used with the -v option of 4 BSD and
4 BSD-derived versions of the cat utility since 1980.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No specific display format is
required by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Implementations are
encouraged to conform to historic practice in the absence of
any strong reason to diverge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
