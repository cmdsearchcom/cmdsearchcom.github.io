<p>PS(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual PS(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ps - report process status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ps [-aA][-defl][-G grouplist][-o format]...[-p proclist][-t
termlist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-U userlist][-g grouplist][-n
namelist][-u userlist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ps utility shall write information about processes,
subject to having the appropriate privileges to obtain
information about those processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ps shall select all
processes with the same effective user ID as the current
user and the same controlling terminal as the invoker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ps utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Write information for all
processes associated with terminals. Implementations may
omit session leaders from this list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Write information for all
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Write information for all
processes, except session leaders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Write information for all
processes. (Equivalent to -A.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Generate a full listing. (See
the STDOUT section for the contents of a full listing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g grouplist <br>
Write information for processes whose session leaders are
given in grouplist. The application shall ensure that the
grouplist is a single argument in the form of a
&lt;blank&gt; <br>
or comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G grouplist <br>
Write information for processes whose real group ID numbers
are given in grouplist. The application shall ensure that
the grouplist is a single argument in the form of a <br>
&lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Generate a long listing. (See
STDOUT for the contents of a long listing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n namelist <br>
Specify the name of an alternative system namelist file in
place of the default. The name of the default file and the
format of a namelist file are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o format <br>
Write information according to the format specification
given in format. This is fully described in the STDOUT
section. Multiple -o options can be specified; the format
<br>
specification shall be interpreted as the
&lt;space&gt;-separated concatenation of all the format
option-arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p proclist <br>
Write information for processes whose process ID numbers are
given in proclist. The application shall ensure that the
proclist is a single argument in the form of a <br>
&lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t termlist <br>
Write information for processes associated with terminals
given in termlist. The application shall ensure that the
termlist is a single argument in the form of a &lt;blank&gt;
<br>
or comma-separated list. Terminal identifiers shall be given
in an implementation-defined format. On XSI-conformant
systems, they shall be given in one of two forms: the <br>
device&rsquo;s filename (for example, tty04) or, if the
device&rsquo;s filename starts with tty, just the identifier
following the characters tty (for example, &quot;04&quot;
).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u userlist <br>
Write information for processes whose user ID numbers or
login names are given in userlist. The application shall
ensure that the userlist is a single argument in the form
<br>
of a &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated list. In the listing,
the numerical user ID shall be written unless the -f option
is used, in which case the login name shall be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U userlist <br>
Write information for processes whose real user ID numbers
or login names are given in userlist. The application shall
ensure that the userlist is a single argument in the <br>
form of a &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the exception of -o format,
all of the options shown are used to select processes. If
any are specified, the default list shall be ignored and ps
shall select the processes <br>
represented by the inclusive OR of all the
selection-criteria options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
Override the system-selected horizontal display line size,
used to determine the number of text columns to display. See
the Base Definitions volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables for
valid values and results when it is unset or null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME <br>
Determine the format and contents of the date and time
strings displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
to calculate date and time strings displayed. If TZ is unset
or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
When the -o option is not specified, the standard output
format is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On XSI-conformant systems, the
output format shall be as follows. The column headings and
descriptions of the columns in a ps listing are given below.
The precise meanings of <br>
these fields are implementation-defined. The letters
&rsquo;f&rsquo; and &rsquo;l&rsquo; (below) indicate the
option ( full or long) that shall cause the corresponding
heading to appear; all means that <br>
the heading always appears. Note that these two options
determine only what information is provided for a process;
they do not determine which processes are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F (l) Flags (octal and additive)
associated <br>
with the process. <br>
S (l) The state of the process. <br>
UID (f,l) The user ID number of the process owner; <br>
the login name is printed under the -f <br>
option. <br>
PID (all) The process ID of the process; it is <br>
possible to kill a process if this datum <br>
is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PPID (f,l) The process ID of the
parent process. <br>
C (f,l) Processor utilization for scheduling. <br>
PRI (l) The priority of the process; higher num&acirc; <br>
bers mean lower priority. <br>
NI (l) Nice value; used in priority computa&acirc; <br>
tion. <br>
ADDR (l) The address of the process. <br>
SZ (l) The size in blocks of the core image of <br>
the process. <br>
WCHAN (l) The event for which the process is wait&acirc;
<br>
ing or sleeping; if blank, the process <br>
is running. <br>
STIME (f) Starting time of the process. <br>
TTY (all) The controlling terminal for the <br>
process. <br>
TIME (all) The cumulative execution time for the <br>
process. <br>
CMD (all) The command name; the full command name <br>
and its arguments are written under the <br>
-f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A process that has exited and
has a parent, but has not yet been waited for by the parent,
shall be marked defunct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under the option -f, ps tries to
determine the command name and arguments given when the
process was created by examining memory or the swap area.
Failing this, the command name, <br>
as it would appear without the option -f, is written in
square brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o option allows the output
format to be specified under user control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application shall ensure
that the format specification is a list of names presented
as a single argument, &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated. Each
variable has a default header. The <br>
default header can be overridden by appending an equals sign
and the new text of the header. The rest of the characters
in the argument shall be used as the header text. The <br>
fields specified shall be written in the order specified on
the command line, and should be arranged in columns in the
output. The field widths shall be selected by the system to
<br>
be at least as wide as the header text (default or
overridden value). If the header text is null, such as -o
user=, the field width shall be at least as wide as the
default <br>
header text. If all header text fields are null, no header
line shall be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following names are
recognized in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ruser The real user ID of the
process. This shall be the textual user ID, if it can be
obtained and the field width permits, or a decimal
representation otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user The effective user ID of
the process. This shall be the textual user ID, if it can be
obtained and the field width permits, or a decimal
representation otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rgroup The real group ID of the
process. This shall be the textual group ID, if it can be
obtained and the field width permits, or a decimal
representation otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group The effective group ID of
the process. This shall be the textual group ID, if it can
be obtained and the field width permits, or a decimal
representation otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid The decimal value of the
process ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppid The decimal value of the
parent process ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgid The decimal value of the
process group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcpu The ratio of CPU time used
recently to CPU time available in the same period, expressed
as a percentage. The meaning of &quot;recently&quot; in this
context is unspecified. The CPU <br>
time available is determined in an unspecified manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vsz The size of the process in
(virtual) memory in 1024 byte units as a decimal
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice The decimal value of the
nice value of the process; see nice() .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">etime In the POSIX locale, the
elapsed time since the process was started, in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[dd-]hh:]mm:ss</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where dd shall represent the
number of days, hh the number of hours, mm the number of
minutes, and ss the number of seconds. The dd field shall be
a decimal integer. The hh, mm, <br>
and ss fields shall be two-digit decimal integers padded on
the left with zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time In the POSIX locale, the
cumulative CPU time of the process in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[dd-]hh:mm:ss</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dd, hh, mm, and ss fields
shall be as described in the etime specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tty The name of the controlling
terminal of the process (if any) in the same format used by
the who utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comm The name of the command
being executed ( argv[0] value) as a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">args The command with all its
arguments as a string. The implementation may truncate this
value to the field width; it is implementation-defined
whether any further truncation <br>
occurs. It is unspecified whether the string represented is
a version of the argument list as it was passed to the
command when it started, or is a version of the argu&acirc;
<br>
ments as they may have been modified by the application.
Applications cannot depend on being able to modify their
argument list and having that modification be reflected <br>
in the output of ps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any field need not be meaningful
in all implementations. In such a case a hyphen (
&rsquo;-&rsquo; ) should be output in place of the field
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only comm and args shall be
allowed to contain &lt;blank&gt;s; all others shall not. Any
implementation-defined variables shall be specified in the
system documentation along with the <br>
default header and indicating whether the field may contain
&lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following table specifies
the default header to be used in the POSIX locale
corresponding to each format specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table: Variable Names and

The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Things can change while ps is running; the snapshot it gives
is only true for an instant, and might not be accurate by
the time it is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The args format specifier is
allowed to produce a truncated version of the command
arguments. In some implementations, this information is no
longer available when the ps utility <br>
is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the field width is too narrow
to display a textual ID, the system may use a numeric
version. Normally, the system would be expected to choose
large enough field widths, but if <br>
a large number of fields were selected to write, it might
squeeze fields to their minimum sizes to fit on one line.
One way to ensure adequate width for the textual IDs is to
<br>
override the default header for a field to make it larger
than most or all user or group names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no special quoting
mechanism for header text. The header text is the rest of
the argument. If multiple header changes are needed,
multiple -o options can be used, such <br>
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps -o &quot;user=User Name&quot;
-o pid=Process&nbsp;ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some implementations,
especially multi-level secure systems, ps may be severely
restricted and produce information only about child
processes owned by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps -o user,pid,ppid=MOM -o
args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writes at least the following in
the POSIX locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER PID MOM COMMAND <br>
helene 34 12 ps -o uid,pid,ppid=MOM -o args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the COMMAND
field need not be the same in all implementations, due to
possible truncation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
There is very little commonality between BSD and System V
implementations of ps. Many options conflict or have subtly
different usages. The standard developers attempted to <br>
select a set of options for the base standard that were
useful on a wide range of systems and selected options that
either can be implemented on both BSD and System V-based
sys&acirc; <br>
tems without breaking the current implementations or where
the options are sufficiently similar that any changes would
not be unduly problematic for users or implementors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recognized that on some
implementations, especially multi-level secure systems, ps
may be nearly useless. The default output has therefore been
chosen such that it does not <br>
break historical implementations and also is likely to
provide at least some useful information on most
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The major change is the addition
of the format specification capability. The motivation for
this invention is to provide a mechanism for users to access
a wider range of system <br>
information, if the system permits it, in a portable manner.
The fields chosen to appear in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 were arrived at after considering what concepts
<br>
were likely to be both reasonably useful to the
&quot;average&quot; user and had a reasonable chance of
being implemented on a wide range of systems. Again it is
recognized that not all <br>
systems are able to provide all the information and,
conversely, some may wish to provide more. It is hoped that
the approach adopted will be sufficiently flexible and
extensible <br>
to accommodate most systems. Implementations may be expected
to introduce new format specifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default output should
consist of a short listing containing the process ID,
terminal name, cumulative execution time, and command name
of each process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preference of the standard
developers would have been to make the format specification
an operand of the ps command. Unfortunately, BSD usage
precluded this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At one time a format was
included to display the environment array of the process.
This was deleted because there is no portable way to display
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -A option is equivalent to
the BSD -g and the SVID -e. Because the two systems
differed, a mnemonic compromise was selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a option is described with
some optional behavior because the SVID omits session
leaders, but BSD does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an early proposal, format
specifiers appeared for priority and start time. The former
was not defined adequately in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 and was removed in def&acirc; <br>
erence to the defined nice value; the latter because elapsed
time was considered to be more useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a new BSD version of ps, a -O
option can be used to write all of the default information,
followed by additional format specifiers. This was not
adopted because the default <br>
output is implementation-defined. Nevertheless, this is a
useful option that should be reserved for that purpose. In
the -o option for the POSIX Shell and Utilities ps, the
for&acirc; <br>
mat is the concatenation of each -o. Therefore, the user can
have an alias or function that defines the beginning of
their desired format and add more fields to the end of the
<br>
output in certain cases where that would be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the terminal name
is unspecified, but the descriptions of ps, talk, who, and
write require that they all use the same format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pcpu field indicates that
the CPU time available is determined in an unspecified
manner. This is because it is difficult to express an
algorithm that is useful across all <br>
possible machine architectures. Historical counterparts to
this value have attempted to show percentage of use in the
recent past, such as the preceding minute. Frequently, these
<br>
values for all processes did not add up to 100%.
Implementations are encouraged to provide data in this field
to users that will help them identify processes currently
affecting <br>
the performance of the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
