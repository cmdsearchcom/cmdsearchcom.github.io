<p>CTAGS(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual CTAGS(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ctags - create a tags file (DEVELOPMENT, FORTRAN)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ctags [-a][-f tagsfile] pathname ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctags -x pathname ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ctags utility shall be provided on systems that support
the User Portability Utilities option, the Software
Development Utilities option, and either or both of the
C-Language <br>
Development Utilities option and FORTRAN Development
Utilities option. On other systems, it is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ctags utility shall write a
tagsfile or an index of objects from C-language or FORTRAN
source files specified by the pathname operands. The
tagsfile shall list the locators <br>
of language-specific objects within the source files. A
locator consists of a name, pathname, and either a search
pattern or a line number that can be used in searching for
the <br>
object definition. The objects that shall be recognized are
specified in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ctags utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Append to tagsfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f tagsfile <br>
Write the object locator lists into tagsfile instead of the
default file named tags in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Produce a list of object
names, the line number, and filename in which each is
defined, as well as the text of that line, and write this to
the standard output. A tagsfile <br>
shall not be created when -x is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following pathname operands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.c Files with basenames
ending with the .c suffix shall be treated as C-language
source code. Such files that are not valid input to c99
produce unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.h Files with basenames
ending with the .h suffix shall be treated as C-language
source code. Such files that are not valid input to c99
produce unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.f Files with basenames
ending with the .f suffix shall be treated as
FORTRAN-language source code. Such files that are not valid
input to fort77 produce unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The handling of other files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files containing source code
in the language indicated by the operand filename
suffixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ctags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the order in which
output is sorted for the -x option. The POSIX locale
determines the order in which the tagsfile is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files). When processing C-language source code, if the
locale is not compatible with the C locale described by the
ISO C standard, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The list of object name information produced by the -x
option shall be written to standard output in the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s %d %s %s&quot;,
&lt;object-name&gt;, &lt;line-number&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;,
&lt;text&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;text&gt; is the text
of line &lt;line-number&gt; of file &lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
When the -x option is not specified, the format of the
output file shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s%s/%s/0,
&lt;identifier&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;pattern&gt; is a
search pattern that could be used by an editor to find the
defining instance of &lt;identifier&gt; in &lt;filename&gt;
(where defining instance is indicated by the dec&acirc; <br>
larations listed in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional circumflex (
&rsquo;^&rsquo; ) can be added as a prefix to
&lt;pattern&gt;, and an optional dollar sign can be appended
to &lt;pattern&gt; to indicate that the pattern is anchored
to the <br>
beginning (end) of a line of text. Any slash or backslash
characters in &lt;pattern&gt; shall be preceded by a
backslash character. The anchoring circumflex, dollar sign,
and escaping <br>
backslash characters shall not be considered part of the
search pattern. All other characters in the search pattern
shall be considered literal characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative format is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s%s?%s?0,
&lt;identifier&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is identical to the first
format except that slashes in &lt;pattern&gt; shall not be
preceded by escaping backslash characters, and question mark
characters in &lt;pattern&gt; shall be <br>
preceded by backslash characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second alternative format
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s%s%d0,
&lt;identifier&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;lineno&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;lineno&gt; is a
decimal line number that could be used by an editor to find
&lt;identifier&gt; in &lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither alternative format shall
be produced by ctags when it is used as described by IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, but the standard utilities that process
tags files shall be able to <br>
process those formats as well as the first format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any of these formats, the
file shall be sorted by identifier, based on the collation
sequence in the POSIX locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
If the operand identifies C-language source, the ctags
utility shall attempt to produce an output line for each of
the following objects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Function definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Type definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Macros with arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may also produce output for
any of the following objects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Function prototypes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Structures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Unions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Global variable
definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Enumeration types</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Macros without arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* #define statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* #line statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any #if and #ifdef statements
shall produce no output. The tag main is treated specially
in C programs. The tag formed shall be created by prefixing
M to the name of the file, <br>
with the trailing .c, and leading pathname components (if
any) removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that do not support
the C-Language Development Utilities option, ctags produces
unspecified results for C-language source code files. It
should write to standard error <br>
a message identifying this condition and cause a non-zero
exit status to be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the operand identifies
FORTRAN source, the ctags utility shall produce an output
line for each function definition. It may also produce
output for any of the following <br>
objects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Subroutine definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* COMMON statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* PARAMETER statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* DATA and BLOCK DATA
statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Statement numbers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that do not support
the FORTRAN Development Utilities option, ctags produces
unspecified results for FORTRAN source code files. It should
write to standard error a <br>
message identifying this condition and cause a non-zero exit
status to be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is implementation-defined
what other objects (including duplicate identifiers) produce
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The output with -x is meant to be a simple index that can be
written out as an off-line readable function index. If the
input files to ctags (such as .c files) were not created
<br>
using the same locale as that in effect when ctags -x is
run, results might not be as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description of C-language
processing says &quot;attempts to&quot; because the C
language can be greatly confused, especially through the use
of #defines, and this utility would be of <br>
no use if the real C preprocessor were run to identify them.
The output from ctags may be fooled and incorrect for
various constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The option list was significantly reduced from that provided
by historical implementations. The -F option was omitted as
redundant, since it is the default. The -B option was <br>
omitted as being of very limited usefulness. The -t option
was omitted since the recognition of typedefs is now
required for C source files. The -u option was omitted
because the <br>
update function was judged to be not only inefficient, but
also rarely needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal included a -w
option to suppress warning diagnostics. Since the types of
such diagnostics could not be described, the option was
omitted as being not useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text for LC_CTYPE about
compatibility with the C locale acknowledges that the ISO C
standard imposes requirements on the locale used to process
C source. This could easily be <br>
a superset of that known as &quot;the C locale&quot; by way
of implementation extensions, or one of a few alternative
locales for systems supporting different codesets. No
statement is <br>
made for FORTRAN because the ANSI X3.9-1978 standard
(FORTRAN 77) does not (yet) define a similar locale concept.
However, a general rule in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 <br>
is that any time that locales do not match (preparing a file
for one locale and processing it in another), the results
are suspect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The collation sequence of the
tags file is not affected by LC_COLLATE because it is
typically not used by human readers, but only by programs
such as vi to locate the tag within <br>
the source files. Using the POSIX locale eliminates some of
the problems of coordinating locales between the ctags file
creator and the vi file reader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the tags file has
been used only by ex and vi. However, the format of the tags
file has been published to encourage other programs to use
the tags in new ways. The <br>
format allows either patterns or line numbers to find the
identifiers because the historical vi recognizes either. The
ctags utility does not produce the format using line
num&acirc; <br>
bers because it is not useful following any source file
changes that add or delete lines. The documented search
patterns match historical practice. It should be noted that
lit&acirc; <br>
eral leading circumflex or trailing dollar-sign characters
in the search pattern will only behave correctly if anchored
to the beginning of the line or end of the line by an <br>
additional circumflex or dollar-sign character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations also
understand the objects used by the languages Pascal and
sometimes LISP, and they understand the C source output by
lex and yacc. The ctags utility <br>
is not required to accommodate these languages, although
implementors are encouraged to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following historical option
was not specified, as vgrind is not included in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v If the -v flag is given, an
index of the form expected by vgrind is produced on the
standard output. This listing contains the function name,
filename, and page number <br>
(assuming 64-line pages). Since the output is sorted into
lexicographic order, it may be desired to run the output
through sort -f. Sample use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctags -v files | sort -f &gt;
index vgrind -x index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special treatment of the tag
main makes the use of ctags practical in directories with
more than one program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
