<p>NICE(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual NICE(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nice - invoke a utility with an altered nice value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nice [-n increment] utility [argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The nice utility shall invoke a utility, requesting that it
be run with a different nice value (see the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.239, Nice <br>
Value). With no options and only if the user has appropriate
privileges, the executed utility shall be run with a nice
value that is some implementation-defined quantity less <br>
than or equal to the nice value of the current process. If
the user lacks appropriate privileges to affect the nice
value in the requested manner, the nice utility shall not
<br>
affect the nice value; in this case, a warning message may
be written to standard error, but this shall not prevent the
invocation of utility or affect the exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The nice utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option is
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n increment <br>
A positive or negative decimal integer which shall have the
same effect on the execution of the utility as if the
utility had called the nice() function with the numeric <br>
value of the increment option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utility <br>
The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If the utility
operand names any of the special built-in utilities in
Special Built-In Utilities, the results are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
Any string to be supplied as an argument when invoking the
utility named by the utility operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of nice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the search path
used to locate the utility to be invoked. See the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8,
Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If utility is invoked, the exit status of nice shall be the
exit status of utility; otherwise, the nice utility shall
exit with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1-125 An error occurred in the
nice utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 The utility specified by
utility was found but could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 The utility specified by
utility could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The only guaranteed portable uses of this utility are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run utility with the default
lower nice value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice -n &lt;positive integer&gt;
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run utility with a lower nice
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some implementations they
have no discernible effect on the invoked utility and on
some others they are exactly equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical systems have
frequently supported the &lt;positive integer&gt; up to 20.
Since there is no error penalty associated with guessing a
number that is too high, users without <br>
access to the system conformance document (to see what
limits are actually in place) could use the historical 1 to
20 range or attempt to use very large numbers if the job
should <br>
be truly low priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nice value of a process can
be displayed using the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps -o nice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command, env, nice, nohup,
time, and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit
code 127 if an error occurs so that applications can
distinguish &quot;failure to find a util&acirc; <br>
ity&quot; from &quot;invoked utility exited with an error
indication&quot;. The value 127 was chosen because it is not
commonly used for other meanings; most utilities use small
values for <br>
&quot;normal error conditions&quot; and the values above 128
can be confused with termination due to receipt of a signal.
The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate
that the <br>
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differentiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is <br>
based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts
to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when
any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Due to the text about the limits of the nice value being
implementation-defined, nice is not actually required to
change the nice value of the executed command; the limits
could <br>
be zero differences from the system default, although the
implementor is required to document this fact in the
conformance document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 4.3 BSD version of nice does
not check whether increment is a valid decimal integer. The
command nice -x utility, for example, would be treated the
same as the command nice <br>
--1 utility. If the user does not have appropriate
privileges, this results in a &quot;permission denied&quot;
error. This is considered a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user without appropriate
privileges gives a negative increment, System V treats it
like the command nice -0 utility, while 4.3 BSD writes a
&quot;permission denied&quot; message and <br>
does not run the utility. Neither was considered clearly
superior, so the behavior was left unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C shell has a built-in
version of nice that has a different interface from the one
described in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term &quot;utility&quot; is
used, rather than &quot;command&quot;, to highlight the fact
that shell compound commands, pipelines, and so on, cannot
be used. Special built-ins also cannot be <br>
used. However, &quot;utility&quot; includes user application
programs and shell scripts, not just utilities defined in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations of
nice provide a nice value range of 40 or 41 discrete steps,
with the default nice value being the midpoint of that
range. By default, they lower the <br>
nice value of the executed utility by 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical documentation
states that the increment value must be within a fixed
range. This is misleading; the valid increment values on any
invocation are determined by the <br>
current process nice value, which is not always the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of nice value is
not intended to suggest that all processes in a system have
priorities that are comparable. Scheduling policy extensions
such as the realtime <br>
priorities in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 make the notion of a single underlying priority
for all scheduling policies problematic. Some
implementations <br>
may implement the nice-related features to affect all
processes on the system, others to affect just the general
time-sharing activities implied by this volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, and others may have no effect at all.
Because of the use of &quot;implementation-defined&quot; in
nice and renice, a wide range of implementation strategies
are pos&acirc; <br>
sible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
