<p>CD(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual CD(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cd - change the working directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cd [-L | -P] [directory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cd utility shall change the working directory of the
current shell execution environment (see Shell Execution
Environment ) by executing the following steps in sequence.
(In <br>
the following steps, the symbol curpath represents an
intermediate value used to simplify the description of the
algorithm used by cd. There is no requirement that curpath
be <br>
made visible to the application.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If no directory operand is
given and the HOME environment variable is empty or
undefined, the default behavior is implementation-defined
and no further steps shall be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If no directory operand is
given and the HOME environment variable is set to a
non-empty value, the cd utility shall behave as if the
directory named in the HOME environment <br>
variable was specified as the directory operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the directory operand
begins with a slash character, set curpath to the operand
and proceed to step 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the first component of the
directory operand is dot or dot-dot, proceed to step 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Starting with the first
pathname in the colon-separated pathnames of CDPATH (see the
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section) if the pathname is non-null,
test if the concatenation of <br>
that pathname, a slash character, and the directory operand
names a directory. If the pathname is null, test if the
concatenation of dot, a slash character, and the operand
<br>
names a directory. In either case, if the resulting string
names an existing directory, set curpath to that string and
proceed to step 7. Otherwise, repeat this step with <br>
the next pathname in CDPATH until all pathnames have been
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Set curpath to the string
formed by the concatenation of the value of PWD, a slash
character, and the operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. If the -P option is in
effect, the cd utility shall perform actions equivalent to
the chdir() function, called with curpath as the path
argument. If these actions succeed, <br>
the PWD environment variable shall be set to an absolute
pathname for the current working directory and shall not
contain filename components that, in the context of pathname
<br>
resolution, refer to a file of type symbolic link. If there
is insufficient permission on the new directory, or on any
parent of that directory, to determine the current <br>
working directory, the value of the PWD environment variable
is unspecified. If the actions equivalent to chdir() fail
for any reason, the cd utility shall display an appro&acirc;
<br>
priate error message and not alter the PWD environment
variable. Whether the actions equivalent to chdir() succeed
or fail, no further steps shall be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. The curpath value shall then
be converted to canonical form as follows, considering each
component from beginning to end, in sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. Dot components and any
slashes that separate them from the next component shall be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. For each dot-dot component,
if there is a preceding component and it is neither root nor
dot-dot, the preceding component, all slashes separating the
preceding component <br>
from dot-dot, dot-dot and all slashes separating dot-dot
from the following component shall be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. An implementation may further
simplify curpath by removing any trailing slash characters
that are not also leading slashes, replacing multiple
non-leading consecutive <br>
slashes with a single slash, and replacing three or more
leading slashes with a single slash. If, as a result of this
canonicalization, the curpath variable is null, no <br>
further steps shall be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. The cd utility shall then
perform actions equivalent to the chdir() function called
with curpath as the path argument. If these actions failed
for any reason, the cd utility <br>
shall display an appropriate error message and no further
steps shall be taken. The PWD environment variable shall be
set to curpath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, during the execution of the
above steps, the PWD environment variable is changed, the
OLDPWD environment variable shall also be changed to the
value of the old working direc&acirc; <br>
tory (that is the current working directory immediately
prior to the call to cd).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The cd utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Handle the operand dot-dot
logically; symbolic link components shall not be resolved
before dot-dot components are processed (see steps 8. and 9.
in the DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Handle the operand dot-dot
physically; symbolic link components shall be resolved
before dot-dot components are processed (see step 7. in the
DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both -L and -P options are
specified, the last of these options shall be used and all
others ignored. If neither -L nor -P is specified, the
operand shall be handled dot-dot <br>
logically; see the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory <br>
An absolute or relative pathname of the directory that shall
become the new working directory. The interpretation of a
relative pathname by cd depends on the -L option and <br>
the CDPATH and PWD environment variables. If directory is an
empty string, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- When a hyphen is used as the
operand, this shall be equivalent to the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd &quot;$OLDPWD&quot;
&amp;&amp; pwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which changes to the previous
working directory and then writes its name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of cd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDPATH A colon-separated list of
pathnames that refer to directories. The cd utility shall
use this list in its attempt to change the directory, as
described in the DESCRIPTION. <br>
An empty string in place of a directory pathname represents
the current directory. If CDPATH is not set, it shall be
treated as if it were an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME The name of the directory,
used when no directory operand is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDPWD A pathname of the
previous working directory, used by cd -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PWD This variable shall be set
as specified in the DESCRIPTION. If an application sets or
unsets the value of PWD, the behavior of cd is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if cd
- is used, an absolute pathname of the new working directory
shall be written to the standard output as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;new
directory&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, there shall be no
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The directory was successfully
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
The working directory shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Since cd affects the current shell execution environment, it
is always provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is
called in a subshell or separate utility execution
environ&acirc; <br>
ment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(cd /tmp) <br>
nohup cd <br>
find . -exec cd {} ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it does not affect the working
directory of the caller&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user must have execute
(search) permission in directory in order to change to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The use of the CDPATH was introduced in the System V shell.
Its use is analogous to the use of the PATH variable in the
shell. The BSD C shell used a shell parameter cdpath for
<br>
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common extension when HOME is
undefined is to get the login directory from the user
database for the invoking user. This does not occur on
System V implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical shells, such as
the KornShell, took special actions when the directory name
contained a dot-dot component, selecting the logical parent
of the directory, rather <br>
than the actual parent directory; that is, it moved up one
level toward the &rsquo;/&rsquo; in the pathname,
remembering what the user typed, rather than performing the
equivalent of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir(&quot;..&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In such a shell, the following
commands would not necessarily produce equivalent output for
all directories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd .. &amp;&amp; ls ls ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior is now the
default. It is not consistent with the definition of dot-dot
in most historical practice; that is, while this behavior
has been optionally available in <br>
the KornShell, other shells have historically not supported
this functionality. The logical pathname is stored in the
PWD environment variable when the cd utility completes and
<br>
this value is used to construct the next directory name if
cd is invoked with the -L option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
