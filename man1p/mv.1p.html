<p>MV(1P) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual MV(1P)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mv - move files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mv [-fi] source_file target_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv [-fi] source_file...
target_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In the first synopsis form, the mv utility shall move the
file named by the source_file operand to the destination
specified by the target_file. This first synopsis form is
<br>
assumed when the final operand does not name an existing
directory and is not a symbolic link referring to an
existing directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second synopsis form, mv
shall move each file named by a source_file operand to a
destination file in the existing directory named by the
target_dir operand, or referenced <br>
if target_dir is a symbolic link referring to an existing
directory. The destination path for each source_file shall
be the concatenation of the target directory, a single slash
<br>
character, and the last pathname component of the
source_file. This second form is assumed when the final
operand names an existing directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any operand specifies an
existing file of a type not specified by the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the behavior is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each source_file the
following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the destination path
exists, the -f option is not specified, and either of the
following conditions is true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The permissions of the
destination path do not permit writing and the standard
input is a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. The -i option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the mv utility shall write a
prompt to standard error and read a line from standard
input. If the response is not affirmative, mv shall do
nothing more with the current <br>
source_file and go on to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The mv utility shall perform
actions equivalent to the rename() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, called
with the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The source_file operand is
used as the old argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. The destination path is used
as the new argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this succeeds, mv shall do
nothing more with the current source_file and go on to any
remaining source_files. If this fails for any reasons other
than those described for the <br>
errno [EXDEV] in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, mv shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with the current source_file, and go
<br>
on to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the destination path
exists, and it is a file of type directory and source_file
is not a file of type directory, or it is a file not of type
directory and source_file is a <br>
file of type directory, mv shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with the current
source_file, and go on to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the destination path
exists, mv shall attempt to remove it. If this fails for any
reason, mv shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with the <br>
current source_file, and go on to any remaining
source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The file hierarchy rooted in
source_file shall be duplicated as a file hierarchy rooted
in the destination path. If source_file or any of the files
below it in the hierarchy <br>
are symbolic links, the links themselves shall be
duplicated, including their contents, rather than any files
to which they refer. The following characteristics of each
file <br>
in the file hierarchy shall be duplicated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The time of last data
modification and time of last access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The user ID and group ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The file mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user ID, group ID, or
file mode of a regular file cannot be duplicated, the file
mode bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID shall not be duplicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When files are duplicated to
another file system, the implementation may require that the
process invoking mv has read access to each file being
duplicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the duplication of the file
hierarchy fails for any reason, mv shall write a diagnostic
message to standard error, do nothing more with the current
source_file, and go on to <br>
any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the duplication of the file
characteristics fails for any reason, mv shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error, but this failure shall
not cause mv to modify its exit <br>
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The file hierarchy rooted in
source_file shall be removed. If this fails for any reason,
mv shall write a diagnostic message to the standard error,
do nothing more with the <br>
current source_file, and go on to any remaining
source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The mv utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not prompt for
confirmation if the destination path exists. Any previous
occurrence of the -i option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Prompt for confirmation if
the destination path exists. Any previous occurrence of the
-f option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
-f or -i options shall not be considered an error. The last
option specified shall determine the behavior of mv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_file <br>
A pathname of a file or directory to be moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_file <br>
A new pathname for the file or directory being moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_dir <br>
A pathname of an existing directory into which to move the
input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used to read an input line in
response to each prompt specified in the STDERR section.
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files specified by each source_file operand can be
of any file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of mv:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internation&acirc; <br>
alization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the locale for the
behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
collating elements used in the extended regular expression
defined for the <br>
yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and <br>
input files), the behavior of character classes used in the
extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr locale
keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative
responses that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH <br>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the
processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
Prompts shall be written to the standard error under the
conditions specified in the DESCRIPTION section. The prompts
shall contain the destination pathname, but their format is
<br>
otherwise unspecified. Otherwise, the standard error shall
be used only for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
The output files may be of any file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were moved
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If the copying or removal of source_file is prematurely
terminated by a signal or error, mv may leave a partial copy
of source_file at the source or destination. The mv utility
<br>
shall not modify both source_file and the destination path
simultaneously; termination at any point shall leave either
source_file or the destination path complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Some implementations mark for update the st_ctime field of
renamed files and some do not. Applications which make use
of the st_ctime field may behave differently with respect to
<br>
renamed files unless they are designed to allow for either
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If the current directory contains only files a (of any type
defined by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001), b (also of any type), and a directory c:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv a b c <br>
mv c d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">results with the original files
a and b residing in the directory d in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Early proposals diverged from the SVID and BSD historical
practice in that they required that when the destination
path exists, the -f option is not specified, and input is
not a <br>
terminal, mv fails. This was done for compatibility with cp.
The current text returns to historical practice. It should
be noted that this is consistent with the rename()
func&acirc; <br>
tion defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, which does not require write permission on the
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For absolute clarity, paragraph
(1), describing the behavior of mv when prompting for
confirmation, should be interpreted in the following
manner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (exists AND (NOT f_option)
AND <br>
((not_writable AND input_is_terminal) OR i_option))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option exists on BSD
systems, giving applications and users a way to avoid
accidentally unlinking files when moving others. When the
standard input is not a terminal, the <br>
4.3 BSD mv deletes all existing destination paths without
prompting, even when -i is specified; this is inconsistent
with the behavior of the 4.3 BSD cp utility, which always
<br>
generates an error when the file is unwritable and the
standard input is not a terminal. The standard developers
decided that use of -i is a request for interaction, so when
the <br>
destination path exists, the utility takes instructions from
whatever responds to standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rename() function is able to
move directories within the same file system. Some
historical versions of mv have been able to move
directories, but not to a different file <br>
system. The standard developers considered that this was an
annoying inconsistency, so this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 requires directories to be able to be moved even
across <br>
file systems. There is no -R option to confirm that moving a
directory is actually intended, since such an option was not
required for moving directories in historical practice. <br>
Requiring the application to specify it sometimes, depending
on the destination, seemed just as inconsistent. The
semantics of the rename() function were preserved as much as
<br>
possible. For example, mv is not permitted to
&quot;rename&quot; files to or from directories, even though
they might be empty and removable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historic implementations of mv
did not exit with a non-zero exit status if they were unable
to duplicate any file characteristics when moving a file
across file systems, nor did <br>
they write a diagnostic message for the user. The former
behavior has been preserved to prevent scripts from
breaking; a diagnostic message is now required, however, so
that <br>
users are alerted that the file characteristics have
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact format of the
interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature
of the contents of prompts are specified because
implementations may desire more descriptive <br>
prompts than those used on historical implementations.
Therefore, an application not using the -f option or using
the -i option relies on the system to provide the most
suitable <br>
dialog directly with the user, based on the behavior
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When mv is dealing with a single
file system and source_file is a symbolic link, the link
itself is moved as a consequence of the dependence on the
rename() functionality, per <br>
the DESCRIPTION. Across file systems, this has to be made
explicit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
