<p>DUMMY-UPS(8) NUT Manual DUMMY-UPS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dummy-ups - Driver for multi-purpose UPS emulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the specific features of the
dummy-ups driver. For information about the core driver, see
nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is a multi-purpose UPS emulation tool. Its
behavior depends on the running mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dummy Mode <br>
dummy-ups looks like a standard device driver to upsd(8) and
allows one to change any value for testing purposes. It is
both interactive, controllable through the upsrw(1) and <br>
upscmd(1) commands (or equivalent graphical tool), and
batchable through script files. It can be configured,
launched and used as any other real driver. This mode is
mostly <br>
useful for development and testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeater Mode <br>
dummy-ups acts as a NUT client, simply forwarding data. This
can be useful for supervision purposes. This can also allow
some load sharing between several UPS instances, using a
<br>
point-to-point communication with the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION <br>
The port specification depends on the running mode, and
allows the driver to select the right mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dummy Mode <br>
Port is a definition file name for dummy-ups. This can
either be an absolute or a relative path name. In the latter
case the NUT sysconfig directory (ie /etc/nut, <br>
/usr/local/ups/etc, ...) is prepended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[dummy] <br>
driver = dummy-ups <br>
port = evolution500.dev <br>
desc = &quot;dummy-ups in dummy mode&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file is generally named
&quot;something.dev&quot;. It contains a list of all valid
data and associated values, and has the same format as an
upsc(8) dump (&lt;varname&gt;: &lt;value&gt;). So you <br>
can easily create definition files from an existing UPS
using &quot;upsc &gt; file.dev&quot;. It can also be empty,
in which case only a basic set of data is available:
device., driver., <br>
ups.mfr, ups.model, ups.status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Samples definition files are
available in the &quot;data&quot; directory of the nut
source tree, and generally in the sysconfig directory of
your system distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since dummy-ups will loop on
reading this file, you can dynamically modify it to interact
with the driver. This will avoid message spam into your
system log files, if you are <br>
using NUT default configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use the &quot;TIMER
&lt;seconds&gt;&quot; instruction to create scheduled events
sequences. For example, the following sequence will loop on
switching ups.status between &quot;OL&quot;, &quot;OB&quot;
<br>
and &quot;OB LB&quot; every minute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.status: OL <br>
TIMER 60 <br>
ups.status: OB <br>
TIMER 60 <br>
ups.status: LB <br>
TIMER 60</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is wise to end the script
with a TIMER. Otherwise dummy-ups will directly go back to
the beginning of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeater Mode <br>
Port is the name of a remote UPS, using the NUT form,
ie:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;upsname&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[repeater] <br>
driver = dummy-ups <br>
port = ups@hostname <br>
desc = &quot;dummy-ups in repeater mode&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike UPS specifications in the
rest of NUT, the @hostname portion is not optional - it is
the @ character which enables Repeater Mode. To refer to an
UPS on the same host as <br>
dummy-ups, use port = upsname@localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTION <br>
Once the driver is loaded in dummy mode, you can change any
variables, except those of the driver.* and server.*
collections. You can do this by either editing the
definition <br>
file, or use the upsrw(1) and upscmd(1) commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in simulation mode,
new variables can be added on the fly, by adding these to
the definition file. Conversely, if you need to remove
variable (such as transient ones, <br>
like ups.alarm), simply update these by setting an empty
value. As a result, they will get removed from the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In repeater mode, the driver
acts according to the capabilities of the UPS, and so
support the same instant commands and settable values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND <br>
Dummy Mode was originally written in one evening to replace
the previous dummycons testing driver, which was too
limited, and required a terminal for interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dummy-ups is useful for NUT
client development, and other testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also helps the NUT Quality
Assurance effort, by automating some tests on the NUT
framework.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It now offers a repeater mode.
This will help in building the Meta UPS approach, which
allows one to build a virtual device, composed of several
other devices (either UPS, PDUs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Instant commands are not yet supported in Dummy Mode, and
data need name/value checking enforcement, as well as
boundaries or enumeration definition.</p>
