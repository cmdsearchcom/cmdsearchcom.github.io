<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
spill is a tool which creates symbolic links under a
destination directory which point to the corresponding
locations under a source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original use of spill is to
support building programs from source with separate
installation prefixes, so that individual programs (and
versions of the same program) can be <br>
kept apart, yet by creating links to the installations under
/usr/local, it is convenient to access the programs without
PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, MANPATH etc having to get out-of-
<br>
hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool can also be used to
remove a set of links to a package installed elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
tool_install_path <br>
This is the head of the directory tree at which the package
is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an absolute path is given,
absolute symbolic links will be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a relative path is given,
relative symbolic links will be created. Note, the path
should be relative to the current directory, not to the
destination <br>
(link_install_path) directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spill assumes that the final two
directory components of tool_install_path are the package
name, and the package version, in that order. For example,
suppose binary <br>
installations are placed under /apps. Version 1.1 of a
package called foobar would be installed under
/apps/foobar/1.1. So there would be directories like
/apps/foo&acirc; <br>
bar/1.1/bin, /apps/foobar/1.1/man/man1 etc. This approach
allows spill to auto-detect when an existing package is
being upgraded by a newer version, and not complain <br>
about links being replaced in such circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link_install_path <br>
This is the head of the directory tree where the links
should be placed. If omitted, it defaults to the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_path... <br>
This is a space separated list of paths to ignore in the
linking process. Each path is relative to
tool_install_path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A frequent problem when using
spill is the dir file in the info subdirectory. The make
install process typically creates one of these files in
every tool installation, <br>
and these conflict when spill tries to create links. (In the
world the designers of info envisaged, everything installs
to a common directory tree and there is a single <br>
info/dir file that gathers the topics for all of the
tools.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To ignore the conflicting
info/dir file, spill would be invoked like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spill /apps/foo/1.0 /usr/local
info/dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, if one of the ignored
relative paths is a directory, everything under that
directory is ignored too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Normally, spill will check that tool_install_path and
link_install_path each have at least one of the following
subdirectories : bin, lib or sbin. This provides a sanity
<br>
check against user errors in specifying the directories on
the command line. The -f option allows this checking to be
overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry_run <br>
This option does a &rsquo;dry-run&rsquo;, i.e. reports on
any potential install conflicts then stops without actually
creating any links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
This option means &rsquo;quiet&rsquo;. Only errors will be
reported. Normally, successful link creations are reported
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --retain <br>
This option causes links to an older version of the package
to be retained if they are not replaced by an equivalent in
the newer version of the package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to remove all
links to the currently installed version, before installing
the new version. This avoids the (usually) unwanted
references to older versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --expand <br>
This option means &rsquo;expand&rsquo;. Suppose a single
package called wibble has already been linked under
/usr/local using spill. The directory /usr/local/man would
probably be <br>
linked to something like /apps/wibble/1.0/man. Now, suppose
spill is called to install package foobar under /usr/local,
and this package has a manpage also. spill <br>
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to link /usr/local/man to
/apps/foobar/1.1/man, because that would break access to
wibble&rsquo;s manpage. In this case, a &quot;NEEDEXPN&quot;
error will be reported <br>
during the pre-installation check. This means that the
symbolic links to directories need to be
&quot;expanded&quot;, i.e. replaced by directories
containing links to the contents <br>
of the directory that they used to be linked to. spill can
perform such expansions automatically if the -x switch is
specified. This option is not the default, though, <br>
because it will modify the filesystem even if -n is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --override <br>
This option means &rsquo;override&rsquo;. If the destination
tree contains links that conflict with those spill wants to
create to link in the new package, normally spill will
report <br>
the conflicts and give up. If -o is specified, the existing
links will be removed and the links pointing to the new
package will take their place. This is useful if the <br>
file in the existing package and that in the new package
provide basically the same data, but the one in the new
package is more up to date than the existing one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l conflict_filename <br>
--conflict-list=filename <br>
When there are conflicts between the tool you are trying to
install and the existing installation, this option allows
the list of conflicting links to be written to a <br>
file. This can be expanded as the ignore-path argument on
another spill run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
--delete-tree <br>
Delete an installation, given the path to the installed tree
and the path to the area where the symlinks are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -d does not actually
delete the installed software. It only removes the symlinks
that point to it. However, it is useful in the case where
you intend to remove <br>
the installed software in a separate step, and avoids the
symlink area being left with stale symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
--delete-pkg <br>
Delete an installation, given the name of the package and
the path to the area where the symlinks are. This relies on
the information stored in the .spill subdirectory of <br>
the link area to know what needs to be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -D does not actually
delete the installed software. It only removes the symlinks
that point to it. However, it is useful in the case where
you intend to remove <br>
the installed software in a separate step, and avoids the
symlink area being left with stale symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Suppose you want to build and install a package called
foobar, version 1.1. The steps you might take would be</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar xzvf foobar-1.1.tar.gz <br>
cd foobar-1.1 <br>
make <br>
make install <br>
spill /apps/foobar/1.1 /usr/local</p>
