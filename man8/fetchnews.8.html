<p>fetchnews(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
fetchnews(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fetchnews - fetch news via NNTP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fetchnews [-q] [-v] ... [-x number] [-l] [-n] [-f] [-P]
[-w]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Leafnode is a USENET package intended for small sites, where
there are few users and little disk space, but where a large
number of groups is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The design of leafnode is
intended to self-repair after problems, and to require no
manual maintenance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fetchnews (formerly called
&quot;fetch&quot;) is the program which submits and
retrieves new articles to or from the upstream NNTP
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q Be quiet. Suppresses some warnings. This flag cancels any
previously encountered -v flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. This flag cancels
any previously encountered -q flags. A maximum of four -v
can be used (the more v, the more verbose):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Warn about non-critical
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Be verbose whenever a group
command occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vvv Be verbose whenever an
article command occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vvvv For debugging purposes.
Don&rsquo;t expect the additional output to make sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Wait mode. This causes the
XOVER update (which runs after the article fetch phase) to
run in the foreground. By default, the XOVER update runs in
the background, detached <br>
from the shell, on systems that offer a working fork(2)
call. Helpful for debugging and to avoid terminal clobbering
when fetchnews is run manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x number <br>
Go number articles back and try to re-fetch what&rsquo;s
missing. This can be useful to pull data from broken servers
that have either overview and group data out of synch or
<br>
create articles out of article number order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Don&rsquo;t use supplementary
servers (-l is supposed to mean &quot;local&quot;). This
does speed up the operation quite a bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not expire newsgroup
subscriptions. Technically: do not unlink files in the
interesting.groups directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Erase the active.read file,
thus force redownloading the whole active file from all
upstream servers. This is usually occurring only very
infrequently because it takes a <br>
long time. See timeout_active in leafnode(8). DO NOT use
this option in cron jobs or otherwise regularly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Only post articles that have
accumulated in the out.going directory but do not fetch
articles from upstream servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
fetchnews will exit with code 0 if it could connect to all
servers and encountered no other errors. It exits with code
2 when it was unable to connect to at least one server, and
<br>
it exits with code 1 on other errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES AND CONFIGURATION <br>
/var/spool/news/leaf.node/active.read <br>
is a file to track when the active files have been
successfully downloaded from the upstream servers the last
time. If it is missing, this has the same effect as giving
<br>
the -f option. It is only created after the active file of
each upstream servers has been downloaded successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See leafnode(8) for the list of
other files affected, and for information on configuring
fetchnews.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LN_SKIP_GROUPS=pattern[,pattern[...]] (since v1.9.53) <br>
If set, all groups that match one of the wildmat(3) patterns
will be skipped during the fetch. This can be used as a
quick way of skipping binary groups during daytime, <br>
for instance, example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env
&rsquo;LN_SKIP_GROUPS=*binary*,alt.*&rsquo;
/usr/sbin/fetchnews -nq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LN_LOCK_TIMEOUT <br>
This variable is parsed as an unsigned integer value and
determines how many seconds fetchnews will wait when trying
to obtain the lock file from another leafnode program. <br>
0 means to wait indefinitely. This variable takes precedence
over the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LN_SUPPRESS_DATE <br>
(since v1.11.7) If this variable is defined (regardless of
its value, including empty), leafnode will skip checking the
upstream server&rsquo;s time by means of the NNTP DATE <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHM <br>
Here is a brief description of what fetchnews does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, after connecting to the
upstream NNTP server, all articles that have the u+r
permission (0400) flag set in /var/spool/news/out.going are
posted using POST. If a posting <br>
fails, that article is moved to
/var/spool/news/failed.postings which an administrator has
to clean up once in a while. Moving a file back to
/var/spool/news/out.going is suffi&acirc; <br>
cient to retry the post it. The u+r flag is checked to
prevent posting an (incomplete) article that leafnode(8) is
still receiving at the same time. If a posting succeeds, the
<br>
article is removed from out.going in order to not post it
twice into a moderated newsgroup on a different server
(which would send multiple copies of the article to the
modera&acirc; <br>
tor). Note: older fetchnews versions tried to post on all
servers first, but failed to do so when one of the servers
could not be reached. If you need to work around a dodgy
<br>
upstream server that is fast but doesn&rsquo;t forward your
posts reliably, prohibit posting to this server using the
nopost server option in the configuration file, see
leafnode(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second, the upstream
server&rsquo;s list of newsgroups (obtained using LIST and
LIST NEWSGROUPS) is merged into leafnode&rsquo;s (if
timeout_active has expired, the active.read file is not <br>
present or the active file is empty) or updated (with
NEWGROUPS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Third, fetchnews iterates over
the list of newsgroups, performing a GROUP, an XOVER (if
supported) or XHDR Message-ID and a number of HEAD and BODY
or ARTICLE commands for each <br>
group which has been read recently. It assumes that for the
particular group it is looking at, &quot;maxage&quot; was
set to the groupexpire or global expire. As a consequence,
it makes <br>
only sense to set maxage lower than or equal to expire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Fetchnews does not use NEWNEWS. NEWNEWS is not used because
it is often very expensive and therefore also disabled at
many sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After some experiments, I
decided that it was better to fetch all the articles in a
group than to optimize away some; users would complain too
loudly when the optmizer guessed <br>
wrongly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only way to control what
newsgroups are accessible to local users is to control what
the upstream server lets fetchnews read, and that will not
keep out all crossposts <br>
(endemic in e.g. the alt.sex groups). If your site is big
enough that you need to control newsgroup access, consider
using a news server which is designed for a big site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fetchnews sets its real and
effective uid to &quot;news&quot; when started as root and
refuses to run if it cannot get this user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Fetchnews ignores the &quot;Supersedes:&quot; and
&quot;Control:&quot; headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Older versions of fetchnews posted any articles found in
out.going. Since v1.9.23, fetchnews will only post article
files that have their user executable bit set. Leafnode sets
<br>
this bit after it has successfully received a post. This
behaviour avoids posting incomplete articles when leafnode
receives a post at the same time fetchnews is posting.</p>
