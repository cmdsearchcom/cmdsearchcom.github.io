<b>Leafnode</b> is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are
  few users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
  desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The design of <b>leafnode</b> is intended to self-repair after problems, and to
  require no manual maintenance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Fetchnews</b> (formerly called &quot;fetch&quot;) is the program which
  submits and retrieves new articles to or from the upstream NNTP server.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ALGORITHM"><a class="selflink" href="#ALGORITHM">ALGORITHM</a></h1>
Here is a brief description of what <b>fetchnews</b> does.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, after connecting to the upstream NNTP server, all articles that have the
  u+r permission (0400) flag set in <b>/var/spool/news/out.going</b> are posted
  using POST. If a posting fails, that article is moved to
  <b>/var/spool/news/failed.postings</b> which an administrator has to clean up
  once in a while. Moving a file back to <b>/var/spool/news/out.going</b> is
  sufficient to retry the post it. The u+r flag is checked to prevent posting an
  (incomplete) article that <b>leafnode</b>(8) is still receiving at the same
  time. If a posting succeeds, the article is removed from out.going in order to
  not post it twice into a moderated newsgroup on a different server (which
  would send multiple copies of the article to the moderator). <b>Note:</b>
  older fetchnews versions tried to post on all servers first, but failed to do
  so when one of the servers could not be reached. If you need to work around a
  dodgy upstream server that is fast but doesn't forward your posts reliably,
  prohibit posting to this server using the nopost server option in the
  configuration file, see <b>leafnode</b>(8).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Second, the upstream server's list of newsgroups (obtained using LIST and LIST
  NEWSGROUPS) is merged into <b>leafnode</b>'s (if timeout_active has expired,
  the active.read file is not present or the active file is empty) or updated
  (with NEWGROUPS).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Third, <b>fetchnews</b> iterates over the list of newsgroups, performing a
  GROUP, an XOVER (if supported) or XHDR Message-ID and a number of HEAD and
  BODY or ARTICLE commands for each group which has been read recently. It
  assumes that for the particular group it is looking at, &quot;maxage&quot; was
  set to the groupexpire or global expire. As a consequence, it makes only sense
  to set maxage lower than or equal to expire.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<b>Fetchnews</b> does not use NEWNEWS. NEWNEWS is not used because it is often
  very expensive and therefore also disabled at many sites.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After some experiments, I decided that it was better to fetch all the articles
  in a group than to optimize away some; users would complain too loudly when
  the optmizer guessed wrongly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only way to control what newsgroups are accessible to local users is to
  control what the upstream server lets <b>fetchnews</b> read, and that will not
  keep out all crossposts (endemic in e.g. the alt.sex groups). If your site is
  big enough that you need to control newsgroup access, consider using a news
  server which is designed for a big site.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Fetchnews</b> sets its real and effective uid to &quot;news&quot; when
  started as root and refuses to run if it cannot get this user ID.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<b>Fetchnews</b> ignores the &quot;Supersedes:&quot; and &quot;Control:&quot;
  headers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
Older versions of <b>fetchnews</b> posted any articles found in out.going. Since
  v1.9.23, <b>fetchnews</b> will only post article files that have their user
  executable bit set. <b>Leafnode</b> sets this bit after it has successfully
  received a post. This behaviour avoids posting incomplete articles when
  <b>leafnode</b> receives a post at the same time <b>fetchnews</b> is posting.
