<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnf.plugin.leaves - DNF leaves Plugin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List installed packages not
required by any other installed package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnf leaves</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
leaves lists all the packages installed on your system which
are not required as a dependency of another installed
package. However two or more packages might depend on
eachother <br>
in a dependency cycle. Packages in such cycles, which are
not required by any other package, are also listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY IS THIS USEFUL? <br>
The list gives you a nice overview of what is installed on
your system without flooding you with anything required by
the packages already shown. The following list of arguments
<br>
basically says the same thing in different ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All the packages
on this list is either needed by you, other users of the
system or not needed at all -- if it was required by another
installed package it would not be on the <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you want to
uninstall anything from your system (without breaking
dependencies) it must involve at least one package on this
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If there is
anything installed on the system which is not needed it must
be on this list -- otherwise it would be required as a
dependency by another package.</p>
