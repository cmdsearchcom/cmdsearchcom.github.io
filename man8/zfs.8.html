<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The zfs command configures ZFS datasets within a ZFS storage
pool, as described in zpool(1M). A dataset is identified by
a unique path within the ZFS namespace. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">pool/{filesystem,volume,snapshot}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the maximum length of a
dataset name is MAXNAMELEN (256 bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A dataset can be one of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A ZFS dataset of type filesystem
can be mounted within the standard system namespace and
behaves like other file systems. While ZFS file systems are
designed to be POSIX com&acirc; <br>
pliant, known issues exist that prevent compliance in some
cases. Applications that depend on standards conformance
might fail due to nonstandard behavior when checking file
<br>
system free space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volume</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A logical volume exported as a
raw or block device. This type of dataset should only be
used under special circumstances. File systems are typically
used in most environ&acirc; <br>
ments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A read-only version of a file
system or volume at a given point in time. It is specified
as filesystem@name or volume@name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZFS File System Hierarchy <br>
A ZFS storage pool is a logical collection of devices that
provide space for datasets. A storage pool is also the root
of the ZFS file system hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The root of the pool can be
accessed as a file system, such as mounting and unmounting,
taking snapshots, and setting properties. The physical
storage characteristics, however, <br>
are managed by the zpool(1M) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See zpool(1M) for more
information on creating and administering pools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snapshots <br>
A snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system or volume.
Snapshots can be created extremely quickly, and initially
consume no additional space within the pool. As data within
<br>
the active dataset changes, the snapshot consumes more data
than would otherwise be shared with the active dataset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snapshots can have arbitrary
names. Snapshots of volumes can be cloned or rolled back,
but cannot be accessed independently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File system snapshots can be
accessed under the .zfs/snapshot directory in the root of
the file system. Snapshots are automatically mounted on
demand and may be unmounted at reg&acirc; <br>
ular intervals. The visibility of the .zfs directory can be
controlled by the snapdir property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clones <br>
A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial
contents are the same as another dataset. As with snapshots,
creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially <br>
consumes no additional space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clones can only be created from
a snapshot. When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an
implicit dependency between the parent and child. Even
though the clone is created somewhere <br>
else in the dataset hierarchy, the original snapshot cannot
be destroyed as long as a clone exists. The origin property
exposes this dependency, and the destroy command lists any
<br>
such dependencies, if they exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The clone parent-child
dependency relationship can be reversed by using the promote
subcommand. This causes the &quot;origin&quot; file system
to become a clone of the specified file sys&acirc; <br>
tem, which makes it possible to destroy the file system that
the clone was created from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount Points <br>
Creating a ZFS file system is a simple operation, so the
number of file systems per system is likely to be numerous.
To cope with this, ZFS automatically manages mounting and
<br>
unmounting file systems without the need to edit the
/etc/vfstab file. All automatically managed file systems are
mounted by ZFS at boot time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, file systems are
mounted under /path, where path is the name of the file
system in the ZFS namespace. Directories are created and
destroyed as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file system can also have a
mount point set in the mountpoint property. This directory
is created as needed, and ZFS automatically mounts the file
system when the zfs mount -a <br>
command is invoked (without editing /etc/vfstab). The
mountpoint property can be inherited, so if pool/home has a
mount point of /export/stuff, then pool/home/user
automatically <br>
inherits a mount point of /export/stuff/user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file system mountpoint
property of none prevents the file system from being
mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If needed, ZFS file systems can
also be managed with traditional tools (mount, umount,
/etc/vfstab). If a file system&rsquo;s mount point is set to
legacy, ZFS makes no attempt to man&acirc; <br>
age the file system, and the administrator is responsible
for mounting and unmounting the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zones <br>
A ZFS file system can be added to a non-global zone by using
the zonecfg add fs subcommand. A ZFS file system that is
added to a non-global zone must have its mountpoint property
<br>
set to legacy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The physical properties of an
added file system are controlled by the global
administrator. However, the zone administrator can create,
modify, or destroy files within the added <br>
file system, depending on how the file system is
mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A dataset can also be delegated
to a non-global zone by using the zonecfg add dataset
subcommand. You cannot delegate a dataset to one zone and
the children of the same dataset <br>
to another zone. The zone administrator can change
properties of the dataset or any of its children. However,
the quota property is controlled by the global
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A ZFS volume can be added as a
device to a non-global zone by using the zonecfg add device
subcommand. However, its physical properties can be modified
only by the global admin&acirc; <br>
istrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about
zonecfg syntax, see zonecfg(1M).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a dataset is delegated to
a non-global zone, the zoned property is automatically set.
A zoned file system cannot be mounted in the global zone,
since the zone administrator <br>
might have to set the mount point to an unacceptable
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The global administrator can
forcibly clear the zoned property, though this should be
done with extreme care. The global administrator should
verify that all the mount points are <br>
acceptable before clearing the property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deduplication <br>
Deduplication is the process for removing redundant data at
the block-level, reducing the total amount of data stored.
If a file system has the dedup property enabled,
dupli&acirc; <br>
cate data blocks are removed synchronously. The result is
that only unique data is stored and common components are
shared among files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native Properties <br>
Properties are divided into two types, native properties and
user-defined (or &quot;user&quot;) properties. Native
properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS
behavior. In <br>
addition, native properties are either editable or
read-only. User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior,
but you can use them to annotate datasets in a way that is
meaning&acirc; <br>
ful in your environment. For more information about user
properties, see the &quot;User Properties&quot; section,
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every dataset has a set of
properties that export statistics about the dataset as well
as control various behaviors. Properties are inherited from
the parent unless overridden by <br>
the child. Some properties apply only to certain types of
datasets (file systems, volumes, or snapshots).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values of numeric properties
can be specified using human-readable suffixes (for example,
k, KB, M, Gb, and so forth, up to Z for zettabyte). The
following are all valid (and <br>
equal) specifications:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1536M, 1.5g, 1.50GB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values of non-numeric
properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase, except
for mountpoint, sharenfs, and sharesmb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following native properties
consist of read-only statistics about the dataset. These
properties can be neither set, nor inherited. Native
properties apply to all dataset <br>
types unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">available</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space available to
the dataset and all its children, assuming that there is no
other activity in the pool. Because space is shared within a
pool, availability <br>
can be limited by any number of factors, including physical
pool size, quotas, reservations, or other datasets within
the pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name, avail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compressratio</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compression ratio achieved
for this dataset, expressed as a multiplier. Compression can
be turned on by running: zfs set compression=on dataset. The
default value is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time this dataset was
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defer_destroy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property is on if the
snapshot has been marked for deferred destroy by using the
zfs destroy -d command. Otherwise, the property is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mounted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For file systems, indicates
whether the file system is currently mounted. This property
can be either yes or no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">origin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For cloned file systems or
volumes, the snapshot from which the clone was created. The
origin cannot be destroyed (even with the -r or -f options)
so long as a clone exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">referenced</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of data that is
accessible by this dataset, which may or may not be shared
with other datasets in the pool. When a snapshot or clone is
created, it initially ref&acirc; <br>
erences the same amount of space as the file system or
snapshot it was created from, since its contents are
identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name, refer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of dataset: filesystem,
volume, or snapshot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space consumed by
this dataset and all its descendents. This is the value that
is checked against this dataset&rsquo;s quota and
reservation. The space used does not <br>
include this dataset&rsquo;s reservation, but does take into
account the reservations of any descendent datasets. The
amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as
<br>
well as the amount of space that are freed if this dataset
is recursively destroyed, is the greater of its space used
and its reservation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When snapshots (see the
&quot;Snapshots&quot; section) are created, their space is
initially shared between the snapshot and the file system,
and possibly with previous snapshots. As <br>
the file system changes, space that was previously shared
becomes unique to the snapshot, and counted in the
snapshot&rsquo;s space used. Additionally, deleting
snapshots can <br>
increase the amount of space unique to (and used by) other
snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space used,
available, or referenced does not take into account pending
changes. Pending changes are generally accounted for within
a few seconds. Committing a <br>
change to a disk using fsync(3c) or O_SYNC does not
necessarily guarantee that the space usage information is
updated immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usedby*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usedby* properties decompose
the used properties into the various reasons that space is
used. Specifically, used = usedbychildren + usedbydataset +
usedbyrefreservation <br>
+, usedbysnapshots. These properties are only available for
datasets created on zpool &quot;version 13&quot; pools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usedbychildren</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space used by
children of this dataset, which would be freed if all the
dataset&rsquo;s children were destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usedbydataset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space used by this
dataset itself, which would be freed if the dataset were
destroyed (after first removing any refreservation and
destroying any necessary <br>
snapshots or descendents).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usedbyrefreservation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space used by a
refreservation set on this dataset, which would be freed if
the refreservation was removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usedbysnapshots</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space consumed by
snapshots of this dataset. In particular, it is the amount
of space that would be freed if all of this dataset&rsquo;s
snapshots were destroyed. <br>
Note that this is not simply the sum of the snapshots&rsquo;
used properties because space can be shared by multiple
snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userused@user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space consumed by
the specified user in this dataset. Space is charged to the
owner of each file, as displayed by ls -l. The amount of
space charged is dis&acirc; <br>
played by du and ls -s. See the zfs userspace subcommand for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unprivileged users can access
only their own space usage. The root user, or a user who has
been granted the userused privilege with zfs allow, can
access everyone&rsquo;s usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The userused@... properties are
not displayed by zfs get all. The user&rsquo;s name must be
appended after the @ symbol, using one of the following
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o POSIX name (for example,
joe)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o POSIX numeric ID (for example,
789)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o SID name (for example,
joe.smith@mydomain)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o SID numeric ID (for example,
S-1-123-456-789)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userrefs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property is set to the
number of user holds on this snapshot. User holds are set by
using the zfs hold command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groupused@group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of space consumed by
the specified group in this dataset. Space is charged to the
group of each file, as displayed by ls -l. See the
userused@user property for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unprivileged users can only
access their own groups&rsquo; space usage. The root user,
or a user who has been granted the groupused privilege with
zfs allow, can access all groups&rsquo; <br>
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volblocksize=blocksize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For volumes, specifies the block
size of the volume. The blocksize cannot be changed once the
volume has been written, so it should be set at volume
creation time. The <br>
default blocksize for volumes is 8 Kbytes. Any power of 2
from 512 bytes to 128 Kbytes is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name, volblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following native properties
can be used to change the behavior of a ZFS dataset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aclinherit=discard | noallow |
restricted | passthrough | passthrough-x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls how ACL entries are
inherited when files and directories are created. A file
system with an aclinherit property of discard does not
inherit any ACL entries. A file <br>
system with an aclinherit property value of noallow only
inherits inheritable ACL entries that specify
&quot;deny&quot; permissions. The property value restricted
(the default) removes <br>
the write_acl and write_owner permissions when the ACL entry
is inherited. A file system with an aclinherit property
value of passthrough inherits all inheritable ACL entries
<br>
without any modifications made to the ACL entries when they
are inherited. A file system with an aclinherit property
value of passthrough-x has the same meaning as <br>
passthrough, except that the owner@, group@, and everyone@
ACEs inherit the execute permission only if the file
creation mode also requests the execute bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the property value is set
to passthrough, files are created with a mode determined by
the inheritable ACEs. If no inheritable ACEs exist that
affect the mode, then the <br>
mode is set in accordance to the requested mode from the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aclmode=discard | groupmask |
passthrough</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls how an ACL is modified
during chmod(2). A file system with an aclmode property of
discard deletes all ACL entries that do not represent the
mode of the file. An <br>
aclmode property of groupmask (the default) reduces user or
group permissions. The permissions are reduced, such that
they are no greater than the group permission bits, <br>
unless it is a user entry that has the same UID as the owner
of the file or directory. In this case, the ACL permissions
are reduced so that they are no greater than owner <br>
permission bits. A file system with an aclmode property of
passthrough indicates that no changes are made to the ACL
other than generating the necessary ACL entries to
repre&acirc; <br>
sent the new mode of the file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atime=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether the access time
for files is updated when they are read. Turning this
property off avoids producing write traffic when reading
files and can result in sig&acirc; <br>
nificant performance gains, though it might confuse mailers
and other similar utilities. The default value is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">canmount=on | off | noauto</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this property is set to off,
the file system cannot be mounted, and is ignored by zfs
mount -a. Setting this property to off is similar to setting
the mountpoint property <br>
to none, except that the dataset still has a normal
mountpoint property, which can be inherited. Setting this
property to off allows datasets to be used solely as a
mechanism <br>
to inherit properties. One example of setting canmount=off
is to have two datasets with the same mountpoint, so that
the children of both datasets appear in the same
direc&acirc; <br>
tory, but might have different inherited
characteristics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the noauto option is set, a
dataset can only be mounted and unmounted explicitly. The
dataset is not mounted automatically when the dataset is
created or imported, nor <br>
is it mounted by the zfs mount -a command or unmounted by
the zfs unmount -a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property is not
inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checksum=on | off | fletcher2,|
fletcher4 | sha256</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls the checksum used to
verify data integrity. The default value is on, which
automatically selects an appropriate algorithm (currently,
fletcher4, but this may change <br>
in future releases). The value off disables integrity
checking on user data. Disabling checksums is NOT a
recommended practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing this property affects
only newly-written data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compression=on | off | lzjb |
gzip | gzip-N | zle | lzo | lzo9 | bz2 | lzma-N | lzma</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls the compression
algorithm used for this dataset. The lzjb compression
algorithm is optimized for performance while providing
decent data compression. Setting com&acirc; <br>
pression to on uses the lzjb compression algorithm. The gzip
compression algorithm uses the same compression as the
gzip(1) command. You can specify the gzip level by using
<br>
the value gzip-N where N is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9
(best compression ratio). Currently, gzip is equivalent to
gzip-6 (which is also the default for gzip(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name compress. Changing
this property affects only newly-written data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfs-fuse : you can also choose
lzo, lzo9, bz2 or lzma with zfs-fuse. Notice that it will
create data which will be readable only with zfs-fuse (and
not with the other zfs <br>
implementations). Here is a quick benchmark of what you can
expect from the different compression methods (here when
writing bzcat linux-2.6.1.tar.bz2 to a zfs volume)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copies=1 | 2 | 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls the number of copies of
data stored for this dataset. These copies are in addition
to any redundancy provided by the pool, for example,
mirroring or RAID-Z. The <br>
copies are stored on different disks, if possible. The space
used by multiple copies is charged to the associated file
and dataset, changing the used property and counting <br>
against quotas and reservations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing this property only
affects newly-written data. Therefore, set this property at
file system creation time by using the -o copies=N
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dedup=on | off | verify |
sha256[,verify]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether deduplication
is in effect for a dataset. The default value is off. The
default checksum used for deduplication is sha256 (subject
to change). When dedup is <br>
enabled, the dedup checksum algorithm overrides the checksum
property. Setting the value to verify is equivalent to
specifying sha256,verify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the property is set to
verify, then, whenever two blocks have the same signature,
ZFS will do a byte-for-byte comparison with the existing
block to ensure that the con&acirc; <br>
tents are identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devices=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether device nodes
can be opened on this file system. The default value is
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether processes can
be executed from within this file system. The default value
is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mlslabel=label | none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mlslabel property is a
sensitivity label that determines if a dataset can be
mounted in a zone on a system with Trusted Extensions
enabled. If the labeled dataset <br>
matches the labeled zone, the dataset can be mounted and
accessed from the labeled zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the mlslabel property is
not set, the default value is none. Setting the mlslabel
property to none is equivalent to removing the property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mlslabel property can be
modified only when Trusted Extensions is enabled and only
with appropriate privilege. Rights to modify it cannot be
delegated. When changing a <br>
label to a higher label or setting the initial dataset
label, the {PRIV_FILE_UPGRADE_SL} privilege is required.
When changing a label to a lower label or the default
(none), <br>
the {PRIV_FILE_DOWNGRADE_SL} privilege is required. Changing
the dataset to labels other than the default can be done
only when the dataset is not mounted. When a dataset <br>
with the default label is mounted into a labeled-zone, the
mount operation automatically sets the mlslabel property to
the label of that zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Trusted Extensions is not
enabled, only datasets with the default label (none) can be
mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mountpoint=path | none |
legacy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls the mount point used
for this file system. See the &quot;Mount Points&quot;
section for more information on how this property is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the mountpoint property is
changed for a file system, the file system and any children
that inherit the mount point are unmounted. If the new value
is legacy, then they <br>
remain unmounted. Otherwise, they are automatically
remounted in the new location if the property was previously
legacy or none, or if they were mounted before the property
<br>
was changed. In addition, any shared file systems are
unshared and shared in the new location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbmand=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether the file system
should be mounted with nbmand (Non Blocking mandatory
locks). This is used for CIFS clients. Changes to this
property only take effect when <br>
the file system is umounted and remounted. See mount(1M) for
more information on nbmand mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primarycache=all | none |
metadata</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls what is cached in the
primary cache (ARC). If this property is set to all, then
both user data and metadata is cached. If this property is
set to none, then neither <br>
user data nor metadata is cached. If this property is set to
metadata, then only metadata is cached. The default value is
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quota=size | none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limits the amount of space a
dataset and its descendents can consume. This property
enforces a hard limit on the amount of space used. This
includes all space consumed by <br>
descendents, including file systems and snapshots. Setting a
quota on a descendent of a dataset that already has a quota
does not override the ancestor&rsquo;s quota, but rather
<br>
imposes an additional limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quotas cannot be set on volumes,
as the volsize property acts as an implicit quota.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userquota@user=size | none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limits the amount of space
consumed by the specified user. Similar to the refquota
property, the userquota space calculation does not include
space that is used by descendent <br>
datasets, such as snapshots and clones. User space
consumption is identified by the userspace@user
property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enforcement of user quotas may
be delayed by several seconds. This delay means that a user
might exceed her quota before the system notices that she is
over quota. The system <br>
would then begin to refuse additional writes with the EDQUOT
error message . See the zfs userspace subcommand for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unprivileged users can only
access their own groups&rsquo; space usage. The root user,
or a user who has been granted the userquota privilege with
zfs allow, can get and set every&acirc; <br>
one&rsquo;s quota.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property is not available
on volumes, on file systems before version 4, or on pools
before version 15. The userquota@... properties are not
displayed by zfs get all. The <br>
user&rsquo;s name must be appended after the @ symbol, using
one of the following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o POSIX name (for example,
joe)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o POSIX numeric ID (for example,
789)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o SID name (for example,
joe.smith@mydomain)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o SID numeric ID (for example,
S-1-123-456-789)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groupquota@group=size | none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limits the amount of space
consumed by the specified group. Group space consumption is
identified by the userquota@user property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unprivileged users can access
only their own groups&rsquo; space usage. The root user, or
a user who has been granted the groupquota privilege with
zfs allow, can get and set all <br>
groups&rsquo; quotas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readonly=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether this dataset
can be modified. The default value is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name, rdonly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recordsize=size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a suggested block size
for files in the file system. This property is designed
solely for use with database workloads that access files in
fixed-size records. ZFS <br>
automatically tunes block sizes according to internal
algorithms optimized for typical access patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For databases that create very
large files but access them in small random chunks, these
algorithms may be suboptimal. Specifying a recordsize
greater than or equal to the <br>
record size of the database can result in significant
performance gains. Use of this property for general purpose
file systems is strongly discouraged, and may adversely <br>
affect performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size specified must be a
power of two greater than or equal to 512 and less than or
equal to 128 Kbytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing the file system&rsquo;s
recordsize affects only files created afterward; existing
files are unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name, recsize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refquota=size | none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limits the amount of space a
dataset can consume. This property enforces a hard limit on
the amount of space used. This hard limit does not include
space used by descendents, <br>
including file systems and snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refreservation=size | none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The minimum amount of space
guaranteed to a dataset, not including its descendents. When
the amount of space used is below this value, the dataset is
treated as if it were <br>
taking up the amount of space specified by refreservation.
The refreservation reservation is accounted for in the
parent datasets&rsquo; space used, and counts against the
parent <br>
datasets&rsquo; quotas and reservations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If refreservation is set, a
snapshot is only allowed if there is enough free pool space
outside of this reservation to accommodate the current
number of &quot;referenced&quot; bytes in <br>
the dataset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name, refreserv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reservation=size | none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The minimum amount of space
guaranteed to a dataset and its descendents. When the amount
of space used is below this value, the dataset is treated as
if it were taking up the <br>
amount of space specified by its reservation. Reservations
are accounted for in the parent datasets&rsquo; space used,
and count against the parent datasets&rsquo; quotas and
reserva&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This property can also be
referred to by its shortened column name, reserv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">secondarycache=all | none |
metadata</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls what is cached in the
secondary cache (L2ARC). If this property is set to all,
then both user data and metadata is cached. If this property
is set to none, then nei&acirc; <br>
ther user data nor metadata is cached. If this property is
set to metadata, then only metadata is cached. The default
value is all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setuid=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether the set-UID bit
is respected for the file system. The default value is
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shareiscsi=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the sharenfs property,
shareiscsi indicates whether a ZFS volume is exported as an
iSCSI target. The acceptable values for this property are
on, off, and type=disk. The <br>
default value is off. In the future, other target types
might be supported. For example, tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might want to set
shareiscsi=on for a file system so that all ZFS volumes
within the file system are shared by default. However,
setting this property on a file system <br>
has no direct effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sharesmb=on | off | opts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether the file system
is shared by using the Solaris CIFS service, and what
options are to be used. A file system with the sharesmb
property set to off is managed <br>
through traditional tools such as sharemgr(1M). Otherwise,
the file system is automatically shared and unshared with
the zfs share and zfs unshare commands. If the property <br>
is set to on, the sharemgr(1M) command is invoked with no
options. Otherwise, the sharemgr(1M) command is invoked with
options equivalent to the contents of this property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because SMB shares requires a
resource name, a unique resource name is constructed from
the dataset name. The constructed name is a copy of the
dataset name except that the <br>
characters in the dataset name, which would be illegal in
the resource name, are replaced with underscore (_)
characters. A pseudo property &quot;name&quot; is also
supported that <br>
allows you to replace the data set name with a specified
name. The specified name is then used to replace the prefix
dataset in the case of inheritance. For example, if the <br>
dataset data/home/john is set to name=john, then
data/home/john has a resource name of john. If a child
dataset of data/home/john/backups, it has a resource name of
<br>
john_backups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When SMB shares are created, the
SMB share name appears as an entry in the .zfs/shares
directory. You can use the ls or chmod command to display
the share-level ACLs on the <br>
entries in this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the sharesmb property is
changed for a dataset, the dataset and any children
inheriting the property are re-shared with the new options,
only if the property was previ&acirc; <br>
ously set to off, or if they were shared before the property
was changed. If the new property is set to off, the file
systems are unshared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sharenfs=on | off | opts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether the file system
is shared via NFS, and what options are used. A file system
with a sharenfs property of off is managed through
traditional tools such as <br>
share(1M), unshare(1M), and dfstab(4). Otherwise, the file
system is automatically shared and unshared with the zfs
share and zfs unshare commands. If the property is set to
<br>
on, the share(1M) command is invoked with no options.
Otherwise, the share(1M) command is invoked with options
equivalent to the contents of this property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the sharenfs property is
changed for a dataset, the dataset and any children
inheriting the property are re-shared with the new options,
only if the property was previ&acirc; <br>
ously off, or if they were shared before the property was
changed. If the new property is off, the file systems are
unshared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logbias = latency |
throughput</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provides a hint to ZFS about
handling of synchronous requests in this dataset. If logbias
is set to latency (the default), ZFS uses the pool&rsquo;s
log devices (if configured) to <br>
handle the requests at low latency. If logbias is set to
throughput, ZFS does not use the configured pool log
devices. Instead, ZFS optimizes synchronous operations for
<br>
global pool throughput and efficient use of resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snapdir=hidden | visible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether the .zfs
directory is hidden or visible in the root of the file
system as discussed in the &quot;Snapshots&quot; section.
The default value is hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version=1 | 2 | current</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The on-disk version of this file
system, which is independent of the pool version. This
property can only be set to later supported versions. See
the zfs upgrade command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volsize=size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For volumes, specifies the
logical size of the volume. By default, creating a volume
establishes a reservation of equal size. For storage pools
with a version number of 9 or <br>
higher, a refreservation is set instead. Any changes to
volsize are reflected in an equivalent change to the
reservation (or refreservation). The volsize can only be set
to a <br>
multiple of volblocksize, and cannot be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reservation is kept equal to
the volume&rsquo;s logical size to prevent unexpected
behavior for consumers. Without the reservation, the volume
could run out of space, resulting <br>
in undefined behavior or data corruption, depending on how
the volume is used. These effects can also occur when the
volume size is changed while it is in use (particularly <br>
when shrinking the size). Extreme care should be used when
adjusting the volume size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Though not recommended, a
&quot;sparse volume&quot; (also known as &quot;thin
provisioning&quot;) can be created by specifying the -s
option to the zfs create -V command, or by changing the <br>
reservation after the volume has been created. A
&quot;sparse volume&quot; is a volume where the reservation
is less then the volume size. Consequently, writes to a
sparse volume can <br>
fail with ENOSPC when the pool is low on space. For a sparse
volume, changes to volsize are not reflected in the
reservation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vscan=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether regular files
should be scanned for viruses when a file is opened and
closed. In addition to enabling this property, the virus
scan service must also be <br>
enabled for virus scanning to occur. The default value is
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xattr=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether extended
attributes are enabled for this file system. The default
value is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zoned=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls whether the dataset is
managed from a non-global zone. See the &quot;Zones&quot;
section for more information. The default value is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following three properties
cannot be changed after the file system is created, and
therefore, should be set when the file system is created. If
the properties are not set <br>
with the zfs create or zpool create commands, these
properties are inherited from the parent dataset. If the
parent dataset lacks these properties due to having been
created <br>
prior to these features being supported, the new file system
will have the default values for these properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">casesensitivity=sensitive |
insensitive | mixed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates whether the file name
matching algorithm used by the file system should be
case-sensitive, case-insensitive, or allow a combination of
both styles of matching. The <br>
default value for the casesensitivity property is sensitive.
Traditionally, UNIX and POSIX file systems have
case-sensitive file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mixed value for the
casesensitivity property indicates that the file system can
support requests for both case-sensitive and
case-insensitive matching behavior. Cur&acirc; <br>
rently, case-insensitive matching behavior on a file system
that supports mixed behavior is limited to the Solaris CIFS
server product. For more information about the mixed <br>
value behavior, see the Solaris ZFS Administration
Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normalization = none | formC |
formD | formKC | formKD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates whether the file
system should perform a unicode normalization of file names
whenever two file names are compared, and which
normalization algorithm should be used. <br>
File names are always stored unmodified, names are
normalized as part of any comparison process. If this
property is set to a legal value other than none, and the
utf8only <br>
property was left unspecified, the utf8only property is
automatically set to on. The default value of the
normalization property is none. This property cannot be
changed <br>
after the file system is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8only=on | off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates whether the file
system should reject file names that include characters that
are not present in the UTF-8 character code set. If this
property is explicitly set to <br>
off, the normalization property must either not be
explicitly set or be set to none. The default value for the
utf8only property is off. This property cannot be changed
after <br>
the file system is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The casesensitivity,
normalization, and utf8only properties are also new
permissions that can be assigned to non-privileged users by
using the ZFS delegated administration fea&acirc; <br>
ture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Temporary Mount Point Properties
<br>
When a file system is mounted, either through mount(1M) for
legacy mounts or the zfs mount command for normal file
systems, its mount options are set according to its
properties. <br>
The correlation between properties and mount options is as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROPERTY MOUNT OPTION <br>
devices devices/nodevices <br>
exec exec/noexec <br>
readonly ro/rw <br>
setuid setuid/nosetuid <br>
xattr xattr/noxattr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, these options can
be set on a per-mount basis using the -o option, without
affecting the property that is stored on disk. The values
specified on the command line <br>
override the values stored in the dataset. The -nosuid
option is an alias for nodevices,nosetuid. These properties
are reported as &quot;temporary&quot; by the zfs get
command. If the <br>
properties are changed while the dataset is mounted, the new
setting overrides any temporary settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Properties <br>
In addition to the standard native properties, ZFS supports
arbitrary user properties. User properties have no effect on
ZFS behavior, but applications or administrators can use
<br>
them to annotate datasets (file systems, volumes, and
snapshots).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User property names must contain
a colon (:) character to distinguish them from native
properties. They may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and
the following punctuation <br>
characters: colon (:), dash (-), period (.), and underscore
(_). The expected convention is that the property name is
divided into two portions such as module:property, but this
<br>
namespace is not enforced by ZFS. User property names can be
at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash
(-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When making programmatic use of
user properties, it is strongly suggested to use a reversed
DNS domain name for the module component of property names
to reduce the chance that <br>
two independently-developed packages use the same property
name for different purposes. Property names beginning with
com.sun. are reserved for use by Sun Microsystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values of user properties
are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and are never
validated. All of the commands that operate on properties
(zfs list, zfs get, zfs set, <br>
and so forth) can be used to manipulate both native
properties and user properties. Use the zfs inherit command
to clear a user property . If the property is not defined in
any <br>
parent dataset, it is removed entirely. Property values are
limited to 1024 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZFS Volumes as Swap or Dump
Devices <br>
During an initial installation or a live upgrade from a UFS
file system, a swap device and dump device are created on
ZFS volumes in the ZFS root pool. By default, the swap area
<br>
size is based on 1/2 the size of physical memory up to 2
Gbytes. The size of the dump device depends on the
kernel&rsquo;s requirements at installation time. Separate
ZFS volumes must <br>
be used for the swap area and dump devices. Do not swap to a
file on a ZFS file system. A ZFS swap file configuration is
not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to change your swap
area or dump device after the system is installed or
upgraded, use the swap(1M) and dumpadm(1M) commands. If you
need to change the size of your <br>
swap area or dump device, see the Solaris ZFS Administration
Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBCOMMANDS <br>
All subcommands that modify state are logged persistently to
the pool in their original form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfs ?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displays a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfs create [-p] [-o

/dev/zvol/{dsk,rdsk}/path, where path is the name of the
volume in the ZFS namespace. The size <br>
represents the logical size as exported by the device. By
default, a reservation of equal size is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size is automatically rounded up

effect on non-file systems or unmounted file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extreme care should be taken
when applying either the -r or the -f options, as they can
destroy large portions of a pool and cause unexpected

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfs destroy [-rRd] snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The given snapshot is destroyed
immediately if and only if the zfs destroy command without

example, if the snapshot had no clones and the
user-initiated reference count were zero.</p>

&quot;Snapshots&quot; section for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursively create snapshots of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfs rollback [-rRf] snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Roll back the given dataset to a
previous snapshot. When a dataset is rolled back, all data
that has changed since the snapshot is discarded, and the
dataset reverts to the <br>
state at the time of the snapshot. By default, the command
refuses to roll back to a snapshot other than the most
recent one. In order to do so, all intermediate snapshots
<br>
must be destroyed by specifying the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -rR options do not
recursively destroy the child snapshots of a recursive
snapshot. Only the top-level recursive snapshot is destroyed
by either of these options. To com&acirc; <br>
pletely roll back a recursive snapshot, you must rollback
the individual child snapshots.</p>

The target dataset can be located anywhere in the ZFS
hierarchy, and is created as the same type <br>
as the original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creates all the non-existing

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfs promote clone-filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Promotes a clone file system to
no longer be dependent on its &quot;origin&quot; snapshot.
This makes it possible to destroy the file system that the
clone was created from. The clone <br>
parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that
the origin file system becomes a clone of the specified file
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The snapshot that was cloned,
and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are now owned
by the promoted clone. The space they use moves from the
origin file system to the <br>
promoted clone, so enough space must be available to
accommodate these snapshots. No new space is consumed by
this operation, but the space accounting is adjusted. The
pro&acirc; <br>
moted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of
its own. The rename subcommand can be used to rename any
conflicting snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfs rename

zfs rename [-p] filesystem|volume filesystem|volume</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Renames the given dataset. The
new target can be located anywhere in the ZFS hierarchy,
with the exception of snapshots. Snapshots can only be
renamed within the parent file <br>
system or volume. When renaming a snapshot, the parent file
system of the snapshot does not need to be specified as part
of the second argument. Renamed file systems can <br>
inherit new mount points, in which case they are unmounted

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s property</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A property for sorting the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A comma-separated list of types

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Translate SID to POSIX ID. The
POSIX ID may be ephemeral if no mapping exists. Normal POSIX
interfaces (for example, stat(2), ls -l) perform this
translation, so the -i <br>
option allows the output from zfs userspace to be compared
directly with those utilities. However, -i may lead to
confusion if some files were created by an SMB user <br>
before a SMB-to-POSIX name mapping was established. In such
a case, some files are owned by the SMB entity and some by
the POSIX entity. However, the -i option will <br>
report that the POSIX entity has the total usage and quota
for both.</p>

zfs receive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an incremental stream is
