<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Dump</b> examines files on an ext2/3/4 filesystem and determines which files
  need to be backed up. These files are copied to the given disk, tape or other
  storage medium for safe keeping (see the <b>-f</b> option below for doing
  remote backups). A dump that is larger than the output medium is broken into
  multiple volumes. On most media the size is determined by writing until an
  end-of-media indication is returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On media that cannot reliably return an end-of-media indication (such as some
  cartridge tape drives), each volume is of a fixed size; the actual size is
  determined by specifying cartridge media, or via the tape size, density and/or
  block count options below. By default, the same output file name is used for
  each volume after prompting the operator to change media.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>files-to-dump</i> is either a mountpoint of a filesystem or a list of files
  and directories to be backed up as a subset of a filesystem. In the former
  case, either the path to a mounted filesystem or the device of an unmounted
  filesystem can be used. In the latter case, certain restrictions are placed on
  the backup: <b>-u</b> is not allowed, the only dump level that is supported is
  <b>0</b> and all the files and directories must reside on the same filesystem.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are supported by <b>dump:</b>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-level#</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The dump level (any integer). A level 0, full backup,
      specified by <b>-0</b> guarantees the entire file system is copied (but
      see also the <b>-h</b> option below). A level number above 0, incremental
      backup, tells <b>dump</b> to copy all files new or modified since the last
      dump of a lower level. The default level is 0. Historically only levels 0
      to 9 were usable in dump, this version is able to understand any integer
      as a dump level.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&#x201C;auto-size&#x201D;. Bypass all tape length
      calculations, and write until an end-of-media indication is returned. This
      works best for most modern tape drives, and is the default. Use of this
      option is particularly recommended when appending to an existing tape, or
      using a tape drive with hardware compression (where you can never be sure
      about the compression ratio).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-A</b><i> archive_file</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Archive a dump table-of-contents in the specified
      <i>archive_file</i> to be used by <b>restore</b>(8) to determine whether a
      file is in the dump file that is being restored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b><i> blocksize</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of kilobytes per dump record. The default
      blocksize is 10, unless the <b>-d</b> option has been used to specify a
      tape density of 6250BPI or more, in which case the default blocksize is
      32. Th maximal value is 1024. Note however that, since the IO system
      slices all requests into chunks of <b>MAXBSIZE</b> (which can be as low as
      64kB), you can experience problems with <b>dump</b>(8) and
      <b>restore</b>(8) when using a higher value, depending on your kernel
      and/or libC versions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-B</b><i> records</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of 1 kB blocks per volume. Not normally
      required, as <b>dump</b> can detect end-of-media. When the specified size
      is reached, <b>dump</b> waits for you to change the volume. This option
      overrides the calculation of tape size based on length and density. If
      compression is on this limits the size of the compressed output per
      volume. Multiple values may be given as a single argument separated by
      commas. Each value will be used for one dump volume in the order listed;
      if <b>dump</b> creates more volumes than the number of values given, the
      last value will be used for the remaining volumes. This is useful for
      filling up already partially filled media (and then continuing with full

<b>Dump</b> requires operator intervention on these conditions: end of tape, end
  of dump, tape write error, tape open error or disk read error (if there is
  more than a threshold of nr errors). In addition to alerting all operators
  implied by the <b>-n</b> key, <b>dump</b> interacts with the operator on
  dump's control terminal at times when <b>dump</b> can no longer proceed, or if
  something is grossly wrong. All questions <b>dump</b> poses <i>must</i> be
  answered by typing &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;, appropriately.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since making a dump involves a lot of time and effort for full dumps,
  <b>dump</b> checkpoints itself at the start of each tape volume. If writing
  that volume fails for some reason, <b>dump</b> will, with operator permission,
  restart itself from the checkpoint after the old tape has been rewound and
  removed, and a new tape has been mounted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Dump</b> tells the operator what is going on at periodic intervals, including
  usually low estimates of the number of blocks to write, the number of tapes it
  will take, the time to completion, and the time to the tape change. The output
  is verbose, so that others know that the terminal controlling <b>dump</b> is
  busy, and will be for some time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the event of a catastrophic disk event, the time required to restore all the
  necessary backup tapes or files to disk can be kept to a minimum by staggering
  the incremental dumps. An efficient method of staggering incremental dumps to
  minimize the number of tapes follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2014;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Always start with a level 0 backup, for example:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 14.00ex;"><b>/sbin/dump -0u -f /dev/st0
  /usr/src</b></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This should be done at set intervals, say once a month or
      once every two months, and on a set of fresh tapes that is saved
    forever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2014;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">After a level 0, dumps of active file systems are taken on
      a daily basis, with this sequence of dump levels:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 14.00ex;"><b>3 2 5 4 7 6 9 8 9 9 ...</b></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For the daily dumps, it should be possible to use a fixed
      number of tapes for each day, used on a weekly basis. Each week, a level 1
      dump is taken, and the daily Hanoi sequence repeats beginning with 3. For
      weekly dumps, another fixed set of tapes per dumped file system is used,
      also on a cyclical basis.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After several months or so, the daily and weekly tapes should get rotated out of
  the dump cycle and fresh tapes brought in.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another backup strategy is the Tower of Hanoi sequence, which reuses older tapes
  in a way that for newer dates the available restore points are more frequent,
  then for older dates (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme
  for additional information).

The format of the <i>/etc/dumpdates</i> file has changed in release 0.4b34,
  however, the file will be read correctly with either pre-0.4b34 or 0.4b34 and
  later versions of <b>dump</b> provided that the machine on which <b>dump</b>
  is run did not change timezones (which should be a fairly rare occurrence).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT

<b>Dump</b> exits with zero status on success. Startup errors are indicated with
  an exit code of 1; abnormal termination is indicated with an exit code of 3.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
It might be considered a bug that this version of dump can only handle ext2/3/4
  filesystems. Specifically, it does not work with FAT filesystems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fewer than 32 read errors (change this with <b>-I</b>) on the filesystem are
  ignored. If noticing read errors is important, the output from dump can be
  parsed to look for lines that contain the text 'read error'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a read error occurs, <b>dump</b> prints out the corresponding physical disk
  block and sector number and the ext2/3/4 logical block number. It doesn't
  print out the corresponding file name or even the inode number. The user has
  to use <b>debugfs</b>(8), commands <b>ncheck</b> and <b>icheck</b> to
  translate the <b>ext2blk</b> number printed out by <b>dump</b> into an inode
  number, then into a file name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each reel requires a new process, so parent processes for reels already written
  just hang around until the entire tape is written.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The estimated number of tapes is not correct if compression is on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It would be nice if <b>dump</b> knew about the dump sequence, kept track of the
  tapes scribbled on, told the operator which tape to mount when, and provided
  more assistance for the operator running <b>restore</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Dump</b> cannot do remote backups without being run as root, due to its
  security history. Presently, it works if you set it setuid (like it used to
  be), but this might constitute a security risk. Note that you can set
  <b>RSH</b> to use a remote shell program instead.

The <b>dump/restore</b> backup suite was ported to Linux's Second Extended File
  System by Remy Card &lt;card@Linux.EU.Org&gt;. He maintained the initial
  versions of <b>dump</b> (up and including 0.4b4, released in January 1997).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Starting with 0.4b5, the new maintainer is Stelian Pop
  &lt;stelian@popies.net&gt;.
