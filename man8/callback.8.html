<p>callback(8) mgetty+callback manual callback(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
callback - call a user back, presenting a login prompt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
callback [-x&lt;debuglevel&gt;] [-V] [-l&lt;modemlines&gt;]
[-m&lt;initstring&gt;] [-s&lt;speed&gt;] [-d] [-S]
[phone-number]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Call the given phone number (if none is given on the command
line, ask user for one), and if a CONNECT is established,
hand over control to mgetty(8) to present user with a login
<br>
name prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback is used for various
purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* security: make sure your users
are who they pretend to be by calling a well-known phone
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* cost savings: make your
company call you back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback can be called directly
from the command line (but you must be &quot;root&quot; to
do this, otherwise callback can&rsquo;t signal mgetty), or
from mgetty&rsquo;s &quot;login.config&quot;. See the <br>
login.config file shipped with mgetty for an example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-x &lt;debug level&gt; <br>
Use the given level of verbosity for logging - 0 means no
logging, 5 is really noisy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number and
quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not go into the
background. This is helpful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;modem lines&gt; <br>
Use the given modem lines. Multiple lines can be separated
by &quot;:&quot;, as with sendfax(8). Example: callback -l
tty1a:tty2a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;init sequence&gt; <br>
Set the modem initialization sequence (as usual: expect send
expect ...). This can do nearly everything, as long as it
leaves the modem command responses on (that is, no <br>
ATQ1 here!) and switches the modem to data mode
(AT+FCLASS=0) if it is used in data/fax mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;speed&gt; <br>
This is the bit rate that should be used for the
machine-modem connection. Usually you&rsquo;ll set this via
the &quot;speed &lt;nnnn&gt;&quot; option in
&quot;callback.config&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Use the line where callback
is started from for dialing out. Callback can make use of
multiple modem lines, and with this options, you can force
it to use just one modem, <br>
the one where a call comes in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
callback will read all its configuration at run-time from a
file, usually called /etc/mgetty+sendfax/callback.config.
See the documentation in the mgetty.info manual for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
In most cases, callback can&rsquo;t print any error messages
to the console, because it must detach itself immediately
from the terminal, in case someone wants to be called back
on the <br>
modem line he called in. So, nothing to print messages
to...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of this, all callback
errors are logged to a protocol file (the extent of the data
written is controlled by the &quot;-x&quot; option),
especially including the reason why a call <br>
was not made, or what exactly failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just two messages are printed on
stdout, and those are self-explaining, a call from a
non-root user, and an invalid option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNALS <br>
How does it work?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a bit tricky, because of
the way init(8) handles the utmp(5) file. You can&rsquo;t
just have any program ask the user for a login name, and
then start a &quot;login shell&quot;, it <br>
won&rsquo;t work (this is for the same reason mgetty(8) has
to be started from /etc/inittab).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, mgetty has to do the
&quot;asking for login name&quot;. But I do not want to have
all that dialout code in mgetty, bloating it even more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way it works is this:
callback dials out on a modem device. It will only take a
modem device that has a mgetty watching over it (!). When
the connection is established (CON&acirc; <br>
NECT), callback will send a signal SIGUSR1 to mgetty, which,
in turn, will send the same signal back to signal &quot;I
got your signal&quot;. callback then exits, and mgetty takes
over <br>
the existing connection, prompts the user for a login name,
and forks off /bin/login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conclusion: this will not work
with mgetty versions before February 04, 1996 (no support
for this signalling), and if it doesn&rsquo;t work for you,
please send me BOTH the mgetty and <br>
the callback log file, otherwise it&rsquo;s very hard to
find the bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
callback is &quot;alpha&quot; code, not very stable right
now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback is fairly dumb
concerning retries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback must be run as
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the documentation
consists of &quot;reading the source&quot;.</p>
