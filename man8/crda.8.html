<p>CRDA(8) Linux CRDA(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
crda - send to the kernel a wireless regulatory domain for a
given ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
crda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
crda is the Linux wireless central regulatory domain agent.
crda is intended to be used by udev scripts and should not
be run manually unless debugging udev scripts. crda is <br>
triggered to run by the kernel by sending a udev event upon
a new regulatory domain change. Regulatory domain changes
are triggered by the wireless kernel subsystem (upon
ini&acirc; <br>
tialization and on reception of country IEs), wireless
drivers, or userspace (see iw ). Upon a regulatory domain
change the kernel sends a udev change event for the
regulatory <br>
platform. The kernel ignores regulatory domains sent to it
if it does not expect them. The regulatory domain is read by
crda from the regulatory.bin file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSA Digital Signature <br>
If built with openssl or gcrypt support crda will have
embedded into it an RSA digital signature which will prevent
it from reading corrupted or non-authored regulatory.bin
<br>
files. Authorship is respected by the RSA public key packed
into crda. This specific crda package has been built with an
RSA public key from John Linville (the Linux wireless <br>
kernel maintainer) and as such will only read regulatory.bin
files signed by him. For further information see the
regulatory.bin man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDEV RULE <br>
A udev regulatory rule must be put in place in order to
receive and parse udev events from the kernel in order to
get udev to call crda with the passed ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2
<br>
country code. An example udev rule which can be used
(usually in /lib/udev/rules.d/85-regulatory.rules ):</p>

ACTION==&quot;change&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;platform&quot;,
RUN+=&quot;/sbin/crda&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment variable <br>
Set the COUNTRY environment variable with a specific ISO /
IEC 3166 alpha2 country code and then run crda without
arguments. This will send a regulatory domain for that
alpha2 to <br>
the kernel.</p>
