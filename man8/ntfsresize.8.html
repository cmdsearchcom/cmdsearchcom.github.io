ntfsresize - resize an NTFS filesystem without data loss
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>ntfsresize</b> [ <i>OPTIONS</i>] <b>--info(-mb-only)</b> <i>DEVICE</i>

<b>ntfsresize</b> [ <i>OPTIONS</i>] [ <b>--size
  </b><i>SIZE</i>[<b>k</b>|<b>M</b>| <b>G</b>]] <i>DEVICE</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>ntfsresize</b> program safely resizes Windows XP, Windows Server 2003,
  Windows 2000, Windows NT4 and Longhorn NTFS filesystems without data loss. All
  NTFS versions are supported, used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.
  <b>Defragmentation is NOT required prior to resizing</b> because the program
  can relocate any data if needed, without risking data integrity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ntfsresize can be used to shrink or enlarge any NTFS filesystem located on an
  unmounted <i>DEVICE</i> (usually a disk partition). The new filesystem will
  fit in a DEVICE whose desired size is <i>SIZE</i> bytes. The <i>SIZE</i>
  parameter may have one of the optional modifiers <b>k</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>G</b>,
  which means the <i>SIZE</i> parameter is given in kilo-, mega- or gigabytes
  respectively. <b>Ntfsresize</b> conforms to the SI, ATA, IEEE standards and
  the disk manufacturers by using k=10^3, M=10^6 and G=10^9.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If both <b>--info(-mb-only)</b> and <b>--size</b> are omitted then the NTFS
  filesystem will be enlarged to match the underlying <i>DEVICE</i> size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To resize a filesystem on a partition, you must resize BOTH the filesystem and
  the partition by editing the partition table on the disk. Similarly to other
  command line filesystem resizers, <b>ntfsresize</b> doesn't manipulate the
  size of the partitions, hence to do that you must use a disk partitioning tool
  as well, for example <b>fdisk</b>(8). Alternatively you could use one of the
  many user friendly partitioners that uses <b>ntfsresize</b> internally, like
  Mandriva's DiskDrake, QTParted, SUSE/Novell's YaST Partitioner, IBM's EVMS,
  GParted or Debian/Ubuntu's Partman.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>IMPORTANT!</b> It's a good practice making REGULAR BACKUPS of your valuable
  data, especially before using ANY partitioning tools. To do so for NTFS, you
  could use <b>ntfsclone</b>(8). Don't forget to save the partition table as
  well!
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Shrinkage"><a class="selflink" href="#Shrinkage">Shrinkage</a></h2>
If you wish to shrink an NTFS partition, first use <b>ntfsresize</b> to shrink
  the size of the filesystem. Then you could use <b>fdisk</b>(8) to shrink the
  size of the partition by deleting the partition and recreating it with the
  smaller size. Do not make the partition smaller than the new size of NTFS
  otherwise you won't be able to boot. If you did so notwithstanding then just
  recreate the partition to be as large as NTFS.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Enlargement"><a class="selflink" href="#Enlargement">Enlargement</a></h2>
To enlarge an NTFS filesystem, first you must enlarge the size of the underlying
  partition. This can be done using <b>fdisk</b>(8) by deleting the partition
  and recreating it with a larger size. Make sure it will not overlap with
  another existing partition. You may enlarge upwards (first sector unchanged)
  or downwards (last sector unchanged), but you may not enlarge at both ends in
  a single step. If you merge two NTFS partitions, only one of them can be
  expanded to the merged partition. After you have enlarged the partition, you
  may use <b>ntfsresize</b> to enlarge the size of the filesystem.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Partitioning"><a class="selflink" href="#Partitioning">Partitioning</a></h2>
When recreating the partition by a disk partitioning tool, make sure you create
  it at the same starting sector and with the same partition type as before.
  Otherwise you won't be able to access your filesystem. Use the 'u' fdisk
  command to switch to the reliable sector unit from the default cylinder one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also make sure you set the bootable flag for the partition if it existed before.
  Failing to do so you might not be able to boot your computer from the disk.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Below is a summary of all the options that <b>ntfsresize</b> accepts. Nearly all
  options have two equivalent names. The short name is preceded by <b>-</b> and
  the long name is preceded by <b>--</b>. Any single letter options, that don't
  take an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g. <b>-fv</b> is
  equivalent to <b>-f -v</b>. Long named options can be abbreviated to any
  unique prefix of their name.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By using this option ntfsresize will only check the device
      to ensure that it is ready to be resized. If not, it will print any errors
      detected. If the device is fine, nothing will be printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b>, <b>--info</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By using this option without <b>--expand</b>, ntfsresize
      will determine the theoretically smallest shrunken filesystem size
      supported. Most of the time the result is the space already used on the
      filesystem. Ntfsresize will refuse shrinking to a smaller size than what
      you got by this option and depending on several factors it might be unable
      to shrink very close to this theoretical size. Although the integrity of
      your data should be never in risk, it's still strongly recommended to make
      a test run by using the <b>--no-action</b> option before real resizing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Practically the smallest shrunken size generally is at around &quot;used
      space&quot; + (20-200 MB). Please also take into account that Windows
      might need about 50-100 MB free space left to boot safely.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If used in association with option <b>--expand</b>, ntfsresize will
      determine the smallest downwards expansion size and the possible
      increments to the size. These are exact byte counts which must not be
      rounded. This option may be used after the partition has been expanded
      provided the upper bound has not been changed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option never causes any changes to the filesystem, the partition is
      opened read-only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b>, <b>--info-mb-only</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Like the info option, only print out the shrinkable size in
      MB. Print nothing if the shrink size is the same as the original size (in
      MB). This option cannot be used in association with option
      <b>--expand</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>
    SIZE[<b>k</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>G</b>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Resize filesystem to fit in a partition whose size is
      <i>SIZE</i>[ <b>k</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>G</b>] bytes by shifting its end and
      keeping its beginning unchanged. The filesystem size is set to be at least
      one sector smaller than the partition. The optional modifiers <b>k</b>,
      <b>M</b>, <b>G</b> mean the <i>SIZE</i> parameter is given in kilo-, mega-
      or gigabytes respectively. Conforming to standards, k=10^3, M=10^6 and
      G=10^9. ki=2^10, Mi=2^20 and Gi=2^30 are also allowed. Use this option
      with <b>--no-action</b> first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-x</b>, <b>--expand</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Expand the filesystem to the current partition size,
      shifting down its beginning and keeping its end unchanged. The metadata is
      recreated in the expanded space and no user data is relocated. This is
      incompatible with option -s (or --size) and can only be made if the
      expanded space is an exact multiple of the cluster size. It must also be
      large enough to hold the new metadata.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the expansion is interrupted for some reason (power outage, etc), you may
      restart the resizing, as the original data and metadata have been kept
      unchanged.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note : expanding a Windows system partition and filesystem downwards may
      lead to the registry or some files not matching the new system layout, or
      to some important files being located too far from the beginning of the
      partition, thus making Windows not bootable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Forces ntfsresize to proceed with the resize operation
      either without prompting for an explicit acceptance, or if the filesystem
      is marked for consistency check. Double the option (-ff, --force --force)
      to avoid prompting even if the file system is marked for check.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Please note, ntfsresize always marks the filesystem for consistency check
      before a real resize operation and it leaves that way for extra safety.
      Thus if NTFS was marked by ntfsresize then it's safe to use this option.
      If you need to resize several times without booting into Windows between
      each resizing steps then you must use this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n, --no-action</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use this option to make a test run before doing the real
      resize operation. Volume will be opened read-only and <b>ntfsresize</b>
      displays what it would do if it were to resize the filesystem. Continue
      with the real resizing only if the test run passed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b>, <b>--bad-sectors</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Support disks having hardware errors, bad sectors with
      those <b>ntfsresize</b> would refuse to work by default.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Prior using this option, it's strongly recommended to make a backup by
      <b>ntfsclone</b>(8) using the --rescue option, then running 'chkdsk /f /r
      volume:' on Windows from the command line. If the disk guarantee is still
      valid then replace it. It's defected. Please also note, that no software
      can repair these type of hardware errors. The most what they can do is to
      work around the permanent defects.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option doesn't have any effect if the disk is flawless.</dd>

There are a few very rarely met restrictions at present: filesystems having
  unknown bad sectors, relocation of the first MFT extent and resizing into the
  middle of a $MFTMirr extent aren't supported yet. These cases are detected and
  resizing is restricted to a safe size or the closest safe size is displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Ntfsresize</b> schedules an NTFS consistency check and after the first boot
  into Windows you must see <b>chkdsk</b> running on a blue background. This is
  intentional and no need to worry about it. Windows may force a quick reboot
  after the consistency check. Moreover after repartitioning your disk and
  depending on the hardware configuration, the Windows message <b>System
  Settings Change</b> may also appear. Just acknowledge it and reboot again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The disk geometry handling semantic (HDIO_GETGEO ioctl) has changed in an
  incompatible way in Linux 2.6 kernels and this triggered multitudinous
  partition table corruptions resulting in unbootable Windows systems, even if
  NTFS was consistent, if <b>parted</b>(8) was involved in some way. This
  problem was often attributed to ntfsresize but in fact it's completely
  independent of NTFS thus ntfsresize. Moreover ntfsresize never touches the
  partition table at all. By changing the 'Disk Access Mode' to LBA in the BIOS
  makes booting work again, most of the time. You can find more information
  about this issue in the Troubleshooting section of the below referred
  Ntfsresize FAQ.
