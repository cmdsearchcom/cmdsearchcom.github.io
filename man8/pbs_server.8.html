<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbs_server - start a pbs batch server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pbs_server [-a active] [-c] [-d config_path] [-e] [-f] [-h]
[-l port] [-p port] [-t type] [-v] [-A acctfile] [-D] [-H
hostname] [-L logfile] [-M mom_port] [-R momRPP_port] <br>
[-S scheduler_port] [--about] [--ha] [--help]
[--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pbs_server command starts the operation of a batch
server on the local host. Typically, this command will be in
a local boot file such as /etc/rc.local . If the batch <br>
server is already in execution, pbs_server will exit with an
error. To insure that the pbs_server command is not runnable
by the general user community, the server will only <br>
execute if its real and effective uid is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server will record a
diagnostic message in a log file for any error occurrence.
The log files are maintained in the server_logs directory
below the home directory of the <br>
server. If the log file cannot be opened, the diagnostic
message is written to the system console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a active Specifies if scheduling is active or not. This
sets the server attribute scheduling. If the option argument
is &quot;true&quot; (&quot;True&quot;, &quot;t&quot;,
&quot;T&quot;, or &quot;1&quot;), the server is <br>
active and the PBS job scheduler will be called. If the
argument is &quot;false&quot; (&quot;False&quot;,
&quot;f&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, or &quot;0), the server is
idle, and the scheduler will not be called <br>
and no jobs will be run. If this option is not specified,
the server will retain the prior value of the scheduling
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Wait 10 minutes before
contacting moms. Any mom reporting in does not get pinged if
starting pbs_server before moms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d config_path Specifies the
path of the directory which is home to the servers
configuration files, PBS_HOME. A host may have multiple
servers. Each server must have a differ&acirc; <br>
ent configuration directory. The default configuration
directory is given by the symbol $PBS_SERVER_HOME which is
typically /usr/spool/PBS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Accept status update from any
mom. Adds node to nodes file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force overwrite of server
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print help information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l scheduler_port <br>
Specifies the host name and port number of listening
schedulers. By default pbs_server communicates to the
scheduler on the loop back address at port 15004. If the
<br>
scheduler and pbs_server are not on the same host the -l
option tells pbs_server where to find the scheduler. When
using TORQUE in high availability mode the -l <br>
option should be used to let TORQUE know where all potential
schedulers are located. If pbs_server and the scheduler are
not on the same node the -l option or the <br>
-S option must be used in order for TORQUE to communicate
with the scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port Specifies the port
number on which the server will listen for batch requests.
If multiple servers are running on a single host, each must
have its own unique port <br>
number. This option is for use in testing with multiple
batch systems on a single host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type Specifies the impact on
jobs which were in execution, running, when the server shut
down. If the running job is not rerunnable or restartable
from a checkpoint <br>
image, the job is aborted. If the job is rerunnable or
restartable, then the actions described below are taken.
When the type argument is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hot All jobs are requeued except
non-rerunnable jobs that were executing. Any rerunnable job
which was executing when the server went down will be run
immedi&acirc; <br>
ately. This returns the server to the same state as when it
went down. After those jobs are restarted, then normal
scheduling takes place for all remain&acirc; <br>
ing queued jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a job cannot be restarted
immediately because of a missing resource, such as a node
being down, the server will attempt to restart it
periodically for <br>
upto 5 minutes. After that period, the server will revert to
a normal state, as if warm started, and will no longer
attempt to restart any remaining jobs <br>
which were running prior to the shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warm All rerunnable jobs which
were running when the server went down are requeued. All
other jobs are maintained. New selections are made for which
jobs are <br>
placed into execution. Warm is the default if -t is not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cold All jobs are deleted.
Positive confirmation is required before this direction is
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create The server will discard
any existing configuration files, queues and jobs, and
initialize configuration files to the default values. The
server is idled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Shows version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A acctfile Specifies an
absolute path name of the file to use as the accounting
file. If not specified, the file is named for the current
date in the <br>
PBS_HOME/server_priv/accounting directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Debug mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H hostname Causes the server to
start under a different hostname as obtained from
gethostname(2). Useful for servers with multiple network
interfaces to support connections <br>
from clients over an interface that has a hostname assigned
that differs from the one that is returned by
gethostname(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L logfile Specifies an absolute
path name of the file to use as the log file. If not
specified, the file is one named for the current date in the
PBS_HOME/server_logs <br>
directory, see the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M mom_port Specifies the host
name and/or port number on which the server should connect
the job executor, MOM. The option argument, mom_conn, is one
of the forms: <br>
host_name, [:]port_number, or host_name:port_number. If
host_name not specified, the local host is assumed. If
port_number is not specified, the default port is <br>
assumed. See the -M option for pbs_mom(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R mom_RPPport Specifies the
port number on which the the server should query the up/down
status of Mom. See the -R option for pbs_mom(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S scheduler_port <br>
Specifies the port number to which the server should connect
when contacting the Scheduler. By default pbs_server looks
for the scheduler on the loopback address <br>
at port 15004. The -S option changes the default to the
value given in the option argument. The option argument,
scheduler_conn, is of the same syntax as under the <br>
-M option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--about Shows information about
pbs_server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ha Enables high availability
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Prints help
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version Shows version and
commit information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_priv <br>
default directory for configuration files, typically
/usr/spool/pbs/server_priv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_logs
<br>
directory for log files recorded by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal Handling <br>
On receipt of the following signals, the server performs the
defined action:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP The current server log
and accounting log are closed and reopened. This allows for
the prior log to be renamed and a new log started from the
time of the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT Causes an orderly
shutdown of pbs_server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 <br>
Causes server to increase and decrease logging levels,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM <br>
Causes an orderly shutdown of pbs_server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGSHUTDN <br>
On systems (Unicos) where SIGSHUTDN is defined, it also
causes an orderly shutdown of the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGPIPE <br>
This signal is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other signals have their
default behavior installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If the server command fails to begin batch operation, the
server exits with a value greater than zero.</p>
