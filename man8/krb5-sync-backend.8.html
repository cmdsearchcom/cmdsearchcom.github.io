<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
krb5-sync-backend - Manipulate Kerberos password and status
change queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
krb5-sync-backend (help|manual)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5-sync-backend
(disable|enable) [-d queue] user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5-sync-backend list [-d
queue]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5-sync-backend process [-s]
[-d queue]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5-sync-backend password [-d
queue] user ad &lt; password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5-sync-backend purge [-d
queue] days</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
krb5-sync-backend provides an interface to the queue of
pending password and account status changes written by
either this utility or by the synchronization plugin after
<br>
failures. It can queue account enables, disables, or
password changes for Active Directory, list the queued
actions, or process the queued actions with krb5-sync
(telling it to <br>
take its action from a file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The queue directory will contain
files with names in the format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;username&gt;-&lt;domain&gt;-&lt;action&gt;-&lt;timestamp&gt;-&lt;count&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;username&gt; is the
name of the affected account (&quot;/&quot; will be replaced
with &quot;.&quot; in the file name and the realm will be
removed), &lt;domain&gt; is &quot;ad&quot;, &lt;action&gt;
is either &quot;enable&quot; <br>
(used for both enabling and disabling accounts) or
&quot;password&quot;, &lt;timestamp&gt; is a ISO 8601
timestamp in UTC, and &lt;count&gt; is a two-digit
zero-padded number between 0 and 99 (so that <br>
we can handle multiple changes that arrive in the same
second). Each file contains a queued change in the format
described in krb5-sync(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported arguments to
krb5-sync-backend are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable user <br>
Queue a disable action (in Active Directory, as that&rsquo;s
the only system currently supported for enable and disable)
for user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable user <br>
Queue an enable action (in Active Directory, as that&rsquo;s
the only system currently supported for enable and disable)
for user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
List the supported commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list <br>
List the current contents of the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manual <br>
Display this documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">process <br>
Process the queue. All queued actions will be sorted
alphanumerically (which due to the timestamp means that all
changes for a particular user of a particular type will be
<br>
done in the order queued). krb5-sync will be called for each
queued action, as long as it continues to succeed. If it
fails for a queued action, all other actions sharing <br>
the same username, domain, and action will be skipped and
queue processing will continue with the next action that
differs in one of those three parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password user ad &lt; password
<br>
Queue a password change for user in Active Directory,
setting their password to password. By default, password is
read from standard input. It can also be passed as a <br>
command-line argument, but this is less secure since the
password is then readable by anyone on the system who can
see the command-line arguments of processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entire standard input is
taken as the password, including any trailing newlines, so
be careful how the password is provided. If using something
like echo, use &quot;echo -n&quot; <br>
or the &quot; <br>
purge days <br>
Delete all queued actions last modified longer than days
days ago. This can be used to clean up old failed change
propagations in situations where accounts may be created or
<br>
have password changes queued that are later removed and
never created in other environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options must be specified after the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d queue, --directory=queue <br>
Use queue as the queue directory instead of the default of
/var/spool/krb5-sync. This also changes the lock file
accordingly. This option is supported for all commands <br>
except &quot;help&quot; and &quot;manual&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --silent <br>
This option is only allowed for the &quot;process&quot;
command. Filter out the output of krb5-sync to ignore common
errors and success messages and only show uncommon errors.
This <br>
option will filter out all output when krb5-sync is
successful and will filter out error messages that normally
indicate the account is missing in Active Directory. The
<br>
regexes can be modified at the start of this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/sbin/krb5-sync <br>
The path to the krb5-sync utility. This may be changed at
the top of this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/krb5-sync <br>
The default path to the queue. This must match the queue_dir
parameter in krb5.conf used by the plugin. It can be changed
at the top of this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/krb5-sync/.lock <br>
An empty file used for locking the queue. When writing to or
querying the queue, krb5-sync-backend will open and lock
this file with the Perl flock function, which normally <br>
calls flock(2). Any other queue writers need to use the same
locking mechanism for safe operation.</p>
