<p>ext_time_quota_acl(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ext_time_quota_acl(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ext_time_quota_acl - Squid time quota external acl
helper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ext_time_quota_acl [-b database] [-l logfile] [-d] [-p
pauselen] [-h] configfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ext_time_quota_acl allows an administrator to define time
budgets for the users of squid to limit the time using
squid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful for corporate
lunch time allocations, wifi portal pay-per-minute
installations or for parental control of children. The
administrator can define a time budget <br>
(e.g. 1 hour per day) which is enforced through this
helper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b database <br>
Filename of persistent database. This defaults to
ext_time_quota.db in Squids state directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pauselen <br>
Pauselen is given in seconds and defines the period between
two requests to be treated as part of the same session.
Pauses shorter than this value will be counted against <br>
the quota, longer ones ignored. Default is 300 seconds (5
minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
Filename where all logging and debugging information will be
written. If none is given, then stderr will be used and the
logging will go to Squids main cache.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enables debug logging in the
logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h show a short command line
help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configfile <br>
This file contains the definition of the time budgets for
the users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The time quotas of the users are defined in a text file
typically residing in /etc/squid/time_quota. Any line
starting with &quot;#&quot; contains a comment and is
ignored. Every line must <br>
start with a user followed by a time budget and a
corresponding time period separated by &quot;/&quot;. Here
is an example file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># user budget / period <br>
john 8h / 1d <br>
littlejoe 1h / 1d <br>
babymary 30m / 1w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">John has a time budget of 8
hours every day, littlejoe is only allowed 1 hour and the
poor babymary only 30 minutes a week.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use &quot;s&quot; for
seconds, &quot;m&quot; for minutes, &quot;h&quot; for hours,
&quot;d&quot; for days and &quot;w&quot; for weeks.
Numerical values can be given as integer values or with a
fraction. E.g. &quot;0.5h&quot; means <br>
30 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This helper is configured in
squid.conf using the external_acl_type directive then access
controls which use it to allow or deny.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Ensure that users have a valid
login. We need their username. <br>
acl users proxy_auth REQUIRED <br>
http_access deny !users <br>
# Define program and quota file <br>
external_acl_type time_quota ttl=60 children-max=1 %LOGIN
/usr/libexec/ext_time_quota_acl /etc/squid/time_quota <br>
acl noquota src all <br>
acl time_quota external time_quota <br>
deny_info ERR_ACL_TIME_QUOTA_EXCEEDED noquota <br>
http_access deny !time_quota noquota</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, after
restarting Squid it should allow access only for users as
long as they have time budget left. If the budget is
exceeded the user will be presented with an <br>
error page informing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example we use separate
users access control and noquota ACL in order to keep the
username and password prompt and the quota-exceeded messages
separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User is just a unique key value.
The above example uses %LOGIN and the username but any of
the external_acl_type format tags can be substituted in its
place. %EXT_TAG , %LOGIN , <br>
%IDENT , %EXT_USER , %SRC , %SRCEUI48 , and %SRCEUI64 are
all likely candidates for client identification. The Squid
wiki has more examples at
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Con&acirc; <br>
figExamples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
This helper only controls access to the Internet through
HTTP. It does not control other protocols, like VOIP, ICQ,
IRC, FTP, IMAP, SMTP or SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Desktop browsers are typically
able to deal with authentication to HTTP proxies like squid
. But more and more different programs and devices
(smartphones, games on mobile <br>
devices, ...) are using the Internet over HTTP. These
devices are often not able to work through an authenticating
proxy. Means other than %LOGIN authentication are required
to <br>
authorize these devices and software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more general control to
Internet access could be a captive portal approach (such as
pfSense or ChilliSpot) using %SRC, %SRCEUI48 and %SRCEUI64
as keys or maybe a 802.11X solu&acirc; <br>
tion. But the latter is often not supported by mobile
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION <br>
When the helper is called it will be asked if the current
user is allowed to access squid. The helper will reduce the
remaining time budget of this user and return OK if there is
<br>
budget left. Otherwise it will return ERR .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ttl=N parameter in
squid.conf determines how often the helper will be called,
the example config uses a 1 minute TTL. The interaction is
that Squid will only call the helper <br>
on new requests if there has been more than TTL seconds
passed since last check. This handling creates an amount of
slippage outside the quota by whatever amount is configured.
<br>
TTL can be set as short as desired, down to and including
zero. Though values of 1 or more are recommended due to a
quota resolution of one second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the configured time period
(e.g. &quot;1w&quot; for babymary) is over, the time budget
will be restored to the configured value thus allowing the
user to access squid with a fresh bud&acirc; <br>
get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the time between the current
request and the previous request is greater than pauselen
(default 5 minutes and adjustable with command line
parameter -p ), the current request <br>
will be considered as a new request and the time budget will
not be decreased. If the time is less than pauselen , then
both requests will be considered as part of the same <br>
active time period and the time budget will be decreased by
the time difference. This allows the user to take arbitrary
breaks during Internet access without losing their time <br>
budget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FURTHER IDEAS <br>
The following ideas could further improve this helper. Maybe
someone wants to help? Any support or feedback is
welcome!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There should be a way for a user
to see their configured and remaining <br>
time budget. This could be realized by implementing a web
page accessing the database of the helper showing the
corresponding data. One of the problems to be solved is <br>
user authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We could always return
&quot;OK&quot; and use the module simply as an Internet <br>
usage tracker showing who has stayed how long in the
WWW.</p>
