<p>HDPARM(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual HDPARM(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hdparm - get/set SATA/IDE device parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hdparm [options] [device ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hdparm provides a command line interface to various kernel
interfaces supported by the Linux SATA/PATA/SAS
&quot;libata&quot; subsystem and the older IDE driver
subsystem. Many newer <br>
(2008 and later) USB drive enclosures now also support
&quot;SAT&quot; (SCSI-ATA Command Translation) and therefore
may also work with hdparm. E.g. recent WD
&quot;Passport&quot; models and recent <br>
NexStar-3 enclosures. Some options may work correctly only
with the latest kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
When no options are given, -acdgkmur is assumed. For
&quot;Get/set&quot; options, a query without the optional
parameter (e.g. -d) will query (get) the device state, and
with a parameter <br>
(e.g., -d0) will set the device state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Get/set sector count for
filesystem (software) read-ahead. This is used to improve
performance in sequential reads of large files, by
prefetching additional blocks in <br>
anticipation of them being needed by the running task. Many
IDE drives also have a separate built-in read-ahead
function, which augments this filesystem (software) read-
<br>
ahead function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Get/set the IDE
drive&Acirc;&acute;s read-lookahead feature (usually ON by
default). Usage: -A0 (disable) or -A1 (enable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Get/set bus state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Get/set Advanced Power
Management feature, if the drive supports it. A low value
means aggressive power management and a high value means
better performance. Possible <br>
settings range from values 1 through 127 (which permit
spin-down), and values 128 through 254 (which do not permit
spin-down). The highest degree of power management is <br>
attained with a setting of 1, and the highest I/O
performance with a setting of 254. A value of 255 tells
hdparm to disable Advanced Power Management altogether on
the <br>
drive (not all drives support disabling it, but most
do).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Get/set (E)IDE 32-bit I/O
support. A numeric parameter can be used to enable/disable
32-bit I/O support. Currently supported values include 0 to
disable 32-bit I/O sup&acirc; <br>
port, 1 to enable 32-bit data transfers, and 3 to enable
32-bit data transfers with a special sync sequence required
by many chipsets. The value 3 works with nearly all <br>
32-bit IDE chipsets, but incurs slightly more overhead. Note
that &quot;32-bit&quot; refers to data transfers across a
PCI or VLB bus to the interface card only; all (E)IDE drives
<br>
still have only a 16-bit connection over the ribbon cable
from the interface card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Check the current IDE power
mode status, which will always be one of unknown (drive does
not support this command), active/idle (normal operation),
standby (low power <br>
mode, drive has spun down), or sleeping (lowest power mode,
drive is completely shut down). The -S, -y, -Y, and -Z
options can be used to manipulate the IDE power modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Get/set the
&quot;using_dma&quot; flag for this drive. This option now
works with most combinations of drives and PCI interfaces
which support DMA and which are known to the kernel <br>
IDE driver. It is also a good idea to use the appropriate -X
option in combination with -d1 to ensure that the drive
itself is programmed for the correct DMA mode, <br>
although most BIOSs should do this for you at boot time.
Using DMA nearly always gives the best performance, with
fast I/O throughput and low CPU usage. But there are at <br>
least a few configurations of chipsets and drives for which
DMA does not make much of a difference, or may even slow
things down (on really messed up hardware!). Your <br>
mileage may vary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dco-freeze <br>
DCO stands for Device Configuration Overlay, a way for
vendors to selectively disable certain features of a drive.
The --dco-freeze option will freeze/lock the current <br>
drive configuration, thereby preventing software (or
malware) from changing any DCO settings until after the next
power-on reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dco-identify <br>
Query and dump information regarding drive configuration
settings which can be disabled by the vendor or OEM
installer. These settings show capabilities of the drive
<br>
which might be disabled by the vendor for &quot;enhanced
compatibility&quot;. When disabled, they are otherwise
hidden and will not show in the -I identify output. For
example, <br>
system vendors sometimes disable 48_bit addressing on large
drives, for compatibility (and loss of capacity) with a
specific BIOS. In such cases, --dco-identify will show <br>
that the drive is 48_bit capable, but -I will not show it,
and nor will the drive accept 48_bit commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dco-restore <br>
Reset all drive settings, features, and accessible
capacities back to factory defaults and full capabilities.
This command will fail if DCO is frozen/locked, or if a -Np
<br>
maximum size restriction has also been set. This is
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and will very likely cause massive loss
of data. DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--direct <br>
Use the kernel&Acirc;&acute;s &quot;O_DIRECT&quot; flag when
performing a -t timing test. This bypasses the page cache,
causing the reads to go directly from the drive into
hdparm&rsquo;s buffers, <br>
using so-called &quot;raw&quot; I/O. In many cases, this can
produce results that appear much faster than the usual page
cache method, giving a better indication of raw device and
<br>
driver performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drq-hsm-error <br>
VERY DANGEROUS, DON&rsquo;T EVEN THINK ABOUT USING IT. This
option causes hdparm to issue an IDENTIFY command to the
kernel, but incorrectly marked as a &quot;non-data&quot;
command. <br>
This results in the drive being left with its
DataReQust(DRQ) line &quot;stuck&quot; high. This confuses
the kernel drivers, and may crash the system immediately
with massive data <br>
loss. The option exists to help in testing and fortifying
the kernel against similar real-world drive malfunctions.
VERY DANGEROUS, DO NOT USE!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enable/disable the on-drive
defect management feature, whereby the drive firmware tries
to automatically manage defective sectors by relocating them
to &quot;spare&quot; sectors <br>
reserved by the factory for such. Control of this feature
via the -D option is not supported for most modern drives
since ATA-4; thus this command may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Set cd/dvd drive speed. This
is NOT necessary for regular operation, as the drive will
automatically switch speeds on its own. But if you want to
play with it, just sup&acirc; <br>
ply a speed number after the option, usually a number like 2
or 4. This can be useful in some cases, though, to smooth
out DVD video playback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Sync and flush the buffer
cache for the device on exit. This operation is also
performed internally as part of the -t and -T timings and
other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fallocate <br>
This option currently works only on ext4 and xfs filesystem
types. When used, this must be the only option given. It
requires two parameters: the desired file size in <br>
kilo-bytes (byte count divided by 1024), followed by the
pathname for the new file. It will create a new file of the
specified size, but without actually having to write <br>
any data to the file. This will normally complete very
quickly, and without thrashing the storage device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g. Create a 10KByte file:
hdparm --fallocate 10 temp_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fibmap <br>
When used, this must be the only option given. It requires a
file path as a parameter, and will print out a list of the
block extents (sector ranges) occupied by that <br>
file on disk. Sector numbers are given as absolute LBA
numbers, referenced from sector 0 of the physical device
rather than from the partition or filesystem. This
infor&acirc; <br>
mation can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as
examining the degree of fragmenation of larger files, or
determining appropriate sectors to deliberately corrupt <br>
during fault-injection testing procedures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option uses the new FIEMAP
(file extent map) ioctl() when available, and falls back to
the older FIBMAP (file block map) ioctl() otherwise. Note
that FIBMAP suffers <br>
from a 32-bit block-number interface, and thus not work
beyond 8TB or 16TB. FIBMAP is also very slow, and does not
deal well with preallocated uncommitted extents in <br>
ext4/xfs filesystems, unless a sync() is done before using
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fwdownload <br>
When used, this should be the only option given. It requires
a file path immediately after the option, indicating where
the new drive firmware should be read from. The <br>
contents of this file will be sent to the drive using the
(S)ATA DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command, using either transfer
protocol 7 (entire file at once), or, if the drive
sup&acirc; <br>
ports it, transfer protocol 3 (segmented download). This
command is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and could destroy both the
drive and all data on it. DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND. <br>
The --fwdownload-mode3 , --fwdownload-mode3-max , and
--fwdownload-mode7 variations on basic --fwdownload allow
overriding automatic protocol detection in favour of
forc&acirc; <br>
ing hdparm to use a specific transfer protocol, for testing
purposes only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Flush the on-drive write
cache buffer (older drives may not implement this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Display the drive geometry
(cylinders, heads, sectors), the size (in sectors) of the
device, and the starting offset (in sectors) of the device
from the beginning of the <br>
drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display terse usage
information (help).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Read the temperature from
some (mostly Hitachi) drives. Also reports if the
temperature is within operating condition range (this may
not be reliable). Does not cause the <br>
drive to spin up if idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Display the identification
info which the kernel drivers (IDE, libata) have stored from
boot/configuration time. This may differ from the current
information obtainable <br>
directly from the drive itself with the -I option. The data
returned may or may not be current, depending on activity
since booting the system. For a more detailed <br>
interpretation of the identification info, refer to AT
Attachment Interface for Disk Drives, ANSI ASC X3T9.2
working draft, revision 4a, April 19/93, and later
editions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--idle-immediate <br>
Issue an ATA IDLE_IMMEDIATE command, to put the drive into a
lower power state. Usually the device remains spun-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--idle-unload <br>
Issue an ATA IDLE_IMMEDIATE_WITH_UNLOAD command, to unload
or park the heads and put the drive into a lower power
state. Usually the device remains spun-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Request identification info
directly from the drive, which is displayed in a new
expanded format with considerably more detail than with the
older -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Istdin <br>
This is a special variation on the -I option, which accepts
a drive identification block as standard input instead of
using a /dev/hd* parameter. The format of this block <br>
must be exactly the same as that found in the
/proc/ide/*/hd*/identify &quot;files&quot;, or that produced
by the --Istdout option described below. This variation is
designed for <br>
use with collected &quot;libraries&quot; of drive
identification information, and can also be used on ATAPI
drives which may give media errors with the standard
mechanism. When <br>
--Istdin is used, it must be the *only* parameter given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Istdout <br>
This option dumps the drive&rsquo;s identify data in hex to
stdout, in a format similar to that from
/proc/ide/*/identify, and suitable for later use with the
--Istdin option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Get/set the Western Digital
(WD) Green Drive&rsquo;s &quot;idle3&quot; timeout value.
This timeout controls how often the drive parks its heads
and enters a low power consumption state. <br>
The factory default is eight (8) seconds, which is a very
poor choice for use with Linux. Leaving it at the default
will result in hundreds of thousands of head <br>
load/unload cycles in a very short period of time. The drive
mechanism is only rated for 300,000 to 1,000,000 cycles, so
leaving it at the default could result in prema&acirc; <br>
ture failure, not to mention the performance impact of the
drive often having to wake-up before doing routine I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WD supply a WDIDLE3.EXE DOS
utility for tweaking this setting, and you should use that
program instead of hdparm if at all possible. The
reverse-engineered implementation <br>
in hdparm is not as complete as the original official
program, even though it does seem to work on at a least a
few drives. A full power cycle is required for any change
<br>
in setting to take effect, regardless of which program is
used to tweak things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A setting of 30 seconds is
recommended for Linux use. Permitted values are from 8 to 12
seconds, and from 30 to 300 seconds in 30-second increments.
Specify a value of <br>
zero (0) to disable the WD idle3 timer completely (NOT
RECOMMENDED!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Get/set the
&quot;keep_settings_over_reset&quot; flag for the drive.
When this flag is set, the drive will preserve the -dmu
settings over a soft reset, (as done during the error <br>
recovery sequence). This option defaults to off, to prevent
drive reset loops which could be caused by combinations of
-dmu settings. The -k option should therefore only <br>
be set after one has achieved confidence in correct system
operation with a chosen set of configuration settings. In
practice, all that is typically necessary to test a <br>
configuration (prior to using -k) is to verify that the
drive can be read/written, and that no error logs (kernel
messages) are generated in the process (look in <br>
/var/log/messages on most systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Set the drive&Acirc;&acute;s
&quot;keep_features_over_reset&quot; flag. Setting this
enables the drive to retain the settings for -APSWXZ over a
soft reset (as done during the error recovery <br>
sequence). Not all drives support this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Set the drive&Acirc;&acute;s
doorlock flag. Setting this to 1 will lock the door
mechanism of some removable hard drives (e.g. Syquest, ZIP,
Jazz..), and setting it to 0 will unlock <br>
the door mechanism. Normally, Linux maintains the door
locking mechanism automatically, depending on drive usage
(locked whenever a filesystem is mounted). But on system
<br>
shutdown, this can be a nuisance if the root partition is on
a removable disk, since the root partition is left mounted
(read-only) after shutdown. So, by using this com&acirc;
<br>
mand to unlock the door after the root filesystem is
remounted read-only, one can then remove the cartridge from
the drive after shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Get/set sector count for
multiple sector I/O on the drive. A setting of 0 disables
this feature. Multiple sector mode (aka IDE Block Mode), is
a feature of most modern <br>
IDE hard drives, permitting the transfer of multiple sectors
per I/O interrupt, rather than the usual one sector per
interrupt. When this feature is enabled, it typically <br>
reduces operating system overhead for disk I/O by 30-50%. On
many systems, it also provides increased data throughput of
anywhere from 5% to 50%. Some drives, however <br>
(most notably the WD Caviar series), seem to run slower with
multiple mode enabled. Your mileage may vary. Most drives
support the minimum settings of 2, 4, 8, or 16 <br>
(sectors). Larger settings may also be possible, depending
on the drive. A setting of 16 or 32 seems optimal on many
systems. Western Digital recommends lower settings <br>
of 4 to 8 on many of their drives, due tiny (32kB) drive
buffers and non-optimized buffering algorithms. The -i
option can be used to find the maximum setting supported
<br>
by an installed drive (look for MaxMultSect in the output).
Some drives claim to support multiple mode, but lose data at
some settings. Under rare circumstances, such <br>
failures can result in massive filesystem corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--make-bad-sector <br>
Deliberately create a bad sector (aka. &quot;media
error&quot;) on the disk. EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO NOT
USE THIS OPTION!! This can be useful for testing of
device/RAID error <br>
recovery mechanisms. The sector number is given as a
(base10) parameter after the option. Depending on the
device, hdparm will choose one of two possible ATA commands
<br>
for corrupting the sector. The WRITE_LONG works on most
drives, but only up to the 28-bit sector boundary. Some very
recent drives (2008) may support the new <br>
WRITE_UNCORRECTABLE_EXT command, which works for any LBA48
sector. If available, hdparm will use that in preference to
WRITE_LONG. The WRITE_UNCORRECTABLE_EXT command <br>
itself presents a choice of how the new bad sector should
behave. By default, it will look like any other bad sector,
and the drive may take some time to retry and fail <br>
on subsequent READs of the sector. However, if a single
letter f is prepended immediately in front of the first
digit of the sector number parameter, then hdparm will <br>
issue a &quot;flagged&quot; WRITE_UNCORRECTABLE_EXT, which
causes the drive to merely flag the sector as bad (rather
than genuinely corrupt it), and subsequent READs of the
sector <br>
will fail immediately (rather than after several retries).
Note also that the --repair-sector option can be used to
restore (any) bad sectors when they are no longer <br>
needed, including sectors that were genuinely bad (the drive
will likely remap those to a fresh area on the media).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Get/set Automatic Acoustic
Management (AAM) setting. Most modern harddisk drives have
the ability to speed down the head movements to reduce their
noise output. The pos&acirc; <br>
sible values are between 0 and 254. 128 is the most quiet
(and therefore slowest) setting and 254 the fastest (and
loudest). Some drives have only two levels (quiet / <br>
fast), while others may have different levels between 128
and 254. At the moment, most drives only support 3 options,
off, quiet, and fast. These have been assigned the <br>
values 0, 128, and 254 at present, respectively, but integer
space has been incorporated for future expansion, should
this change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Get or set the
&quot;ignore_write_errors&quot; flag in the driver. Do NOT
play with this without grokking the driver source code
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Get/set max visible number of
sectors, also known as the Host Protected Area setting.
Without a parameter, -N displays the current setting, which
is reported as two val&acirc; <br>
ues: the first gives the current max sectors setting, and
the second shows the native (real) hardware limit for the
disk. The difference between these two values indi&acirc;
<br>
cates how many sectors of the disk are currently hidden from
the operating system, in the form of a Host Protected Area
(HPA). This area is often used by computer makers <br>
to hold diagnostic software, and/or a copy of the originally
provided operating system for recovery purposes. Another
possible use is to hide the true capacity of a very <br>
large disk from a BIOS/system that cannot normally cope with
drives of that size (eg. most current {2010} BIOSs cannot
deal with drives larger than 2TB, so an HPA could be <br>
used to cause a 3TB drive to report itself as a 2TB drive).
To change the current max (VERY DANGEROUS, DATA LOSS IS
EXTREMELY LIKELY), a new value should be provided (in <br>
base10) immediately following the -N option. This value is
specified as a count of sectors, rather than the &quot;max
sector address&quot; of the drive. Drives have the concept
of <br>
a temporary (volatile) setting which is lost on the next
hardware reset, as well as a more permanent (non-volatile)
value which survives resets and power cycles. By <br>
default, -N affects only the temporary (volatile) setting.
To change the permanent (non-volatile) value, prepend a
leading p character immediately before the first digit <br>
of the value. Drives are supposed to allow only a single
permanent change per session. A hardware reset (or power
cycle) is required before another permanent -N opera&acirc;
<br>
tion can succeed. Note that any attempt to set this value
may fail if the disk is being accessed by other software at
the same time. This is because setting the value <br>
requires a pair of back-to-back drive commands, but there is
no way to prevent some other command from being inserted
between them by the kernel. So if it fails ini&acirc; <br>
tially, just try again. Kernel support for -N is buggy for
many adapter types across many kernel versions, in that an
incorrect (too small) max size value is sometimes <br>
reported. As of the 2.6.27 kernel, this does finally seem to
be working on most hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--offset <br>
Offsets to given number of GiB (1024*1024*1024) when
performing -t timings of device reads. Speed changes (about
twice) along many mechanical drives. Usually the maximum
<br>
is at the beginning, but not always. Solid-state drives
(SSDs) should show similar timings regardless of offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Attempt to reprogram the IDE
interface chipset for the specified PIO mode, or attempt to
auto-tune for the &quot;best&quot; PIO mode supported by the
drive. This feature is sup&acirc; <br>
ported in the kernel for only a few &quot;known&quot;
chipsets, and even then the support is iffy at best. Some
IDE chipsets are unable to alter the PIO mode for a single
drive, in <br>
which case this option may cause the PIO mode for both
drives to be set. Many IDE chipsets support either fewer or
more than the standard six (0 to 5) PIO modes, so the <br>
exact speed setting that is actually implemented will vary
by chipset/driver sophistication. Use with extreme caution!
This feature includes zero protection for the <br>
unwary, and an unsuccessful outcome may result in severe
filesystem corruption!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Set the maximum sector count
for the drive&Acirc;&acute;s internal prefetch mechanism.
Not all drives support this feature, and it was dropped from
the offical spec as of ATA-4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefer-ata12 <br>
When using the SAT (SCSI ATA Translation) protocol, hdparm
normally prefers to use the 16-byte command format whenever
possible. But some USB drive enclosures don&rsquo;t work
<br>
correctly with 16-byte commands. This option can be used to
force use of the smaller 12-byte command format with such
drives. hdparm will still revert to 16-byte com&acirc; <br>
mands for things that cannot be done with the 12-byte format
(e.g. sector accesses beyond 28-bits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Handle the next option
quietly, suppressing normal output (but not error messages).
This is useful for reducing screen clutter when running from
system startup scripts. <br>
Not applicable to the -i or -v or -t or -T options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Get or set the device&rsquo;s
command queue_depth, if supported by the hardware. This only
works with 2.6.xx (or later) kernels, and only with device
and driver combinations <br>
which support changing the queue_depth. For SATA disks, this
is the Native Command Queuing (NCQ) queue depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Get/set read-only flag for
the device. When set, Linux disallows write operations on
the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Get/set Write-Read-Verify
feature, if the drive supports it. Usage: -R0 (disable) or
-R1 (enable). This feature is intended to have the drive
firmware automatically <br>
read-back any data that is written by software, to verify
that the data was successfully written. This is generally
overkill, and can slow down disk writes by as much as <br>
a factor of two (or more).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--read-sector <br>
Reads from the specified sector number, and dumps the
contents in hex to standard output. The sector number must
be given (base10) after this option. hdparm will issue a
<br>
low-level read (completely bypassing the usual block layer
read/write mechanisms) for the specified sector. This can be
used to definitively check whether a given sector <br>
is bad (media error) or not (doing so through the usual
mechanisms can sometimes give false positives).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--repair-sector <br>
This is an alias for the --write-sector option. VERY
DANGEROUS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Enable/disable the power-on
in standby feature, if supported by the drive. VERY
DANGEROUS. Do not use unless you are absolutely certain that
both the system BIOS (or <br>
firmware) and the operating system kernel (Linux &gt;=
2.6.22) support probing for drives that use this feature.
When enabled, the drive is powered-up in the standby mode to
<br>
allow the controller to sequence the spin-up of devices,
reducing the instantaneous current draw burden when many
drives share a power supply. Primarily for use in large <br>
RAID setups. This feature is usually disabled and the drive
is powered-up in the active mode (see -C above). Note that a
drive may also allow enabling this feature by a <br>
jumper. Some SATA drives support the control of this feature
by pin 11 of the SATA power connector. In these cases, this
command may be unsupported or may have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Put the drive into idle
(low-power) mode, and also set the standby (spindown)
timeout for the drive. This timeout value is used by the
drive to determine how long to wait <br>
(with no disk activity) before turning off the spindle motor
to save power. Under such circumstances, the drive may take
as long as 30 seconds to respond to a subsequent <br>
disk access, though most drives are much quicker. The
encoding of the timeout value is somewhat peculiar. A value
of zero means &quot;timeouts are disabled&quot;: the device
will <br>
not automatically enter standby mode. Values from 1 to 240
specify multiples of 5 seconds, yielding timeouts from 5
seconds to 20 minutes. Values from 241 to 251 specify <br>
from 1 to 11 units of 30 minutes, yielding timeouts from 30
minutes to 5.5 hours. A value of 252 signifies a timeout of
21 minutes. A value of 253 sets a vendor-defined <br>
timeout period between 8 and 12 hours, and the value 254 is
reserved. 255 is interpreted as 21 minutes plus 15 seconds.
Note that some older drives may have very differ&acirc; <br>
ent interpretations of these values.</p>

through the buffer cache to the disk without any prior <br>
caching of data. This measurement is an indication of how
fast the drive can sustain sequential data reads under
Linux, without any filesystem overhead. To ensure
accu&acirc; <br>

under test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trim-sector-ranges <br>
For Solid State Drives (SSDs). EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO
NOT USE THIS OPTION!! Tells the drive firmware to discard
unneeded data sectors, destroying any data that may <br>
have been present within them. This makes those sectors
available for immediate use by the firmware&rsquo;s garbage
collection mechanism, to improve scheduling for
wear-level&acirc; <br>
ing of the flash media. This option expects one or more
sector range pairs immediately after the option: an LBA
starting address, a colon, and a sector count (max 65535),
<br>
with no intervening spaces. EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO NOT
USE THIS OPTION!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g. hdparm --trim-sector-ranges
1000:4 7894:16 /dev/sdz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trim-sector-ranges-stdin <br>
Identical to --trim-sector-ranges above, except the list of
lba:count pairs is read from stdin rather than being
specified on the command line. This can be used to avoid
<br>
problems with excessively long command lines. It also
permits batching of many more sector ranges into single
commands to the drive, up to the currently configured
trans&acirc; <br>
fer limit (max_sectors_kb).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Get/set the interrupt-unmask
flag for the drive. A setting of 1 permits the driver to
unmask other interrupts during processing of a disk
interrupt, which greatly <br>
improves Linux&Acirc;&acute;s responsiveness and eliminates
&quot;serial port overrun&quot; errors. Use this feature
with caution: some drive/controller combinations do not
tolerate the <br>
increased I/O latencies possible when this feature is
enabled, resulting in massive filesystem corruption. In
particular, CMD-640B and RZ1000 (E)IDE interfaces can be
<br>
unreliable (due to a hardware flaw) when this option is used
with kernel versions earlier than 2.0.13. Disabling the IDE
prefetch feature of these interfaces (usually a <br>
BIOS/CMOS setting) provides a safe fix for the problem for
use with earlier kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display some basic settings,
similar to -acdgkmur for IDE. This is also the default
behaviour when no options are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display program version and
exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Display extra diagnostics from some commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Perform a device reset
(DANGEROUS). Do NOT use this option. It exists for unlikely
situations where a reboot might otherwise be required to get
a confused drive back <br>
into a useable state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--write-sector <br>
Writes zeros to the specified sector number. VERY DANGEROUS.
The sector number must be given (base10) after this option.
hdparm will issue a low-level write (completely <br>
bypassing the usual block layer read/write mechanisms) to
the specified sector. This can be used to force a drive to
repair a bad sector (media error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Get/set the IDE/SATA
drive&Acirc;&acute;s write-caching feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Set the IDE transfer mode for
(E)IDE/ATA drives. This is typically used in combination
with -d1 when enabling DMA to/from a drive on a supported
interface chipset, where <br>
-X mdma2 is used to select multiword DMA mode2 transfers and
-X sdma1 is used to select simple mode 1 DMA transfers. With
systems which support UltraDMA burst timings, -X <br>
udma2 is used to select UltraDMA mode2 transfers
(you&Acirc;&acute;ll need to prepare the chipset for
UltraDMA beforehand). Apart from that, use of this option is
seldom necessary <br>
since most/all modern IDE drives default to their fastest
PIO transfer mode at power-on. Fiddling with this can be
both needless and risky. On drives which support <br>
alternate transfer modes, -X can be used to switch the mode
of the drive only. Prior to changing the transfer mode, the
IDE interface should be jumpered or programmed <br>
(see -p option) for the new mode setting to prevent loss
and/or corruption of data. Use this with extreme caution!
For the PIO (Programmed Input/Output) transfer modes <br>
used by Linux, this value is simply the desired PIO mode
number plus 8. Thus, a value of 09 sets PIO mode1, 10
enables PIO mode2, and 11 selects PIO mode3. Setting 00 <br>
restores the drive&Acirc;&acute;s &quot;default&quot; PIO
mode, and 01 disables IORDY. For multiword DMA, the value
used is the desired DMA mode number plus 32. for UltraDMA,
the value is the <br>
desired UltraDMA mode number plus 64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Force an IDE drive to
immediately enter the low power consumption standby mode,
usually causing it to spin down. The current power mode
status can be checked using the -C <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y Force an IDE drive to
immediately enter the lowest power consumption sleep mode,
causing it to shut down completely. A hard or soft reset is
required before the drive can <br>
be accessed again (the Linux IDE driver will automatically
handle issuing a reset if/when needed). The current power
mode status can be checked using the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Force a kernel re-read of the
partition table of the specified device(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Disable the automatic
power-saving function of certain Seagate drives (ST3xxx
models?), to prevent them from idling/spinning-down at
inconvenient times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATA Security Feature Set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These switches are DANGEROUS to
experiment with, and might not work with some kernels. USE
AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-help <br>
Display terse usage info for all of the --security-*
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-freeze <br>
Freeze the drive&Acirc;&acute;s security settings. The drive
does not accept any security commands until next power-on
reset. Use this function in combination with
--security-unlock <br>
to protect drive from any attempt to set a new password. Can
be used standalone, too. No other options are permitted on
the command line with this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-unlock PWD <br>
Unlock the drive, using password PWD. Password is given as
an ASCII string and is padded with NULs to reach 32 bytes.
The applicable drive password is selected with the <br>
--user-master switch (default is &quot;user&quot; password).
No other options are permitted on the command line with this
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-set-pass PWD <br>
Lock the drive, using password PWD (Set Password)
(DANGEROUS). Password is given as an ASCII string and is
padded with NULs to reach 32 bytes. Use the special password
<br>
NULL to set an empty password. The applicable drive password
is selected with the --user-master switch (default is
&quot;user&quot; password) and the applicable security mode
with <br>
the --security-mode switch. No other options are permitted
on the command line with this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-disable PWD <br>
Disable drive locking, using password PWD. Password is given
as an ASCII string and is padded with NULs to reach 32
bytes. The applicable drive password is selected with <br>
the --user-master switch (default is &quot;user&quot;
password). No other options are permitted on the command
line with this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-erase PWD <br>
Erase (locked) drive, using password PWD (DANGEROUS).
Password is given as an ASCII string and is padded with NULs
to reach 32 bytes. Use the special password NULL to <br>
represent an empty password. The applicable drive password
is selected with the --user-master switch (default is
&quot;user&quot; password). No other options are permitted
on the <br>
command line with this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-erase-enhanced PWD
<br>
Enhanced erase (locked) drive, using password PWD
(DANGEROUS). Password is given as an ASCII string and is
padded with NULs to reach 32 bytes. The applicable drive
pass&acirc; <br>
word is selected with the --user-master switch (default is
&quot;user&quot; password). No other options are permitted
on the command line with this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user-master USER <br>
Specifies which password (user/master) to select. Defaults
to user password. Only useful in combination with
--security-unlock, --security-set-pass, --security-disable,
<br>
--security-erase or --security-erase-enhanced. <br>
u user password <br>
m master password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security-mode MODE <br>

/etc/hdparm.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As noted above, the -m sectcount and -u 1 options should be
used with caution at first, preferably on a read-only
filesystem. Most drives work well with these features, but a
<br>
few drive/controller combinations are not 100% compatible.
Filesystem corruption may result. Backup everything before
experimenting!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options (e.g. -r for SCSI)
may not work with old kernels as necessary
ioctl()&Acirc;&acute;s were not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although this utility is
intended primarily for use with SATA/IDE hard disk devices,
several of the options are also valid (and permitted) for
use with SCSI hard disk devices and <br>
MFM/RLL hard disks with XT interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Linux kernel up until 2.6.12
(and probably later) doesn&Acirc;&acute;t handle the
security unlock and disable commands gracefully and will
segfault and in some cases even panic. The secu&acirc; <br>
rity commands however might indeed have been executed by the
drive. This poor kernel behaviour makes the PIO data
security commands rather useless at the moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the &quot;security
erase&quot; and &quot;security disable&quot; commands have
been implemented as two consecutive PIO data commands and
will not succeed on a locked drive because the sec&acirc;
<br>
ond command will not be issued after the segfault. See the
code for hints how patch it to work around this problem.
Despite the segfault it is often still possible to run two
<br>
instances of hdparm consecutively and issue the two
necessary commands that way.</p>
