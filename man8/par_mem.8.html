<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
par_mem - memory parallelism benchmark</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
par_mem [ -L &lt;line size&gt; ] [ -M &lt;len&gt; ] [ -W
&lt;warmups&gt; ] [ -N &lt;repetitions&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
par_mem measures the available parallelism in the memory
hierarchy, up to len bytes. Modern processors can often
service multiple memory requests in parallel, while older
pro&acirc; <br>
cessors typically blocked on LOAD instructions and had no
available parallelism (other than that provided by cache
prefetching). par_mem measures the available parallelism at
a <br>
variety of points, since the available parallelism is often
a function of the data location in the memory hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to measure the
available parallelism par_mem conducts a variety of
experiments at each memory size; one for each level of
parallelism. It builds a pointer chain of the <br>
desired length. It then creates an array of pointers which
point to chain entries which are evenly spaced across the
chain. Then it starts running the pointers forward through
<br>
the chain in parallel. It can then measure the average
memory latency for each level of parallelism, and the
available parallelism is the minimum average memory latency
for par&acirc; <br>
allelism 1 divided by the average memory latency across all
levels of available parallelism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the inner loop
which measures parallelism 2 would look something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) { p0
= (char **)*p0; p1 = (char **)*p1; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in a for loop (the overhead of
the for loop is not significant; the loop is an unrolled
loop 100 loads long). In this case, if the hardware can
process two LOAD operations in <br>
parallel, then the overall latency of the loop should be
equivalent to that of a single pointer chain, so the
measured parallelism would be roughly two. If, however, the
hard&acirc; <br>
ware can only process a single LOAD operation at once, or if
there is (significant) resource contention between the two
LOAD operations, then the loop will be much slower than a
<br>
loop with a single pointer chain, so the measured
parallelism will be less than two, and probably no smaller
than one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
Output format is intended as input to xgraph or some similar
program (we use a perl script that produces pic input).
There is a set of data produced for each stride. The data
<br>
set title is the stride size and the data points are the
array size in megabytes (floating point value) and the load
latency over all points in that array.</p>
