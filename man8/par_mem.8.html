par_mem - memory parallelism benchmark
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>par_mem</b> [ <i>-L &lt;line size&gt;</i> ] [ <i>-M &lt;len&gt;</i> ] [ <i>-W
  &lt;warmups&gt;</i> ] [ <i>-N &lt;repetitions&gt;</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>par_mem</b> measures the available parallelism in the memory hierarchy, up to
  <i>len</i> bytes. Modern processors can often service multiple memory requests
  in parallel, while older processors typically blocked on LOAD instructions and
  had no available parallelism (other than that provided by cache prefetching).
  <b>par_mem</b> measures the available parallelism at a variety of points,
  since the available parallelism is often a function of the data location in
  the memory hierarchy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to measure the available parallelism <b>par_mem</b> conducts a variety
  of experiments at each memory size; one for each level of parallelism. It
  builds a pointer chain of the desired length. It then creates an array of
  pointers which point to chain entries which are evenly spaced across the
  chain. Then it starts running the pointers forward through the chain in
  parallel. It can then measure the average memory latency for each level of
  parallelism, and the available parallelism is the minimum average memory
  latency for parallelism 1 divided by the average memory latency across all
  levels of available parallelism.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the inner loop which measures parallelism 2 would look something
  like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) { 	p0 = (char **)*p0; 	p1 = (char **)*p1; }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
in a <i>for</i> loop (the overhead of the <i>for</i> loop is not significant;
  the loop is an unrolled loop 100 loads long). In this case, if the hardware
  can process two LOAD operations in parallel, then the overall latency of the
  loop should be equivalent to that of a single pointer chain, so the measured
  parallelism would be roughly two. If, however, the hardware can only process a
  single LOAD operation at once, or if there is (significant) resource
  contention between the two LOAD operations, then the loop will be much slower
  than a loop with a single pointer chain, so the measured parallelism will be
  less than two, and probably no smaller than one.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></h1>
Output format is intended as input to <b>xgraph</b> or some similar program (we
  use a perl script that produces pic input). There is a set of data produced
  for each stride. The data set title is the stride size and the data points are
  the array size in megabytes (floating point value) and the load latency over
  all points in that array.
