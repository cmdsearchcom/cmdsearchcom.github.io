<p style="margin-top: 1em">ypbind --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ypbind finds the server for NIS domains and maintains the
NIS binding information. The client (normally the NIS
routines in the standard C library) could get the
information over <br>
RPC from ypbind or read the binding files. The binding files
resides in the directory /var/yp/binding and are
conventionally named [domainname].[version]. The supported
versions <br>
are 1 and 2. There could be several such files since it is
possible for an NIS client to be bound to more than one
domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a binding has been
established, ypbind will send YPPROC_DOMAIN requests to the
current NIS server at 20 seconds intervals. If it
doesn&rsquo;t get an response or the NIS server <br>
reports that he doesn&rsquo;t have this domain any longer,
ypbind will search for a new NIS server. All 15 minutes
ypbind will check to see if the current NIS server is the
fastest. If <br>
it find a server which answers faster, it will switch to
this server. You could tell ypbind to use network broadcasts
to find a new server, what is insecure, or you could give it
<br>
a list of known secure servers. In this case ypbind will
send a ping to all servers and binds to first one which
answers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the option -debug is
used, ypbind detaches itself from the controlling terminal
and puts itself into background. ypbind uses syslog(3) for
logging errors and warnings. At <br>
startup or when receiving signal SIGHUP, ypbind parses the
file /etc/yp.conf and tries to use the entries for its
initial binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A broadcast entry in the
configuration file will overwrite a ypserver/server entry
and a ypserver/server entry broadcast. If all given server
are down, ypbind will not switch to <br>
use broadcast. ypbind will try at first /etc/hosts and then
DNS for resolving the hosts names from /etc/yp.conf. If
ypbind couldn&rsquo;t reconfigure the search order, it will
use <br>
only DNS. If DNS isn&rsquo;t available, you could only use
IP-addresses in /etc/hosts. ypbind could only reconfigure
the search order with glibc 2.x. If the -broadcast option is
<br>
specified, ypbind will ignore the configuration file. If the
file does not exist or if there are no valid entries, ypbind
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This ypbind version listens for
DBUS messages from NetworkManager. If no NetworkManager is
running at startup, ypbind will behave as usual and assumes
there is a working network <br>
connection. If NetworkManager is running on the system,
ypbind will only search and provide NIS informations, if
NetworkManager tells that a network connection is available.
If <br>
NetworkManager establishes a connection, ypbind will reread
all configuration files, registers at the local portmapper
and try to search NIS servers. If NetworkManager drops a
<br>
connection, ypbind will unregister from portmapper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Fedora we use systemd for
starting services. We need to finish starting process of
ypbind service not before service is fully started, which
means ypbind daemon is prepared to <br>
answer. There is a test script
/usr/libexec/ypbind-post-waitbind used in ypbind.service,
that waits for ypbind daemon to be fully connected to NIS
server and waits by default up <br>
to 45s. Sometimes this is not enough, because network set up
can take longer than 45s during boot, so starting
ypbind.service fails. User can increase the timeout by
setting an <br>
environment variable NISTIMEOUT in /etc/sysconfig/ypbind.
For example NISTIMEOUT=180 means ypbind will wait up to 180
seconds for binding to a NIS server. Another option is to
<br>
enable NetworkManager-wait-online.service and add an
ordering rule into ypbind.service, ideally by creating
/etc/systemd/system/ypbind.service with the following
content:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.include
/lib/systemd/system/ypbind.service <br>
[Service] <br>
After=NetworkManager-wait-online.service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-broadcast <br>
Send a broadcast to request the information needed to bind
to a specific NIS server. With this option, /etc/yp.conf
will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ypset <br>
Allow root from any remote machine to change the binding for
a domain via the ypset(8) command. By default, no one can
change the binding. This option is really insecure. If <br>
you change a binding for a domain, all the current known
servers for this domain will be forgotten. If the new server
goes down, ypbind will use the old searchlist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ypsetme <br>
The same as -ypset, but only root on the local machine is
allowed to change the binding. Such requests are only
allowed from loopback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
ypbind only checks if the config file has syntax errors and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -debug <br>
starts ypbind in debug mode. ypbind will not put itself into
background, and error messages and debug output are written
to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, -foreground <br>
ypbind will not put itself into backgroun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, -verbose <br>
Causes ypbind to syslog(2) any and all changes in the server
its bound to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-broken-server <br>
Lets ypbind accept answers from servers running on an
illegal port number. This should usually be avoided, but is
required by some ypserv(8) versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-ping <br>
ypbind will not check if the binding is alive. This option
is for use with dialup connections to prevent ypbind from
keeping the connection unnecessarily open or causing <br>
auto-dials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f configfile <br>
ypbind will use configfile and not /etc/yp.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-local-only <br>
ypbind will only bind to the loopback device and is not
reachable from a remote network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Lets ypbind listen on a specified port number, rather than
asking portmapper to assing a port for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, -ping-interval ping-interval
<br>
The default value for ypbind to check, if a NIS server is
still reachable, is 20 seconds. With this options another
frequency in seconds can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, -rebind-interval
rebind-interval <br>
The default value for ypbind to search for the fastest NIS
server is 900 seconds (15 minutes). With this options
another frequency in seconds can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log log-options <br>
Allows to log special events. log-options is a logical sum
of values for particular events - 1 for logging rpc calls, 2
for logging broken server calls, 4 for logging server <br>
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-dbus <br>
Disables DBUS support if compiled in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints the version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/yp.conf <br>
configuration file.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/yp/binding/[domainname].[version]
<br>
binding file containing information about each NIS
domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/ypbind.pid <br>
contains the process id of the currently running ypbind
master process.</p>
