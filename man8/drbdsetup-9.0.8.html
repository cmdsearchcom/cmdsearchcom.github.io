drbdsetup - Configure the DRBD kernel module
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 10.00ex; text-indent: -10.00ex;"><b>drbdsetup</b>
  command {argument...} [option...]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>drbdsetup</b> utility serves to configure the DRBD kernel module and to
  show its current configuration. Users usually interact with the <b>drbdadm</b>
  utility, which provides a more high-level interface to DRBD than
  <b>drbdsetup</b>. (See <b>drbdadm</b>'s <b>--dry-run</b> option to see how
  <b>drbdadm</b> uses <b>drbdsetup</b>.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some option arguments have a default scale which applies when a plain number is
  specified (for example Kilo, or 1024 times the numeric value). Such default
  scales can be overridden by using a suffix (for example, M for Mega). The
  common suffixes K = 2^10 = 1024, M = 1024 K, and G = 1024 M are supported.

<b>drbdsetup</b> attach <i>minor</i> <i>lower_dev</i> <i>meta_data_dev</i>
  <i>meta_data_index</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> disk-options <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>attach</b> command attaches a
  lower-level device to an existing replicated device. The <b>disk-options</b>
  command changes the disk options of an attached lower-level device. In either
  case, the replicated device must have been created with <b>drbdsetup
  new-minor</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Both commands refer to the replicated device by its <i>minor</i> number.
  <i>lower_dev</i> is the name of the lower-level device. <i>meta_data_dev</i>
  is the name of the device containing the metadata, and may be the same as
  <i>lower_dev</i>. <i>meta_data_index</i> is either a numeric metadata index,
  or the keyword <b>internal</b> for internal metadata, or the keyword
  <b>flexible</b> for variable-size external metadata. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--al-extents </b><b></b><i>extents</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">DRBD automatically maintains a &quot;hot&quot;
  or &quot;active&quot; disk area likely to be written to again soon based on
  the recent write activity. The &quot;active&quot; disk area can be written to
  immediately, while &quot;inactive&quot; disk areas must be
  &quot;activated&quot; first, which requires a meta-data write. We also refer
  to this active disk area as the &quot;activity log&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The activity log saves meta-data writes, but the whole log must be resynced upon
  recovery of a failed node. The size of the activity log is a major factor of
  how long a resync will take and how fast a replicated disk will become
  consistent after a crash.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The activity log consists of a number of 4-Megabyte segments; the
  <i>al-extents</i> parameter determines how many of those segments can be
  active at the same time. The default value for <i>al-extents</i> is 1237, with
  a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 65536.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the effective maximum may be smaller, depending on how you created the
  device meta data, see also <b>drbdmeta</b>(8) The effective maximum is 919 *
  (available on-disk activity-log ring-buffer area/4kB -1), the default 32kB
  ring-buffer effects a maximum of 6433 (covers more than 25 GiB of data) We
  recommend to keep this well within the amount your backend storage and
  replication link are able to resync inside of about 5 minutes.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--al-updates </b><b>{yes | no}</b><b> </b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">With this parameter, the activity log can be
  turned off entirely (see the <b>al-extents</b> parameter). This will speed up
  writes because fewer meta-data writes will be necessary, but the entire device
  needs to be resynchronized opon recovery of a failed primary node. The default
  value for <b>al-updates</b> is <b>yes</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--disk-barrier</b>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--disk-flushes</b>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--disk-drain</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">DRBD has three methods of handling the
  ordering of dependent write requests:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>disk-barrier</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use disk barriers to make sure that requests
  are written to disk in the right order. Barriers ensure that all requests
  submitted before a barrier make it to the disk before any requests submitted
  after the barrier. This is implemented using 'tagged command queuing' on SCSI
  devices and 'native command queuing' on SATA devices. Only some devices and
  device stacks support this method. The device mapper (LVM) only supports
  barriers in some configurations.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that on systems which do not support disk barriers, enabling this option
  can lead to data loss or corruption. Until DRBD 8.4.1, <b>disk-barrier</b> was
  turned on if the I/O stack below DRBD did support barriers. Kernels since
  linux-2.6.36 (or 2.6.32 RHEL6) no longer allow to detect if barriers are
  supported. Since drbd-8.4.2, this option is off by default and needs to be
  enabled explicitly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>disk-flushes</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use disk flushes between dependent write
  requests, also referred to as 'force unit access' by drive vendors. This
  forces all data to disk. This option is enabled by default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>disk-drain</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Wait for the request queue to
  &quot;drain&quot; (that is, wait for the requests to finish) before submitting
  a dependent write request. This method requires that requests are stable on
  disk when they finish. Before DRBD 8.0.9, this was the only method
  implemented. This option is enabled by default. Do not disable in production
  environments.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
From these three methods, drbd will use the first that is enabled and supported
  by the backing storage device. If all three of these options are turned off,
  DRBD will submit write requests without bothering about dependencies.
  Depending on the I/O stack, write requests can be reordered, and they can be
  submitted in a different order on different cluster nodes. This can result in
  data loss or corruption. Therefore, turning off all three methods of
  controlling write ordering is strongly discouraged.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A general guideline for configuring write ordering is to use disk barriers or
  disk flushes when using ordinary disks (or an ordinary disk array) with a
  volatile write cache. On storage without cache or with a battery backed write
  cache, disk draining can be a reasonable choice.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--disk-timeout</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the lower-level device on which a DRBD
  device stores its data does not finish an I/O request within the defined
  <b>disk-timeout</b>, DRBD treats this as a failure. The lower-level device is
  detached, and the device's disk state advances to Diskless. If DRBD is
  connected to one or more peers, the failed request is passed on to one of
  them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is <i>dangerous and may lead to kernel panic!</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;Aborting&quot; requests, or force-detaching the disk, is intended for
  completely blocked/hung local backing devices which do no longer complete
  requests at all, not even do error completions. In this situation, usually a
  hard-reset and failover is the only way out.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By &quot;aborting&quot;, basically faking a local error-completion, we allow for
  a more graceful swichover by cleanly migrating services. Still the affected
  node has to be rebooted &quot;soon&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By completing these requests, we allow the upper layers to re-use the associated
  data pages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If later the local backing device &quot;recovers&quot;, and now DMAs some data
  from disk into the original request pages, in the best case it will just put
  random data into unused pages; but typically it will corrupt meanwhile
  completely unrelated data, causing all sorts of damage.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Which means delayed successful completion, especially for READ requests, is a
  reason to panic(). We assume that a delayed *error* completion is OK, though
  we still will complain noisily about it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default value of <b>disk-timeout</b> is 0, which stands for an infinite
  timeout. Timeouts are specified in units of 0.1 seconds. This option is
  available since DRBD 8.3.12.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--md-flushes</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enable disk flushes and disk barriers on the
  meta-data device. This option is enabled by default. See the
  <b>disk-flushes</b> parameter.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--on-io-error </b><b></b><i>handler</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Configure how DRBD reacts to I/O errors on a
  lower-level device. The following policies are defined:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pass_on</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Change the disk status to Inconsistent, mark
  the failed block as inconsistent in the bitmap, and retry the I/O operation on
  a remote cluster node.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>call-local-io-error</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Call the <b>local-io-error</b> handler (see
  the <b>handlers</b> section).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>detach</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Detach the lower-level device and continue in
  diskless mode.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--read-balancing </b><b></b><i>policy</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Distribute read requests among cluster nodes
  as defined by <i>policy</i>. The supported policies are <b>prefer-local</b>
  (the default), <b>prefer-remote</b>, <b>round-robin</b>, <b>least-pending</b>,
  <b>when-congested-remote</b>, <b>32K-striping</b>, <b>64K-striping</b>,
  <b>128K-striping</b>, <b>256K-striping</b>, <b>512K-striping</b> and
  <b>1M-striping</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is available since DRBD 8.4.1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>resync-after </b><b></b><i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define that a device should only resynchronize
  after the specified other device. By default, no order between devices is
  defined, and all devices will resynchronize in parallel. Depending on the
  configuration of the lower-level devices, and the available network and disk
  bandwidth, this can slow down the overall resync process. This option can be
  used to form a chain or tree of dependencies among devices.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--size </b><b></b><i>size</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify the size of the lower-level device
  explicitly instead of determining it automatically. The device size must be
  determined once and is remembered for the lifetime of the device. In order to
  determine it automatically, all the lower-level devices on all nodes must be
  attached, and all nodes must be connected. If the size is specified
  explicitly, this is not necessary. The <b>size</b> value is assumed to be in
  units of sectors (512 bytes) by default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--discard-zeroes-if-aligned </b><b>{yes | no}</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">There are several aspects to
  discard/trim/unmap support on linux block devices. Even if discard is
  supported in general, it may fail silently, or may partially ignore discard
  requests. Devices also announce whether reading from unmapped blocks returns
  defined data (usually zeroes), or undefined data (possibly old data, possibly
  garbage).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If on different nodes, DRBD is backed by devices with differing discard
  characteristics, discards may lead to data divergence (old data or garbage
  left over on one backend, zeroes due to unmapped areas on the other backend).
  Online verify would now potentially report tons of spurious differences. While
  probably harmless for most use cases (fstrim on a file system), DRBD cannot
  have that.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To play safe, we have to disable discard support, if our local backend (on a
  Primary) does not support &quot;discard_zeroes_data=true&quot;. We also have
  to translate discards to explicit zero-out on the receiving side, unless the
  receiving side (Secondary) supports &quot;discard_zeroes_data=true&quot;,
  thereby allocating areas what were supposed to be unmapped.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are some devices (notably the LVM/DM thin provisioning) that are capable
  of discard, but announce discard_zeroes_data=false. In the case of DM-thin,
  discards aligned to the chunk size will be unmapped, and reading from unmapped
  sectors will return zeroes. However, unaligned partial head or tail areas of
  discard requests will be silently ignored.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If we now add a helper to explicitly zero-out these unaligned partial areas,
  while passing on the discard of the aligned full chunks, we effectively
  achieve discard_zeroes_data=true on such devices.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Setting <b>discard-zeroes-if-aligned</b> to <b>yes</b> will allow DRBD to use
  discards, and to announce discard_zeroes_data=true, even on backends that
  announce discard_zeroes_data=false.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Setting <b>discard-zeroes-if-aligned</b> to <b>no</b> will cause DRBD to always
  fall-back to zero-out on the receiving side, and to not even announce discard
  capabilities on the Primary, if the respective backend announces
  discard_zeroes_data=false.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
We used to ignore the discard_zeroes_data setting completely. To not break
  established and expected behaviour, and suddenly cause fstrim on
  thin-provisioned LVs to run out-of-space instead of freeing up space, the
  default value is <b>yes</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is available since 8.4.7.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--rs-discard-granularity </b><b></b><i>byte</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When <b>rs-discard-granularity</b> is set to a
  non zero, positive value then DRBD tries to do a resync operation in requests
  of this size. In case such a block contains only zero bytes on the sync source
  node, the sync target node will issue a discard/trim/unmap command for the
  area.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The value is constrained by the discard granularity of the backing block device.
  In case <b>rs-discard-granularity</b> is not a multiplier of the discard
  granularity of the backing block device DRBD rounds it up. The feature only
  gets active if the backing block device reads back zeroes after a discard
  command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default value of is 0. This option is available since 8.4.7.</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> peer-device-options <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
  <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">These are options that affect the
  <i>peer</i>'s device.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--c-delay-target </b><b></b><i>delay_target</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--c-fill-target </b><b></b><i>fill_target</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--c-max-rate </b><b></b><i>max_rate</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--c-plan-ahead </b><b></b><i>plan_time</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Dynamically control the resync speed. This
  mechanism is enabled by setting the <b>c-plan-ahead</b> parameter to a
  positive value. The goal is to either fill the buffers along the data path
  with a defined amount of data if <b>c-fill-target</b> is defined, or to have a
  defined delay along the path if <b>c-delay-target</b> is defined. The maximum
  bandwidth is limited by the <b>c-max-rate</b> parameter.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>c-plan-ahead</b> parameter defines how fast drbd adapts to changes in the
  resync speed. It should be set to five times the network round-trip time or
  more. Common values for <b>c-fill-target</b> for &quot;normal&quot; data paths
  range from 4K to 100K. If drbd-proxy is used, it is advised to use
  <b>c-delay-target</b> instead of <b>c-fill-target</b>. The
  <b>c-delay-target</b> parameter is used if the <b>c-fill-target</b> parameter
  is undefined or set to 0. The <b>c-delay-target</b> parameter should be set to
  five times the network round-trip time or more. The <b>c-max-rate</b> option
  should be set to either the bandwidth available between the DRBD-hosts and the
  machines hosting DRBD-proxy, or to the available disk bandwidth.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default values of these parameters are: <b>c-plan-ahead</b> = 20 (in units
  of 0.1 seconds), <b>c-fill-target</b> = 0 (in units of sectors),
  <b>c-delay-target</b> = 1 (in units of 0.1 seconds), and <b>c-max-rate</b> =
  102400 (in units of KiB/s).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<b>--c-min-rate </b><b></b><i>min_rate</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A node which is primary and sync-source has to
  schedule application I/O requests and resync I/O requests. The
  <b>c-min-rate</b> parameter limits how much bandwidth is available for resync
  I/O; the remaining bandwidth is used for application I/O.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A <b>c-min-rate</b> value of 0 means that there is no limit on the resync I/O
  bandwidth. This can slow down application I/O significantly. Use a value of 1
  (1 KiB/s) for the lowest possible resync rate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default value of <b>c-min-rate</b> is 4096, in units of KiB/s.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--resync-rate </b><b></b><i>rate</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define how much bandwidth DRBD may use for
  resynchronizing. DRBD allows &quot;normal&quot; application I/O even during a
  resync. If the resync takes up too much bandwidth, application I/O can become
  very slow. This parameter allows to avoid that. Please note this is option
  only works when the dynamic resync controller is disabled.</div>
</div>

<b>drbdsetup</b> check-resize <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Remember the current size of the lower-level

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--after-sb-0pri </b><b></b><i>policy</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define how to react if a split-brain scenario

  split-brain scenarios when two nodes connect; split-brain decisions are always
  between two nodes.) The defined policies are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>disconnect</b>

<b>discard-older-primary</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Resynchronize from the node which became

  the <b>discard-least-changes</b> policy is used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>discard-zero-changes</b>

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>violently-as0p</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Always take the decision of the
  <b>after-sb-0pri</b> algorithm, even if it causes an erratic change of the
  primary's view of the data. This is only useful if a single-node file system
  (i.e., not OCFS2 or GFS) with the <b>allow-two-primaries</b> flag is used.
  This option can cause the primary node to crash, and should not be used.</div>

</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--allow-two-primaries</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The most common way to configure DRBD devices
  is to allow only one node to be primary (and thus writable) at a time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In some scenarios it is preferable to allow two nodes to be primary at once; a
  mechanism outside of DRBD then must make sure that writes to the shared,
  replicated device happen in a coordinated way. This can be done with a
  shared-storage cluster file system like OCFS2 and GFS, or with virtual machine
  images and a virtual machine manager that can migrate virtual machines between
  physical machines.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>allow-two-primaries</b> parameter tells DRBD to allow two nodes to be
  primary at the same time. Never enable this option when using a
  non-distributed file system; otherwise, data corruption and node crashes will
  result!</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--always-asbp</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally the automatic after-split-brain
  policies are only used if current states of the UUIDs do not indicate the
  presence of a third node.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With this option you request that the automatic after-split-brain policies are
  used as long as the data sets of the nodes are somehow related. This might
  cause a full sync, if the UUIDs indicate the presence of a third node. (Or
  double faults led to strange UUID sets.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--connect-int </b><b></b><i>time</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">As soon as a connection between two nodes is
  configured with <b>drbdsetup connect</b>, DRBD immediately tries to establish
  the connection. If this fails, DRBD waits for <b>connect-int</b> seconds and
  then repeats. The default value of <b>connect-int</b> is 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--cram-hmac-alg </b><b></b><i>hash-algorithm</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Configure the hash-based message
  authentication code (HMAC) or secure hash algorithm to use for peer
  authentication. The kernel supports a number of different algorithms, some of
  which may be loadable as kernel modules. See the shash algorithms listed in
  /proc/crypto. By default, <b>cram-hmac-alg</b> is unset. Peer authentication
  also requires a <b>shared-secret</b> to be configured.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--csums-alg </b><b></b><i>hash-algorithm</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally, when two nodes resynchronize, the
  sync target requests a piece of out-of-sync data from the sync source, and the
  sync source sends the data. With many usage patterns, a significant number of
  those blocks will actually be identical.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When a <b>csums-alg</b> algorithm is specified, when requesting a piece of
  out-of-sync data, the sync target also sends along a hash of the data it
  currently has. The sync source compares this hash with its own version of the
  data. It sends the sync target the new data if the hashes differ, and tells it
  that the data are the same otherwise. This reduces the network bandwidth
  required, at the cost of higher cpu utilization and possibly increased I/O on
  the sync target.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>csums-alg</b> can be set to one of the secure hash algorithms supported
  by the kernel; see the shash algorithms listed in /proc/crypto. By default,
  <b>csums-alg</b> is unset.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--csums-after-crash-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enabling this option (and csums-alg, above)
  makes it possible to use the checksum based resync only for the first resync
  after primary crash, but not for later &quot;network hickups&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In most cases, block that are marked as need-to-be-resynced are in fact changed,
  so calculating checksums, and both reading and writing the blocks on the
  resync target is all effective overhead.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The advantage of checksum based resync is mostly after primary crash recovery,
  where the recovery marked larger areas (those covered by the activity log) as
  need-to-be-resynced, just in case. Introduced in 8.4.5.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--data-integrity-alg </b> <i>alg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">DRBD normally relies on the data integrity
  checks built into the TCP/IP protocol, but if a data integrity algorithm is
  configured, it will additionally use this algorithm to make sure that the data
  received over the network match what the sender has sent. If a data integrity
  error is detected, DRBD will close the network connection and reconnect, which
  will trigger a resync.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>data-integrity-alg</b> can be set to one of the secure hash algorithms
  supported by the kernel; see the shash algorithms listed in /proc/crypto. By
  default, this mechanism is turned off.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because of the CPU overhead involved, we recommend not to use this option in
  production environments. Also see the notes on data integrity below.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--fencing </b><b></b><i>fencing_policy</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><b>Fencing</b> is a preventive measure to
  avoid situations where both nodes are primary and disconnected. This is also
  known as a split-brain situation. DRBD supports the following fencing
  policies:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dont-care</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">No fencing actions are taken. This is the
  default policy.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>resource-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If a node becomes a disconnected primary, it
  tries to fence the peer. This is done by calling the <b>fence-peer</b>
  handler. The handler is supposed to reach the peer over an alternative
  communication path and call ' <b>drbdadm outdate minor</b>' there.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>resource-and-stonith</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If a node becomes a disconnected primary, it
  freezes all its IO operations and calls its fence-peer handler. The fence-peer
  handler is supposed to reach the peer over an alternative communication path
  and call ' <b>drbdadm outdate minor</b>' there. In case it cannot do that, it
  should stonith the peer. IO is resumed as soon as the situation is resolved.
  In case the fence-peer handler fails, I/O can be resumed manually with '
  <b>drbdadm resume-io</b>'.</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--ko-count </b><b></b><i>number</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If a secondary node fails to complete a write
  request in <b>ko-count</b> times the <b>timeout</b> parameter, it is excluded
  from the cluster. The primary node then sets the connection to this secondary
  node to Standalone. To disable this feature, you should explicitly set it to
  0; defaults may change between versions.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--max-buffers </b><b></b><i>number</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Limits the memory usage per DRBD minor device
  on the receiving side, or for internal buffers during resync or online-verify.
  Unit is PAGE_SIZE, which is 4 KiB on most systems. The minimum possible
  setting is hard coded to 32 (=128 KiB). These buffers are used to hold data
  blocks while they are written to/read from disk. To avoid possible distributed
  deadlocks on congestion, this setting is used as a throttle threshold rather
  than a hard limit. Once more than max-buffers pages are in use, further
  allocation from this pool is throttled. You want to increase max-buffers if
  you cannot saturate the IO backend on the receiving side.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--max-epoch-size </b><b></b><i>number</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define the maximum number of write requests
  DRBD may issue before issuing a write barrier. The default value is 2048, with
  a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 20000. Setting this parameter to a value below
  10 is likely to decrease performance.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--on-congestion </b><b></b><i>policy</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--congestion-fill </b><b></b><i>threshold</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--congestion-extents </b><b></b><i>threshold</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">By default, DRBD blocks when the TCP send
  queue is full. This prevents applications from generating further write
  requests until more buffer space becomes available again.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When DRBD is used together with DRBD-proxy, it can be better to use the
  <b>pull-ahead</b> <b>on-congestion</b> policy, which can switch DRBD into
  ahead/behind mode before the send queue is full. DRBD then records the
  differences between itself and the peer in its bitmap, but it no longer
  replicates them to the peer. When enough buffer space becomes available again,
  the node resynchronizes with the peer and switches back to normal replication.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This has the advantage of not blocking application I/O even when the queues fill
  up, and the disadvantage that peer nodes can fall behind much further. Also,
  while resynchronizing, peer nodes will become inconsistent.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The available congestion policies are <b>block</b> (the default) and
  <b>pull-ahead</b>. The <b>congestion-fill</b> parameter defines how much data
  is allowed to be &quot;in flight&quot; in this connection. The default value
  is 0, which disables this mechanism of congestion control, with a maximum of
  10 GiBytes. The <b>congestion-extents</b> parameter defines how many bitmap
  extents may be active before switching into ahead/behind mode, with the same
  default and limits as the <b>al-extents</b> parameter. The
  <b>congestion-extents</b> parameter is effective only when set to a value
  smaller than <b>al-extents</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Ahead/behind mode is available since DRBD 8.3.10.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--ping-int </b><b></b><i>interval</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When the TCP/IP connection to a peer is idle
  for more than <b>ping-int</b> seconds, DRBD will send a keep-alive packet to
  make sure that a failed peer or network connection is detected reasonably
  soon. The default value is 10 seconds, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of
  120 seconds. The unit is seconds.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--ping-timeout </b><b></b><i>timeout</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define the timeout for replies to keep-alive
  packets. If the peer does not reply within <b>ping-timeout</b>, DRBD will
  close and try to reestablish the connection. The default value is 0.5 seconds,
  with a minimum of 0.1 seconds and a maximum of 3 seconds. The unit is tenths
  of a second.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--socket-check-timeout </b><b></b><i>timeout</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">In setups involving a DRBD-proxy and
  connections that experience a lot of buffer-bloat it might be necessary to set
  <b>ping-timeout</b> to an unusual high value. By default DRBD uses the same
  value to wait if a newly established TCP-connection is stable. Since the
  DRBD-proxy is usually located in the same data center such a long wait time
  may hinder DRBD's connect process.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In such setups <b>socket-check-timeout</b> should be set to at least to the
  round trip time between DRBD and DRBD-proxy. I.e. in most cases to 1.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default unit is tenths of a second, the default value is 0 (which causes
  DRBD to use the value of <b>ping-timeout</b> instead). Introduced in
  8.4.5.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--protocol </b><b></b><i>name</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use the specified protocol on this connection.
  The supported protocols are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Writes to the DRBD device complete as soon as
  they have reached the local disk and the TCP/IP send buffer.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>B</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Writes to the DRBD device complete as soon as
  they have reached the local disk, and all peers have acknowledged the receipt
  of the write requests.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>C</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Writes to the DRBD device complete as soon as
  they have reached the local and all remote disks.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--rcvbuf-size </b><b></b><i>size</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Configure the size of the TCP/IP receive
  buffer. A value of 0 (the default) causes the buffer size to adjust
  dynamically. This parameter usually does not need to be set, but it can be set
  to a value up to 10 MiB. The default unit is bytes.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--rr-conflict</b> <i>policy</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option helps to solve the cases when the
  outcome of the resync decision is incompatible with the current role
  assignment in the cluster. The defined policies are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>disconnect</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">No automatic resynchronization, simply
  disconnect.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>violently</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Resync to the primary node is allowed,
  violating the assumption that data on a block device are stable for one of the
  nodes. <i>Do not use this option, it is dangerous.</i></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>call-pri-lost</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Call the <b>pri-lost</b> handler on one of the
  machines. The handler is expected to reboot the machine, which puts it into
  secondary role.</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--shared-secret </b><b></b><i>secret</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Configure the shared secret used for peer
  authentication. The secret is a string of up to 64 characters. Peer
  authentication also requires the <b>cram-hmac-alg</b> parameter to be
  set.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--sndbuf-size </b><b></b><i>size</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Configure the size of the TCP/IP send buffer.
  Since DRBD 8.0.13 / 8.2.7, a value of 0 (the default) causes the buffer size
  to adjust dynamically. Values below 32 KiB are harmful to the throughput on
  this connection. Large buffer sizes can be useful especially when protocol A
  is used over high-latency networks; the maximum value supported is 10
  MiB.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--tcp-cork</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">By default, DRBD uses the TCP_CORK socket
  option to prevent the kernel from sending partial messages; this results in
  fewer and bigger packets on the network. Some network stacks can perform worse
  with this optimization. On these, the <b>tcp-cork</b> parameter can be used to
  turn this optimization off.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--timeout </b><b></b><i>time</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define the timeout for replies over the
  network: if a peer node does not send an expected reply within the specified
  <b>timeout</b>, it is considered dead and the TCP/IP connection is closed. The
  timeout value must be lower than <b>connect-int</b> and lower than
  <b>ping-int</b>. The default is 6 seconds; the value is specified in tenths of
  a second.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--use-rle</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Each replicated device on a cluster node has a
  separate bitmap for each of its peer devices. The bitmaps are used for
  tracking the differences between the local and peer device: depending on the
  cluster state, a disk range can be marked as different from the peer in the
  device's bitmap, in the peer device's bitmap, or in both bitmaps. When two
  cluster nodes connect, they exchange each other's bitmaps, and they each
  compute the union of the local and peer bitmap to determine the overall
  differences.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Bitmaps of very large devices are also relatively large, but they usually
  compress very well using run-length encoding. This can save time and bandwidth
  for the bitmap transfers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>use-rle</b> parameter determines if run-length encoding should be used.
  It is on by default since DRBD 8.4.0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--verify-alg </b><b></b><i>hash-algorithm</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Online verification (<b>drbdadm verify</b>)
  computes and compares checksums of disk blocks (i.e., hash values) in order to
  detect if they differ. The <b>verify-alg</b> parameter determines which
  algorithm to use for these checksums. It must be set to one of the secure hash
  algorithms supported by the kernel before online verify can be used; see the
  shash algorithms listed in /proc/crypto.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
We recommend to schedule online verifications regularly during low-load periods,
  for example once a month. Also see the notes on data integrity below.</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> new-path <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i> <i>local-addr</i>
  <i>remote-addr</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>new-path</b> command creates a path
  within a <i>connection</i>. The connection must have been created with
  <b>drbdsetup new-peer</b>. <i>Local_addr</i> and <i>remote_addr</i> refer to
  the local and remote protocol, network address, and port in the format [
  <i>address-family</i>:] <i>address</i>[:<i>port</i>]. The address families
  <b>ipv4</b>, <b>ipv6</b>, <b>ssocks</b> (Dolphin Interconnect Solutions'
  &quot;super sockets&quot;), <b>sdp</b> (Infiniband Sockets Direct Protocol),
  and <b>sci</b> are supported ( <b>sci</b> is an alias for <b>ssocks</b>). If
  no address family is specified, <b>ipv4</b> is assumed. For all address
  families except <b>ipv6</b>, the <i>address</i> uses IPv4 address notation
  (for example, 1.2.3.4). For <b>ipv6</b>, the address is enclosed in brackets
  and uses IPv6 address notation (for example, [fd01:2345:6789:abcd::1]). The
  <i>port</i> defaults to 7788.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> connect <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>connect</b> command activates a
  connection. That means that the DRBD driver will bind and listen on all local
  addresses of the connection-'s paths. It will begin to try to establish one or
  more paths of the connection. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--tentative</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Only determine if a connection to the peer can
  be established and if a resync is necessary (and in which direction) without
  actually establishing the connection or starting the resync. Check the system
  log to see what DRBD would do without the <b>--tentative</b> option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--discard-my-data</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Discard the local data and resynchronize with
  the peer that has the most up-to-data data. Use this option to manually
  recover from a split-brain situation.</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> del-peer <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>del-peer</b> command removes a
  connection from a <i>resource</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> del-path <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i> <i>local-addr</i>
  <i>remote-addr</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>del-path</b> command removes a path
  from a <i>connection</i>. Please not that it fails if the path is necessary to
  keep a connected connection in tact. In order to remove all paths, disconnect
  the connection first.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> cstate <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the current state of a connection. The
  connection is identified by the node-id of the peer; see the <b>drbdsetup
  connect</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> del-minor <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Remove a replicated device. No lower-level
  device may be attached; see <b>drbdsetup detach</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> del-resource <i>resource</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Remove a resource. All volumes and connections
  must be removed first ( <b>drbdsetup del-minor</b>, <b>drbdsetup
  disconnect</b>). Alternatively, <b>drbdsetup down</b> can be used to remove a
  resource together with all its volumes and connections.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> detach <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Detach the lower-level device of a replicated
  device. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--force</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force the detach and return immediately. This
  puts the lower-level device into failed state until all pending I/O has
  completed, and then detaches the device. Any I/O not yet submitted to the
  lower-level device (for example, because I/O on the device was suspended) is
  assumed to have failed.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> disconnect <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Remove a connection to a peer host. The
  connection is identified by the node-id of the peer; see the <b>drbdsetup
  connect</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> down {<i>resource</i> | <i>all</i>}
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Take a resource down by removing all volumes,
  connections, and the resource itself.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> dstate <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the current disk state of a lower-level
  device.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> events2 {<i>resource</i> | <i>all</i>}
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the current state of all configured DRBD
  objects, followed by all changes to the state.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The output format is meant to be human as well as machine readable. The line
  starts with a word that indicates the kind of event: <b>exists</b> for an
  existing object; <b>create</b>, <b>destroy</b>, and <b>change</b> if an object
  is created, destroyed, or changed; or <b>call</b> or <b>response</b> if an
  event handler is called or it returns. The second word indicates the object
  the event applies to: <b>resource</b>, <b>device</b>, <b>connection</b>,
  <b>peer-device</b>, <b>helper</b>, or a dash (<b>-</b>) to indicate that the
  current state has been dumped completely.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The remaining words identify the object and describe the state that he object is
  in. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--now</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Terminate after reporting the current state.
  The default is to continuously listen and report state changes.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--statistics</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Include statistics in the output.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> get-gi <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i> <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the data generation identifiers for a
  device on a particular connection. The device is identified by its volume
  number. The connection is identified by its endpoints; see the <b>drbdsetup
  connect</b> command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The output consists of the current UUID, bitmap UUID, and the first two history
  UUIDS, folowed by a set of flags. The current UUID and history UUIDs are
  device specific; the bitmap UUID and flags are peer device specific. This
  command only shows the first two history UUIDs. Internally, DRBD maintains one
  history UUID for each possible peer device.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> invalidate <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Replace the local data of a device with that
  of a peer. All the local data will be marked out-of-sync, and a resync with
  the specified peer device will be initialted.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> invalidate-remote <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
  <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Replace a peer device's data of a resource
  with the local data. The peer device's data will be marked out-of-sync, and a
  resync from the local node to the specified peer will be initiated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> new-current-uuid <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Generate a new current UUID and rotates all
  other UUID values. This has at least two use cases, namely to skip the initial
  sync, and to reduce network bandwidth when starting in a single node
  configuration and then later (re-)integrating a remote site.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Available option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--clear-bitmap</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Clears the sync bitmap in addition to
  generating a new current UUID.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This can be used to skip the initial sync, if you want to start from scratch.
  This use-case does only work on &quot;Just Created&quot; meta data. Necessary
  steps:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.On <i>both</i> nodes, initialize meta data
  and configure the device.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdadm create-md --force </b><b></b><i>res</i></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.They need to do the initial handshake, so

<b>drbdadm up </b><b></b><i>res</i></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 3.They are now Connected Secondary/Secondary

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdadm --clear-bitmap new-current-uuid </b><b></b><i>res</i></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 4.They are now Connected Secondary/Secondary

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdadm primary </b><b></b><i>res</i>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One obvious side-effect is that the replica is full of old garbage (unless you
  made them identical using other means), so any online-verify is expected to
  find any number of out-of-sync blocks.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>You must not use this on pre-existing data!</i> Even though it may appear to
  work at first glance, once you switch to the other node, your data is toast,
  as it never got replicated. So <i>do not leave out the mkfs</i> (or
  equivalent).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This can also be used to shorten the initial resync of a cluster where the
  second node is added after the first node is gone into production, by means of
  disk shipping. This use-case works on disconnected devices only, the device
  may be in primary or secondary role.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The necessary steps on the current active server are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.<b>drbdsetup new-current-uuid
  --clear-bitmap </b> <b></b><i>minor</i><b> </b></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.Take the copy of the current active server.
  E.g. by pulling a disk out of the RAID1 controller, or by copying with dd. You
  need to copy the actual data, and the meta data.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 3.<b>drbdsetup new-current-uuid
  </b><b></b><i>minor</i><b> </b></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now add the disk to the new secondary node, and join it to the cluster. You will
  get a resync of that parts that were changed since the first call to
  <b>drbdsetup</b> in step 1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> new-minor <i>resource</i> <i>minor</i> <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Create a new replicated device within a
  resource. The command creates a block device inode for the replicated device
  (by default, /dev/drbd <i>minor</i>). The <i>volume</i> number identifies the
  device within the <i>resource</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> new-resource <i>resource</i> <i>node_id</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> resource-options <i>resource</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>new-resource</b> command creates a new
  resource. The <b>resource-options</b> command changes the resource options of
  an existing resource. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--auto-promote </b><b></b><i>bool-value</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A resource must be promoted to primary role
  before any of its devices can be mounted or opened for writing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Before DRBD 9, this could only be done explicitly (&quot;drbdadm primary&quot;).
  Since DRBD 9, the <b>auto-promote</b> parameter allows to automatically
  promote a resource to primary role when one of its devices is mounted or
  opened for writing. As soon as all devices are unmounted or closed with no
  more remaining users, the role of the resource changes back to secondary.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Automatic promotion only succeeds if the cluster state allows it (that is, if an
  explicit <b>drbdadm primary</b> command would succeed). Otherwise, mounting or
  opening the device fails as it already did before DRBD 9: the <b>mount</b>(2)
  system call fails with errno set to EROFS (Read-only file system); the
  <b>open</b>(2) system call fails with errno set to EMEDIUMTYPE (wrong medium
  type).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Irrespective of the <b>auto-promote</b> parameter, if a device is promoted
  explicitly ( <b>drbdadm primary</b>), it also needs to be demoted explicitly
  (<b>drbdadm secondary</b>).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>auto-promote</b> parameter is available since DRBD 9.0.0, and defaults to
  <b>yes</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--cpu-mask </b><b></b><i>cpu-mask</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the cpu affinity mask for DRBD kernel
  threads. The cpu mask is specified as a hexadecimal number. The default value
  is 0, which lets the scheduler decide which kernel threads run on which CPUs.
  CPU numbers in <b>cpu-mask</b> which do not exist in the system are
  ignored.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--on-no-data-accessible </b><b></b><i>policy</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Determine how to deal with I/O requests when
  the requested data is not available locally or remotely (for example, when all
  disks have failed). The defined policies are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>io-error</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">System calls fail with errno set to EIO.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>suspend-io</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The resource suspends I/O. I/O can be resumed
  by (re)attaching the lower-level device, by connecting to a peer which has
  access to the data, or by forcing DRBD to resume I/O with <b>drbdadm resume-io
  </b> <b></b><i>res</i>. When no data is available, forcing I/O to resume will
  result in the same behavior as the <b>io-error</b> policy.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This setting is available since DRBD 8.3.9; the default policy is
  <b>io-error</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--peer-ack-window </b><b></b><i>value</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">On each node and for each device, DRBD
  maintains a bitmap of the differences between the local and remote data for
  each peer device. For example, in a three-node setup (nodes A, B, C) each with
  a single device, every node maintains one bitmap for each of its peers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When nodes receive write requests, they know how to update the bitmaps for the
  writing node, but not how to update the bitmaps between themselves. In this
  example, when a write request propagates from node A to B and C, nodes B and C
  know that they have the same data as node A, but not whether or not they both
  have the same data.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As a remedy, the writing node occasionally sends peer-ack packets to its peers
  which tell them which state they are in relative to each other.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>peer-ack-window</b> parameter specifies how much data a primary node may
  send before sending a peer-ack packet. A low value causes increased network
  traffic; a high value causes less network traffic but higher memory
  consumption on secondary nodes and higher resync times between the secondary
  nodes after primary node failures. (Note: peer-ack packets may be sent due to
  other reasons as well, e.g. membership changes or expiry of the
  <b>peer-ack-delay</b> timer.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default value for <b>peer-ack-window</b> is 2 MiB, the default unit is
  sectors. This option is available since 9.0.0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--peer-ack-delay </b><b></b><i>expiry-time</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If after the last finished write request no
  new write request gets issued for <i>expiry-time</i>, then a peer-ack packet
  is sent. If a new write request is issued before the timer expires, the timer
  gets reset to <i>expiry-time</i>. (Note: peer-ack packets may be sent due to
  other reasons as well, e.g. membership changes or the <b>peer-ack-window</b>
  option.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This parameter may influence resync behavior on remote nodes. Peer nodes need to
  wait until they receive an peer-ack for releasing a lock on an AL-extent.
  Resync operations between peers may need to wait for for these locks.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default value for <b>peer-ack-delay</b> is 100 milliseconds, the default
  unit is milliseconds. This option is available since 9.0.0.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> outdate <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Mark the data on a lower-level device as
  outdated. This is used for fencing, and prevents the resource the device is
  part of from becoming primary in the future. See the <b>--fencing</b> disk
  option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> pause-sync <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i> <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Stop resynchronizing between a local and a
  peer device by setting the local pause flag. The resync can only resume if the
  pause flags on both sides of a connection are cleared.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> primary <i>resource</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Change the role of a node in a resource to
  primary. This allows the replicated devices in this resource to be mounted or
  opened for writing. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--overwrite-data-of-peer</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option is an alias for the <b>--force</b>
  option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--force</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force the resource to become primary even if
  some devices are not guaranteed to have up-to-date data. This option is used
  to turn one of the nodes in a newly created cluster into the primary node, or
  when manually recovering from a disaster.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this can lead to split-brain scenarios. Also, when forcefully turning
  an inconsistent device into an up-to-date device, it is highly recommended to
  use any integrity checks available (such as a filesystem check) to make sure
  that the device can at least be used without crashing the system.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that DRBD usually only allows one node in a cluster to be in primary role
  at any time; this allows DRBD to coordinate access to the devices in a
  resource across nodes. The <b>--allow-two-primaries</b> network option changes
  this; in that case, a mechanism outside of DRBD needs to coordinate device
  access.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> resize <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reexamine the size of the lower-level devices
  of a replicated device on all nodes. This command is called after the
  lower-level devices on all nodes have been grown to adjust the size of the
  replicated device. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--assume-peer-has-space</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Resize the device even if some of the peer
  devices are not connected at the moment. DRBD will try to resize the peer
  devices when they next connect. It will refuse to connect to a peer device
  which is too small.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--assume-clean</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not resynchronize the added disk space;
  instead, assume that it is identical on all nodes. This option can be used
  when the disk space is uninitialized and differences do not matter, or when it
  is known to be identical on all nodes. See the <b>drbdsetup verify</b>
  command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--size </b><b></b><i>val</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option can be used to online shrink the
  usable size of a drbd device. It's the users responsibility to make sure that
  a file system on the device is not truncated by that operation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--al-stripes </b><b></b><i>val</i> <b>--al-stripes </b><b></b><i>val</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">These options may be used to change the layout
  of the activity log online. In case of internal meta data this may invovle
  shrinking the user visible size at the same time (unsing the <b>--size</b>) or
  increasing the avalable space on the backing devices.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> resume-io <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Resume I/O on a replicated device. See the
  <b>--fencing</b> net option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> resume-sync <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i> <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Allow resynchronization to resume by clearing
  the local sync pause flag.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> role <i>resource</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the current role of a resource.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> secondary <i>resource</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Change the role of a node in a resource to
  secondary. This command fails if the replicated device is in use.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> show {<i>resource</i> | <i>all</i>}
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the current configuration of a resource,
  or of all resources. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--show-defaults</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show all configuration parameters, even the
  ones with default values. Normally, parameters with default values are not
  shown.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> show-gi <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i> <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the data generation identifiers for a
  device on a particular connection. In addition, explain the output. The output
  otherwise is the same as in the <b>drbdsetup get-gi</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> state
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is an alias for <b>drbdsetup role</b>.
  Deprecated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> status {<i>resource</i> | <i>all</i>}
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the status of a resource, or of all
  resources. The output consists of one paragraph for each configured resource.
  Each paragraph contains one line for each resource, followed by one line for
  each device, and one line for each connection. The device and connection lines
  are indented. The connection lines are followed by one line for each peer
  device; these lines are indented against the connection line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Long lines are wrapped around at terminal width, and indented to indicate how
  the lines belongs together. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--verbose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Include more information in the output even
  when it is likely redundant or irrelevant.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--statistics</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Include data transfer statistics in the
  output.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--color=</b><b>{always | auto | never}</b><b> </b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Colorize the output. With <b>--color=auto</b>,
  <b>drbdsetup</b> emits color codes only when standard output is connected to a
  terminal.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, the non-verbose output for a resource with only one connection and
  only one volume could look like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
drbd0 role:Primary
  disk:UpToDate
  host2.example.com role:Secondary
    disk:UpToDate
	      
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With the <b>--verbose</b> option, the same resource could be reported as:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
drbd0 node-id:1 role:Primary suspended:no
  volume:0 minor:1 disk:UpToDate blocked:no
  host2.example.com local:ipv4:192.168.123.4:7788
      peer:ipv4:192.168.123.2:7788 node-id:0 connection:WFReportParams
      role:Secondary congested:no
    volume:0 replication:Connected disk:UpToDate resync-suspended:no
	      
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> suspend-io <i>minor</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Suspend I/O on a replicated device. It is not
  usually necessary to use this command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> verify <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i> <i>volume</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Start online verification, change which part
  of the device will be verified, or stop online verification. The command
  requires the specified peer to be connected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Online verification compares each disk block on the local and peer node. Blocks
  which differ between the nodes are marked as out-of-sync, but they are
  <i>not</i> automatically brought back into sync. To bring them into sync, the
  resource must be disconnected and reconnected. Progress can be monitored in
  the output of <b>drbdsetup status --statistics</b>. Available options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--start </b><b></b><i>position</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define where online verification should start.
  This parameter is ignored if online verification is already in progress. If
  the start parameter is not specified, online verification will continue where
  it was interrupted (if the connection to the peer was lost while verifying),
  after the previous stop sector (if the previous online verification has
  finished), or at the beginning of the device (if the end of the device was
  reached, or online verify has not run before).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The position on disk is specified in disk sectors (512 bytes) by default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--stop </b><b></b><i>position</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define where online verification should stop.
  If online verification is already in progress, the stop position of the active
  online verification process is changed. Use this to stop online verification.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The position on disk is specified in disk sectors (512 bytes) by default.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also see the notes on data integrity in the <b>drbd.conf</b>(5) manual
  page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> wait-connect-volume <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
  <i>volume</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> wait-connect-connection <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> wait-connect-resource <i>resource</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> wait-sync-volume <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
  <i>volume</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> wait-sync-connection <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> wait-sync-resource <i>resource</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>wait-connect-*</b> commands waits until
  a device on a peer is visible. The <b>wait-sync-*</b> commands waits until a
  device on a peer is up to date. Available options for both commands:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--degr-wfc-timeout </b><b></b><i>timeout</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define how long to wait until all peers are
  connected in case the cluster consisted of a single node only when the system
  went down. This parameter is usually set to a value smaller than
  <b>wfc-timeout</b>. The assumption here is that peers which were unreachable
  before a reboot are less likely to be be reachable after the reboot, so
  waiting is less likely to help.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The timeout is specified in seconds. The default value is 0, which stands for an
  infinite timeout. Also see the <b>wfc-timeout</b> parameter.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--outdated-wfc-timeout </b><b></b><i>timeout</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define how long to wait until all peers are
  connected if all peers were outdated when the system went down. This parameter
  is usually set to a value smaller than <b>wfc-timeout</b>. The assumption here
  is that an outdated peer cannot have become primary in the meantime, so we
  don't need to wait for it as long as for a node which was alive before.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The timeout is specified in seconds. The default value is 0, which stands for an
  infinite timeout. Also see the <b>wfc-timeout</b> parameter.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--wait-after-sb</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This parameter causes DRBD to continue waiting
  in the init script even when a split-brain situation has been detected, and
  the nodes therefore refuse to connect to each other.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--wfc-timeout </b><b></b><i>timeout</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Define how long the init script waits until
  all peers are connected. This can be useful in combination with a cluster
  manager which cannot manage DRBD resources: when the cluster manager starts,
  the DRBD resources will already be up and running. With a more capable cluster
  manager such as Pacemaker, it makes more sense to let the cluster manager
  control DRBD resources. The timeout is specified in seconds. The default value
  is 0, which stands for an infinite timeout. Also see the
  <b>degr-wfc-timeout</b> parameter.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>drbdsetup</b> forget-peer <i>resource</i> <i>peer_node_id</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <b>forget-peer</b> command removes all
  traces of a peer node from the meta-data. It frees a bitmap slot in the
  meta-data and make it avalable for futher bitmap slot allocation in case a
  so-far never seen node connects.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The connection must be taken down before this command may be used. In case the
  peer re-connects at a later point a bit-map based resync will be turned into a
  full-sync.</div>
