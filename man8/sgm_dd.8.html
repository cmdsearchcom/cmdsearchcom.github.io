<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sgm_dd - copy data to and from files and devices, especially
SCSI devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sgm_dd [bs=BS] [count=COUNT] [ibs=BS] [if=IFILE]
[iflag=FLAGS] [obs=BS] [of=OFILE] [oflag=FLAGS] [seek=SEEK]
[skip=SKIP] [--help] [--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[bpt=BPT] [cdbsz=6|10|12|16]
[dio=0|1] [sync=0|1] [time=0|1] [verbose=VERB]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Copy data to and from any files. Specialized for
&quot;files&quot; that are Linux SCSI generic (sg) devices
and raw devices. Uses memory mapped transfers on sg devices.
Similar syntax and <br>
semantics to dd(1) but does not perform any conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will only perform memory mapped
transfers when IFILE or OFILE are SCSI generic (sg)
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both IFILE and OFILE are sg
devices then memory mapped transfers are performed on IFILE.
If no other flags are specified then indirect IO is
performed on OFILE. If &rsquo;oflag=dio&rsquo; <br>
is given then direct IO is attempted on OFILE. If
&rsquo;oflag=smmap&rsquo; is given then shared mmap-ed IO
(sharing the mmap-ed reserve buffer associated with IFILE)
is attempted. In both <br>
latter cases if the faster IO option is not available, they
fall back to indirect IO and report this at the end of the
copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first group in the synopsis
above are &quot;standard&quot; Unix dd(1) operands. The
second group are extra options added by this utility. Both
groups are defined below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
bpt=BPT <br>
each IO transaction will be made using BPT blocks (or less
if near the end of the copy). Default is 128 for block sizes
less that 2048 bytes, otherwise the default is 32. <br>
So for bs=512 the reads and writes will each convey 64 KiB
of data by default (less if near the end of the transfer or
memory restrictions). When cd/dvd drives are <br>
accessed, the block size is typically 2048 bytes and bpt
defaults to 32 which again implies 64 KiB transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs=BS where BS must be the block
size of the physical device. Note that this differs from
dd(1) which permits BS to be an integral multiple. Default
is 512 which is usually cor&acirc; <br>
rect for disks but incorrect for cdroms (which normally have
2048 byte blocks). For this utility the maximum size of each
individual IO operation is BS * BPT bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdbsz=6 | 10 | 12 | 16 <br>
size of SCSI READ and/or WRITE commands issued on sg device
names. Default is 10 byte SCSI command blocks (unless
calculations indicate that a 4 byte block number may be <br>
exceeded, in which case it defaults to 16 byte SCSI
commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count=COUNT <br>
copy COUNT blocks from IFILE to OFILE. Default is the
minimum (of IFILE and OFILE) number of blocks that sg
devices report from SCSI READ CAPACITY commands or that
block <br>
devices (or their partitions) report. Normal files are not
probed for their size. If skip=SKIP or skip=SEEK are given
and the count is derived (i.e. not explicitly given) <br>
then the derived count is scaled back so that the copy will
not overrun the device. If the file name is a block device
partition and COUNT is not given then the size of <br>
the partition rather than the size of the whole device is
used. If COUNT is not given and cannot be derived then an
error message is issued and no copy takes place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dio=0 | 1 <br>
permits direct IO to be selected on the write-side (i.e. on
OFILE). Only allowed when the read-side (i.e. IFILE) is a sg
device. When 1 there may be a &quot;zero copy&quot; copy
<br>
(i.e. mmap-ed transfer on the read into the user space and
direct IO from there on the write, potentially two DMAs and
no data copying from the CPU). Default is 0. The <br>
same action as &rsquo;dio=1&rsquo; is also available with
&rsquo;oflag=dio&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ibs=BS if given must be the same
as BS given to &rsquo;bs=&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if=IFILE <br>
read from IFILE instead of stdin. If IFILE is
&rsquo;-&rsquo; then stdin is read. Starts reading at the
beginning of IFILE unless SKIP is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iflag=FLAGS <br>
where FLAGS is a comma separated list of one or more flags
outlined below. These flags are associated with IFILE and
are ignored when IFILE is stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obs=BS if given must be the same
as BS given to &rsquo;bs=&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">of=OFILE <br>
write to OFILE instead of stdout. If OFILE is
&rsquo;-&rsquo; then writes to stdout. If OFILE is /dev/null
then no actual writes are performed. If OFILE is
&rsquo;.&rsquo; (period) then it is <br>
treated the same way as /dev/null (this is a shorthand
notation). If OFILE exists then it is _not_ truncated; it is
overwritten from the start of OFILE unless <br>
&rsquo;oflag=append&rsquo; or SEEK is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oflag=FLAGS <br>
where FLAGS is a comma separated list of one or more flags
outlined below. These flags are associated with OFILE and
are ignored when OFILE is /dev/null, &rsquo;.&rsquo;
(period), or <br>
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seek=SEEK <br>
start writing SEEK bs-sized blocks from the start of OFILE.
Default is block 0 (i.e. start of file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip=SKIP <br>
start reading SKIP bs-sized blocks from the start of IFILE.
Default is block 0 (i.e. start of file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync=0 | 1 <br>
when 1, does SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command on OFILE at the end
of the transfer. Only active when OFILE is a sg device file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time=0 | 1 <br>
when 1, times transfer and does throughput calculation,
outputting the results (to stderr) at completion. When 0
(default) doesn&rsquo;t perform timing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose=VERB <br>
as VERB increases so does the amount of debug output sent to
stderr. Default value is zero which yields the minimum
amount of debug output. A value of 1 reports extra <br>
information that is not repetitive. A value 2 reports cdbs
and responses for SCSI commands that are not repetitive
(i.e. other that READ and WRITE). Error processing is <br>
not considered repetitive. Values of 3 and 4 yield output
for all SCSI commands (and Unix read() and write() calls) so
there can be a lot of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help outputs usage message and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
outputs version number information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLAGS <br>
Here is a list of flags and their meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append causes the O_APPEND flag
to be added to the open of OFILE. For normal files this will
lead to data appended to the end of any existing data.
Cannot be used together with <br>
the seek=SEEK option as they conflict. The default action of
this utility is to overwrite any existing data from the
beginning of the file or, if SEEK is given, starting <br>
at block SEEK. Note that attempting to &rsquo;append&rsquo;
to a device file (e.g. a disk) will usually be ignored or
may cause an error to be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dio is only active with oflag
(i.e. &rsquo;oflag=dio&rsquo;). Its action is described in
the &rsquo;dio=1&rsquo; option description above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direct causes the O_DIRECT flag
to be added to the open of IFILE and/or OFILE. This flag
requires some memory alignment on IO. Hence user memory
buffers are aligned to the page <br>
size. Has no effect on sg, normal or raw files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpo set the DPO bit (disable
page out) in SCSI READ and WRITE commands. Not supported for
6 byte cdb variants of READ and WRITE. Indicates that data
is unlikely to be required <br>
to stay in device (e.g. disk) cache. May speed media copy
and/or cause a media copy to have less impact on other
device users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync causes the O_SYNC flag to
be added to the open of IFILE and/or OFILE. The
&quot;d&quot; is prepended to lower confusion with the
&rsquo;sync=0|1&rsquo; option which has another action (i.e.
a <br>
synchronisation to media at the end of the transfer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">excl causes the O_EXCL flag to
be added to the open of IFILE and/or OFILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fua causes the FUA (force unit
access) bit to be set in SCSI READ and/or WRITE commands.
This only has effect with sg devices. The 6 byte variants of
the SCSI READ and WRITE <br>
commands do not support the FUA bit. Only active for sg
device file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null has no affect, just a
placeholder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smmap is only active for oflag.
It sets shared mmap IO usage on OFILE if it is a sg device
node. The IFILE also needs to be a sg device node (or there
is no mmap-ed reserve buf&acirc; <br>
fer to share).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETIRED OPTIONS <br>
Here are some retired options that are still present:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fua=0 | 1 | 2 | 3 <br>
force unit access bit. When 3, fua is set on both IFILE and
OFILE; when 2, fua is set on IFILE; when 1, fua is set on
OFILE; when 0 (default), fua is cleared on both. See <br>
the &rsquo;fua&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
A raw device must be bound to a block device prior to using
sgm_dd. See raw(8) for more information about binding raw
devices. To be safe, the sg device mapping to SCSI block
<br>
devices should be checked with &rsquo;cat
/proc/scsi/scsi&rsquo; before use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raw device partition information
can often be found with fdisk(8) [the &quot;-ul&quot;
argument is useful in this respect].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various numeric arguments (e.g.
SKIP) may include multiplicative suffixes or be given in
hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section
in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The count, skip and seek
parameters can take 64 bit values (i.e. very big numbers).
Other values are limited to what can fit in a signed 32 bit
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data usually gets to the user
space in a 2 stage process: first the SCSI adapter DMAs into
kernel buffers and then the sg driver copies this data into
user memory (write opera&acirc; <br>
tions reverse this sequence). With memory mapped transfers a
kernel buffer reserved by sg is memory mapped (see the
mmap(2) system call) into the user space. When this is done
<br>
the second (redundant) copy from kernel buffers to user
space is not needed. Hence the transfer is faster and
requires less &quot;grunt&quot; from the CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All informative, warning and
error output is sent to stderr so that dd&rsquo;s output
file can be stdout and remain unpolluted. If no options are
given, then the usage message is out&acirc; <br>
put and nothing else happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For sg devices this utility
issues SCSI READ and WRITE (SBC) commands which are
appropriate for disks and reading from CD/DVD/BD drives.
Those commands are not formatted cor&acirc; <br>
rectly for tape devices so sgm_dd should not be used on tape
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility stops the copy if
any error is encountered. For more advanced &quot;copy on
error&quot; logic see the sg_dd utility (and its
&rsquo;coe&rsquo; flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
See the examples given in the man page for sg_dd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT,
SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE output the number of remaining blocks to
be transferred and the records in + out counts; then they
have <br>
their default action. SIGUSR1 causes the same information to
be output yet the copy continues. All output caused by
signals is sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sgm_dd is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page. Since this utility
works at a higher level than individual commands, and there
are <br>
&rsquo;coe&rsquo; and &rsquo;retries&rsquo; flags,
individual SCSI command failures do not necessary cause the
process to exit.</p>
