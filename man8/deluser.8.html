<p>DELUSER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual DELUSER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
deluser, delgroup - remove a user or group from the
system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
deluser [options] [--force] [--remove-home]
[--remove-all-files] [--backup] [--backup-to DIR] user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deluser --group [options] group
<br>
delgroup [options] [--only-if-empty] group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deluser [options] user group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
[--quiet] [--system] [--help] [--version] [--conf FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
deluser and delgroup remove users and groups from the system
according to command line options and configuration
information in /etc/deluser.conf and /etc/adduser.conf. They
are <br>
friendlier front ends to the userdel and groupdel programs,
removing the home directory as option or even all files on
the system owned by the user to be removed, running a
cus&acirc; <br>
tom script, and other features. deluser and delgroup can be
run in one of three modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove a normal user <br>
If called with one non-option argument and without the
--group option, deluser will remove a normal user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, deluser will remove
the user without removing the home directory, the mail spool
or any other files on the system owned by the user. Removing
the home directory and <br>
mail spool can be achieved using the --remove-home
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --remove-all-files option
removes all files on the system owned by the user. Note that
if you activate both options --remove-home will have no
effect because all files <br>
including the home directory and mail spool are already
covered by the --remove-all-files option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to backup all files
before deleting them you can activate the --backup option
which will create a file username.tar(.gz|.bz2) in the
directory specified by the <br>
--backup-to option (defaulting to the current working
directory). Both the remove and backup options can also be
activated for default in the configuration file <br>
/etc/deluser.conf. See deluser.conf(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to remove the root
account (uid 0), then use the --force parameter; this may
prevent to remove the root user by accident.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file
/usr/local/sbin/deluser.local exists, it will be executed
after the user account has been removed in order to do any
local cleanup. The arguments passed to <br>
deluser.local are: <br>
username uid gid home-directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove a group <br>
If deluser is called with the --group option, or delgroup is
called, a group will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The primary group of an
existing user cannot be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option --only-if-empty is
given, the group won&rsquo;t be removed if it has any
members left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove a user from a specific
group <br>
If called with two non-option arguments, deluser will remove
a user from a specific group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--conf FILE <br>
Use FILE instead of the default files /etc/deluser.conf and
/etc/adduser.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--group <br>
Remove a group. This is the default action if the program is
invoked as delgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display brief
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Suppress progress messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system <br>
Only delete if user/group is a system user/group. This
avoids accidentally deleting non-system users/groups.
Additionally, if the user does not exist, no error value is
<br>
returned. This option is mainly for use in Debian package
maintainer scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup <br>
Backup all files contained in the userhome and the
mailspool-file to a file named /$user.tar.bz2 or
/$user.tar.gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup-to <br>
Place the backup files not in / but in the directory
specified by this parameter. This implicitly sets --backup
also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-home <br>
Remove the home directory of the user and its mailspool. If
--backup is specified, the files are deleted after having
performed the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-all-files <br>
Remove all files from the system owned by this user. Note:
--remove-home does not have an effect any more. If --backup
is specified, the files are deleted after having <br>
performed the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version and copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
0 The action was successfully executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 The user to delete was not a
system account. No action was performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 There is no such user. No
action was performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 There is no such group. No
action was performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Internal error. No action was
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 The group to delete is not
empty. No action was performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 The user does not belong to
the specified group. No action was performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 You cannot remove a user from
its primary group. No action was performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 The required perl-package
&rsquo;perl modules&rsquo; is not installed. This package is
required to perform the requested actions. No action was
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 For removing the root account
the parameter &quot;--force&quot; is required. No action was
performed.</p>
