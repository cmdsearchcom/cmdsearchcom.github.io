<p>BADBLOCKS(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
BADBLOCKS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
badblocks - search a device for bad blocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
badblocks [ -svwnfBX ] [ -b block-size ] [ -c blocks_at_once
] [ -e max_bad_blocks ] [ -d read_delay_factor ] [ -i
input_file ] [ -o output_file ] [ -p num_passes ] [ -t <br>
test_pattern ] device [ last-block ] [ first-block ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
badblocks is used to search for bad blocks on a device
(usually a disk partition). device is the special file
corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdc1). last-block is
the <br>
last block to be checked; if it is not specified, the last
block on the device is used as a default. first-block is an
optional parameter specifying the starting block number <br>
for the test, which allows the testing to start in the
middle of the disk. If it is not specified the first block
on the disk is used as a default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important note: If the output of
badblocks is going to be fed to the e2fsck or mke2fs
programs, it is important that the block size is properly
specified, since the block numbers <br>
which are generated are very dependent on the block size in
use by the filesystem. For this reason, it is strongly
recommended that users not run badblocks directly, but
rather <br>
use the -c option of the e2fsck and mke2fs programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b block-size <br>
Specify the size of blocks in bytes. The default is
1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c number of blocks <br>
is the number of blocks which are tested at a time. The
default is 64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e max bad block count <br>
Specify a maximum number of bad blocks before aborting the
test. The default is 0, meaning the test will continue until
the end of the test range is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d read delay factor <br>
This parameter, if passed and non-zero, will cause bad
blocks to sleep between reads if there were no errors
encountered in the read operation; the delay will be
calcu&acirc; <br>
lated as a percentage of the time it took for the read
operation to be performed. In other words, a value of 100
will cause each read to be delayed by the amount the
pre&acirc; <br>
vious read took, and a value of 200 by twice the amount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Normally, badblocks will
refuse to do a read/write or a non-destructive test on a
device which is mounted, since either can cause the system
to potentially crash and/or <br>
damage the filesystem even if it is mounted read-only. This
can be overridden using the -f flag, but should almost never
be used --- if you think you&rsquo;re smarter than the <br>
badblocks program, you almost certainly aren&rsquo;t. The
only time when this option might be safe to use is if the
/etc/mtab file is incorrect, and the device really
isn&rsquo;t <br>
mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i input_file <br>
Read a list of already existing known bad blocks. Badblocks
will skip testing these blocks since they are known to be
bad. If input_file is specified as &quot;-&quot;, the list
<br>
will be read from the standard input. Blocks listed in this
list will be omitted from the list of new bad blocks
produced on the standard output or in the output file. <br>
The -b option of dumpe2fs(8) can be used to retrieve the
list of blocks currently marked bad on an existing
filesystem, in a format suitable for use with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Use non-destructive
read-write mode. By default only a non-destructive read-only
test is done. This option must not be combined with the -w
option, as they are mutually <br>
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output_file <br>
Write the list of bad blocks to the specified file. Without
this option, badblocks displays the list on its standard
output. The format of this file is suitable for use <br>
by the -l option in e2fsck(8) or mke2fs(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p num_passes <br>
Repeat scanning the disk until there are no new blocks
discovered in num_passes consecutive scans of the disk.
Default is 0, meaning badblocks will exit after the first
<br>
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Show the progress of the scan
by writing out rough percentage completion of the current
badblocks pass over the disk. Note that badblocks may do
multiple test passes over <br>
the disk, in particular if the -p or -w option is requested
by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t test_pattern <br>
Specify a test pattern to be read (and written) to disk
blocks. The test_pattern may either be a numeric value
between 0 and ULONG_MAX-1 inclusive, or the word
&quot;random&quot;, <br>
which specifies that the block should be filled with a
random bit pattern. For read/write (-w) and non-destructive
(-n) modes, one or more test patterns may be specified <br>
by specifying the -t option for each test pattern desired.
For read-only mode only a single pattern may be specified
and it may not be &quot;random&quot;. Read-only testing with
a <br>
pattern assumes that the specified pattern has previously
been written to the disk - if not, large numbers of blocks
will fail verification. If multiple patterns are <br>
specified then all blocks will be tested with one pattern
before proceeding to the next pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Will write the
number of read errors, write errors and data- corruptions to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Use write-mode test. With
this option, badblocks scans for bad blocks by writing some
patterns (0xaa, 0x55, 0xff, 0x00) on every block of the
device, reading every block <br>
and comparing the contents. This option may not be combined
with the -n option, as they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Use buffered I/O and do not
use Direct I/O, even if it is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Internal flag only to be used
by e2fsck(8) and mke2fs(8). It bypasses the exclusive mode
in-use device safety check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Never use the -w option on a device containing an existing
file system. This option erases data! If you want to do
write-mode testing on an existing file system, use the -n
<br>
option instead. It is slower, but it will preserve your
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option will cause
badblocks to output a possibly incomplete list of bad
blocks. Therefore it is recommended to use it only when one
wants to know if there are any bad <br>
blocks at all on the device, and not when the list of bad
blocks is wanted.</p>
