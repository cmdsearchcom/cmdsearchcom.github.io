<p>TINYLEAF(8) InterNetNews Documentation TINYLEAF(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tinyleaf - Very simple IHAVE-only NNTP server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tinyleaf spool [processor]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tinyleaf is intended to be the simplest possible transit
news server that still does something useful. It must be run
under inetd(8) or some equivalent, and only implements <br>
three commands (HELP, IHAVE, and QUIT). When it receives an
article, it saves it into the directory spool and, if
processor is given, passes information about the article to
<br>
processor via a pipe. The file name of the article will be
the MD5 hash of its message-ID, and if a file by that name
already exists, tinyleaf will refuse the article, reporting
<br>
it as a duplicate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If processor is given, it should
specify the path to a program. That program is started when
tinyleaf starts, and its current working directory will be
spool. For each article <br>
received by tinyleaf, a single line will be sent to standard
input of processor. That line will consist of the file name
of the received article (relative to spool), a single <br>
space, and the message-ID of the received article. Note that
the message-ID will be taken from the argument to the IHAVE
command and may not match the Message-ID: header in the <br>
article. When tinyleaf shuts down, standard input to
processor will be closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tinyleaf does no syntax
verification of received articles whatsoever; it just stores
them and optionally passes them off to processor. It also
never deletes articles; normally, <br>
processor should do that when it&rsquo;s finished doing
whatever it needs to with the article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tinyleaf expects NNTP commands
on standard input and replies on standard output. Status
information and any error messages are sent to standard
error. It does no <br>
authentication; any authentication must be done by inetd(8)
or by a wrapper program. (One simple authentication
mechanism is to invoke tinyleaf via tcpd(8) from TCP
wrappers and <br>
use /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny to restrict who can
talk to the server.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tinyleaf has a (currently
hard-coded) maximum message size of 1 MB and a (similarly
hard-coded) timeout of ten minutes for each command or chunk
of article data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Suppose that you want to archive news articles on a
particular host (like the FTP server for a newsgroup
archive) where you don&rsquo;t want the overhead of running
a full-blown news <br>
server. Write a program that reads one line at a time from
standard input and treats everything before the first space
as the filename of a news article to archive. Each time <br>
the program reads a line, it should archive that file and
then delete it, and it should exit when it gets end of file
on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, add a line like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nntp stream tcp nowait archive
/usr/sbin/tcpd &lt;pathbin&gt;/tinyleaf
&lt;pathspool&gt;/tinyleaf &lt;pathbin&gt;/archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(all on one line -- the
backslash and split in this line is just for readability)
where &quot;archive&quot; is the user that owns the archive,
/usr/sbin/tcpd is the path to tcpd(8), <br>
pathbin/tinyleaf is the path to this program,
pathspool/tinyleaf is some scratch directory that the user
&quot;archive&quot; has write access to, and pathbin/archive
is the path to your <br>
archive script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can now restrict access to
tinyleaf to just your local news server with
&quot;/etc/hosts.allow&quot; and &quot;/etc/hosts.deny&quot;
and set up an ordinary feed from the server to the archive
<br>
host, just like you would to any other news server, of only
the newsgroup that you want to archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the archiving script
should probably perform basic syntax and validity checks on
the input, since tinyleaf doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the application that
motivated the original development of this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The timeout and maximum message size should really be
configurable. tinyleaf should also probably not just respond
500 to every command other than HELP, IHAVE, and QUIT; there
<br>
are more useful (and more expected) error codes that could
be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An option to scan the spool
directory for any left-over files and pass them to the
processor when starting up would be useful.</p>
