tinyleaf - Very simple IHAVE-only NNTP server
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>tinyleaf</b> <i>spool</i> [<i>processor</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>tinyleaf</b> is intended to be the simplest possible transit news server that
  still does something useful. It must be run under <i>inetd</i>(8) or some
  equivalent, and only implements three commands (HELP, IHAVE, and QUIT). When
  it receives an article, it saves it into the directory <i>spool</i> and, if
  <i>processor</i> is given, passes information about the article to
  <i>processor</i> via a pipe. The file name of the article will be the MD5 hash
  of its message-ID, and if a file by that name already exists, <b>tinyleaf</b>
  will refuse the article, reporting it as a duplicate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>processor</i> is given, it should specify the path to a program. That
  program is started when <b>tinyleaf</b> starts, and its current working
  directory will be <i>spool</i>. For each article received by <b>tinyleaf</b>,
  a single line will be sent to standard input of <i>processor</i>. That line
  will consist of the file name of the received article (relative to
  <i>spool</i>), a single space, and the message-ID of the received article.
  Note that the message-ID will be taken from the argument to the IHAVE command
  and may not match the Message-ID: header in the article. When <b>tinyleaf</b>
  shuts down, standard input to <i>processor</i> will be closed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>tinyleaf</b> does no syntax verification of received articles whatsoever; it
  just stores them and optionally passes them off to <i>processor</i>. It also
  never deletes articles; normally, <i>processor</i> should do that when it's
  finished doing whatever it needs to with the article.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>tinyleaf</b> expects NNTP commands on standard input and replies on standard
  output. Status information and any error messages are sent to standard error.
  It does no authentication; any authentication must be done by <i>inetd</i>(8)
  or by a wrapper program. (One simple authentication mechanism is to invoke
  <b>tinyleaf</b> via <i>tcpd</i>(8) from TCP wrappers and use
  <i>/etc/hosts.allow</i> and <i>/etc/hosts.deny</i> to restrict who can talk to
  the server.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>tinyleaf</b> has a (currently hard-coded) maximum message size of 1&#x00A0;MB
  and a (similarly hard-coded) timeout of ten minutes for each command or chunk
  of article data.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
Suppose that you want to archive news articles on a particular host (like the
  FTP server for a newsgroup archive) where you don't want the overhead of
  running a full-blown news server. Write a program that reads one line at a
  time from standard input and treats everything before the first space as the
  filename of a news article to archive. Each time the program reads a line, it
  should archive that file and then delete it, and it should exit when it gets
  end of file on standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then, add a line like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    nntp stream tcp nowait archive /usr/sbin/tcpd \
      &lt;pathbin&gt;/tinyleaf &lt;pathspool&gt;/tinyleaf &lt;pathbin&gt;/archive
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(all on one line --&#x00A0;the backslash and split in this line is just for
  readability) where &quot;archive&quot; is the user that owns the archive,
  <i>/usr/sbin/tcpd</i> is the path to <i>tcpd</i>(8), <i>pathbin</i>/tinyleaf
  is the path to this program, <i>pathspool</i>/tinyleaf is some scratch
  directory that the user &quot;archive&quot; has write access to, and
  <i>pathbin</i>/archive is the path to your <b>archive</b> script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can now restrict access to <b>tinyleaf</b> to just your local news server
  with &quot;/etc/hosts.allow&quot; and &quot;/etc/hosts.deny&quot; and set up
  an ordinary feed from the server to the archive host, just like you would to
  any other news server, of only the newsgroup that you want to archive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the archiving script should probably perform basic syntax and validity
  checks on the input, since <b>tinyleaf</b> doesn't.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the application that motivated the original development of this program.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The timeout and maximum message size should really be configurable.
  <b>tinyleaf</b> should also probably not just respond 500 to every command
  other than HELP, IHAVE, and QUIT; there are more useful (and more expected)
  error codes that could be returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An option to scan the spool directory for any left-over files and pass them to
  the processor when starting up would be useful.
