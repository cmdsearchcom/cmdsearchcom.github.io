OpenVPN is an open source VPN daemon by James Yonan. Because OpenVPN tries to be
  a universal VPN tool offering a great deal of flexibility, there are a lot of
  options on this manual page. If you're new to OpenVPN, you might want to skip
  ahead to the examples section where you will see how to construct simple VPNs
  on the command line without even needing a configuration file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also note that there's more documentation and examples on the OpenVPN web site:
  <i>http://openvpn.net/</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
And if you would like to see a shorter version of this manual, see the openvpn
  usage message which can be obtained by running <b>openvpn</b> without any
  parameters.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. OpenVPN supports SSL/TLS
  security, ethernet bridging, TCP or UDP tunnel transport through proxies or
  NAT, support for dynamic IP addresses and DHCP, scalability to hundreds or
  thousands of users, and portability to most major OS platforms.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
OpenVPN is tightly bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much of its crypto
  capabilities from it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
OpenVPN supports conventional encryption using a pre-shared secret key
  <b>(Static Key mode)</b> or public key security <b>(SSL/TLS mode)</b> using
  client &amp; server certificates. OpenVPN also supports non-encrypted TCP/UDP
  tunnels.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
OpenVPN is designed to work with the <b>TUN/TAP</b> virtual networking interface
  that exists on most platforms.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Overall, OpenVPN aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but with a
  relatively lightweight footprint.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a
  configuration file. Though all command line options are preceded by a
  double-leading-dash (&quot;--&quot;), this prefix can be removed when an
  option is placed in a configuration file.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Show options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--config file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Load additional config options from <b>file</b> where each
      line corresponds to one command line option, but with the leading '--'
      removed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>--config file</b> is the only option to the openvpn command, the
      <b>--config</b> can be removed, and the command can be given as <b>openvpn
      file</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Double quotation or single quotation characters (&quot;&quot;, '') can be
      used to enclose single parameters containing whitespace, and &quot;#&quot;
      or &quot;;&quot; characters in the first column can be used to denote
      comments.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that OpenVPN 2.0 and higher performs backslash-based shell escaping for
      characters not in single quotations, so the following mappings should be
      observed:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
<br/>
\\       Maps to a single backslash character (\).
\&quot;       Pass a literal doublequote character (&quot;), don't
         interpret it as enclosing a parameter.
\[SPACE] Pass a literal space or tab character, don't
         interpret it as a parameter delimiter.
<br/>
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example on Windows, use double backslashes to represent pathnames:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
<br/>
secret &quot;c:\\OpenVPN\\secret.key&quot;
<br/>
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For examples of configuration files, see
      <i>http://openvpn.net/examples.html</i>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here is an example configuration file:

      a different OpenVPN server. Specifying multiple <b>--remote</b> options
      for this purpose is a special case of the more general connection-profile
      feature. See the <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> documentation below.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The OpenVPN client will try to connect to a server at <b>host:port</b> in
      the order specified by the list of <b>--remote</b> options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>proto</b> indicates the protocol to use when connecting with the remote,
      and may be &quot;tcp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For forcing IPv4 or IPv6 connection suffix tcp or udp with 4/6 like
      udp4/udp6/tcp4/tcp6.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The client will move on to the next host in the list, in the event of
      connection failure. Note that at any given time, the OpenVPN client will
      at most be connected to one server.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that since UDP is connectionless, connection failure is defined by the
      <b>--ping</b> and <b>--ping-restart</b> options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note the following corner case: If you use multiple <b>--remote</b> options,
      AND you are dropping root privileges on the client with <b>--user</b>
      and/or <b>--group,</b> AND the client is running a non-Windows OS, if the
      client needs to switch to a different server, and that server pushes back
      different TUN/TAP or route settings, the client may lack the necessary
      privileges to close and reopen the TUN/TAP interface. This could cause the
      client to exit with a fatal error.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>--remote</b> is unspecified, OpenVPN will listen for packets from any
      IP address, but will not act on those packets unless they pass all
      authentication tests. This requirement for authentication is binding on
      all potential peers, even those from known and supposedly trusted IP
      addresses (it is very easy to forge a source IP address on a UDP packet).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When used in TCP mode, <b>--remote</b> will act as a filter, rejecting
      connections from any host which does not match <b>host.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>host</b> is a DNS name which resolves to multiple IP addresses,
      OpenVPN will try them in the order that the system getaddrinfo() presents
      them, so priorization and DNS randomization is done by the system library.
      Unless an IP version is forced by the protocol specification (4/6 suffix),
      OpenVPN will try both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in the order getaddrinfo()
      returns them.</dd>

      <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;/connection&gt;.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An OpenVPN client will try each connection profile sequentially until it

    First we try to connect to a server at 198.19.34.56:1194 using UDP. If that
      fails, we then try to connect to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP. If that also
      fails, then try connecting through an HTTP proxy at 192.168.0.8:8080 to
      198.19.34.56:443 using TCP. Finally, try to connect through the same proxy
      to a server at 198.19.36.99:443 using TCP.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following OpenVPN options may be used inside of a
      <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> block:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>bind,</b> <b>connect-retry,</b> <b>connect-retry-max,</b>
      <b>connect-timeout,</b> <b>explicit-exit-notify,</b> <b>float,</b>
      <b>fragment,</b> <b>http-proxy,</b> <b>http-proxy-option,</b>
      <b>link-mtu,</b> <b>local,</b> <b>lport,</b> <b>mssfix,</b>
      <b>mtu-disc,</b> <b>nobind,</b> <b>port,</b> <b>proto,</b> <b>remote,</b>
      <b>rport,</b> <b>socks-proxy,</b> <b>tun-mtu and</b> <b>tun-mtu-extra.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A defaulting mechanism exists for specifying options to apply to all
      <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> profiles. If any of the above options (with the
      exception of <b>remote</b> ) appear outside of a <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b>
      block, but in a configuration file which has one or more
      <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> blocks, the option setting will be used as a
      default for <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> blocks which follow it in the
      configuration file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, suppose the <b>nobind</b> option were placed in the sample
      configuration file above, near the top of the file, before the first
      <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> block. The effect would be as if <b>nobind</b>
      were declared in all <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> blocks below it.</dd>

    For TCP operation, one peer must use <b>--proto tcp-server</b> and the other

      will wait indefinitely for an incoming connection. A peer started with
      <b>tcp-client</b> will attempt to connect, and if that fails, will sleep
      for 5 seconds (adjustable via the <b>--connect-retry</b> option) and try
      again infinite or up to N retries (adjustable via the
      <b>--connect-retry-max</b> option). Both TCP client and server will
      simulate a SIGUSR1 restart signal if either side resets the connection.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    OpenVPN is designed to operate optimally over UDP, but TCP capability is
      provided for situations where UDP cannot be used. In comparison with UDP,
      TCP will usually be somewhat less efficient and less robust when used over
      unreliable or congested networks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This article outlines some of problems with tunneling IP over TCP:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html</i>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are certain cases, however, where using TCP may be advantageous from a
      security and robustness perspective, such as tunneling non-IP or
      application-level UDP protocols, or tunneling protocols which don't
      possess a built-in reliability layer.</dd>

    If you are running in a dynamic IP address environment where the IP
      addresses of either peer could change without notice, you can use this

      address of the peer. The script will be run every time the remote peer
      changes its IP address.

      mode, which always uses a <b>subnet</b> topology.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you set this directive on the server, the <b>--server</b> and
      <b>--server-bridge</b> directives will automatically push your chosen
      topology setting to clients as well. This directive can also be manually
      pushed to clients. Like the <b>--dev</b> directive, this directive must
      always be compatible between client and server.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>mode</b> can be one of:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>net30 --</b> Use a point-to-point topology, by allocating one /30 subnet
      per client. This is designed to allow point-to-point semantics when some
      or all of the connecting clients might be Windows systems. This is the
      default on OpenVPN 2.0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>p2p --</b> Use a point-to-point topology where the remote endpoint of the
      client's tun interface always points to the local endpoint of the server's
      tun interface. This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting
      client. Only use when none of the connecting clients are Windows systems.
      This mode is functionally equivalent to the <b>--ifconfig-pool-linear</b>
      directive which is available in OpenVPN 2.0 and is now deprecated.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>subnet --</b> Use a subnet rather than a point-to-point topology by
      configuring the tun interface with a local IP address and subnet mask,
      similar to the topology used in <b>--dev tap</b> and ethernet bridging
      mode. This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting client and
      works on Windows as well. Only available when server and clients are
      OpenVPN 2.1 or higher, or OpenVPN 2.0.x which has been manually patched
      with the <b>--topology</b> directive code. When used on Windows, requires
      version 8.2 or higher of the TAP-Win32 driver. When used on *nix, requires
      that the tun driver supports an <b>ifconfig</b>(8) command which sets a
      subnet instead of a remote endpoint IP address.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option exists in OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: Using <b>--topology subnet</b> changes the interpretation of the
      arguments of <b>--ifconfig</b> to mean &quot;address netmask&quot;, no

      whether <b>node</b> is a TUN or TAP device based on the name, you should
      also specify <b>--dev-type tun</b> or <b>--dev-type tap.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Under Mac OS X this option can be used to specify the default tun
      implementation. Using <b>--dev-node utun</b> forces usage of the native
      Darwin tun kernel support. Use <b>--dev-node utunN</b> to select a
      specific utun instance. To force using the tun.kext (/dev/tunX) use
      <b>--dev-node tun.</b> When not specifying a <b>--dev-node</b> option
      openvpn will first try to open utun, and fall back to tun.kext.

      or TUN devices used with <b>--topology subnet,</b> <b>rn</b> is the subnet
      mask of the virtual network segment which is being created or connected
      to.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For TUN devices, which facilitate virtual point-to-point IP connections
      (when used in <b>--topology net30</b> or <b>p2p</b> mode), the proper
      usage of <b>--ifconfig</b> is to use two private IP addresses which are
      not a member of any existing subnet which is in use. The IP addresses may
      be consecutive and should have their order reversed on the remote peer.
      After the VPN is established, by pinging <b>rn,</b> you will be pinging

    For TAP devices, which provide the ability to create virtual ethernet
      segments, or TUN devices in <b>--topology subnet</b> mode (which create
      virtual &quot;multipoint networks&quot;), <b>--ifconfig</b> is used to set
      an IP address and subnet mask just as a physical ethernet adapter would be
      similarly configured. If you are attempting to connect to a remote
      ethernet bridge, the IP address and subnet should be set to values which
      would be valid on the the bridged ethernet segment (note also that DHCP
      can be used for the same purpose).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option, while primarily a proxy for the <b>ifconfig</b>(8) command, is
      designed to simplify TUN/TAP tunnel configuration by providing a standard
      interface to the different ifconfig implementations on different
      platforms.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It should also be noted that this option is not meant to replace UDP
      fragmentation at the IP stack level. It is only meant as a last resort
      when path MTU discovery is broken. Using this option is less efficient
      than fixing path MTU discovery for your IP link and using native IP

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      overhead has been added in, but not including the UDP header itself.
      Resulting packet would be at most 28 bytes larger for IPv4 and 48 bytes
      for IPv6 (20/40 bytes for IP header and 8 bytes for UDP header). Default
      value of 1450 allows IPv4 packets to be transmitted over a link with MTU
      1473 or higher without IP level fragmentation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>--mssfix</b> option only makes sense when you are using the UDP

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>--mssfix</b> and <b>--fragment</b> can be ideally used together, where
      <b>--mssfix</b> will try to keep TCP from needing packet fragmentation in
      the first place, and if big packets come through anyhow (from protocols
      other than TCP), <b>--fragment</b> will internally fragment them.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Both <b>--fragment</b> and <b>--mssfix</b> are designed to work around cases
      where Path MTU discovery is broken on the network path between OpenVPN
      peers.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The usual symptom of such a breakdown is an OpenVPN connection which

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    OpenVPN uses the following algorithm to implement traffic shaping: Given a
      shaper rate of <i>n</i> bytes per second, after a datagram write of
      <i>b</i> bytes is queued on the TCP/UDP port, wait a minimum of <i>(b /
      n)</i> seconds before queuing the next write.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It should be noted that OpenVPN supports multiple tunnels between the same
      two peers, allowing you to construct full-speed and reduced bandwidth
      tunnels at the same time, routing low-priority data such as off-site
      backups over the reduced bandwidth tunnel, and other data over the
      full-speed tunnel.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also note that for low bandwidth tunnels (under 1000 bytes per second), you
      should probably use lower MTU values as well (see above), otherwise the
      packet latency will grow so large as to trigger timeouts in the TLS layer
      and TCP connections running over the tunnel.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    In any case, OpenVPN's internal ping packets (which are just keepalives) and

    This option is useful in cases where the remote peer has a dynamic IP
      address and a low-TTL DNS name is used to track the IP address using a
      service such as <i>http://dyndns.org/</i> + a dynamic DNS client such as
      <b>ddclient.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the peer cannot be reached, a restart will be triggered, causing the

    In server mode, <b>--ping-restart, --inactive,</b> or any other type of

      that any internally generated signal which would normally cause a restart,
      will cause the deletion of the client instance object instead.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In client mode, the <b>--ping-restart</b> parameter is set to 120 seconds by
      default. This default will hold until the client pulls a replacement value
      from the server, based on the <b>--keepalive</b> setting in the server
      configuration. To disable the 120 second default, set <b>--ping-restart

    This option can be used on both client and server side, but it is in enough

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that if <b>cmd</b> includes arguments, all OpenVPN-generated arguments

    Typically, <b>cmd</b> will run a script to add routes to the tunnel.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Normally the up script is called after the TUN/TAP device is opened. In this
      context, the last command line parameter passed to the script will be
      <i>init.</i> If the <b>--up-restart</b> option is also used, the up script
      will be called for restarts as well. A restart is considered to be a
      partial reinitialization of OpenVPN where the TUN/TAP instance is
      preserved (the <b>--persist-tun</b> option will enable such preservation).
      A restart can be generated by a SIGUSR1 signal, a <b>--ping-restart</b>
      timeout, or a connection reset when the TCP protocol is enabled with the
      <b>--proto</b> option. If a restart occurs, and <b>--up-restart</b> has
      been specified, the up script will be called with <i>restart</i> as the
      last parameter.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    NOTE: on restart, OpenVPN will not pass the full set of environment
      variables to the script. Namely, everything related to routing and
      gateways will not be passed, as nothing needs to be done anyway - all the
      routing setup is already in place. Additionally, the up-restart script
      will run with the downgraded UID/GID settings (if configured).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following standalone example shows how the <b>--up</b> script can be
      called in both an initialization and restart context. (NOTE: for security
      reasons, don't run the following example unless UDP port 9999 is blocked

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that OpenVPN also provides the <b>--ifconfig</b> option to
      automatically ifconfig the TUN device, eliminating the need to define an

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    OpenVPN releases before v2.3 also supported a <b>method</b> flag which
      indicated how OpenVPN should call external commands and scripts. This
      could be either <b>execve</b> or <b>system.</b> As of OpenVPN v2.3, this
      flag is no longer accepted. In most *nix environments the execve()
      approach has been used without any issues.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Some directives such as --up allow options to be passed to the external
      script. In these cases make sure the script name does not contain any
      spaces or the configuration parser will choke because it can't determine
      where the script name ends and script options start.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To run scripts in Windows in earlier OpenVPN versions you needed to either
      add a full path to the script interpreter which can parse the script or
      use the <b>system</b> flag to run these scripts. As of OpenVPN v2.3 it is
      now a strict requirement to have full path to the script interpreter when
      running non-executables files. This is not needed for executable files,
      such as .exe, .com, .bat or .cmd files. For example, if you have a Visual
      Basic script, you must use this syntax now:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
<br/>
--up 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe C:\\Program\ Files\\OpenVPN\\config\\my-up-script.vbs'

    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Please note the single quote marks and the escaping of the backslashes (\)
      and the space character.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The reason the support for the <b>system</b> flag was removed is due to the
      security implications with shell expansions when executing scripts via the

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By setting <b>user</b> to <i>nobody</i> or somebody similarly unprivileged,
      the hostile party would be limited in what damage they could cause. Of
      course once you take away privileges, you cannot return them to an OpenVPN
      session. This means, for example, that if you want to reset an OpenVPN
      daemon with a <b>SIGUSR1</b> signal (for example in response to a DHCP
      reset), you should make use of one or more of the <b>--persist</b> options
      to ensure that OpenVPN doesn't need to execute any privileged operations

  <dd class="It-tag">Chroot to <b>dir</b> after initialization. <b>--chroot</b>
      essentially redefines <b>dir</b> as being the top level directory tree
      (/). OpenVPN will therefore be unable to access any files outside this
      tree. This can be desirable from a security standpoint.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since the chroot operation is delayed until after initialization, most
      OpenVPN options that reference files will operate in a pre-chroot context.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In many cases, the <b>dir</b> parameter can point to an empty directory,
      however complications can result when scripts or restarts are executed
      after the chroot operation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: The SSL library will probably need /dev/urandom to be available inside
      the chroot directory <b>dir.</b> This is because SSL libraries
      occasionally need to collect fresh random. Newer linux kernels and some
      BSDs implement a getrandom() or getentropy() syscall that removes the need
      for /dev/urandom to be available.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--setcon context</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Apply SELinux <b>context</b> after initialization. This
      essentially provides the ability to restrict OpenVPN's rights to only
      network I/O operations, thanks to SELinux. This goes further than
      <b>--user</b> and <b>--chroot</b> in that those two, while being great
      security features, unfortunately do not protect against privilege
      escalation by exploitation of a vulnerable system call. You can of course
      combine all three, but please note that since setcon requires access to
      /proc you will have to provide it inside the chroot directory (e.g. with
      mount --bind).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since the setcon operation is delayed until after initialization, OpenVPN
      can be restricted to just network-related system calls, whereas by
      applying the context before startup (such as the OpenVPN one provided in
      the SELinux Reference Policies) you will have to allow many things
      required only during initialization.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Like with chroot, complications can result when scripts or restarts are
      executed after the setcon operation, which is why you should really
      consider using the <b>--persist-key</b> and <b>--persist-tun</b>
    options.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--daemon [progname]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Become a daemon after all initialization functions are

      to the syslog file (such as /var/log/messages), except for the output of
      scripts and ifconfig commands, which will go to /dev/null unless otherwise
      redirected. The syslog redirection occurs immediately at the point that
      <b>--daemon</b> is parsed on the command line even though the
      daemonization point occurs later. If one of the <b>--log</b> options is
      present, it will supercede syslog redirection.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The optional <b>progname</b> parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its
      program name to the system logger as <b>progname.</b> This can be useful
      in linking OpenVPN messages in the syslog file with specific tunnels. When
      unspecified, <b>progname</b> defaults to &quot;openvpn&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When OpenVPN is run with the <b>--daemon</b> option, it will try to delay
      daemonization until the majority of initialization functions which are
      capable of generating fatal errors are complete. This means that
      initialization scripts can test the return status of the openvpn command
      for a fairly reliable indication of whether the command has correctly
      initialized and entered the packet forwarding event loop.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initialization are
      non-fatal.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: as soon as OpenVPN has daemonized, it can not ask for usernames,
      passwords, or key pass phrases anymore. This has certain consequences,
      namely that using a password-protected private key will fail unless the
      <b>--askpass</b> option is used to tell OpenVPN to ask for the pass phrase
      (this requirement is new in 2.3.7, and is a consequence of calling
      daemon() before initializing the crypto layer).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Further, using <b>--daemon</b> together with <b>--auth-user-pass</b>

    In a server mode setup, it is possible to selectively turn compression on or
      off for individual clients.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    First, make sure the client-side config file enables selective compression
      by having at least one <b>--comp-lzo</b> directive, such as <b>--comp-lzo
      no.</b> This will turn off compression by default, but allow a future
      directive push from the server to dynamically change the on/off/adaptive
      setting.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Next in a <b>--client-config-dir</b> file, specify the compression setting
      for the client, for example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
<br/>
comp-lzo yes
push &quot;comp-lzo yes&quot;
<br/>
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first line sets the <b>comp-lzo</b> setting for the server side of the

    Adaptive compression tries to optimize the case where you have compression
      enabled, but you are sending predominantly incompressible (or
      pre-compressed) packets over the tunnel, such as an FTP or rsync transfer
      of a large, compressed file. With adaptive compression, OpenVPN will
      periodically sample the compression process to measure its efficiency. If
      the data being sent over the tunnel is already compressed, the compression
      efficiency will be very low, triggering openvpn to disable compression for
      a period of time until the next re-sample test.</dd>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The management interface can also listen on a unix domain socket, for those

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The management interface provides a special mode where the TCP management
      link can operate over the tunnel itself. To enable this mode, set
      <b>IP</b> = &quot;tunnel&quot;. Tunnel mode will cause the management

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    While the management port is designed for programmatic control of OpenVPN by

Starting with OpenVPN 2.0, a multi-client TCP/UDP server mode is supported, and
  can be enabled with the <b>--mode server</b> option. In server mode, OpenVPN
  will listen on a single port for incoming client connections. All client
  connections will be routed through a single tun or tap interface. This mode is
  designed for scalability and should be able to support hundreds or even
  thousands of clients on sufficiently fast hardware. SSL/TLS authentication
  must be used in this mode.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A helper directive similar to <b>--server</b> which is designed to simplify
      the configuration of OpenVPN's server mode in ethernet bridging
      configurations.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>--server-bridge</b> is used without any parameters, it will enable a
      DHCP-proxy mode, where connecting OpenVPN clients will receive an IP
      address for their TAP adapter from the DHCP server running on the OpenVPN
      server-side LAN. Note that only clients that support the binding of a DHCP
      client with the TAP adapter (such as Windows) can support this mode. The
      optional <b>nogw</b> flag (advanced) indicates that gateway information
      should not be pushed to the client.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To configure ethernet bridging, you must first use your OS's bridging
      capability to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet NIC interface.
      For example, on Linux this is done with the <b>brctl</b> tool, and with
      Windows XP it is done in the Network Connections Panel by selecting the
      ethernet and TAP adapters and right-clicking on &quot;Bridge
      Connections&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Next you you must manually set the IP/netmask on the bridge interface. The
      <b>gateway</b> and <b>netmask</b> parameters to <b>--server-bridge</b> can
      be set to either the IP/netmask of the bridge interface, or the IP/netmask
      of the default gateway/router on the bridged subnet.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Finally, set aside a IP range in the bridged subnet, denoted by
      <b>pool-start-IP</b> and <b>pool-end-IP,</b> for OpenVPN to allocate to
      connecting clients.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, <b>server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.128
      10.8.0.254</b> expands as follows:

<br/>
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    This directive can be used to route a fixed subnet from the server to a

      Remember that you must also add the route to the system routing table as
      well (such as by using the <b>--route</b> directive). The reason why two
      routes are needed is that the <b>--route</b> directive routes the packet
      from the kernel to OpenVPN. Once in OpenVPN, the <b>--iroute</b> directive
      routes to the specific client.

    The <b>--iroute</b> directive also has an important interaction with

      If you would like other clients to be able to reach A's subnet, you can
      use <b>--push</b> &quot;route ...&quot; together with
      <b>--client-to-client</b> to effect this. In order for all clients to see
      A's subnet, OpenVPN must push this route to all clients EXCEPT for A,
      since the subnet is already owned by A. OpenVPN accomplishes this by not
      not pushing a route to a client if it matches one of the client's

    The optional <b>direction</b> parameter enables the use of 4 distinct keys
      (HMAC-send, cipher-encrypt, HMAC-receive, cipher-decrypt), so that each
      data flow direction has a different set of HMAC and cipher keys. This has
      a number of desirable security properties including eliminating certain

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When the <b>direction</b> parameter is omitted, 2 keys are used
      bidirectionally, one for HMAC and the other for encryption/decryption.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>direction</b> parameter should always be complementary on either side
      of the connection, i.e. one side should use &quot;0&quot; and the other
      should use &quot;1&quot;, or both sides should omit it altogether.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>direction</b> parameter requires that <b>file</b> contains a 2048 bit
      key. While pre-1.5 versions of OpenVPN generate 1024 bit key files, any
      version of OpenVPN which supports the <b>direction</b> parameter, will
      also support 2048 bit key file generation using the <b>--genkey</b>
      option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Static key encryption mode has certain advantages, the primary being ease of
      configuration.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are no certificates or certificate authorities or complicated
      negotiation handshakes and protocols. The only requirement is that you
      have a pre-existing secure channel with your peer (such as <b>ssh</b> ) to
      initially copy the key. This requirement, along with the fact that your
      key never changes unless you manually generate a new one, makes it
      somewhat less secure than TLS mode (see below). If an attacker manages to
      steal your key, everything that was ever encrypted with it is compromised.
      Contrast that to the perfect forward secrecy features of TLS mode (using
      Diffie Hellman key exchange), where even if an attacker was able to steal
      your private key, he would gain no information to help him decrypt past
      sessions.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Another advantageous aspect of Static Key encryption mode is that it is a
      handshake-free protocol without any distinguishing signature or feature
      (such as a header or protocol handshake sequence) that would mark the
      ciphertext packets as being generated by OpenVPN. Anyone eavesdropping on
      the wire would see nothing but random-looking data.</dd>

      secure hash algorithm, and a key, to produce a digital signature.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The OpenVPN data channel protocol uses encrypt-then-mac (i.e. first encrypt
      a packet, then HMAC the resulting ciphertext), which prevents padding
      oracle attacks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If an AEAD cipher mode (e.g. GCM) is chosen, the specified <b>--auth</b>
      algorithm is ignored for the data channel, and the authentication method
      of the AEAD cipher is used instead. Note that <b>alg</b> still specifies
      the digest used for <b>tls-auth.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In static-key encryption mode, the HMAC key is included in the key file
      generated by <b>--genkey.</b> In TLS mode, the HMAC key is dynamically
      generated and shared between peers via the TLS control channel. If OpenVPN
      receives a packet with a bad HMAC it will drop the packet. HMAC usually

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    OpenVPN provides datagram replay protection by default.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Replay protection is accomplished by tagging each outgoing datagram with an
      identifier that is guaranteed to be unique for the key being used. The
      peer that receives the datagram will check for the uniqueness of the
      identifier. If the identifier was already received in a previous datagram,
      OpenVPN will drop the packet. Replay protection is important to defeat
      attacks such as a SYN flood attack, where the attacker listens in the
      wire, intercepts a TCP SYN packet (identifying it by the context in which
      it occurs in relation to other packets), then floods the receiving peer
      with copies of this packet.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    OpenVPN's replay protection is implemented in slightly different ways,
      depending on the key management mode you have selected.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In Static Key mode or when using an CFB or OFB mode cipher, OpenVPN uses a
      64 bit unique identifier that combines a time stamp with an incrementing
      sequence number.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When using TLS mode for key exchange and a CBC cipher mode, OpenVPN uses
      only a 32 bit sequence number without a time stamp, since OpenVPN can
      guarantee the uniqueness of this value for each key. As in IPSec, if the
      sequence number is close to wrapping back to zero, OpenVPN will trigger a
      new key exchange.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To check for replays, OpenVPN uses the <i>sliding window</i> algorithm used
      by IPSec.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--replay-window n [t]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use a replay protection sliding-window of size <b>n</b> and
      a time window of <b>t</b> seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By default <b>n</b> is 64 (the IPSec default) and <b>t</b> is 15 seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is only relevant in UDP mode, i.e. when either <b>--proto
      udp</b> is specified, or no <b>--proto</b> option is specified.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When OpenVPN tunnels IP packets over UDP, there is the possibility that
      packets might be dropped or delivered out of order. Because OpenVPN, like
      IPSec, is emulating the physical network layer, it will accept an
      out-of-order packet sequence, and will deliver such packets in the same
      order they were received to the TCP/IP protocol stack, provided they
      satisfy several constraints.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>(a)</b> The packet cannot be a replay (unless <b>--no-replay</b> is
      specified, which disables replay protection altogether).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>(b)</b> If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if the
      difference between its sequence number and the highest sequence number
      received so far is less than <b>n.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>(c)</b> If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if it
      arrives no later than <b>t</b> seconds after any packet containing a
      higher sequence number.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you are using a network link with a large pipeline (meaning that the
      product of bandwidth and latency is high), you may want to use a larger
      value for <b>n.</b> Satellite links in particular often require this.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you run OpenVPN at <b>--verb 4,</b> you will see the message
      &quot;Replay-window backtrack occurred [x]&quot; every time the maximum
      sequence number backtrack seen thus far increases. This can be used to
      calibrate <b>n.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is some controversy on the appropriate method of handling packet
      reordering at the security layer.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Namely, to what extent should the security layer protect the encapsulated
      protocol from attacks which masquerade as the kinds of normal packet loss
      and reordering that occur over IP networks?
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The IPSec and OpenVPN approach is to allow packet reordering within a
      certain fixed sequence number window.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    OpenVPN adds to the IPSec model by limiting the window size in time as well
      as sequence space.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    OpenVPN also adds TCP transport as an option (not offered by IPSec) in which
      case OpenVPN can adopt a very strict attitude towards message deletion and
      reordering: Don't allow it. Since TCP guarantees reliability, any packet
      loss or reordering event can be assumed to be an attack.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In this sense, it could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is preferred
      when tunneling non-IP or UDP application protocols which might be
      vulnerable to a message deletion or reordering attack which falls within
      the normal operational parameters of IP networks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    So I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non-IP protocol
      or UDP application protocol over UDP, if the protocol might be vulnerable
      to a message deletion or reordering attack that falls within the normal
      operating parameters of what is to be expected from the physical IP layer.
      The problem is easily fixed by simply using TCP as the VPN transport
      layer.</dd>

    OpenVPN uses an IV by default, and requires it for CFB and OFB cipher modes
      (which are totally insecure without it). Using an IV is important for
      security when multiple messages are being encrypted/decrypted with the
      same key.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    IV is implemented differently depending on the cipher mode used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In CBC mode, OpenVPN uses a pseudo-random IV for each packet.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In CFB/OFB mode, OpenVPN uses a unique sequence number and time stamp as the

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TLS_Mode_Options:"><a class="selflink" href="#TLS_Mode_Options:">TLS
  Mode Options:</a></h2>
TLS mode is the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both security and
  flexibility. TLS mode works by establishing control and data channels which
  are multiplexed over a single TCP/UDP port. OpenVPN initiates a TLS session
  over the control channel and uses it to exchange cipher and HMAC keys to
  protect the data channel. TLS mode uses a robust reliability layer over the
  UDP connection for all control channel communication, while the data channel,
  over which encrypted tunnel data passes, is forwarded without any mediation.
  The result is the best of both worlds: a fast data channel that forwards over
  UDP with only the overhead of encrypt, decrypt, and HMAC functions, and a
  control channel that provides all of the security features of TLS, including
  certificate-based authentication and Diffie Hellman forward secrecy.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local
  certificate/key pair ( <b>--cert</b> and <b>--key</b> ), signed by the root
  certificate which is specified in <b>--ca.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When two OpenVPN peers connect, each presents its local certificate to the
  other. Each peer will then check that its partner peer presented a certificate
  which was signed by the master root certificate as specified in <b>--ca.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If that check on both peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation will succeed,
  both OpenVPN peers will exchange temporary session keys, and the tunnel will
  begin passing data.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In method 1 (the default for OpenVPN 1.x), both sides generate random

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In method 2, (the default for OpenVPN 2.0) the client generates a random
      key. Both client and server also generate some random seed material. All
      key source material is exchanged over the TLS channel. The actual keys are
      generated using the TLS PRF function, taking source entropy from both
      client and server. Method 2 is designed to closely parallel the key
      generation process used by TLS 1.0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that in TLS mode, two separate levels of keying occur:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (1) The TLS connection is initially negotiated, with both sides of the
      connection producing certificates and verifying the certificate (or other

      parameter has no effect on this process.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (2) After the TLS connection is established, the tunnel session keys are

    keys.</dd>

      stack.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In a nutshell, <b>--tls-auth</b> enables a kind of &quot;HMAC firewall&quot;
      on OpenVPN's TCP/UDP port, where TLS control channel packets bearing an
      incorrect HMAC signature can be dropped immediately without response.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>file</b> (required) is a file in OpenVPN static key format which can be
      generated by <b>--genkey</b>

    Older versions (up to 2.3) supported a freeform passphrase file. This is no
      longer supported in newer versions (2.4+).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See the <b>--secret</b> option for more information on the optional
      <b>direction</b> parameter.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>--tls-auth</b> is recommended when you are running OpenVPN in a mode
      where it is listening for packets from any IP address, such as when
      <b>--remote</b> is not specified, or <b>--remote</b> is specified with
      <b>--float.</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The rationale for this feature is as follows. TLS requires a multi-packet
      exchange before it is able to authenticate a peer. During this time before
      authentication, OpenVPN is allocating resources (memory and CPU) to this
      potential peer. The potential peer is also exposing many parts of OpenVPN
      and the OpenSSL library to the packets it is sending. Most successful
      network attacks today seek to either exploit bugs in programs (such as
      buffer overflow attacks) or force a program to consume so many resources
      that it becomes unusable. Of course the first line of defense is always to
      produce clean, well-audited code. OpenVPN has been written with buffer
      overflow attack prevention as a top priority. But as history has shown,
      many of the most widely used network applications have, from time to time,
      fallen to buffer overflow attacks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of
      authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that every packet on
      the control channel is authenticated by an HMAC signature and a unique ID
      for replay protection. This signature will also help protect against DoS
      (Denial of Service) attacks. An important rule of thumb in reducing
      vulnerability to DoS attacks is to minimize the amount of resources a
      potential, but as yet unauthenticated, client is able to consume.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>--tls-auth</b> does this by signing every TLS control channel packet with
      an HMAC signature, including packets which are sent before the TLS level
      has had a chance to authenticate the peer. The result is that packets
      without the correct signature can be dropped immediately upon reception,
      before they have a chance to consume additional system resources such as
      by initiating a TLS handshake. <b>--tls-auth</b> can be strengthened by
      adding the <b>--replay-persist</b> option which will keep OpenVPN's replay
      protection state in a file so that it is not lost across restarts.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It should be emphasized that this feature is optional and that the key file
      used with <b>--tls-auth</b> gives a peer nothing more than the power to
      initiate a TLS handshake. It is not used to encrypt or authenticate any
      tunnel data.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>cmd certificate_depth subject</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    These arguments are, respectively, the current certificate depth and the
      X509 common name (cn) of the peer.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This feature is useful if the peer you want to trust has a certificate which
      was signed by a certificate authority who also signed many other
      certificates, where you don't necessarily want to trust all of them, but
      rather be selective about which peer certificate you will accept. This
      feature allows you to write a script which will test the X509 name on a
      certificate and decide whether or not it should be accepted. For a simple
      perl script which will test the common name field on the certificate, see
      the file <b>verify-cn</b> in the OpenVPN distribution.

    <b>--x509-username-field ext:subjectAltName</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first example uses the value of the &quot;emailAddress&quot; attribute
      in the certificate's Subject field as the username. The second example
      uses the <b>ext:</b> prefix to signify that the X.509 extension
      <b>fieldname</b> &quot;subjectAltName&quot; be searched for an rfc822Name
      (email) field to be used as the username. In cases where there are

      it defaults to the common name (CN), e.g. a certificate with a subject DN

    <b>--verify-x509-name</b> is a useful replacement for the

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--mktun</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(Standalone) Create a persistent tunnel on platforms which
      support them such as Linux. Normally TUN/TAP tunnels exist only for the
      period of time that an application has them open. This option takes
      advantage of the TUN/TAP driver's ability to build persistent tunnels that
      live through multiple instantiations of OpenVPN and die only when they are
      deleted or the machine is rebooted.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    One of the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate the need
      for separate <b>--up</b> and <b>--down</b> scripts to run the appropriate
      <b>ifconfig</b>(8) and <b>route</b>(8) commands. These commands can be
      placed in the the same shell script which starts or terminates an OpenVPN
      session.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Another advantage is that open connections through the TUN/TAP-based tunnel
      will not be reset if the OpenVPN peer restarts. This can be useful to
      provide uninterrupted connectivity through the tunnel in the event of a
      DHCP reset of the peer's public IP address (see the <b>--ipchange</b>
      option above).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    One disadvantage of persistent tunnels is that it is harder to automatically

      output a message to the console telling the user to configure the adapter

      to be set to.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>dynamic [offset] [lease-time] --</b> Automatically set the IP address and
      netmask by replying to DHCP query messages generated by the kernel. This
      mode is probably the &quot;cleanest&quot; solution for setting the TCP/IP
      properties since it uses the well-known DHCP protocol. There are, however,
      two prerequisites for using this mode: (1) The TCP/IP properties for the
      TAP-Win32 adapter must be set to &quot;Obtain an IP address
      automatically,&quot; and (2) OpenVPN needs to claim an IP address in the
      subnet for use as the virtual DHCP server address. By default in <b>--dev
      tap</b> mode, OpenVPN will take the normally unused first address in the
      subnet. For example, if your subnet is 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0,
      then OpenVPN will take the IP address 192.168.4.0 to use as the virtual
      DHCP server address. In <b>--dev tun</b> mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP
      server to masquerade as if it were coming from the remote endpoint. The
      optional offset parameter is an integer which is &gt; -256 and &lt; 256
      and which defaults to -1. If offset is positive, the DHCP server will
      masquerade as the IP address at network address + offset. If offset is
      negative, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address at broadcast
      address + offset. The Windows <b>ipconfig /all</b> command can be used to
      show what Windows thinks the DHCP server address is. OpenVPN will
      &quot;claim&quot; this address, so make sure to use a free address. Having
      said that, different OpenVPN instantiations, including different ends of
      the same connection, can share the same virtual DHCP server address. The
      <b>lease-time</b> parameter controls the lease time of the DHCP assignment
      given to the TAP-Win32 adapter, and is denoted in seconds. Normally a very
      long lease time is preferred because it prevents routes involving the
      TAP-Win32 adapter from being lost when the system goes to sleep. The
      default lease time is one year.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>netsh --</b> Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the

      work correctly on Windows XP but not Windows 2000.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>ipapi --</b> Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the
      Windows IP Helper API. This approach does not have ideal semantics, though
      testing has indicated that it works okay in practice. If you use this
      option, it is best to leave the TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32
      adapter in their default state, i.e. &quot;Obtain an IP address
      automatically.&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>adaptive --</b> (Default) Try <b>dynamic</b> method initially and fail

      when certain third-party firewall packages installed on the client machine
      block the DHCP negotiation used by the TAP-Win32 adapter. Note that if the
      <b>netsh</b> failover occurs, the TAP-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties will
      be reset from DHCP to static, and this will cause future OpenVPN startups
      using the <b>adaptive</b> mode to use <b>netsh</b> immediately, rather
      than trying <b>dynamic</b> first. To &quot;unstick&quot; the

    <b>NBS scope-id --</b> Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope. A NetBIOS Scope ID
      provides an extended naming service for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Known as
      NBT) module. The primary purpose of a NetBIOS scope ID is to isolate
      NetBIOS traffic on a single network to only those nodes with the same
      NetBIOS scope ID. The NetBIOS scope ID is a character string that is
      appended to the NetBIOS name. The NetBIOS scope ID on two hosts must
      match, or the two hosts will not be able to communicate. The NetBIOS Scope
      ID also allows computers to use the same computer name, as they have
      different scope IDs. The Scope ID becomes a part of the NetBIOS name,
      making the name unique. (This description of NetBIOS scopes courtesy of
      NeonSurge@abyss.com)

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="String_Types_and_Remapping"><a class="selflink" href="#String_Types_and_Remapping">String
  Types and Remapping</a></h2>
In certain cases, OpenVPN will perform remapping of characters in strings.
  Essentially, any characters outside the set of permitted characters for each
  string type will be converted to underbar ('_').
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Q:</b> Why is string remapping necessary?
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>A:</b> It's an important security feature to prevent the malicious coding of
  strings from untrusted sources to be passed as parameters to scripts, saved in
  the environment, used as a common name, translated to a filename, etc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Q:</b> Can string remapping be disabled?
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>A:</b> Yes, by using the <b>--no-name-remapping</b> option, however this
  should be considered an advanced option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here is a brief rundown of OpenVPN's current string types and the permitted
  character class for each string:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>X509 Names:</b> Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), at
  ('@'), colon (':'), slash ('/'), and equal ('='). Alphanumeric is defined as a
  character which will cause the C library isalnum() function to return true.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Common Names:</b> Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), and at
  ('@').
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--auth-user-pass username:</b> Same as Common Name, with one exception:
  starting with OpenVPN 2.0.1, the username is passed to the
  OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY plugin in its raw form, without string
  remapping.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--auth-user-pass password:</b> Any &quot;printable&quot; character except CR
  or LF. Printable is defined to be a character which will cause the C library
  isprint() function to return true.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--client-config-dir filename as derived from common name or username:</b>
  Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), and dot ('.') except for
  &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot; as standalone strings. As of 2.0.1-rc6, the at
  ('@') character has been added as well for compatibility with the common name
  character class.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Environmental variable names:</b> Alphanumeric or underbar ('_').
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Environmental variable values:</b> Any printable character.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For all cases, characters in a string which are not members of the legal
  character class for that string type will be remapped to underbar ('_').
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Environmental_Variables"><a class="selflink" href="#Environmental_Variables">Environmental
  Variables</a></h2>
Once set, a variable is persisted indefinitely until it is reset by a new value
  or a restart,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As of OpenVPN 2.0-beta12, in server mode, environmental variables set by OpenVPN
  are scoped according to the client objects they are associated with, so there
  should not be any issues with scripts having access to stale, previously set
  variables which refer to different client instances.

If you are running Linux 2.4.7 or higher, you probably have the TUN/TAP driver
  already installed. If so, there are still a few things you need to do:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Make device: <b>mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Load driver: <b>modprobe tun</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Prior to running these examples, you should have OpenVPN installed on two
  machines with network connectivity between them. If you have not yet installed
  OpenVPN, consult the INSTALL file included in the OpenVPN distribution.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TUN/TAP_Setup:"><a class="selflink" href="#TUN/TAP_Setup:">TUN/TAP
  Setup:</a></h2>
If you are using Linux 2.4 or higher, make the tun device node and load the tun
  module:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>modprobe tun</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you installed from RPM, the <b>mknod</b> step may be omitted, because the RPM
  install does that for you.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Only Linux 2.4 and newer are supported.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For other platforms, consult the INSTALL file at
  <i>http://openvpn.net/install.html</i> for more information.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Firewall_Setup:"><a class="selflink" href="#Firewall_Setup:">Firewall
  Setup:</a></h2>
If firewalls exist between the two machines, they should be set to forward UDP
  port 1194 in both directions. If you do not have control over the firewalls
  between the two machines, you may still be able to use OpenVPN by adding
  <b>--ping 15</b> to each of the <b>openvpn</b> commands used below in the
  examples (this will cause each peer to send out a UDP ping to its remote peer
  once every 15 seconds which will cause many stateful firewalls to forward
  packets in both directions without an explicit firewall rule).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you are using a Linux iptables-based firewall, you may need to enter the
  following command to allow incoming packets on the TUN device:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the firewalls section below for more information on configuring firewalls
  for use with OpenVPN.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="VPN_Address_Setup:"><a class="selflink" href="#VPN_Address_Setup:">VPN
  Address Setup:</a></h2>
For purposes of our example, our two machines will be called
  <b>bob.example.com</b> and <b>alice.example.com.</b> If you are constructing a
  VPN over the internet, then replace <b>bob.example.com</b> and
  <b>alice.example.com</b> with the internet hostname or IP address that each
  machine will use to contact the other over the internet.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now we will choose the tunnel endpoints. Tunnel endpoints are private IP
  addresses that only have meaning in the context of the VPN. Each machine will
  use the tunnel endpoint of the other machine to access it over the VPN. In our
  example, the tunnel endpoint for bob.example.com will be 10.4.0.1 and for
  alice.example.com, 10.4.0.2.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Once the VPN is established, you have essentially created a secure alternate
  path between the two hosts which is addressed by using the tunnel endpoints.
  You can control which network traffic passes between the hosts (a) over the
  VPN or (b) independently of the VPN, by choosing whether to use (a) the VPN
  endpoint address or (b) the public internet address, to access the remote
  host. For example if you are on bob.example.com and you wish to connect to
  alice.example.com via <b>ssh</b> without using the VPN (since <b>ssh</b> has
  its own built-in security) you would use the command <b>ssh
  alice.example.com.</b> However in the same scenario, you could also use the
  command <b>telnet 10.4.0.2</b> to create a telnet session with
  alice.example.com over the VPN, that would use the VPN to secure the session
  rather than <b>ssh.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can use any address you wish for the tunnel endpoints but make sure that
  they are private addresses (such as those that begin with 10 or 192.168) and
  that they are not part of any existing subnet on the networks of either peer,
  unless you are bridging. If you use an address that is part of your local
  subnet for either of the tunnel endpoints, you will get a weird feedback loop.

For this test, we will designate <b>bob</b> as the TLS client and <b>alice</b>
  as the TLS server. <i>Note that client or server designation only has meaning
  for the TLS subsystem. It has no bearing on OpenVPN's peer-to-peer, UDP-based
  communication model.</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
First, build a separate certificate/key pair for both bob and alice (see above
  where <b>--cert</b> is discussed for more info). Then construct Diffie Hellman
  parameters (see above where <b>--dh</b> is discussed for more info). You can
  also use the included test files client.crt, client.key, server.crt,
  server.key and ca.crt. The .crt files are certificates/public-keys, the .key
  files are private keys, and ca.crt is a certification authority who has signed
  both client.crt and server.crt. For Diffie Hellman parameters you can use the
  included file dh1024.pem. <i>Note that all client, server, and certificate
  authority certificates and keys included in the OpenVPN distribution are
  totally insecure and should be used for testing only.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On bob:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>openvpn --remote alice.example.com --dev tun1 --ifconfig
      10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --tls-client --ca ca.crt --cert client.crt --key
      client.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On alice:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>openvpn --remote bob.example.com --dev tun1 --ifconfig
      10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --tls-server --dh dh1024.pem --ca ca.crt --cert
      server.crt --key server.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On bob:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>ping 10.4.0.2</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On alice:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>ping 10.4.0.1</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice the <b>--reneg-sec 60</b> option we used above. That tells OpenVPN to
  renegotiate the data channel keys every minute. Since we used <b>--verb 5</b>
  above, you will see status information on each new key negotiation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For production operations, a key renegotiation interval of 60 seconds is
  probably too frequent. Omit the <b>--reneg-sec 60</b> option to use OpenVPN's
  default key renegotiation interval of one hour.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Routing:"><a class="selflink" href="#Routing:">Routing:</a></h2>
Assuming you can ping across the tunnel, the next step is to route a real subnet
  over the secure tunnel. Suppose that bob and alice have two network interfaces
  each, one connected to the internet, and the other to a private network. Our
  goal is to securely connect both private networks. We will assume that bob's
  private subnet is 10.0.0.0/24 and alice's is 10.0.1.0/24.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, ensure that IP forwarding is enabled on both peers. On Linux, enable
  routing:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and enable TUN packet forwarding through the firewall:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On bob:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>route add -net 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw
      10.4.0.2</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On alice:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw
      10.4.0.1</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now any machine on the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet can access any machine on the
  10.0.1.0/24 subnet over the secure tunnel (or vice versa).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In a production environment, you could put the route command(s) in a script and
  execute with the <b>--up</b> option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FIREWALLS"><a class="selflink" href="#FIREWALLS">FIREWALLS</a></h1>
OpenVPN's usage of a single UDP port makes it fairly firewall-friendly. You
  should add an entry to your firewall rules to allow incoming OpenVPN packets.
  On Linux 2.4+:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 1.2.3.4 --dport 1194 -j
      ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will allow incoming packets on UDP port 1194 (OpenVPN's default UDP port)
  from an OpenVPN peer at 1.2.3.4.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you are using HMAC-based packet authentication (the default in any of
  OpenVPN's secure modes), having the firewall filter on source address can be
  considered optional, since HMAC packet authentication is a much more secure
  method of verifying the authenticity of a packet source. In that case:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would be adequate and would not render the host inflexible with respect to its
  peer having a dynamic IP address.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
OpenVPN also works well on stateful firewalls. In some cases, you may not need
  to add any static rules to the firewall list if you are using a stateful
  firewall that knows how to track UDP connections. If you specify <b>--ping
  n,</b> OpenVPN will be guaranteed to send a packet to its peer at least once
  every <b>n</b> seconds. If <b>n</b> is less than the stateful firewall
  connection timeout, you can maintain an OpenVPN connection indefinitely
  without explicit firewall rules.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You should also add firewall rules to allow incoming IP traffic on TUN or TAP
  devices such as:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to allow input packets from tun devices,
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to allow input packets from tun devices to be forwarded to other hosts on the
  local network,
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to allow input packets from tap devices, and
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>iptables -A FORWARD -i tap+ -j ACCEPT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to allow input packets from tap devices to be forwarded to other hosts on the
  local network.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These rules are secure if you use packet authentication, since no incoming
  packets will arrive on a TUN or TAP virtual device unless they first pass an
  HMAC authentication test.
