<p>MIMEDEFANG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
MIMEDEFANG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mimedefang - Sendmail MIME mail filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mimedefang prcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mimedefang -p connection -m
mx_socket_name -U user [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mimedefang is a filter built around Sendmail 8.11&rsquo;s
milter API for mail filters. It collects each incoming
message and runs a filter on the message. This is useful for
deleting <br>
attachments which may be a security risk on poorly-designed
systems like Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mimedefang does not actually run
the Perl filter; instead, it communicates with
mimedefang-multiplexor(8), which manages a pool of
persistent Perl processes. See the mimedefang- <br>
multiplexor man page for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
If you invoke mimedefang with the single argument prcap, it
prints information about the version of Milter it is linked
against and exits. Otherwise, you should invoke
mimede&acirc; <br>
fang as shown in the second line of the SYNOPSIS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U user <br>
Runs mimedefang as user rather than root. The user argument
must match the argument to mimedefang-multiplexor&rsquo;s -U
option as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y If the -y command-line option
is given, MIMEDefang will call smfi_setsymlist to set the
list of macros it wants. This function leaked memory in
versions of Sendmail prior <br>
to 8.14.4 so by default we do not call it. If you are
running an older version of sendmail, you should explicitly
set the list of macros you want in the Sendmail
configu&acirc; <br>
ration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z spooldir <br>
Set the spool directory to spooldir. If this option is
omitted, the spool directory defaults to
/var/spool/MIMEDefang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p connection <br>
The -p switch is required and specifies the milter
connection type. Typically, you should run mimedefang on the
same computer as sendmail. Therefore, you should use a <br>
UNIX-domain socket for the connection type. The suggested
value for the -p switch is mimedefang.sock under the spool
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mx_socket_name <br>
Specifies the socket for communicating with
mimedefang-multiplexor(8). The mx_socket_name specifies the
path of the UNIX-domain socket. See
mimedefang-multiplexor(8) for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b backlog <br>
Sets the &quot;backlog&quot; argument to the listen(2)
system call to backlog. If this option is omitted, then the
operating-system default backlog is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Normally, mimedefang uses a
umask of 077 when creating the milter socket and files. If
you would like the socket to be readable and writeable by
the group and files to be <br>
group-readable, supply the -G option. This causes the umask
to be 007 whenever UNIX-domain sockets are created and 027
whenever files are created. Note: if your milter <br>
library is too old to have the smfi_opensocket() function,
the -G option causes mimedefang to use a umask of 007
throughout its execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that by default,
/var/spool/MIMEDefang is created with mode 0700. If you use
the -G option, you probably should change the mode to
0750.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d The -d switch causes
mimedefang not to delete the temporary spool files it
creates for incoming messages. This is for debugging
purposes only and should never be used on <br>
a production mail server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Causes mimedefang to perform
a relay check before processing any messages. It calls into
a user-supplied Perl function called filter_relay with the
IP address and host <br>
name of the sending relay. (See mimedefang-filter(5) for
details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Causes mimedefang to perform
a HELO check before processing any messages. It calls into a
user-supplied Perl function called filter_helo with the IP
address and host name <br>
of the sending relay, and the HELO argument. (See
mimedefang-filter(5) for details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Causes mimedefang to perform
a sender check before processing the message body. It calls
into a user-supplied Perl function called filter_sender with
the envelope address <br>
of the sender. (See mimedefang-filter(5) for details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Causes mimedefang to perform
recipient checks before processing the message body. It
calls into a user-supplied Perl function called
filter_recipient with the envelope <br>
address of each recipient. (See mimedefang-filter(5) for
details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Permits the multiplexor to
queue new connections. See the section QUEUEING REQUESTS in
the mimedefang-multiplexor man page. Note that this option
and the -R option are <br>
mutually-exclusive. If you supply -q, then -R is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Causes mimedefang not to
delete working directories if a filter fails. This lets you
obtain the message which caused the filter to fail and
determine what went wrong. <br>
mimedefang logs the directory containing the failed message
using syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P fileName <br>
Causes mimedefang to write its process-ID (after becoming a
daemon) to the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R num Normally, mimedefang
tempfails a new SMTP connection if there are no free slaves.
Supplying the -R num option makes mimedefang tempfail new
connections if there are fewer <br>
than num free slaves, unless the connection is from the
local host. This allows you to favour connections from
localhost so your clientmqueue doesn&rsquo;t build up. Note
that <br>
supplying -R 0 is subtly different from omitting the option;
in this case, mimedefang permits new connections from
localhost to queue, but not connections from other hosts
<br>
(unless you also supply the -q option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of the -R option is
to reserve resources for clientmqueue runs. Otherwise, on a
very busy mail server, clientmqueue runs can starve for a
long time, leading <br>
to delays for locally-generated or streamed mail. We
recommend using a small number for num; probably no more
than 3 or 10% of the total number of slaves (whichever is
<br>
smaller.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option and the -q
option are mutually-exclusive. If you supply -q, then -R is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Conserve file descriptors by
opening and closing disk files more often. (Disk files are
never held open across Milter callbacks.) While this
shortens the length of time <br>
a file descriptor is open, it also leaves more opportunities
for the open to fail. We do not recommend the use of this
flag except on very busy systems that exhibit fail&acirc;
<br>
ures due to a shortage of file descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Causes mimedefang to log the
run-time of the Perl filter using syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x string <br>
Add string as the content of the X-Scanned-By: header. If
you set string to the empty string (i.e. -x &quot;&quot;),
then no X-Scanned-By: header will be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Do not add an X-Scanned-By:
header. Specifying -X is equivalent to specifying -x
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not fork into the
background and become a daemon. Instead, stay in the
foreground. Useful mainly for debugging or if you have a
supervisory process managing mimede&acirc; <br>
fang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M This option is obsolete; it
is accepted for backward-compatibility, but is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Normally, mimedefang sees all
envelope recipients, even ones that Sendmail knows to be
invalid. If you don&rsquo;t want Sendmail to perform a
milter callback for recipients it <br>
knows to be invalid, invoke mimedefang with the -N flag.
Please note that this flag only works with Sendmail and
Milter 8.14.0 and newer. It has no effect if you&rsquo;re
run&acirc; <br>
ning an older version of Sendmail or Milter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S facility <br>
Specifies the syslog facility for log messages. The default
is mail. See openlog(3) for a list of valid facilities. You
can use either the short name (&quot;mail&quot;) or long
<br>
name (&quot;LOG_MAIL&quot;) for the facility name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a macro <br>
Pass the value of the specified Sendmail macro through to
the Perl filter. You can repeat the -a option to write more
macros than the built-in defaults. Note that in <br>
addition to asking mimedefang to pass the macro value to the
filter, you must configure Sendmail to pass the macro
through to mimedefang using the confMIL&acirc; <br>
TER_MACROS_ENVFROM definition in Sendmail&rsquo;s m4
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Strip &quot;bare&quot;
carriage-returns (CR) characters from the message body. A
bare CR should never appear in an e-mail message. Older
versions of mimedefang used to strip them <br>
out automatically, but now they are left in by default. The
-c option enables the older behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print usage information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
When mimedefang starts, it connects to sendmail using the
milter API. (See the Sendmail 8.11 documentation.) For each
incoming message, mimedefang creates a temporary directory
<br>
and saves information in the directory. At various phases
during the SMTP conversation, mimedefang communicates with
mimedefang-multiplexor to perform various operations. <br>
mimedefang-multiplexor manages a pool of persistent Perl
processes that actually perform the mail scanning
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a Perl process scans an
e-mail, the temporary spool directory contains certain
files; details of the communication protocol between
mimedefang and the Perl script are in <br>
mimedefang-protocol(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
mimedefang does violence to the flow of e-mail. The Perl
filter is quite picky and assumes that MIME e-mail messages
are well-formed. While I have tried to make the script <br>
safe, I take no responsibility for lost or mangled e-mail
messages or any security holes this script may
introduce.</p>
