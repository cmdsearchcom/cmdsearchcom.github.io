<p>RADIUSD(8) FreeRADIUS Daemon RADIUSD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
radiusd - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
radiusd [-C] [-d config_directory] [-f] [-h] [-i ip-address]
[-l log_file] [-m] [-n name] [-p port] [-s] [-t] [-v] [-x]
[-X]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable
RADIUS server. It supports many database back-ends such as
flat-text files, SQL, LDAP, Perl, Python, etc. It also
sup&acirc; <br>
ports many authentication protocols such as PAP, CHAP,
MS-CHAP(v2), HTTP Digest, and EAP (EAP-MD5, EAP-TLS, PEAP,
EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also has fullsupport for
Cisco&rsquo;s VLAN Query Protocol (VMPS) and DHCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please read the DEBUGGING
section below. It contains instructions for quickly
configuring the server for your local system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options are accepted by the
server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Check the configuration and
exit immediately. If there is a problem reading the
configuration, then the server will exit with a non-zero
status code. If the configura&acirc; <br>
tion appears to be acceptable, then the server will exit
with a zero status code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there are limitations
to this check. Due to the complexities involved in almost
starting a RADIUS server, these checks are necessarily
incomplete. The server <br>
can return a zero status code when run with -C, but may
still exit with an error when run normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the output of radiusd -XC
for an informative list of which modules are checked for
correct configuration, and which modules are skipped, and
therefore not checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d config directory <br>
Defaults to /etc/freeradius. Radiusd looks here for its
configuration files such as the dictionary and the users
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not fork, stay running as
a foreground process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print usage help
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i ip-address <br>
Defines which IP address that the server uses for sending
and receiving packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this command-line option is
given, then the &quot;bind_address&quot; and all
&quot;listen{}&quot; entries in radiusd.conf are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option MUST be used in
conjunction with &quot;-p&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l log_file <br>
Defaults to ${logdir}/radius.log. Radiusd writes it&rsquo;s
logging information to this file. If log_file is the string
&quot;stdout&quot; logging will be written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m On SIGINT or SIGQUIT exit
cleanly instead of immediately. This is most useful for when
running the server with &quot;valgrind&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name <br>
Read freeradius/name.conf instead of
freeradius/radiusd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Defines which port is used for receiving authentication
packets. Accounting packets are received on &quot;port +
1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this command-line option is
given, all &quot;listen&quot; sections in radiusd.conf are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option MUST be used in
conjunction with &quot;-i&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Run in &quot;single
server&quot; mode. The server normally runs with multiple
threads and/or processes, which can lower its response time
to requests. Some systems have issues <br>
with threading, however, so running in &quot;single
server&quot; mode may help to address those issues. In
single server mode, the server will also not
&quot;daemonize&quot; (auto-back&acirc; <br>
ground) itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Do not spawn threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print server version
information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Debugging mode. Equivalent to
&quot;-sfxx -l stdout&quot;. When trying to understand how
the server works, ALWAYS run it with &quot;radiusd -X&quot;.
For production servers, use &quot;raddebug&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Finer-grained debug mode. In
this mode the server will print details of every request on
it&rsquo;s stdout output. You can specify this option
multiple times (-x -x or -xx) to <br>
get more detailed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING <br>
The default configuration is set to work in the widest
possible circumstances. It requires minimal changes for your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, your needs may be
complex, and may require significant changes to the server
configuration. Making random changes is a guaranteed method
of failure. Instead, we <br>
STRONGLY RECOMMEND proceeding via the following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Always run the server in
debugging mode ( radiusd -X ) after making a configuration
change. We cannot emphasize this enough. If you are not
running the server in debugging <br>
mode, you will not be able to see what is doing, and you
will not be able to correct any problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you ask questions on the
mailing list, the first response will be to tell you
&quot;run the server in debugging mode&quot;. Please, follow
these instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Change as little as possible
in the default configuration files. The server contains a
decade of experience with protocols, databases, and
different systems. Its default <br>
configuration is designed to work almost everywhere, and to
do almost everything you need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) When you make a small change,
testing it before changing anything else. If the change
works, save a copy of the configuration, and make another
change. If the change doesn&rsquo;t <br>
work, debug it, and try to understand why it doesn&rsquo;t
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you begin by making large
changes to the server configuration, it will never work, and
you will never be able to debug the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) If you need to add a
connection to a database FOO (e.g. LDAP or SQL), then:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) Edit freeradius/modules/foo
<br>
This file contains the default configuration for the module.
It contains comments describing what can be configured, and
what those configuration entries mean. <br>
b) Edit freeradius/sites-available/default <br>
This file contains the default policy for the server. e.g.
&quot;enable CHAP, MS-CHAP, and EAP authentication&quot;.
Look in this file for all references to your module
&quot;foo&quot;. Read <br>
the comments, and remove the leading hash &rsquo;#&rsquo;
from the lines referencing the module. This enables the
module. <br>
c) Edit freeradius/sites-available/inner-tunnel <br>
This file contains the default policy for the
&quot;tunneled&quot; portion of certain EAP methods. Perform
the same kind of edits as above, for the &quot;default&quot;
file.. If you are not <br>
using EAP (802.1X), then this step can be skipped. <br>
d) Start the server in debugging mode ( radiusd -X ), and
start testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5) Ask questions on the mailing
list (freeradius-users@lists.freeradius.org). When asking
questions, include the output from debugging mode ( radiusd
-X ). This information <br>
will allow people to help you. If you do not include it, the
first response to your message will be &quot;post the output
of debug mode&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ask questions earlier, rather
than later. If you cannot solve a problem in a day, ask a
question on the mailing list. Most questions have been seen
before, and can be answered <br>
quickly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND <br>
RADIUS is a protocol spoken between an access server,
typically a device connected to several modems or ISDN
lines, and a radius server. When a user connects to the
access <br>
server, (s)he is asked for a loginname and a password. This
information is then sent to the radius server. The server
replies with &quot;access denied&quot;, or &quot;access
OK&quot;. In the latter <br>
case login information is sent along, such as the IP address
in the case of a PPP connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access server also sends
login and logout records to the radius server so accounting
can be done. These records are kept for each terminal server
separately in a file called <br>
detail, and in the wtmp compatible logfile
/var/log/radwtmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Radiusd uses a number of configuration files. Each file has
it&rsquo;s own manpage describing the format of the file.
These files are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">radiusd.conf <br>
The main configuration file, which sets the
administrator-controlled items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dictionary <br>
This file is usually static. It defines all the possible
RADIUS attributes used in the other configuration files. You
don&rsquo;t have to modify it. It includes other
dictio&acirc; <br>
nary files in the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hints Defines certain hints to
the radius server based on the users&rsquo;s loginname or
other attributes sent by the access server. It also provides
for mapping user names (such as <br>
Pusername -&gt; username). This provides the functionality
that the Livingston 2.0 server has as &quot;Prefix&quot; and
&quot;Suffix&quot; support in the users file, but is more
general. <br>
Ofcourse the Livingston way of doing things is also
supported, and you can even use both at the same time
(within certain limits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">huntgroups <br>
Defines the huntgroups that you have, and makes it possible
to restrict access to certain huntgroups to certain (groups
of) users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">users Here the users are
defined. On a typical setup, this file mainly contains
DEFAULT entries to process the different types of logins,
based on hints from the hints file. <br>
Authentication is then based on the contents of the UNIX
/etc/passwd file. However it is also possible to define all
users, and their passwords, in this file.</p>
