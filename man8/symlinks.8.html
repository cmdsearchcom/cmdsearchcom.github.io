<p>SYMLINKS(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
SYMLINKS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
symlinks - symbolic link maintenance utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
symlinks [ -cdorstv ] dirlist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
symlinks is a useful utility for maintainers of FTP sites,
CDROMs, and Linux software distributions. It scans
directories for symbolic links and lists them on stdout,
often <br>
revealing flaws in the filesystem tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each link is output with a
classification of relative, absolute, dangling, messy,
lengthy, or other_fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relative links are those
expressed as paths relative to the directory in which the
links reside, usually independent of the mount point of the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">absolute links are those given
as an absolute path from the root directory as indicated by
a leading slash (/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dangling links are those for
which the target of the link does not currently exist. This
commonly occurs for absolute links when a filesystem is
mounted at other than its cus&acirc; <br>
tomary mount point (such as when the normal root filesystem
is mounted at /mnt after booting from alternative
media).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">messy links are links which
contain unnecessary slashes or dots in the path. These are
cleaned up as well when -c is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lengthy links are links which
use &quot;../&quot; more than necessary in the path (eg.
/bin/vi -&gt; ../bin/vim) These are only detected when -s is
specified, and are only cleaned up when -c <br>
is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other_fs are those links whose
target currently resides on a different filesystem from
where symlinks was run (most useful with -r ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c convert absolute links (within the same filesystem) to
relative links. This permits links to maintain their
validity regardless of the mount point used for the
filesystem <br>
-- a desirable setup in most cases. This option also causes
any messy links to be cleaned up, and, if -s was also
specified, then lengthy links are also shortened. Links <br>
affected by -c are prefixed with changed in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d causes dangling links to be
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o fix links on other
filesystems encountered while recursing. Normally, other
filesystems encountered are not modified by symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r recursively operate on
subdirectories within the same filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s causes lengthy links to be
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t is used to test for what
symlinks would do if -c were specified, but without really
changing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v show all symbolic links. By
default, relative links are not shown unless -v is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
symlinks does not recurse or change links across
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
symlinks has been written by Mark Lord
&lt;mlord@pobox.com&gt;, the original developer and
maintainer of the IDE Performance Package for linux, the
Linux IDE Driver subsystem, hdparm, <br>
and a current day libata hacker.</p>
