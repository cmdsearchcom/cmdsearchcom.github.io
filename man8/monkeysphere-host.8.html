<b>Monkeysphere</b> is a framework to leverage the OpenPGP web of trust for SSH
  and TLS key-based authentication.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>monkeysphere-host</b> stores and manages OpenPGP certificates for various
  services offered by the host.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most subcommands take a KEYID argument, which identifies (by OpenPGP key ID
  (e.g. 0xDEADBEEF) or full OpenPGP fingerprint) which certificate is to be
  operated upon. If only one certificate is currently managed by
  <b>monkeysphere-host</b>, the KEYID argument may be omitted, and
  <b>monkeysphere-host</b> will operate on it.

<b>monkeysphere-host</b> takes various subcommands:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>import-key FILE SCHEME://HOSTNAME[:PORT]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Import a PEM-encoded host secret key from file FILE. If
      FILE is `-', then the key will be imported from stdin. Only RSA keys are
      supported at the moment. SCHEME://HOSTNAME[:PORT] is used to specify the
      scheme (e.g. ssh or https), fully-qualified hostname (and port) used in
      the user ID of the new OpenPGP key (e.g. ssh://example.net or
      https://www.example.net). If PORT is not specified, then no port is added
      to the user ID, which means the default port for that service (e.g. 22 for
      ssh) is assumed. `i' may be used in place of `import-key'.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>show-keys [KEYID ...]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Output information about the OpenPGP certificate(s) for

      offline, to publish in case of compromise). If you explicitly tell it to

To enable users to verify your SSH host's key via the monkeysphere, an OpenPGP
  certificate must be made out of the host's RSA ssh key, and the certificate
  must be published to the Web of Trust. Certificate publication is not done by
  default. The first step is to import the host's ssh key into a
  monkeysphere-style OpenPGP certificate. This is done with the import-key
  command. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
# monkeysphere-host import-key /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key ssh://host.example.org
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On most systems, sshd's RSA secret key is stored at /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See PUBLISHING AND CERTIFYING MONKEYSPHERE SERVICE CERTIFICATES for how to make
  sure your users can verify the ssh service offered by your host once the key
  is imported into <b>monkeysphere-host</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SETUP_WEB_SERVER_CERTIFICATES"><a class="selflink" href="#SETUP_WEB_SERVER_CERTIFICATES">SETUP
  WEB SERVER CERTIFICATES</a></h1>
You can set up your HTTPS-capable web server so that your users can verify it
  via the monkeysphere, without changing your server's software at all. You just
  need access to a (PEM-encoded) version of the server's RSA secret key (most
  secret keys are already stored PEM-encoded). The first step is to import the
  web server's key into a monkeysphere-style OpenPGP certificate. This is done
  with the import-key command. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
# monkeysphere-host import-key /etc/ssl/private/host.example.net-key.pem
  https://host.example.net
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you don't know where the web server's key is stored on your machine, consult
  the configuration files for your web server. Debian-based systems using the
  `ssl-cert' packages often have a default self-signed certificate stored in
  `/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key' ; if you're using that key, your
  users are getting browser warnings about it. You can keep using the same key,
  but help them use the OpenPGP WoT to verify that it does belong to your web
  server by using something like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
# monkeysphere-host import-key /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
  https://$(hostname --fqdn)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you offer multiple HTTPS websites using the same secret key, you should add
  the additional website names with the `add-servicename' subcommand.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See PUBLISHING AND CERTIFYING MONKEYSPHERE SERVICE CERTIFICATES (the next
  section) for how to make sure your users can verify the https service offered
  by your host once the key is imported and any extra site names have been
  added. Note that you can add or remove additional servicenames at any time,
  but you'll need to certify any new ones separately.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PUBLISHING_AND_CERTIFYING_MONKEYSPHERE_SERVICE_CERTIFICATES"><a class="selflink" href="#PUBLISHING_AND_CERTIFYING_MONKEYSPHERE_SERVICE_CERTIFICATES">PUBLISHING
  AND CERTIFYING MONKEYSPHERE SERVICE CERTIFICATES</a></h1>
Once the host key has been imported, the corresponding certificate must be
  published to the Web of Trust so that users can retrieve the cert when
  connecting to the host. The host certificates are published to the keyserver
  with the publish-key command:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
$ monkeysphere-host publish-key --all
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order for users accessing the system to be able to identify the host's
  service via the monkeysphere, at least one person (e.g. a server admin) will
  need to sign the host's certificate. This is done using standard OpenPGP
  keysigning techniques. Usually: pull the host's OpenPGP certificate from the
  keyserver, verify and sign it, and then re-publish your signature. More than
  one person can certify any certificate. Please see
  http://web.monkeysphere.info/doc/host-keys/ for more information and details.
  Once an admin's signature is published, users accessing the host can use the
  certificate to validate the host's key without having to manually check the
  host key's fingerprint (in the case of ssh) or without seeing a nasty
  &quot;security warning&quot; in their browsers (in the case of https).

Note that <b>monkeysphere-host</b> currently caches a copy of all imported
  secret keys (stored in OpenPGP form for future manipulation) in
  /var/lib/monkeysphere/host/. Cleartext backups of files in this directory
  could expose secret key material if not handled sensitively.
