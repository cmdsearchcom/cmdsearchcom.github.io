<p>MONKEYSPHERE-HOST(8) System Commands
MONKEYSPHERE-HOST(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
monkeysphere-host - Monkeysphere host key administration
tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
monkeysphere-host subcommand [args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Monkeysphere is a framework to leverage the OpenPGP web of
trust for SSH and TLS key-based authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monkeysphere-host stores and
manages OpenPGP certificates for various services offered by
the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most subcommands take a KEYID
argument, which identifies (by OpenPGP key ID (e.g.
0xDEADBEEF) or full OpenPGP fingerprint) which certificate
is to be operated upon. If only one <br>
certificate is currently managed by monkeysphere-host, the
KEYID argument may be omitted, and monkeysphere-host will
operate on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBCOMMANDS <br>
monkeysphere-host takes various subcommands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import-key FILE
SCHEME://HOSTNAME[:PORT] <br>
Import a PEM-encoded host secret key from file FILE. If FILE
is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, then the key will be imported from
stdin. Only RSA keys are supported at the moment.
SCHEME://HOST&acirc; <br>
NAME[:PORT] is used to specify the scheme (e.g. ssh or
https), fully-qualified hostname (and port) used in the user
ID of the new OpenPGP key (e.g. ssh://example.net or <br>
https://www.example.net). If PORT is not specified, then no
port is added to the user ID, which means the default port
for that service (e.g. 22 for ssh) is assumed.
&lsquo;i&rsquo; <br>
may be used in place of &lsquo;import-key&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-keys [KEYID ...] <br>
Output information about the OpenPGP certificate(s) for
services offered by the host, including their KEYIDs. If no
KEYID is specified (or if the special string
&lsquo;--all&rsquo; <br>
is used), output information about all certificates managed
by monkeysphere-host. &lsquo;s&rsquo; may be used in place
of &lsquo;show-keys&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-expire EXPIRE [KEYID] <br>
Extend the validity of the OpenPGP certificate specified
until EXPIRE from the present. Expiration is specified as
with GnuPG (measured from today&rsquo;s date): <br>
0 = key does not expire <br>
&lt;n&gt; = key expires in n days <br>
&lt;n&gt;w = key expires in n weeks <br>
&lt;n&gt;m = key expires in n months <br>
&lt;n&gt;y = key expires in n years <br>
&lsquo;e&rsquo; may be used in place of
&lsquo;set-expire&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-servicename
SCHEME://HOSTNAME[:PORT] [KEYID] <br>
Add a service-specific user ID to the specified certificate.
For example, the operator of
&lsquo;https://example.net&rsquo; may wish to add an
additional servicename of <br>
&lsquo;https://www.example.net&rsquo; to the certificate
corresponding to the secret key used by the TLS-enabled web
server. &lsquo;add-name&rsquo; or &lsquo;n+&rsquo; may be
used in place of &lsquo;add-service&acirc; <br>
name&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revoke-servicename
SCHEME://HOSTNAME[:PORT] [KEYID] <br>
Revoke a service-specific user ID from the specified
certificate. &lsquo;revoke-name&rsquo; or &lsquo;n-&rsquo;
may be used in place of
&lsquo;revoke-servicename&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-revoker REVOKER_KEYID|FILE
[KEYID] <br>
Add a revoker to the specified OpenPGP certificate. The
revoker can be specified by their own REVOKER_KEYID (in
which case it will be loaded from an OpenPGP keyserver),
<br>
or by specifying a path to a file containing the
revoker&rsquo;s OpenPGP certificate, or by specifying
&lsquo;-&rsquo; to load from stdin. &lsquo;r+&rsquo; may be
be used in place of &lsquo;add-revoker&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revoke-key [KEYID] <br>
Generate (with the option to publish) a revocation
certificate for given OpenPGP certificate. If such a
certificate is published, the given key will be permanently
<br>
revoked, and will no longer be accepted by
monkeysphere-enabled clients. This subcommand will ask you a
series of questions, and then generate a key revocation
certifi&acirc; <br>
cate, sending it to stdout. You might want to store these
certificates safely offline, to publish in case of
compromise). If you explicitly tell it to publish the
revo&acirc; <br>
cation certificate immediately, it will send it to the
public keyservers. PUBLISH THESE CERTIFICATES ONLY IF YOU
ARE SURE THE CORRESPONDING KEY WILL NEVER BE RE-USED!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">publish-keys [KEYID ...] <br>
Publish the specified OpenPGP certificates to the public
keyservers. If the special string &lsquo;--all&rsquo; is
specified, all of the host&rsquo;s OpenPGP certificates will
be published. <br>
&lsquo;p&rsquo; may be used in place of
&lsquo;publish-keys&rsquo;. NOTE: that there is no way to
remove a key from the public keyservers once it is
published!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Show the monkeysphere version number. &lsquo;v&rsquo; may be
used in place of &lsquo;version&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Output a brief usage
summary. &lsquo;h&rsquo; or &lsquo;?&rsquo; may be used in
place of &lsquo;help&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diagnostics <br>
Review the state of the monkeysphere server host key and
report on suggested changes. Among other checks, this
includes making sure there is a valid host key, that the
<br>
key is not expired, that the sshd configuration points to
the right place, etc. &lsquo;d&rsquo; may be used in place
of &lsquo;diagnostics&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP SSH SERVER CERTIFICATES
<br>
To enable users to verify your SSH host&rsquo;s key via the
monkeysphere, an OpenPGP certificate must be made out of the
host&rsquo;s RSA ssh key, and the certificate must be
published to <br>
the Web of Trust. Certificate publication is not done by
default. The first step is to import the host&rsquo;s ssh
key into a monkeysphere-style OpenPGP certificate. This is
done <br>
with the import-key command. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># monkeysphere-host import-key
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key ssh://host.example.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On most systems, sshd&rsquo;s
RSA secret key is stored at /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See PUBLISHING AND CERTIFYING
MONKEYSPHERE SERVICE CERTIFICATES for how to make sure your
users can verify the ssh service offered by your host once
the key is imported into mon&acirc; <br>
keysphere-host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP WEB SERVER CERTIFICATES
<br>
You can set up your HTTPS-capable web server so that your
users can verify it via the monkeysphere, without changing
your server&rsquo;s software at all. You just need access to
a <br>
(PEM-encoded) version of the server&rsquo;s RSA secret key
(most secret keys are already stored PEM-encoded). The first
step is to import the web server&rsquo;s key into a
monkey&acirc; <br>
sphere-style OpenPGP certificate. This is done with the
import-key command. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># monkeysphere-host import-key
/etc/ssl/private/host.example.net-key.pem
https://host.example.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t know where
the web server&rsquo;s key is stored on your machine,
consult the configuration files for your web server.
Debian-based systems using the &lsquo;ssl-cert&rsquo;
packages <br>
often have a default self-signed certificate stored in
&lsquo;/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key&rsquo; ; if
you&rsquo;re using that key, your users are getting browser
warnings about it. You <br>
can keep using the same key, but help them use the OpenPGP
WoT to verify that it does belong to your web server by
using something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># monkeysphere-host import-key
/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key https://$(hostname
--fqdn)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you offer multiple HTTPS
websites using the same secret key, you should add the
additional website names with the
&lsquo;add-servicename&rsquo; subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See PUBLISHING AND CERTIFYING
MONKEYSPHERE SERVICE CERTIFICATES (the next section) for how
to make sure your users can verify the https service offered
by your host once the key <br>
is imported and any extra site names have been added. Note
that you can add or remove additional servicenames at any
time, but you&rsquo;ll need to certify any new ones
separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PUBLISHING AND CERTIFYING
MONKEYSPHERE SERVICE CERTIFICATES <br>
Once the host key has been imported, the corresponding
certificate must be published to the Web of Trust so that
users can retrieve the cert when connecting to the host. The
<br>
host certificates are published to the keyserver with the
publish-key command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ monkeysphere-host publish-key
--all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for users accessing the
system to be able to identify the host&rsquo;s service via
the monkeysphere, at least one person (e.g. a server admin)
will need to sign the host&rsquo;s <br>
certificate. This is done using standard OpenPGP keysigning
techniques. Usually: pull the host&rsquo;s OpenPGP
certificate from the keyserver, verify and sign it, and then
re-publish <br>
your signature. More than one person can certify any
certificate. Please see
http://web.monkeysphere.info/doc/host-keys/ for more
information and details. Once an admin&rsquo;s sig&acirc;
<br>
nature is published, users accessing the host can use the
certificate to validate the host&rsquo;s key without having
to manually check the host key&rsquo;s fingerprint (in the
case of ssh) <br>
or without seeing a nasty &quot;security warning&quot; in
their browsers (in the case of https).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Note that monkeysphere-host currently caches a copy of all
imported secret keys (stored in OpenPGP form for future
manipulation) in /var/lib/monkeysphere/host/. Cleartext
back&acirc; <br>
ups of files in this directory could expose secret key
material if not handled sensitively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables will override those
specified in the config file (defaults in parentheses):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONKEYSPHERE_LOG_LEVEL <br>
Set the log level. Can be SILENT, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE,
DEBUG, in increasing order of verbosity. (INFO)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONKEYSPHERE_KEYSERVER <br>
OpenPGP keyserver to use. (pool.sks-keyservers.net)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONKEYSPHERE_PROMPT <br>
If set to &lsquo;false&rsquo;, never prompt the user for
confirmation. (true)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere-host.conf <br>
System monkeysphere-host config file.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/monkeysphere/host_keys.pub.pgp
<br>
A world-readable copy of the host&rsquo;s OpenPGP
certificates in ASCII armored format. This includes the
certificates (including the public keys, servicename-based
User IDs, <br>
and most recent relevant self-signatures) corresponding to
every key used by Monkeysphere-enabled services on the
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/monkeysphere/host/ <br>
A locked directory (readable only by the superuser)
containing copies of all imported secret keys (this is the
host&rsquo;s GNUPGHOME directory).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere-host-x509-anchors.crt
or <br>
/etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere-x509-anchors.crt <br>
If monkeysphere-host is configured to query an hkps
keyserver for publish-keys, it will use the PEM-encoded
X.509 Certificate Authority certificates in this file to
vali&acirc; <br>
date any X.509 certificates used by the keyserver. If the
monkeysphere-host-x509 file is present, the
monkeysphere-x509 file will be ignored.</p>
