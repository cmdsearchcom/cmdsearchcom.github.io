Version 0.62, 04/14/2003.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b class="Nm" title="Nm">rinetd</b> redirects TCP connections from one IP
  address and port to another. rinetd is a single-process server which handles
  any number of connections to the address/port pairs specified in the file
  /etc/rinetd.conf. Since rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O,
  it is able to redirect a large number of connections without a severe impact
  on the machine. This makes it practical to run TCP services on machines inside
  an IP masquerading firewall. rinetd does not redirect FTP, because FTP
  requires more than one socket.
<div class="Pp"></div>
rinetd is typically launched at boot time, using the following syntax:
<div class="Pp"></div>
/usr/sbin/rinetd
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration file is found in the file /etc/rinetd.conf, unless another
  file is specified using the -c command line option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FORWARDING_RULES"><a class="selflink" href="#FORWARDING_RULES">FORWARDING
  RULES</a></h1>
Most entries in the configuration file are forwarding rules. The format of a
  forwarding rule is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
bindaddress bindport connectaddress connectport
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
206.125.69.81 80 10.1.1.2 80
<div class="Pp"></div>
Would redirect all connections to port 80 of the &quot;real&quot; IP address
  206.125.69.81, which could be a virtual interface, through rinetd to port 80
  of the address 10.1.1.2, which would typically be a machine on the inside of a
  firewall which has no direct routing to the outside world.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although responding on individual interfaces rather than on all interfaces is
  one of rinetd's primary features, sometimes it is preferable to respond on all
  IP addresses that belong to the server. In this situation, the special IP
  address 0.0.0.0 can be used. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
0.0.0.0 23 10.1.1.2 23
<div class="Pp"></div>
Would redirect all connections to port 23, for all IP addresses assigned to the
  server. This is the default behavior for most other programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Service names can be specified instead of port numbers. On most systems, service
  names are defined in the file /etc/services.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both IP addresses and hostnames are accepted for bindaddress and connectaddress.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ALLOW_AND_DENY_RULES"><a class="selflink" href="#ALLOW_AND_DENY_RULES">ALLOW
  AND DENY RULES</a></h1>
Configuration files can also contain allow and deny rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Allow rules which appear before the first forwarding rule are applied globally:
  if at least one global allow rule exists, and the address of a new connection
  does not satisfy at least one of the global allow rules, that connection is
  immediately rejected, regardless of any other rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Allow rules which appear after a specific forwarding rule apply to that
  forwarding rule only. If at least one allow rule exists for a particular
  forwarding rule, and the address of a new connection does not satisfy at least
  one of the allow rules for that forwarding rule, that connection is
  immediately rejected, regardless of any other rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deny rules which appear before the first forwarding rule are applied globally:
  if the address of a new connection satisfies any of the global allow rules,
  that connection is immediately rejected, regardless of any other rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deny rules which appear after a specific forwarding rule apply to that
  forwarding rule only. If the address of a new connection satisfies any of the
  deny rules for that forwarding rule, that connection is immediately rejected,
  regardless of any other rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of an allow rule is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
allow pattern
<div class="Pp"></div>
Patterns can contain the following characters: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, .
  (period), ?, and *. The ? wildcard matches any one character. The * wildcard
  matches any number of characters, including zero.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
allow 206.125.69.*
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allow rule matches all IP addresses in the 206.125.69 class C domain.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Host names are NOT permitted in allow and deny rules. The performance cost of
  looking up IP addresses to find their corresponding names is prohibitive.
  Since rinetd is a single process server, all other connections would be forced
  to pause during the address lookup.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#LOGGING">LOGGING</a></h1>
rinetd is able to produce a log file in either of two formats: tab-delimited and
  web server-style &quot;common log format.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, rinetd does not produce a log file. To activate logging, add the
  following line to the configuration file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
logfile log-file-location
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example: logfile /var/log/rinetd.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, rinetd logs in a simple tab-delimited format containing the
  following information:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Date and time
<div class="Pp"></div>
Client address
<div class="Pp"></div>
Listening host
<div class="Pp"></div>
Listening port
<div class="Pp"></div>
Forwarded-to host
<div class="Pp"></div>
Forwarded-to port
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bytes received from client
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bytes sent to client
<div class="Pp"></div>
Result message
<div class="Pp"></div>
To activate web server-style &quot;common log format&quot; logging, add the
  following line to the configuration file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
logcommon
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS">COMMAND
  LINE OPTIONS</a></h1>
The -c command line option is used to specify an alternate configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -h command line option produces a short help message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -v command line option displays the version number.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REINITIALIZING_RINETD"><a class="selflink" href="#REINITIALIZING_RINETD">REINITIALIZING
  RINETD</a></h1>
The kill -1 signal (SIGHUP) can be used to cause rinetd to reload its
  configuration file without interrupting existing connections. Under
  Linux&#x2122; the process id is saved in the file <i>/var/run/rinetd.pid</i>
  to facilitate the kill -HUP. An alternate filename can be provided by using
  the &lt;code&gt;pidlogfile&lt;/code&gt; configuration file option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
rinetd redirects TCP connections only. There is no support for UDP. rinetd only
  redirects protocols which use a single TCP socket. This rules out FTP.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The server redirected to is not able to identify the host the client really came
  from. This cannot be corrected; however, the log produced by rinetd provides a
  way to obtain this information. Under Unix, Sockets would theoretically lose
  data when closed with SO_LINGER turned off, but in Linux this is not the case
  (kernel source comments support this belief on my part). On non-Linux Unix
  platforms, alternate code which uses a different trick to work around blocking
  close() is provided, but this code is untested. The logging is inadequate. The
  duration of each connection should be logged.
