<p>RINETD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
RINETD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rinetd &acirc; internet &acirc;redirection server&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/rinetd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
Version 0.62, 04/14/2003.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and
port to another. rinetd is a single-process server which
handles any number of connections to the address/port pairs
speci&acirc; <br>
fied in the file /etc/rinetd.conf. Since rinetd runs as a
single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to redirect
a large number of connections without a severe impact on the
<br>
machine. This makes it practical to run TCP services on
machines inside an IP masquerading firewall. rinetd does not
redirect FTP, because FTP requires more than one socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rinetd is typically launched at
boot time, using the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/sbin/rinetd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file is found
in the file /etc/rinetd.conf, unless another file is
specified using the -c command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORWARDING RULES <br>
Most entries in the configuration file are forwarding rules.
The format of a forwarding rule is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindaddress bindport
connectaddress connectport</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">206.125.69.81 80 10.1.1.2 80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Would redirect all connections
to port 80 of the &quot;real&quot; IP address 206.125.69.81,
which could be a virtual interface, through rinetd to port
80 of the address 10.1.1.2, which would <br>
typically be a machine on the inside of a firewall which has
no direct routing to the outside world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although responding on
individual interfaces rather than on all interfaces is one
of rinetd&rsquo;s primary features, sometimes it is
preferable to respond on all IP addresses that <br>
belong to the server. In this situation, the special IP
address 0.0.0.0 can be used. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0.0.0.0 23 10.1.1.2 23</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Would redirect all connections
to port 23, for all IP addresses assigned to the server.
This is the default behavior for most other programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Service names can be specified
instead of port numbers. On most systems, service names are
defined in the file /etc/services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both IP addresses and hostnames
are accepted for bindaddress and connectaddress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALLOW AND DENY RULES <br>
Configuration files can also contain allow and deny
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allow rules which appear before
the first forwarding rule are applied globally: if at least
one global allow rule exists, and the address of a new
connection does not satisfy at <br>
least one of the global allow rules, that connection is
immediately rejected, regardless of any other rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allow rules which appear after a
specific forwarding rule apply to that forwarding rule only.
If at least one allow rule exists for a particular
forwarding rule, and the address of <br>
a new connection does not satisfy at least one of the allow
rules for that forwarding rule, that connection is
immediately rejected, regardless of any other rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deny rules which appear before
the first forwarding rule are applied globally: if the
address of a new connection satisfies any of the global
allow rules, that connection is imme&acirc; <br>
diately rejected, regardless of any other rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deny rules which appear after a
specific forwarding rule apply to that forwarding rule only.
If the address of a new connection satisfies any of the deny
rules for that forwarding <br>
rule, that connection is immediately rejected, regardless of
any other rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of an allow rule is
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patterns can contain the
following characters: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, .
(period), ?, and *. The ? wildcard matches any one
character. The * wildcard matches any number of <br>
characters, including zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow 206.125.69.*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allow rule matches all IP
addresses in the 206.125.69 class C domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host names are NOT permitted in
allow and deny rules. The performance cost of looking up IP
addresses to find their corresponding names is prohibitive.
Since rinetd is a single <br>
process server, all other connections would be forced to
pause during the address lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
rinetd is able to produce a log file in either of two
formats: tab-delimited and web server-style &quot;common log
format.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, rinetd does not
produce a log file. To activate logging, add the following
line to the configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logfile log-file-location</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: logfile
/var/log/rinetd.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, rinetd logs in a
simple tab-delimited format containing the following
information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Date and time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listening host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listening port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forwarded-to host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forwarded-to port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bytes received from client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bytes sent to client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Result message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To activate web server-style
&quot;common log format&quot; logging, add the following
line to the configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logcommon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The -c command line option is used to specify an alternate
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h command line option
produces a short help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v command line option
displays the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REINITIALIZING RINETD <br>
The kill -1 signal (SIGHUP) can be used to cause rinetd to
reload its configuration file without interrupting existing
connections. Under Linux&acirc;&cent; the process id is
saved in the <br>
file /var/run/rinetd.pid to facilitate the kill -HUP. An
alternate filename can be provided by using the
&lt;code&gt;pidlogfile&lt;/code&gt; configuration file
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
rinetd redirects TCP connections only. There is no support
for UDP. rinetd only redirects protocols which use a single
TCP socket. This rules out FTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The server redirected to is not able to identify the host
the client really came from. This cannot be corrected;
however, the log produced by rinetd provides a way to obtain
this <br>
information. Under Unix, Sockets would theoretically lose
data when closed with SO_LINGER turned off, but in Linux
this is not the case (kernel source comments support this
belief <br>
on my part). On non-Linux Unix platforms, alternate code
which uses a different trick to work around blocking close()
is provided, but this code is untested. The logging is
inade&acirc; <br>
quate. The duration of each connection should be logged.</p>
