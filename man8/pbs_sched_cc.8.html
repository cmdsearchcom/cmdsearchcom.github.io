<p>pbs_sched(8B) PBS pbs_sched(8B)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbs_sched_cc - pbs C scheduler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pbs_sched [-a alarm] [-d home] [-L logfile] [-p file] [-S
port] [-R port] [-c file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pbs_sched program runs in conjunction with the PBS
server. It queries the server about the state of PBS and
communicates with pbs_resmon to get information about the
status <br>
of running jobs, memory available etc. It then makes
decisions as to what jobs to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbs_sched must be executed with
root permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a alarm This specifies the time in seconds to wait for a
schedule run to finish. If a script takes too long to
finish, an alarm signal is sent, and the scheduler is <br>
restarted. If a core file does not exist in the current
directory, abort() is called and a core file is generated.
The default for alarm is 180 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d home This specifies the PBS
home directory, PBS_HOME. The current working directory of
the scheduler is PBS_HOME/sched_priv. If this option is not
given, PBS_HOME <br>
defaults to $PBS_SERVER_HOME as defined during the PBS build
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L logfile Specifies an absolute
path name of the file to use as the log file. If not
specified, the scheduler will open a file named for the
current date in the <br>
PBS_HOME/sched_logs directory (see the -d option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file This specifies the
&quot;print&quot; file. Any output from the C code which is
written to standard out or standard error will be written to
this file. If this option is <br>
not given, the file used will be
PBS_HOME/sched_priv/sched_out . See the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S port This specifies the port
to use. If this option is not given, the default port for
the PBS scheduler is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R port This specifies the
resource monitor port to use. If this option is not given,
the default port for the PBS mom is used. NOTE: this option
only makes the mom port <br>
available to the scheduler writer. It doesn&rsquo;t force
them to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file Specify a configuration
file, see description below. If this is a relative file name
it will be relative to PBS_HOME/sched_priv, see the -d
option. If the -c <br>
option is not supplied, pbs_sched will not attempt to open a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options that specify file
names may be absolute or relative. If they are relative,
their root directory will be PBS_HOME/sched_priv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
This version of the scheduler requires knowledge of the C
language and the PBS API. Source code is provided for a main
program for the scheduler. The site must supply the heart
<br>
of the program. When invoked, the main program performs
general initialization and housekeeping chores. Then a
locally supplied function, schedinit() is called to perform
site <br>
specific initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the main loop, a locally
supplied function, schedule() is called to make the
scheduling decisions and perform any required actions.
Information about jobs and queues is <br>
obtained from the Server through the standard PBS API as
found in libifl.a. Information about the execution host(s)
is obtained from the Resource Monitor. Routines to
communi&acirc; <br>
cate with the Resource Monitor are found in libnet.a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the processing takes more
than the allotted time, the scheduler will restart itself.
The default amount of time is three minutes. This can be
changed with the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On receipt of a SIGHUP signal,
the scheduler will close and reopen its log file and reread
its configuration file (if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
A configuration file may be specified with the -c option.
This file may be used to specify the hosts (servers) which
are allowed to connect to pbs_sched. The hosts are
speci&acirc; <br>
fied in the configuration file in a manor identical to that
used in pbs_mom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clienthost <br>
One or more servers, one per line, may be specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$clienthost hostname +.IP
restricted Allows connections from non-priviledged ports on
the named hosts. Typically only used with Mac OSX:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$restricted hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two host names are always
allowed to connection to pbs_sched, &quot;localhost&quot;
and the name returned to pbs_sched by the system call
gethostname(). These names need not be <br>
specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file must be
&quot;secure&quot;. It must be owned by a user id and group
id less than 10 and not be world writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PBS_SERVER_HOME/sched_priv <br>
the default directory for configuration files, typically
(/usr/spool/pbs)/sched_priv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal Handling <br>
A C based scheduler will handle the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP The server will close and
reopen its log file and reread the config file if one
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGALRM <br>
If the site supplied scheduling module exceeds the time
limit, the Alarm will cause the scheduler to attempt to core
dump and restart itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT and SIGTERM <br>
Will result in an orderly shutdown of the scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other signals have the
default action installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Upon normal termination, an exit status of zero is
returned.</p>
