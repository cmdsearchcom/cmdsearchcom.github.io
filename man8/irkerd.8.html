irkerd is a specialized write-only IRC client intended to be used for shipping
  notification messages to IRC channels. The use case in mind when it was
  designed was broadcasting notifications from commit hooks in version-control
  systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main advantage of relaying through this daemon over individual scripted
  sends from applications is that it can maintain connection state for multiple
  channels, rather than producing obnoxious join/leave channel spam on every
  message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
irkerd is a socket server that listens on for UDP or TCP packets on port 6659
  for textual request lines containing JSON objects and terminated by a newline.
  Each JSON object must have two members: &quot;to&quot; specifying a
  destination or destination list, and &quot;privmsg&quot; specifying the
  message text. Examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/git-ciabot&quot;, &quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Hello, world!&quot;}
{&quot;to&quot;:[&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/#git-ciabot&quot;,&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/#gpsd&quot;],&quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Multichannel test&quot;}
{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;irc://chat.hypothetical.net:6668/git-ciabot&quot;, &quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Hello, world!&quot;}
{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;ircs://chat.hypothetical.net/git-private?key=topsecret&quot;, &quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Keyed channel test&quot;}
{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;ircs://:topsecret@chat.example.net/git-private&quot;, &quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Password-protected server test&quot;}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the channel part of the URL does not have one of the prefix characters
  &#x201C;#&#x201D;, &#x201C;&amp;&#x201D;, or &#x201C;+&#x201D;, a
  &#x201C;#&#x201D; will be prepended to it before shipping - <i>unless</i> the
  channel part has the suffix &quot;,isnick&quot; (which is unconditionally
  removed).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The host part of the URL may have a port-number suffix separated by a colon, as
  shown in the third example; otherwise irkerd sends plaintext messages to the
  default 6667 IRC port of each server, and SSL/TLS messages to 6697.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The password for password-protected servers can be set using the usual
  &#x201C;[{username}:{password}@]{host}:{port}&#x201D; defined in RFC 3986, as
  shown in the fifth example. Non-empty URL usernames override the default
  &#x201C;irker&#x201D; username.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the &#x201C;to&#x201D; URL uses the &#x201C;ircs&#x201D; scheme (as shown
  in the fourth and fifth examples), the connection to the IRC server is made
  via SSL/TLS (vs. a plaintext connection with the &#x201C;irc&#x201D; scheme).
  To connect via SSL/TLS with Python 2.x, you need to explicitly declare the
  certificate authority file used to verify server certificates. For example,
  &#x201C;-c /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt&#x201D;. In Python 3.2 and
  later, you can still set this option to declare a custom CA file, but irkerd;
  if you don't set it irkerd will use OpenSSL's default file (using Python's
  &#x201C;ssl.SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths&#x201D;). In Python 3.2 and
  later, &#x201C;ssl.match_hostname&#x201D; is used to ensure the server
  certificate belongs to the intended host, as well as being signed by a trusted
  CA.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To join password-protected (mode +k) channels, the channel part of the URL may
  be followed with a query-string indicating the channel key, of the form
  &#x201C;?secret&#x201D; or &#x201C;?key=secret&#x201D;, where
  &#x201C;secret&#x201D; is the channel key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An empty message is legal and will cause irkerd to join or maintain a connection
  to the target channels without actually emitting a message. This may be useful
  for advertising that an instance is up and running, or for joining a channel
  to log its traffic.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
irkerd takes the following options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
-d
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes a following value, setting the debugging
  level from it; possible values are 'critical', 'error', 'warning', 'info',
  'debug'. This option will generally only be of interest to developers, as the
  logs are designed to help trace irkerd's internal state. These tracing logs
  are independent of the traffic logs controlled by &#x201C;-l&#x201D;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Logging will be to standard error (if irkerd is running in the foreground) or to
  &#x201C;/dev/syslog&#x201D; with facility &quot;daemon&quot; (if irkerd is
  running in the background). The background-ness of irkerd is determined by
  comparing the process group id with the process group associated with the
  terminal attached to stdout (with non-matches for background processes). We
  assume you aren't running irkerd in Windows or another OS that doesn't support
  &#x201C;os.getpgrp&#x201D; or &#x201C;tcgetpgrp&#x201D;. We assume that if
  stdout is attached to a TTY associated with the same process group as irkerd,
  you do intend to log to stderr and not syslog.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-e
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes a following filename in pem format and
  uses it to authenticate to the IRC server. You must be connecting to the IRC
  server over SSL for this to function properly. This is commonly known as
  &#x201C;CertFP.&#x201D;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-e
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes a following filename in pem format and
  uses it to authenticate to the IRC server. You must be connecting to the IRC
  server over SSL for this to function properly. This is commonly known as
  &#x201C;CertFP.&#x201D;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-l
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes a following filename, logs traffic to
  that file. Each log line consists of three |-separated fields; a numeric
  timestamp in Unix time, the FQDN of the sending server, and the message
  data.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-H
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes a following hostname, and binds to that
  address when listening for messages. irkerd binds to localhost by default, but
  you may want to use your host's public address to listen on a local network.
  Listening on a public interface is not recommended, as it makes spamming IRC
  channels very easy.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-n
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes a following value, setting the nick to
  be used. If the nick contains a numeric format element (such as %03d) it is
  used to generate suffixed fallback names in the event of a nick
  collision.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-p
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes a following value, setting a nickserv
  password to be used. If given, this password is shipped to authenticate the
  nick on receipt of a welcome message.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-i
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Immediate mode, to be run in foreground. Takes
  a following following value interpreted as a channel URL. May take a second
  argument giving a message string; if the second argument is absent the message
  is read from standard input (and may contain newlines). Sends the message,
  then quits.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-V
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write the program version to stdout and
  terminate.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-h
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print usage instructions and terminate.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
Requests via UDP optimizes for lowest latency and network load by avoiding TCP
  connection setup time; the cost is that delivery is not reliable in the face
  of packet loss.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An irkerd instance with a publicly-accessible request socket could complicate
  blocking of IRC spam by making it easy for spammers to submit while hiding
  their IP addresses; the better way to deploy, then, is on places like
  project-hosting sites where the irkerd socket can be visible from commit-hook
  code but not exposed to the outside world. Priming your firewall with
  blocklists of IP addresses known to spew spam is always a good idea.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The absence of any option to set the service port is deliberate. If you think
  you need to do that, you have a problem better solved at your firewall.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IRC has a message length limit of 510 bytes; generate your privmsg attribute
  values with appropriate care.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IRC ignores any text after an embedded newline. Be aware that irkerd will turn
  payload strings with embedded newlines into multiple IRC sends to avoid having
  message data discarded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to a bug in Python URL parsing, IRC urls with both a # and a key part may
  fail unexpectedly. The workaround is to remove the #.
