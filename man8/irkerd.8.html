<p>IRKERD(8) Commands IRKERD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
irkerd - relay for shipping notifications to IRC servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
irkerd [-c ca-file] [-d debuglevel] [-e cert-file] [-l
logfile] [-H host] [-n nick] [-p password] [-i IRC-URL] [-V]
[-h] [message text]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
irkerd is a specialized write-only IRC client intended to be
used for shipping notification messages to IRC channels. The
use case in mind when it was designed was broadcasting <br>
notifications from commit hooks in version-control
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main advantage of relaying
through this daemon over individual scripted sends from
applications is that it can maintain connection state for
multiple channels, rather than <br>
producing obnoxious join/leave channel spam on every
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">irkerd is a socket server that
listens on for UDP or TCP packets on port 6659 for textual
request lines containing JSON objects and terminated by a
newline. Each JSON object must <br>
have two members: &quot;to&quot; specifying a destination or
destination list, and &quot;privmsg&quot; specifying the
message text. Examples:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/git-ciabot&quot;,
&quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Hello, world!&quot;} <br>

{&quot;to&quot;:[&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/#git-ciabot&quot;,&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/#gpsd&quot;],&quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Multichannel
test&quot;} <br>

{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;irc://chat.hypothetical.net:6668/git-ciabot&quot;,
&quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Hello, world!&quot;} <br>

{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;ircs://chat.hypothetical.net/git-private?key=topsecret&quot;,
&quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Keyed channel test&quot;} <br>

{&quot;to&quot;:&quot;ircs://:topsecret@chat.example.net/git-private&quot;,
&quot;privmsg&quot;:&quot;Password-protected server
test&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the channel part of the URL
does not have one of the prefix characters &acirc;#&acirc;,
&acirc;&amp;&acirc;, or &acirc;+&acirc;, a &acirc;#&acirc;
will be prepended to it before shipping - unless the channel
part has the suffix <br>
&quot;,isnick&quot; (which is unconditionally removed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host part of the URL may
have a port-number suffix separated by a colon, as shown in
the third example; otherwise irkerd sends plaintext messages
to the default 6667 IRC port <br>
of each server, and SSL/TLS messages to 6697.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The password for
password-protected servers can be set using the usual
&acirc;[{username}:{password}@]{host}:{port}&acirc; defined
in RFC 3986, as shown in the fifth example. Non-empty URL
<br>
usernames override the default &acirc;irker&acirc;
username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &acirc;to&acirc; URL
uses the &acirc;ircs&acirc; scheme (as shown in the fourth
and fifth examples), the connection to the IRC server is
made via SSL/TLS (vs. a plaintext connection with the <br>
&acirc;irc&acirc; scheme). To connect via SSL/TLS with
Python 2.x, you need to explicitly declare the certificate
authority file used to verify server certificates. For
example, &acirc;-c <br>
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt&acirc;. In Python 3.2 and
later, you can still set this option to declare a custom CA
file, but irkerd; if you don&rsquo;t set it irkerd will use
OpenSSL&rsquo;s <br>
default file (using Python&rsquo;s
&acirc;ssl.SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths&acirc;). In
Python 3.2 and later, &acirc;ssl.match_hostname&acirc; is
used to ensure the server certificate belongs to the <br>
intended host, as well as being signed by a trusted CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To join password-protected (mode
+k) channels, the channel part of the URL may be followed
with a query-string indicating the channel key, of the form
&acirc;?secret&acirc; or &acirc;?key=secret&acirc;, <br>
where &acirc;secret&acirc; is the channel key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty message is legal and
will cause irkerd to join or maintain a connection to the
target channels without actually emitting a message. This
may be useful for advertising <br>
that an instance is up and running, or for joining a channel
to log its traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
irkerd takes the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
Takes a following value, setting the debugging level from
it; possible values are &rsquo;critical&rsquo;,
&rsquo;error&rsquo;, &rsquo;warning&rsquo;,
&rsquo;info&rsquo;, &rsquo;debug&rsquo;. This option will
generally only be of <br>
interest to developers, as the logs are designed to help
trace irkerd&rsquo;s internal state. These tracing logs are
independent of the traffic logs controlled by
&acirc;-l&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging will be to standard
error (if irkerd is running in the foreground) or to
&acirc;/dev/syslog&acirc; with facility &quot;daemon&quot;
(if irkerd is running in the background). The <br>
background-ness of irkerd is determined by comparing the
process group id with the process group associated with the
terminal attached to stdout (with non-matches for <br>
background processes). We assume you aren&rsquo;t running
irkerd in Windows or another OS that doesn&rsquo;t support
&acirc;os.getpgrp&acirc; or &acirc;tcgetpgrp&acirc;. We
assume that if stdout is attached to <br>
a TTY associated with the same process group as irkerd, you
do intend to log to stderr and not syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Takes a following filename in pem format and uses it to
authenticate to the IRC server. You must be connecting to
the IRC server over SSL for this to function properly. This
<br>
is commonly known as &acirc;CertFP.&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Takes a following filename in pem format and uses it to
authenticate to the IRC server. You must be connecting to
the IRC server over SSL for this to function properly. This
<br>
is commonly known as &acirc;CertFP.&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Takes a following filename, logs traffic to that file. Each
log line consists of three |-separated fields; a numeric
timestamp in Unix time, the FQDN of the sending server, <br>
and the message data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H <br>
Takes a following hostname, and binds to that address when
listening for messages. irkerd binds to localhost by
default, but you may want to use your host&rsquo;s public
address <br>
to listen on a local network. Listening on a public
interface is not recommended, as it makes spamming IRC
channels very easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Takes a following value, setting the nick to be used. If the
nick contains a numeric format element (such as %03d) it is
used to generate suffixed fallback names in the event <br>
of a nick collision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
Takes a following value, setting a nickserv password to be
used. If given, this password is shipped to authenticate the
nick on receipt of a welcome message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Immediate mode, to be run in foreground. Takes a following
following value interpreted as a channel URL. May take a
second argument giving a message string; if the second <br>
argument is absent the message is read from standard input
(and may contain newlines). Sends the message, then
quits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Write the program version to stdout and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Print usage instructions and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Requests via UDP optimizes for lowest latency and network
load by avoiding TCP connection setup time; the cost is that
delivery is not reliable in the face of packet loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An irkerd instance with a
publicly-accessible request socket could complicate blocking
of IRC spam by making it easy for spammers to submit while
hiding their IP addresses; the <br>
better way to deploy, then, is on places like
project-hosting sites where the irkerd socket can be visible
from commit-hook code but not exposed to the outside world.
Priming <br>
your firewall with blocklists of IP addresses known to spew
spam is always a good idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The absence of any option to set
the service port is deliberate. If you think you need to do
that, you have a problem better solved at your firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRC has a message length limit
of 510 bytes; generate your privmsg attribute values with
appropriate care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRC ignores any text after an
embedded newline. Be aware that irkerd will turn payload
strings with embedded newlines into multiple IRC sends to
avoid having message data <br>
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to a bug in Python URL
parsing, IRC urls with both a # and a key part may fail
unexpectedly. The workaround is to remove the #.</p>
