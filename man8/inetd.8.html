<b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> listens for connections on certain internet
  sockets. When a connection is found on one of its sockets, it decides what
  service the socket corresponds to, and invokes a program to service the
  request. After the program is finished, it continues to listen on the socket
  (except in some cases which will be described below). Essentially,
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> allows running one daemon to invoke several
  others, reducing load on the system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">Prevents <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> from laundering
      the environment. Without this option a selection of potentially harmful
      environment variables, including <i class="Pa" title="Pa">PATH</i>, will

  <dd class="It-tag">Turns on libwrap connection logging and access control.
      Internal services cannot be wrapped. When enabled,
      <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/usr/sbin/tcpd</i> is silently not executed even

    <var class="Ar" title="Ar">length</var></dt>

    <var class="Ar" title="Ar">rate</var></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the maximum number of times a service can be
      invoked in one minute; the default is 256. If a service exceeds this
      limit, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> will log the problem and stop
      servicing requests for the specific service for ten minutes. See also the
      wait/nowait configuration fields below.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Upon execution, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> reads its configuration
  information from a configuration file which, by default, is
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/inetd.conf</i>. There must be an entry for each
  field of the configuration file, with entries for each field separated by a
  tab or a space. Comments are denoted by a &#x201C;#&#x201D; at the beginning
  of a line. The fields of the configuration file are as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre class="Li">
service name 
socket type 
protocol[,sndbuf=size][,rcvbuf=size] 
wait/nowait[.max] 
user[.group] or user[:group] 
server program 
server program arguments
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To specify a Sun-RPC based service, the entry would contain these fields.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre class="Li">
service name/version 
socket type 
rpc/protocol[,sndbuf=size][,rcvbuf=size] 
wait/nowait[.max] 
user[.group] or user[:group] 
server program 
server program arguments
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For internet services, the first field of the line may also have a host address
  specifier prefixed to it, separated from the service name by a colon. If this
  is done, the string before the colon in the first field indicates what local
  address <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> should use when listening for that
  service. Multiple local addresses can be specified on the same line, separated
  by commas. Numeric IP addresses in dotted-quad notation can be used as well as
  symbolic hostnames. Symbolic hostnames are looked up using
  <b class="Fn" title="Fn">getaddrinfo</b>(). If a hostname has multiple address
  mappings, inetd creates a socket to listen on each address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The single character &#x201C;*&#x201D; indicates
  <code class="Dv" title="Dv">INADDR_ANY</code>, meaning &#x201C;all local
  addresses&#x201D;. To avoid repeating an address that occurs frequently, a
  line with a host address specifier and colon, but no further fields, causes
  the host address specifier to be remembered and used for all further lines
  with no explicit host specifier (until another such line or the end of the
  file). A line
<div class="D1"><code class="Li">*:</code></div>
is implicitly provided at the top of the file; thus, traditional configuration
  files (which have no host address specifiers) will be interpreted in the
  traditional manner, with all services listened for on all local addresses. If
  the protocol is &#x201C;unix&#x201D;, this value is ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">service name</i> entry is the name of a valid
  service in the file <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/services</i> or a port
  number. For &#x201C;internal&#x201D; services (discussed below), the service
  name <i class="Em" title="Em">must</i> be the official name of the service
  (that is, the first entry in <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/services</i>). When
  used to specify a Sun-RPC based service, this field is a valid RPC service
  name in the file <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/rpc</i>. The part on the right
  of the &#x201C;/&#x201D; is the RPC version number. This can simply be a
  single numeric argument or a range of versions. A range is bounded by the low
  version to the high version - &#x201C;rusers/1-3&#x201D;. For
  <span class="Ux">UNIX</span>-domain sockets this field specifies the path name
  of the socket.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">socket type</i> should be one of
  &#x201C;stream&#x201D;, &#x201C;dgram&#x201D;, &#x201C;raw&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;rdm&#x201D;, or &#x201C;seqpacket&#x201D;, depending on whether the
  socket is a stream, datagram, raw, reliably delivered message, or sequenced
  packet socket.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">protocol</i> must be a valid protocol as given in
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/protocols or</i> &#x201C;unix&#x201D;. Examples
  might be &#x201C;tcp&#x201D; or &#x201C;udp&#x201D;. RPC based services are
  specified with the &#x201C;rpc/tcp&#x201D; or &#x201C;rpc/udp&#x201D; service
  type. &#x201C;tcp&#x201D; and &#x201C;udp&#x201D; will be recognized as
  &#x201C;TCP or UDP over default IP version&#x201D;. This is currently IPv4,
  but in the future it will be IPv6. If you need to specify IPv4 or IPv6
  explicitly, use something like &#x201C;tcp4&#x201D; or &#x201C;udp6&#x201D;. A
  <i class="Em" title="Em">protocol</i> of &#x201C;unix&#x201D; is used to
  specify a socket in the <span class="Ux">UNIX</span>-domain.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the protocol, the configuration file may specify the send and
  receive socket buffer sizes for the listening socket. This is especially
  useful for TCP as the window scale factor, which is based on the receive
  socket buffer size, is advertised when the connection handshake occurs, thus
  the socket buffer size for the server must be set on the listen socket. By
  increasing the socket buffer sizes, better TCP performance may be realized in
  some situations. The socket buffer sizes are specified by appending their
  values to the protocol specification as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre class="Li">
tcp,rcvbuf=16384 
tcp,sndbuf=64k 
tcp,rcvbuf=64k,sndbuf=1m
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A literal value may be specified, or modified using &#x2018;k&#x2019; to
  indicate kilobytes or &#x2018;m&#x2019; to indicate megabytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">wait/nowait</i> entry is used to tell
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> if it should wait for the server program to
  return, or continue processing connections on the socket. If a datagram server
  connects to its peer, freeing the socket so <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b>
  can receive further messages on the socket, it is said to be a
  &#x201C;multi-threaded&#x201D; server, and should use the
  &#x201C;nowait&#x201D; entry. For datagram servers which process all incoming
  datagrams on a socket and eventually time out, the server is said to be
  &#x201C;single-threaded&#x201D; and should use a &#x201C;wait&#x201D; entry.
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">comsat(8)</a> (<a class="Xr" title="Xr">biff(1)</a>)
  and <a class="Xr" title="Xr">talkd(8)</a> are both examples of the latter type
  of datagram server. The optional &#x201C;max&#x201D; suffix (separated from
  &#x201C;wait&#x201D; or &#x201C;nowait&#x201D; by a dot) specifies the maximum
  number of times a service can be invoked in one minute; the default is 256. If
  a service exceeds this limit, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> will log the
  problem and stop servicing requests for the specific service for ten minutes.
  See also the <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-R</b> option above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stream servers are usually marked as &#x201C;nowait&#x201D; but if a single
  server process is to handle multiple connections, it may be marked as
  &#x201C;wait&#x201D;. The master socket will then be passed as fd 0 to the
  server, which will then need to accept the incoming connection. The server
  should eventually time out and exit when no more connections are active.
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> will continue to listen on the master
  socket for connections, so the server should not close it when it exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">user</i> entry should contain the user name of the
  user as whom the server should run. This allows for servers to be given less
  permission than root. An optional group name can be specified by appending a
  dot to the user name followed by the group name. This allows for servers to
  run with a different (primary) group ID than specified in the password file.
  If a group is specified and user is not root, the supplementary groups
  associated with that user will still be set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">server program</i> entry should contain the
  pathname of the program which is to be executed by
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> when a request is found on its socket. If
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> provides this service internally, this
  entry should be &#x201C;internal&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">server program arguments</i> should be just as
  arguments normally are, starting with argv[0], which is the name of the
  program. If the service is provided internally, the word
  &#x201C;internal&#x201D; should take the place of this entry.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> provides several &#x201C;trivial&#x201D;
  services internally by use of routines within itself. These services are
  &#x201C;echo&#x201D;, &#x201C;discard&#x201D;, &#x201C;chargen&#x201D;
  (character generator), &#x201C;daytime&#x201D; (human readable time), and
  &#x201C;time&#x201D; (machine readable time, in the form of the number of
  seconds since midnight, January 1, 1900). All of these services are TCP based.
  For details of these services, consult the appropriate RFC from the Network
  Information Center.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> rereads its configuration file when it
  receives a hangup signal, <code class="Dv" title="Dv">SIGHUP</code>. Services
  may be added, deleted or modified when the configuration file is reread.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="libwrap"><a class="selflink" href="#libwrap">libwrap</a></h2>
Support for TCP wrappers is included with <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> to
  provide built-in tcpd-like access control functionality. An external tcpd
  program is not needed. You do not need to change the
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/inetd.conf</i> server-program entry to enable
  this capability. <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> uses
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/hosts.allow</i> and
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/hosts.deny</i> for access control facility
  configurations, as described in <a class="Xr" title="Xr">hosts_access(5)</a>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IPv6_TCP/UDP_behavior"><a class="selflink" href="#IPv6_TCP/UDP_behavior">IPv6
  TCP/UDP behavior</a></h2>
If you wish to run a server for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, you'll need to run two
  separate processes for the same server program, specified as two separate
  lines in <i class="Pa" title="Pa">inetd.conf</i>, for &#x201C;tcp4&#x201D; and
  &#x201C;tcp6&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under various combinations of IPv4/v6 daemon settings,
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> will behave as follows:
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bl-compact">
  <li class="It-bullet">If you have only one server on &#x201C;tcp4&#x201D;,
      IPv4 traffic will be routed to the server. IPv6 traffic will not be
      accepted.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">If you have two servers on &#x201C;tcp4&#x201D; and
      &#x201C;tcp6&#x201D;, IPv4 traffic will be routed to the server on
      &#x201C;tcp4&#x201D;, and IPv6 traffic will go to server on
      &#x201C;tcp6&#x201D;.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">If you have only one server on &#x201C;tcp6&#x201D;,
      only IPv6 traffic will be routed to the server.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    The special &#x201C;tcp46&#x201D; parameter can be used for obsolete servers
      which require to receive IPv4 connections mapped in an IPv6 socket. Its
      usage is discouraged.</li>

The <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> command appeared in
  <span class="Ux">4.3BSD</span>. Support for Sun-RPC based services is modelled
  after that provided by SunOS 4.1. IPv6 support was added by the KAME project
  in 1999.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Marco d'Itri ported this code from OpenBSD in summer 2002 and added socket
  buffers tuning and libwrap support from the NetBSD source tree.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
On Linux systems, the daemon cannot reload its configuration and needs to be
  restarted when the host address for a service is changed between
  &#x201C;*&#x201D; and a specific address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Server programs used with &#x201C;dgram&#x201D; &#x201C;udp&#x201D;
  &#x201C;nowait&#x201D; must read from the network socket, or
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> will spawn processes until the maximum is
  reached.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Host address specifiers, while they make conceptual sense for RPC services, do
  not work entirely correctly. This is largely because the portmapper interface
  does not provide a way to register different ports for the same service on
  different local addresses. Provided you never have more than one entry for a
  given RPC service, everything should work correctly. (Note that default host
  address specifiers do apply to RPC lines with no explicit specifier.)</div>
