<p>INETD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual INETD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
inetd, inetd.conf &acirc; internet super-server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
inetd [-d] [-E] [-i] [-l] [-q length] [-R rate]
[configuration_file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
inetd listens for connections on certain internet sockets.
When a connection is found on one of its sockets, it decides
what service the socket corresponds to, and invokes a
pro&acirc; <br>
gram to service the request. After the program is finished,
it continues to listen on the socket (except in some cases
which will be described below). Essentially, inetd allows
<br>
running one daemon to invoke several others, reducing load
on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Turns on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Prevents inetd from
laundering the environment. Without this option a selection
of potentially harmful environment variables, including
PATH, will be removed and not <br>
inherited by services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Makes the program not
daemonize itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Turns on libwrap connection
logging and access control. Internal services cannot be
wrapped. When enabled, /usr/sbin/tcpd is silently not
executed even if present in <br>
/etc/inetd.conf and instead libwrap is called directly by
inetd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q length <br>
Specify the length of the listen(2) connections queue; the
default is 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R rate <br>
Specify the maximum number of times a service can be invoked
in one minute; the default is 256. If a service exceeds this
limit, inetd will log the problem and stop ser&acirc; <br>
vicing requests for the specific service for ten minutes.
See also the wait/nowait configuration fields below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon execution, inetd reads its
configuration information from a configuration file which,
by default, is /etc/inetd.conf. There must be an entry for
each field of the configura&acirc; <br>
tion file, with entries for each field separated by a tab or
a space. Comments are denoted by a &acirc;#&acirc; at the
beginning of a line. The fields of the configuration file
are as fol&acirc; <br>
lows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service name <br>
socket type <br>
protocol[,sndbuf=size][,rcvbuf=size] <br>
wait/nowait[.max] <br>
user[.group] or user[:group] <br>
server program <br>
server program arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify a Sun-RPC based
service, the entry would contain these fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service name/version <br>
socket type <br>
rpc/protocol[,sndbuf=size][,rcvbuf=size] <br>
wait/nowait[.max] <br>
user[.group] or user[:group] <br>
server program <br>
server program arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For internet services, the first
field of the line may also have a host address specifier
prefixed to it, separated from the service name by a colon.
If this is done, the string <br>
before the colon in the first field indicates what local
address inetd should use when listening for that service.
Multiple local addresses can be specified on the same line,
sep&acirc; <br>
arated by commas. Numeric IP addresses in dotted-quad
notation can be used as well as symbolic hostnames. Symbolic
hostnames are looked up using getaddrinfo(). If a hostname
has <br>
multiple address mappings, inetd creates a socket to listen
on each address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The single character
&acirc;*&acirc; indicates INADDR_ANY, meaning &acirc;all
local addresses&acirc;. To avoid repeating an address that
occurs frequently, a line with a host address specifier and
colon, <br>
but no further fields, causes the host address specifier to
be remembered and used for all further lines with no
explicit host specifier (until another such line or the end
of the <br>
file). A line <br>
*: <br>
is implicitly provided at the top of the file; thus,
traditional configuration files (which have no host address
specifiers) will be interpreted in the traditional manner,
with all <br>
services listened for on all local addresses. If the
protocol is &acirc;unix&acirc;, this value is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The service name entry is the
name of a valid service in the file /etc/services or a port
number. For &acirc;internal&acirc; services (discussed
below), the service name must be the official <br>
name of the service (that is, the first entry in
/etc/services). When used to specify a Sun-RPC based
service, this field is a valid RPC service name in the file
/etc/rpc. The <br>
part on the right of the &acirc;/&acirc; is the RPC version
number. This can simply be a single numeric argument or a
range of versions. A range is bounded by the low version to
the high <br>
version - &acirc;rusers/1-3&acirc;. For UNIX-domain sockets
this field specifies the path name of the socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The socket type should be one of
&acirc;stream&acirc;, &acirc;dgram&acirc;,
&acirc;raw&acirc;, &acirc;rdm&acirc;, or
&acirc;seqpacket&acirc;, depending on whether the socket is
a stream, datagram, raw, reliably delivered message, or <br>
sequenced packet socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol must be a valid
protocol as given in /etc/protocols or &acirc;unix&acirc;.
Examples might be &acirc;tcp&acirc; or &acirc;udp&acirc;.
RPC based services are specified with the
&acirc;rpc/tcp&acirc; or &acirc;rpc/udp&acirc; <br>
service type. &acirc;tcp&acirc; and &acirc;udp&acirc; will
be recognized as &acirc;TCP or UDP over default IP
version&acirc;. This is currently IPv4, but in the future it
will be IPv6. If you need to specify IPv4 <br>
or IPv6 explicitly, use something like &acirc;tcp4&acirc; or
&acirc;udp6&acirc;. A protocol of &acirc;unix&acirc; is used
to specify a socket in the UNIX-domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the protocol, the
configuration file may specify the send and receive socket
buffer sizes for the listening socket. This is especially
useful for TCP as the window <br>
scale factor, which is based on the receive socket buffer
size, is advertised when the connection handshake occurs,
thus the socket buffer size for the server must be set on
the <br>
listen socket. By increasing the socket buffer sizes, better
TCP performance may be realized in some situations. The
socket buffer sizes are specified by appending their values
<br>
to the protocol specification as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp,rcvbuf=16384 <br>
tcp,sndbuf=64k <br>
tcp,rcvbuf=64k,sndbuf=1m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A literal value may be
specified, or modified using &acirc;k&acirc; to indicate
kilobytes or &acirc;m&acirc; to indicate megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wait/nowait entry is used to
tell inetd if it should wait for the server program to
return, or continue processing connections on the socket. If
a datagram server connects to <br>
its peer, freeing the socket so inetd can receive further
messages on the socket, it is said to be a
&acirc;multi-threaded&acirc; server, and should use the
&acirc;nowait&acirc; entry. For datagram <br>
servers which process all incoming datagrams on a socket and
eventually time out, the server is said to be
&acirc;single-threaded&acirc; and should use a
&acirc;wait&acirc; entry. comsat(8) (biff(1)) and <br>
talkd(8) are both examples of the latter type of datagram
server. The optional &acirc;max&acirc; suffix (separated
from &acirc;wait&acirc; or &acirc;nowait&acirc; by a dot)
specifies the maximum number of times a <br>
service can be invoked in one minute; the default is 256. If
a service exceeds this limit, inetd will log the problem and
stop servicing requests for the specific service for ten
<br>
minutes. See also the -R option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stream servers are usually
marked as &acirc;nowait&acirc; but if a single server
process is to handle multiple connections, it may be marked
as &acirc;wait&acirc;. The master socket will then be passed
<br>
as fd 0 to the server, which will then need to accept the
incoming connection. The server should eventually time out
and exit when no more connections are active. inetd will
con&acirc; <br>
tinue to listen on the master socket for connections, so the
server should not close it when it exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user entry should contain
the user name of the user as whom the server should run.
This allows for servers to be given less permission than
root. An optional group name can <br>
be specified by appending a dot to the user name followed by
the group name. This allows for servers to run with a
different (primary) group ID than specified in the password
<br>
file. If a group is specified and user is not root, the
supplementary groups associated with that user will still be
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server program entry should
contain the pathname of the program which is to be executed
by inetd when a request is found on its socket. If inetd
provides this service inter&acirc; <br>
nally, this entry should be &acirc;internal&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server program arguments
should be just as arguments normally are, starting with
argv[0], which is the name of the program. If the service is
provided internally, the word <br>
&acirc;internal&acirc; should take the place of this
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inetd provides several
&acirc;trivial&acirc; services internally by use of routines
within itself. These services are &acirc;echo&acirc;,
&acirc;discard&acirc;, &acirc;chargen&acirc; (character
generator), &acirc;daytime&acirc; (human <br>
readable time), and &acirc;time&acirc; (machine readable
time, in the form of the number of seconds since midnight,
January 1, 1900). All of these services are TCP based. For
details of <br>
these services, consult the appropriate RFC from the Network
Information Center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inetd rereads its configuration
file when it receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP. Services may
be added, deleted or modified when the configuration file is
reread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libwrap <br>
Support for TCP wrappers is included with inetd to provide
built-in tcpd-like access control functionality. An external
tcpd program is not needed. You do not need to change the
<br>
/etc/inetd.conf server-program entry to enable this
capability. inetd uses /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny
for access control facility configurations, as described in
<br>
hosts_access(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 TCP/UDP behavior <br>
If you wish to run a server for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic,
you&rsquo;ll need to run two separate processes for the same
server program, specified as two separate lines in
inetd.conf, for <br>
&acirc;tcp4&acirc; and &acirc;tcp6&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under various combinations of
IPv4/v6 daemon settings, inetd will behave as follows: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If you have only one server on
&acirc;tcp4&acirc;, IPv4 traffic will be routed to the
server. IPv6 traffic will not be accepted. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If you have two servers on
&acirc;tcp4&acirc; and &acirc;tcp6&acirc;, IPv4 traffic will
be routed to the server on &acirc;tcp4&acirc;, and IPv6
traffic will go to server on &acirc;tcp6&acirc;. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If you have only one server on
&acirc;tcp6&acirc;, only IPv6 traffic will be routed to the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special &acirc;tcp46&acirc;
parameter can be used for obsolete servers which require to
receive IPv4 connections mapped in an IPv6 socket. Its usage
is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
fingerd(8), ftpd(8), identd(8), talkd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The inetd command appeared in 4.3BSD. Support for Sun-RPC
based services is modelled after that provided by SunOS 4.1.
IPv6 support was added by the KAME project in 1999.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Marco d&rsquo;Itri ported this
code from OpenBSD in summer 2002 and added socket buffers
tuning and libwrap support from the NetBSD source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
On Linux systems, the daemon cannot reload its configuration
and needs to be restarted when the host address for a
service is changed between &acirc;*&acirc; and a specific
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server programs used with
&acirc;dgram&acirc; &acirc;udp&acirc; &acirc;nowait&acirc;
must read from the network socket, or inetd will spawn
processes until the maximum is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host address specifiers, while
they make conceptual sense for RPC services, do not work
entirely correctly. This is largely because the portmapper
interface does not provide a way <br>
to register different ports for the same service on
different local addresses. Provided you never have more than
one entry for a given RPC service, everything should work
cor&acirc; <br>
rectly. (Note that default host address specifiers do apply
to RPC lines with no explicit specifier.)</p>
