<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>upsmon</b> is the client process that is responsible for the most important
  part of UPS monitoring&#x2014;shutting down the system when the power goes
  out. It can call out to other helper programs for notification purposes during
  power events.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
upsmon can monitor multiple systems using a single process. Every UPS that is
  defined in the <b>upsmon.conf</b>(5) configuration file is assigned a power
  value and a type ( <b>slave</b> or <b>master</b>).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-h</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display the help message.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-c</b> <i>command</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Send the command <i>command</i> to the
  existing upsmon process. Valid commands are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fsd</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">shutdown all master UPSes (use with
  caution)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>stop</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">stop monitoring and exit</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>reload</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">reread <b>upsmon.conf</b>(5) configuration
  file. See &quot;reloading nuances&quot; below if this doesn&#x2019;t
  work.</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-D</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Raise the debugging level. upsmon will run in
  the foreground and prints information on stdout about the monitoring process.
  Use this multiple times for more details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-K</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Test for the shutdown flag. If it exists and
  contains the magic string from upsmon, then upsmon will exit with
  EXIT_SUCCESS. Any other condition will make upsmon exit with EXIT_FAILURE.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can test for a successful exit from upsmon -K in your shutdown scripts to
  know when to call <b>upsdrvctl</b>(8) to shut down the UPS.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Run privileged all the time. Normally upsmon
  will split into two processes. The majority of the code runs as an
  unprivileged user, and only a tiny stub runs as root. This switch will disable
  that mode, and run the old &quot;all root all the time&quot; system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is not the recommended mode, and you should not use this unless you have a
  very good reason.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-u</b> <i>user</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the user for the unprivileged monitoring
  process. This has no effect when using -p.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default user is set at configure time with <i>configure --with-user=...</i>.
  Typically this is <i>nobody</i>, but other distributions will probably have a
  specific <i>nut</i> user for this task. If your notification scripts need to
  run as a specific user, set it here.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also set this in the <b>upsmon.conf</b>(5) file with the RUN_AS_USER
  directive.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UPS_DEFINITIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#UPS_DEFINITIONS">UPS
  DEFINITIONS</a></h1>
In the <b>upsmon.conf</b>(5), you must specify at least one UPS that will be
  monitored. Use the MONITOR directive.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
MONITOR 'system' 'powervalue' 'username' 'password' 'type'
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>system</i> refers to a <b>upsd</b>(8) server, in the form
  upsname[@hostname[:port]]. The default hostname is &quot;localhost&quot;. Some
  examples follow:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;&quot;su700@mybox&quot; means a UPS
  called &quot;su700&quot; on a system called &quot;mybox&quot;. This is the
  normal form.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;&quot;fenton@bigbox:5678&quot; is a
  UPS called &quot;fenton&quot; on a system called &quot;bigbox&quot; which runs
  <b>upsd</b>(8) on port &quot;5678&quot;.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>powervalue</i> refers to how many power supplies on this system are being
  driven this UPS. This is typically set to 1, but see the section on power
  values below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>username</i> is a section in your <b>upsd.users</b>(5) file. Whatever
  password you set in that section must match the <i>password</i> set in this
  file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The type set in that section must also match the <i>type</i> here--
  <b>master</b> or <b>slave</b>. In general, a master process is one running on
  the system with the UPS actually plugged into a serial port, and a slave is
  drawing power from the UPS but can&#x2019;t talk to it directly. See the
  section on UPS types for more.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTIFY_EVENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTIFY_EVENTS">NOTIFY
  EVENTS</a></h1>
<b>upsmon</b> senses several events as it monitors each UPS. They are called
  notify events as they can be used to tell the users and admins about the
  change in status. See the additional NOTIFY-related sections below for
  information on customizing the delivery of these messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ONLINE</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The UPS is back on line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ONBATT</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The UPS is on battery.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>LOWBATT</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The UPS battery is low (as determined by the
  driver).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>FSD</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The UPS has been commanded into the
  &quot;forced shutdown&quot; mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>COMMOK</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Communication with the UPS has been
  established.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>COMMBAD</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Communication with the UPS was just
  lost.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SHUTDOWN</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The local system is being shut down.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>REPLBATT</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The UPS needs to have its battery
  replaced.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOCOMM</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The UPS can&#x2019;t be contacted for
  monitoring.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTIFY_COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTIFY_COMMAND">NOTIFY
  COMMAND</a></h1>
In <b>upsmon.conf</b>(5), you can configure a program called the NOTIFYCMD that
  will handle events that occur.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTIFYCMD &quot; <i>path to program</i>&quot;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTIFYCMD &quot;/usr/local/bin/notifyme&quot;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Remember to wrap the path in &quot;quotes&quot; if it contains any spaces.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program you run as your NOTIFYCMD can use the environment variables
  NOTIFYTYPE and UPSNAME to know what has happened and on which UPS. It also
  receives the notification message (see below) as the first (and only)
  argument, so you can deliver a preformatted message too.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the NOTIFYCMD will only be called for a given event when you set the
  EXEC flag by using the notify flags, below:
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTIFY_FLAGS"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTIFY_FLAGS">NOTIFY
  FLAGS</a></h1>
By default, all notify events (see above) generate a global message (wall) to
  all users, plus they are logged via the syslog. You can change this with the
  NOTIFYFLAG directive in the configuration file:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTIFYFLAG <i>notifytype</i> <i>flags</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;NOTIFYFLAG ONLINE SYSLOG</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;NOTIFYFLAG ONBATT SYSLOG+WALL</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;NOTIFYFLAG LOWBATT
  SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The flags that can be set on a given notify event are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SYSLOG</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write this message to the syslog.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>WALL</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Send this message to all users on the system
  via <b>wall</b>(1).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>EXEC</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Execute the NOTIFYCMD.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>IGNORE</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Don&#x2019;t do anything. If you use this,
  don&#x2019;t use any of the other flags.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can mix these flags. &quot;SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC&quot; does all three for a given
  event.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTIFY_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTIFY_MESSAGES">NOTIFY
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
upsmon comes with default messages for each of the NOTIFY events. These can be
  changed with the NOTIFYMSG directive.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTIFYMSG <i>type</i> &quot;<i>message</i>&quot;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;NOTIFYMSG ONLINE &quot;UPS %s is
  getting line power&quot;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;` NOTIFYMSG ONBATT &quot;Someone
  pulled the plug on %s&quot;`</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first instance of %s is replaced with the identifier of the UPS that
  generated the event. These messages are used when sending walls to the users
  directly from upsmon, and are also passed to the NOTIFYCMD.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POWER_VALUES"><a class="selflink" href="#POWER_VALUES">POWER
  VALUES</a></h1>
The &quot;current overall power value&quot; is the sum of all UPSes that are
  currently able to supply power to the system hosting upsmon. Any UPS that is
  either on line or just on battery contributes to this number. If a UPS is
  critical (on battery and low battery) or has been put into &quot;forced
  shutdown&quot; mode, it no longer contributes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A &quot;power value&quot; on a MONITOR line in the config file is the number of
  power supplies that the UPS runs on the current system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MONITOR <i>upsname</i> <i>powervalue</i> <i>username</i> <i>password</i>
  <i>type</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Normally, you only have one power supply, so it will be set to 1.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MONITOR myups@myhost 1 username mypassword master
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On a large server with redundant power supplies, the power value for a UPS may
  be greater than 1. You may also have more than one of them defined.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MONITOR ups-alpha@myhost 2 username mypassword master
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MONITOR ups-beta@myhost 2 username mypassword master
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also set the power value for a UPS to 0 if it does not supply any power
  to that system. This is generally used when you want to use the upsmon
  notification features for a UPS even though it&#x2019;s not actually running
  the system that hosts upsmon. Don&#x2019;t set this to &quot;master&quot;
  unless you really want to power this UPS off when this instance of upsmon
  needs to shut down for its own reasons.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MONITOR faraway@anotherbox 0 username mypassword slave
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;minimum power value&quot; is the number of power supplies that must be
  receiving power in order to keep the computer running.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MINSUPPLIES <i>value</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Typical PCs only have 1, so most users will leave this at the default.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MINSUPPLIES 1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you have a server or similar system with redundant power, then this value
  will usually be set higher. One that requires three power supplies to be
  running at all times would simply set it to 3.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
MINSUPPLIES 3
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the current overall power value drops below the minimum power value, upsmon
  starts the shutdown sequence. This design allows you to lose some of your
  power supplies in a redundant power environment without bringing down the
  entire system while still working properly for smaller systems.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UPS_TYPES"><a class="selflink" href="#UPS_TYPES">UPS
  TYPES</a></h1>
<b>upsmon</b> and <b>upsd</b>(8) don&#x2019;t always run on the same system.
  When they do, any UPSes that are directly attached to the upsmon host should
  be monitored in &quot;master&quot; mode. This makes upsmon take charge of that
  equipment, and it will wait for slaves to disconnect before shutting down the
  local system. This allows the distant systems (monitoring over the network) to
  shut down cleanly before upsdrvctl shutdown runs and turns them all off.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When upsmon runs as a slave, it is relying on the distant system to tell it
  about the state of the UPS. When that UPS goes critical (on battery and low
  battery), it immediately invokes the local shutdown command. This needs to
  happen quickly. Once it disconnects from the distant <b>upsd</b>(8) server,
  the master upsmon will start its own shutdown process. Your slaves must all
  shut down before the master turns off the power or filesystem damage may
  result.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
upsmon deals with slaves that get wedged, hang, or otherwise fail to disconnect
  from <b>upsd</b>(8) in a timely manner with the HOSTSYNC timer. During a
  shutdown situation, the master upsmon will give up after this interval and it
  will shut down anyway. This keeps the master from sitting there forever (which
  would endanger that host) if a slave should break somehow. This defaults to 15
  seconds.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If your master system is shutting down too quickly, set the FINALDELAY interval
  to something greater than the default 15 seconds. Don&#x2019;t set this too
  high, or your UPS battery may run out of power before the master upsmon
  process shuts down that system.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TIMED_SHUTDOWNS"><a class="selflink" href="#TIMED_SHUTDOWNS">TIMED
  SHUTDOWNS</a></h1>
For those rare situations where the shutdown process can&#x2019;t be completed
  between the time that low battery is signalled and the UPS actually powers off
  the load, use the <b>upssched</b>(8) helper program. You can use it along with
  upsmon to schedule a shutdown based on the &quot;on battery&quot; event.
  upssched can then come back to upsmon to initiate the shutdown once it has run
  on battery too long.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This can be complicated and messy, so stick to the default critical UPS handling
  if you can.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REDUNDANT_POWER_SUPPLIES"><a class="selflink" href="#REDUNDANT_POWER_SUPPLIES">REDUNDANT
  POWER SUPPLIES</a></h1>
If you have more than one power supply for redundant power, you may also have
  more than one UPS feeding your computer. upsmon can handle this. Be sure to
  set the UPS power values appropriately and the MINSUPPLIES value high enough
  so that it keeps running until it really does need to shut down.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, the HP NetServer LH4 by default has 3 power supplies installed,
  with one bay empty. It has two power cords, one per side of the box. This
  means that one power cord powers two power supply bays, and that you can only
  have two UPSes supplying power.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Connect UPS &quot;alpha&quot; to the cord feeding two power supplies, and UPS
  &quot;beta&quot; to the cord that feeds the third and the empty slot. Define
  alpha as a powervalue of 2, and beta as a powervalue of 1. Set the MINSUPPLIES
  to 2.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When alpha goes on battery, your current overall power value will stay at 3, as
  it&#x2019;s still supplying power. However, once it goes critical (on battery
  and low battery), it will stop contributing to the current overall power
  value. That means the value will be 1 (beta alone), which is less than 2. That
  is insufficient to run the system, and upsmon will invoke the shutdown
  sequence.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, if beta goes critical, subtracting its contribution will take the
  current overall value from 3 to 2. This is just high enough to satisfy the
  minimum, so the system will continue running as before. If beta returns later,
  it will be re-added and the current value will go back to 3. This allows you
  to swap out UPSes, change a power configuration, or whatever, as long as you
  maintain the minimum power value at all times.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MIXED_OPERATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#MIXED_OPERATIONS">MIXED
  OPERATIONS</a></h1>
Besides being able to monitor multiple UPSes, upsmon can also monitor them as
  different roles. If you have a system with multiple power supplies serviced by
  separate UPS batteries, it&#x2019;s possible to be a master on one and a slave
  on the other. This usually happens when you run out of serial ports and need
  to do the monitoring through another system nearby.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is also complicated, especially when it comes time to power down a UPS that
  has gone critical but doesn&#x2019;t supply the local system. You can do this
  with some scripting magic in your notify command script, but it&#x2019;s
  beyond the scope of this manual.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FORCED_SHUTDOWNS"><a class="selflink" href="#FORCED_SHUTDOWNS">FORCED
  SHUTDOWNS</a></h1>
When upsmon is forced to bring down the local system, it sets the
  &quot;FSD&quot; (forced shutdown) flag on any UPSes that it is running in
  master mode. This is used to synchronize slaves in the event that a master UPS
  that is otherwise OK needs to be brought down due to some pressing event on
  the master.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can manually invoke this mode on the master upsmon by starting another copy
  with -c fsd. This is useful when you want to initiate a shutdown before the
  critical stage through some external means, such as <b>upssched</b>(8).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEAD_UPSES"><a class="selflink" href="#DEAD_UPSES">DEAD
  UPSES</a></h1>
In the event that upsmon can&#x2019;t reach <b>upsd</b>(8), it declares that UPS
  &quot;dead&quot; after some interval controlled by DEADTIME in the
  <b>upsmon.conf</b>(5). If this happens while that UPS was last known to be on
  battery, it is assumed to have gone critical and no longer contributes to the
  overall power value.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
upsmon will alert you to a UPS that can&#x2019;t be contacted for monitoring
  with a &quot;NOCOMM&quot; notifier by default every 300 seconds. This can be
  changed with the NOCOMMWARNTIME setting.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RELOADING_NUANCES"><a class="selflink" href="#RELOADING_NUANCES">RELOADING
  NUANCES</a></h1>
upsmon usually gives up root powers for the process that does most of the work,
  including handling signals like SIGHUP to reload the configuration file. This
  means your <b>upsmon.conf</b>(8) file must be readable by the non-root account
  that upsmon switches to.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want reloads to work, upsmon must run as some user that has permissions
  to read the configuration file. I recommend making a new user just for this
  purpose, as making the file readable by &quot;nobody&quot; (the default user)
  would be a bad idea.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See the RUN_AS_USER section in <b>upsmon.conf</b>(8) for more on this topic.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Additionally, you can&#x2019;t change the SHUTDOWNCMD or POWERDOWNFLAG
  definitions with a reload due to the split-process model. If you change those
  values, you <b>must</b> stop upsmon and start it back up. upsmon will warn you
  in the syslog if you make changes to either of those values during a reload.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIMULATING_POWER_FAILURES"><a class="selflink" href="#SIMULATING_POWER_FAILURES">SIMULATING
  POWER FAILURES</a></h1>
To test a synchronized shutdown without pulling the plug on your UPS(es), you
  need only set the forced shutdown (FSD) flag on them. You can do this by
  calling upsmon again to set the flag, i.e.:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
upsmon -c fsd
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After that, the master and the slaves will do their usual shutdown sequence as
  if the battery had gone critical. This is much easier on your UPS equipment,
  and it beats crawling under a desk to find the plug.
