<p>UPSMON(8) NUT Manual UPSMON(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
upsmon - UPS monitor and shutdown controller</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
upsmon -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upsmon -c command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upsmon [-D] [-K] [-p] [-u
user]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
upsmon is the client process that is responsible for the
most important part of UPS monitoring&acirc;shutting down
the system when the power goes out. It can call out to other
helper <br>
programs for notification purposes during power events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upsmon can monitor multiple
systems using a single process. Every UPS that is defined in
the upsmon.conf(5) configuration file is assigned a power
value and a type (slave or <br>
master).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h <br>
Display the help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
Send the command command to the existing upsmon process.
Valid commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsd <br>
shutdown all master UPSes (use with caution)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop <br>
stop monitoring and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload <br>
reread upsmon.conf(5) configuration file. See
&quot;reloading nuances&quot; below if this doesn&acirc;t
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Raise the debugging level. upsmon will run in the foreground
and prints information on stdout about the monitoring
process. Use this multiple times for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K <br>
Test for the shutdown flag. If it exists and contains the
magic string from upsmon, then upsmon will exit with
EXIT_SUCCESS. Any other condition will make upsmon exit with
<br>
EXIT_FAILURE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can test for a successful
exit from upsmon -K in your shutdown scripts to know when to
call upsdrvctl(8) to shut down the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
Run privileged all the time. Normally upsmon will split into
two processes. The majority of the code runs as an
unprivileged user, and only a tiny stub runs as root. This
<br>
switch will disable that mode, and run the old &quot;all
root all the time&quot; system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not the recommended
mode, and you should not use this unless you have a very
good reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Set the user for the unprivileged monitoring process. This
has no effect when using -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default user is set at
configure time with configure --with-user=.... Typically
this is nobody, but other distributions will probably have a
specific nut user for this <br>
task. If your notification scripts need to run as a specific
user, set it here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also set this in the
upsmon.conf(5) file with the RUN_AS_USER directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPS DEFINITIONS <br>
In the upsmon.conf(5), you must specify at least one UPS
that will be monitored. Use the MONITOR directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR &rsquo;system&rsquo;
&rsquo;powervalue&rsquo; &rsquo;username&rsquo;
&rsquo;password&rsquo; &rsquo;type&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system refers to a upsd(8)
server, in the form upsname[@hostname[:port]]. The default
hostname is &quot;localhost&quot;. Some examples follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;su700@mybox&quot; means a UPS called &quot;su700&quot;
on a system called &quot;mybox&quot;. This is the normal
form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;fenton@bigbox:5678&quot; is a UPS called
&quot;fenton&quot; on a system called &quot;bigbox&quot;
which runs upsd(8) on port &quot;5678&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The powervalue refers to how
many power supplies on this system are being driven this
UPS. This is typically set to 1, but see the section on
power values below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The username is a section in
your upsd.users(5) file. Whatever password you set in that
section must match the password set in this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type set in that section
must also match the type here-- master or slave. In general,
a master process is one running on the system with the UPS
actually plugged into a <br>
serial port, and a slave is drawing power from the UPS but
can&acirc;t talk to it directly. See the section on UPS
types for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY EVENTS <br>
upsmon senses several events as it monitors each UPS. They
are called notify events as they can be used to tell the
users and admins about the change in status. See the <br>
additional NOTIFY-related sections below for information on
customizing the delivery of these messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ONLINE <br>
The UPS is back on line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ONBATT <br>
The UPS is on battery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOWBATT <br>
The UPS battery is low (as determined by the driver).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FSD <br>
The UPS has been commanded into the &quot;forced
shutdown&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMOK <br>
Communication with the UPS has been established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMBAD <br>
Communication with the UPS was just lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHUTDOWN <br>
The local system is being shut down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPLBATT <br>
The UPS needs to have its battery replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOCOMM <br>
The UPS can&acirc;t be contacted for monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY COMMAND <br>
In upsmon.conf(5), you can configure a program called the
NOTIFYCMD that will handle events that occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFYCMD &quot;path to
program&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFYCMD
&quot;/usr/local/bin/notifyme&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember to wrap the path in
&quot;quotes&quot; if it contains any spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program you run as your
NOTIFYCMD can use the environment variables NOTIFYTYPE and
UPSNAME to know what has happened and on which UPS. It also
receives the notification <br>
message (see below) as the first (and only) argument, so you
can deliver a preformatted message too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the NOTIFYCMD will
only be called for a given event when you set the EXEC flag
by using the notify flags, below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY FLAGS <br>
By default, all notify events (see above) generate a global
message (wall) to all users, plus they are logged via the
syslog. You can change this with the NOTIFYFLAG directive in
<br>
the configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFYFLAG notifytype flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NOTIFYFLAG
ONLINE SYSLOG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NOTIFYFLAG
ONBATT SYSLOG+WALL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NOTIFYFLAG
LOWBATT SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags that can be set on a
given notify event are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSLOG <br>
Write this message to the syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WALL <br>
Send this message to all users on the system via
wall(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXEC <br>
Execute the NOTIFYCMD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORE <br>
Don&acirc;t do anything. If you use this, don&acirc;t use
any of the other flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can mix these flags.
&quot;SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC&quot; does all three for a given
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY MESSAGES <br>
upsmon comes with default messages for each of the NOTIFY
events. These can be changed with the NOTIFYMSG
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFYMSG type
&quot;message&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NOTIFYMSG ONLINE
&quot;UPS %s is getting line power&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &lsquo;
NOTIFYMSG ONBATT &quot;Someone pulled the plug on
%s&quot;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first instance of %s is
replaced with the identifier of the UPS that generated the
event. These messages are used when sending walls to the
users directly from upsmon, and <br>
are also passed to the NOTIFYCMD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POWER VALUES <br>
The &quot;current overall power value&quot; is the sum of
all UPSes that are currently able to supply power to the
system hosting upsmon. Any UPS that is either on line or
just on battery <br>
contributes to this number. If a UPS is critical (on battery
and low battery) or has been put into &quot;forced
shutdown&quot; mode, it no longer contributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;power value&quot; on a
MONITOR line in the config file is the number of power
supplies that the UPS runs on the current system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR upsname powervalue
username password type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, you only have one
power supply, so it will be set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR myups@myhost 1 username
mypassword master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a large server with redundant
power supplies, the power value for a UPS may be greater
than 1. You may also have more than one of them defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR ups-alpha@myhost 2
username mypassword master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR ups-beta@myhost 2
username mypassword master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also set the power value
for a UPS to 0 if it does not supply any power to that
system. This is generally used when you want to use the
upsmon notification features for a <br>
UPS even though it&acirc;s not actually running the system
that hosts upsmon. Don&acirc;t set this to
&quot;master&quot; unless you really want to power this UPS
off when this instance of upsmon needs <br>
to shut down for its own reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR faraway@anotherbox 0
username mypassword slave</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;minimum power
value&quot; is the number of power supplies that must be
receiving power in order to keep the computer running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINSUPPLIES value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typical PCs only have 1, so most
users will leave this at the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINSUPPLIES 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a server or similar
system with redundant power, then this value will usually be
set higher. One that requires three power supplies to be
running at all times would <br>
simply set it to 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINSUPPLIES 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the current overall power
value drops below the minimum power value, upsmon starts the
shutdown sequence. This design allows you to lose some of
your power supplies in a <br>
redundant power environment without bringing down the entire
system while still working properly for smaller systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPS TYPES <br>
upsmon and upsd(8) don&acirc;t always run on the same
system. When they do, any UPSes that are directly attached
to the upsmon host should be monitored in &quot;master&quot;
mode. This makes <br>
upsmon take charge of that equipment, and it will wait for
slaves to disconnect before shutting down the local system.
This allows the distant systems (monitoring over the <br>
network) to shut down cleanly before upsdrvctl shutdown runs
and turns them all off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When upsmon runs as a slave, it
is relying on the distant system to tell it about the state
of the UPS. When that UPS goes critical (on battery and low
battery), it immediately <br>
invokes the local shutdown command. This needs to happen
quickly. Once it disconnects from the distant upsd(8)
server, the master upsmon will start its own shutdown
process. Your <br>
slaves must all shut down before the master turns off the
power or filesystem damage may result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upsmon deals with slaves that
get wedged, hang, or otherwise fail to disconnect from
upsd(8) in a timely manner with the HOSTSYNC timer. During a
shutdown situation, the master <br>
upsmon will give up after this interval and it will shut
down anyway. This keeps the master from sitting there
forever (which would endanger that host) if a slave should
break <br>
somehow. This defaults to 15 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your master system is
shutting down too quickly, set the FINALDELAY interval to
something greater than the default 15 seconds. Don&acirc;t
set this too high, or your UPS battery may <br>
run out of power before the master upsmon process shuts down
that system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMED SHUTDOWNS <br>
For those rare situations where the shutdown process
can&acirc;t be completed between the time that low battery
is signalled and the UPS actually powers off the load, use
the <br>
upssched(8) helper program. You can use it along with upsmon
to schedule a shutdown based on the &quot;on battery&quot;
event. upssched can then come back to upsmon to initiate the
<br>
shutdown once it has run on battery too long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be complicated and
messy, so stick to the default critical UPS handling if you
can.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REDUNDANT POWER SUPPLIES <br>
If you have more than one power supply for redundant power,
you may also have more than one UPS feeding your computer.
upsmon can handle this. Be sure to set the UPS power values
<br>
appropriately and the MINSUPPLIES value high enough so that
it keeps running until it really does need to shut down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the HP NetServer
LH4 by default has 3 power supplies installed, with one bay
empty. It has two power cords, one per side of the box. This
means that one power cord <br>
powers two power supply bays, and that you can only have two
UPSes supplying power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect UPS &quot;alpha&quot; to
the cord feeding two power supplies, and UPS
&quot;beta&quot; to the cord that feeds the third and the
empty slot. Define alpha as a powervalue of 2, and beta as a
<br>
powervalue of 1. Set the MINSUPPLIES to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When alpha goes on battery, your
current overall power value will stay at 3, as it&acirc;s
still supplying power. However, once it goes critical (on
battery and low battery), it will <br>
stop contributing to the current overall power value. That
means the value will be 1 (beta alone), which is less than
2. That is insufficient to run the system, and upsmon will
<br>
invoke the shutdown sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if beta goes critical,
subtracting its contribution will take the current overall
value from 3 to 2. This is just high enough to satisfy the
minimum, so the system will <br>
continue running as before. If beta returns later, it will
be re-added and the current value will go back to 3. This
allows you to swap out UPSes, change a power configuration,
<br>
or whatever, as long as you maintain the minimum power value
at all times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIXED OPERATIONS <br>
Besides being able to monitor multiple UPSes, upsmon can
also monitor them as different roles. If you have a system
with multiple power supplies serviced by separate UPS <br>
batteries, it&acirc;s possible to be a master on one and a
slave on the other. This usually happens when you run out of
serial ports and need to do the monitoring through another
<br>
system nearby.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is also complicated,
especially when it comes time to power down a UPS that has
gone critical but doesn&acirc;t supply the local system. You
can do this with some scripting magic <br>
in your notify command script, but it&acirc;s beyond the
scope of this manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORCED SHUTDOWNS <br>
When upsmon is forced to bring down the local system, it
sets the &quot;FSD&quot; (forced shutdown) flag on any UPSes
that it is running in master mode. This is used to
synchronize slaves <br>
in the event that a master UPS that is otherwise OK needs to
be brought down due to some pressing event on the
master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can manually invoke this
mode on the master upsmon by starting another copy with -c
fsd. This is useful when you want to initiate a shutdown
before the critical stage through <br>
some external means, such as upssched(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEAD UPSES <br>
In the event that upsmon can&acirc;t reach upsd(8), it
declares that UPS &quot;dead&quot; after some interval
controlled by DEADTIME in the upsmon.conf(5). If this
happens while that UPS was <br>
last known to be on battery, it is assumed to have gone
critical and no longer contributes to the overall power
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upsmon will alert you to a UPS
that can&acirc;t be contacted for monitoring with a
&quot;NOCOMM&quot; notifier by default every 300 seconds.
This can be changed with the NOCOMMWARNTIME setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELOADING NUANCES <br>
upsmon usually gives up root powers for the process that
does most of the work, including handling signals like
SIGHUP to reload the configuration file. This means your
<br>
upsmon.conf(8) file must be readable by the non-root account
that upsmon switches to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want reloads to work,
upsmon must run as some user that has permissions to read
the configuration file. I recommend making a new user just
for this purpose, as making the <br>
file readable by &quot;nobody&quot; (the default user) would
be a bad idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the RUN_AS_USER section in
upsmon.conf(8) for more on this topic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, you can&acirc;t
change the SHUTDOWNCMD or POWERDOWNFLAG definitions with a
reload due to the split-process model. If you change those
values, you must stop upsmon and <br>
start it back up. upsmon will warn you in the syslog if you
make changes to either of those values during a reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMULATING POWER FAILURES <br>
To test a synchronized shutdown without pulling the plug on
your UPS(es), you need only set the forced shutdown (FSD)
flag on them. You can do this by calling upsmon again to set
<br>
the flag, i.e.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upsmon -c fsd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After that, the master and the
slaves will do their usual shutdown sequence as if the
battery had gone critical. This is much easier on your UPS
equipment, and it beats crawling <br>
under a desk to find the plug.</p>
