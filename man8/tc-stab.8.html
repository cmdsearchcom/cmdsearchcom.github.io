<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tc-stab - Generic size table manipulations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tc qdisc add ... stab <br>
[ mtu BYTES ] [ tsize SLOTS ] <br>
[ mpu BYTES ] [ overhead BYTES ] <br>
[ linklayer { adsl | atm | ethernet } ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For the description of BYTES - please refer to the UNITS
section of tc(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtu <br>
maximum packet size we create size table for, assumed 2048
if not specified explicitly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsize <br>
required table size, assumed 512 if not specified
explicitly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpu <br>
minimum packet size used in computations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overhead <br>
per-packet size overhead (can be negative) used in
computations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklayer <br>
required linklayer specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Size tables allow manipulation of packet sizes, as seen by
the whole scheduler framework (of course, the actual packet
size remains the same). Adjusted packet size is calculated
<br>
only once - when a qdisc enqueues the packet. Initial root
enqueue initializes it to the real packet&rsquo;s size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each qdisc can use a different
size table, but the adjusted size is stored in an area
shared by whole qdisc hierarchy attached to the interface.
The effect is that if you have <br>
such a setup, the last qdisc with a stab in a chain
&quot;wins&quot;. For example, consider HFSC with simple
pfifo attached to one of its leaf classes. If that pfifo
qdisc has stab <br>
defined, it will override lengths calculated during
HFSC&rsquo;s enqueue; and in turn, whenever HFSC tries to
dequeue a packet, it will use a potentially invalid size in
its calcula&acirc; <br>
tions. Normal setups will usually include stab defined only
on root qdisc, but further overriding gives extra
flexibility for less usual setups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial size table is
calculated by tc tool using mtu and tsize parameters. The
algorithm sets each slot&rsquo;s size to the smallest power
of 2 value, so the whole mtu is covered <br>
by the size table. Neither tsize, nor mtu have to be power
of 2 value, so the size table will usually support more than
is required by mtu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with mtu = 1500 and
tsize = 128, a table with 128 slots will be created, where
slot 0 will correspond to sizes 0-16, slot 1 to 17 - 32,
..., slot 127 to 2033 - 2048. <br>
Sizes assigned to each slot depend on linklayer
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stab calculation is also safe
for an unusual case, when a size assigned to a slot would be
larger than 2^16-1 (you will lose the accuracy though).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the kernel part of packet
size adjustment, overhead will be added to original size,
and then slot will be calculated. If the size would cause
overflow, more than 1 slot <br>
will be used to get the final size. This of course will
affect accuracy, but it&rsquo;s only a guard against unusual
situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently there are two methods
of creating values stored in the size table - ethernet and
atm (adsl):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ethernet <br>
This is basically 1-1 mapping, so following our example from
above (disregarding mpu for a moment) slot 0 would have 8,
slot 1 would have 16 and so on, up to slot 127 with <br>
2048. Note, that mpu &gt; 0 must be specified, and slots
that would get less than specified by mpu will get mpu
instead. If you don&rsquo;t specify mpu, the size table will
not be <br>
created at all (it wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference),
although any overhead value will be respected during
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atm, adsl <br>
ATM linklayer consists of 53 byte cells, where each of them
provides 48 bytes for payload. Also all the cells must be
fully utilized, thus the last one is padded if/as
neces&acirc; <br>
sary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the size table is
calculated, adjusted size that fits properly into lowest
amount of cells is assigned to a slot. For example, a 100
byte long packet requires three <br>
48-byte payloads, so the final size would require 3 ATM
cells - 159 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ATM size tables, 16 bytes
sized slots are perfectly enough. The default values of mtu
and tsize create 4 bytes sized slots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPICAL OVERHEADS <br>
The following values are typical for different adsl
scenarios (based on [1] and [2]):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLC based: <br>
PPPoA - 14 (PPP - 2, ATM - 12) <br>
PPPoE - 40+ (PPPoE - 8, ATM - 18, ethernet 14, possibly FCS
- 4+padding) <br>
Bridged - 32 (ATM - 18, ethernet 14, possibly FCS -
4+padding) <br>
IPoA - 16 (ATM - 16)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VC Mux based: <br>
PPPoA - 10 (PPP - 2, ATM - 8) <br>
PPPoE - 32+ (PPPoE - 8, ATM - 10, ethernet 14, possibly FCS
- 4+padding) <br>
Bridged - 24+ (ATM - 10, ethernet 14, possibly FCS -
4+padding) <br>
IPoA - 8 (ATM - 8) <br>
There are a few important things regarding the above
overheads:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; IPoA in LLC case
requires SNAP, instead of LLC-NLPID (see rfc2684) - this is
the reason why it actually takes more space than PPPoA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In rare cases,
FCS might be preserved on protocols that include Ethernet
frames (Bridged and PPPoE). In such situation, any Ethernet
specific padding guaranteeing 64 bytes <br>
long frame size has to be included as well (see RFC2684). In
the other words, it also guarantees that any packet you send
will take minimum 2 atm cells. You should set mpu <br>
accordingly for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When the size
table is consulted, and you&rsquo;re shaping traffic for the
sake of another modem/router, an Ethernet header (without
padding) will already be added to initial <br>
packet&rsquo;s length. You should compensate for that by
subtracting 14 from the above overheads in this case. If
you&rsquo;re shaping directly on the router (for example,
with speed&acirc; <br>
touch usb modem) using ppp daemon, you&rsquo;re using raw ip
interface without underlying layer2, so nothing will be
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more thorough explanations,
please see [1] and [2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ETHERNET CARDS CONSIDERATIONS
<br>
It&rsquo;s often forgotten that modern network cards (even
cheap ones on desktop motherboards) and/or their drivers
often support different offloading mechanisms. In the
context of <br>
traffic shaping, &rsquo;tso&rsquo; and &rsquo;gso&rsquo;
might cause undesirable effects, due to massive TCP segments
being considered during traffic shaping (including stab
calculations). For slow <br>
uplink interfaces, it&rsquo;s good to use ethtool to turn
off offloading features.</p>
