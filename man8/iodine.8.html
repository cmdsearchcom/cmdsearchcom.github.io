<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
iodine lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This
can be useful in situations where Internet access is
firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed. It needs a TUN/TAP
<br>
device to operate. The bandwidth is asymmetrical, with a
measured maximum of 680 kbit/s upstream and 2.3 Mbit/s
downstream in a wired LAN test network. Realistic sustained
<br>
throughput on a Wifi network using a carrier-grade DNS cache
has been measured at some 50 kbit/s upstream and over 200
kbit/s downstream. iodine is the client application, <br>
iodined is the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: server and client are
required to speak the exact same protocol. In most cases,
this means running the same iodine version. Unfortunately,
implementing backward and forward <br>
protocol compatibility is usually not feasible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Common Options: <br>
-v Print version info and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print usage info and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Keep running in
foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Drop privileges and run as user &rsquo;user&rsquo; after
setting up tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t chrootdir <br>
Chroot to &rsquo;chrootdir&rsquo; after setting up
tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d device <br>
Use the TUN device &rsquo;device&rsquo; instead of the
normal one, which is dnsX on Linux and otherwise tunX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P password <br>
Use &rsquo;password&rsquo; to authenticate. If not used,
stdin will be used as input. Only the first 32 characters
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z context <br>
Apply SELinux &rsquo;context&rsquo; after
initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F pidfile <br>
Create &rsquo;pidfile&rsquo; and write process id in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client Options: <br>
-4 Force IPv4 DNS queries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Force IPv6 DNS queries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Skip raw UDP mode. If not
used, iodine will try getting the public IP address of the
iodined host and test if it is reachable directly. If it is,
traffic will be sent to <br>
the server instead of the DNS relay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R rdomain <br>
Use OpenBSD routing domain &rsquo;rdomain&rsquo; for the DNS
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m fragsize <br>
Force maximum downstream fragment size. Not setting this
will cause the client to automatically probe the maximum
accepted downstream fragment size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M namelen <br>
Maximum length of upstream hostnames, default 255. Usable
range ca. 100 to 255. Use this option to scale back upstream
bandwidth in favor of downstream bandwidth. Also <br>
useful for DNS servers that perform unreliably when using
full-length hostnames, noticeable when fragment size
autoprobe returns very different results each time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T dnstype <br>
DNS request type override. By default, autodetection will
probe for working DNS request types, and will select the
request type that is expected to provide the most
band&acirc; <br>
width. However, it may turn out that a DNS relay imposes
limits that skew the picture, which may lead to an
&quot;unexpected&quot; DNS request type providing more
bandwidth. In <br>
that case, use this option to override the autodetection. In
(expected) decreasing bandwidth order, the supported DNS
request types are: NULL, PRIVATE, TXT, SRV, MX, <br>
CNAME and A (returning CNAME). Note that SRV, MX and A
may/will cause additional lookups by &quot;smart&quot;
caching nameservers to get an actual IP address, which may
either slow <br>
down or fail completely. The PRIVATE type uses value 65399
(in the &rsquo;private use&rsquo; range) and requires
servers implementing RFC 3597.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O downenc <br>
Force downstream encoding type for all query type responses
except NULL. Default is autodetected, but may not spot all
problems for the more advanced codecs. Use this <br>
option to override the autodetection. Base32 is the
lowest-grade codec and should always work; this is used when
autodetection fails. Base64 provides more bandwidth, but
<br>
may not work on all nameservers. Base64u is equal to Base64
except in using underscore (&rsquo;_&rsquo;) instead of plus
sign (&rsquo;+&rsquo;), possibly working where Base64 does
not. Base128 <br>
uses high byte values (mostly accented letters in
iso8859-1), which might work with some nameservers. For TXT
queries, Raw will provide maximum performance, but this will
<br>
only work if the nameserver path is fully 8-bit-clean for
responses that are assumed to be &quot;legible
text&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L 0|1 Lazy-mode switch. -L1
(default): Use lazy mode for improved performance and
decreased latency. A very small minority of DNS relays
appears to be unable to handle the <br>
lazy mode traffic pattern, resulting in no or very little
data coming through. The iodine client will detect this and
try to switch back to legacy mode, but this may not <br>
always work. In these situations use -L0 to force running in
legacy mode (implies -I1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I interval <br>
Maximum interval between requests (pings) so that
intermediate DNS servers will not time out. Default is 4 in
lazy mode, which will work fine in most cases. When too many
<br>
SERVFAIL errors occur, iodine will automatically reduce this
to 1. To get absolute minimum DNS traffic, increase well
above 4, but not so high that SERVFAIL errors start <br>
to occur. There are some DNS relays with very small
timeouts, notably dnsadvantage.com (ultradns), that will
give SERVFAIL errors even with -I1; data will still get <br>
trough, and these errors can be ignored. Maximum useful
value is 59, since iodined will close a client&rsquo;s
connection after 60 seconds of inactivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Options: <br>
-c Disable checking the client IP address on all incoming
requests. By default, requests originating from non-matching
IP addresses will be rejected, however this will cause <br>
problems when requests are routed via a cluster of DNS
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Don&rsquo;t try to configure
IP address or MTU. This should only be used if you have
already configured the device that will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Increase debug level. Level 1
prints info about each RX/TX packet. Implies the -f option.
On level 2 (-DD) or higher, DNS queries will be printed
literally. When using <br>
Base128 upstream encoding, this is best viewed as ISO
Latin-1 text instead of (illegal) UTF-8. This is easily done
with : &quot;LC_ALL=C luit iodined -DD ...&quot; (see
luit(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mtu Set &rsquo;mtu&rsquo; as
mtu size for the tun device. This will be sent to the client
on login, and the client will use the same mtu for its tun
device. Default 1130. Note that the <br>
DNS traffic will be automatically fragmented when
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l listen_ip <br>
Make the server listen only on &rsquo;listen_ip&rsquo; for
incoming requests. By default, incoming requests are
accepted from all interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Make the server listen on &rsquo;port&rsquo; instead of 53
for traffic. If &rsquo;listen_ip&rsquo; does not include
localhost, this &rsquo;port&rsquo; can be the same as
&rsquo;dnsport&rsquo;. Note: You must make sure <br>
the dns requests are forwarded to this port yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n auto|external_ip <br>
The IP address to return in NS responses. Default is to
return the address used as destination in the query. If
external_ip is &rsquo;auto&rsquo;, iodined will use
externalip.net web <br>
service to retrieve the external IP of the host and use that
for NS responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b dnsport <br>
If this port is specified, all incoming requests not inside
the tunnel domain will be forwarded to this port on
localhost, to be handled by a real dns. If
&rsquo;listen_ip&rsquo; <br>
does not include localhost, this &rsquo;dnsport&rsquo; can
be the same as &rsquo;port&rsquo;. Note: The forwarding is
not fully transparent, and not advised for use in production
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i max_idle_time <br>
Make the server stop itself after max_idle_time seconds if
no traffic have been received. This should be combined with
systemd or upstart on demand activation for being <br>
effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client Arguments: <br>
nameserver <br>
The nameserver to use to relay the dns traffic. This can be
any relaying nameserver or the server running iodined if
reachable. This field can be given as an IPv4/IPv6 <br>
address or as a hostname. This argument is optional, and if
not specified a nameserver will be read from the
/etc/resolv.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">topdomain <br>
The dns traffic will be sent as queries for subdomains under
&Acirc;&acute;topdomain&rsquo;. This is normally a subdomain
to a domain you own. Use a short domain name to get better
through&acirc; <br>
put. If nameserver is the iodined server, then the topdomain
can be chosen freely. This argument must be the same on both
the client and the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Arguments: <br>
tunnel_ip[/netmask] <br>
This is the server&rsquo;s ip address on the tun interface.
The client will be given the next ip number in the range. It
is recommended to use the 10.0.0.0 or 172.16.0.0 ranges.
<br>
The default netmask is /27, can be overridden by specifying
it here. Using a smaller network will limit the number of
concurrent users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">topdomain <br>
The dns traffic is expected to arrive as queries for
subdomains under &rsquo;topdomain&rsquo;. This is normally a
subdomain to a domain you own. Use a short domain name to
get better <br>
throughput. This argument must be the same on both the
client and the server. Queries for domains other than
&rsquo;topdomain&rsquo; will be forwarded when the -b option
is given, <br>
otherwise they will be dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
See the README file for both a quick test scenario, and a
detailed description of real-world deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
Login is a relatively secure challenge-response MD5 hash,
with the password never passing the wire. However, all other
data is NOT encrypted in any way. The DNS traffic is also
<br>
vulnerable to replay, injection and man-in-the-middle
attacks, especially when iodined is used with the -c option.
Use of ssh or vpn tunneling is strongly recommended. On both
<br>
server and client, use iptables, pf or other firewalls to
block all traffic coming in from the tun interfaces, except
to the used ssh or vpn ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
IODINE_PASS <br>
If the environment variable IODINE_PASS is set, iodine will
use the value it is set to as password instead of asking for
one. The -P option still has precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IODINED_PASS <br>
If the environment variable IODINED_PASS is set, iodined
will use the value it is set to as password instead of
asking for one. The -P option still has precedence.</p>
