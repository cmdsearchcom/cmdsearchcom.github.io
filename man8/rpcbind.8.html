<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPCBIND(8) BSD System
Manager&rsquo;s Manual RPCBIND(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rpcbind &acirc; universal addresses to RPC program number
mapper</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rpcbind [-adhiLls]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The rpcbind utility is a server that converts RPC program
numbers into universal addresses. It must be running on the
host to be able to make RPC calls on a server on that <br>
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an RPC service is started,
it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening, and
the RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve. When a
client wishes to make an RPC <br>
call to a given program number, it first contacts rpcbind on
the server machine to determine the address where RPC
requests should be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rpcbind utility should be
started before any other RPC service. Normally, standard RPC
servers are started by port monitors, so rpcbind must be
started before port monitors <br>
are invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rpcbind is started, it
checks that certain name-to-address translation-calls
function correctly. If they fail, the network configuration
databases may be corrupt. Since RPC <br>
services cannot function correctly in this situation,
rpcbind reports the condition and terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rpcbind utility can only be
started by the super-user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a When debugging (-d), do an abort on errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Run in debug mode. In this
mode, rpcbind will log additional information during
operation, and will abort on certain errors if -a is also
specified. With this option, the <br>
name-to-address translation consistency checks are shown in
detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not fork and become a
background process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify specific IP addresses
to bind to for UDP requests. This option may be specified
multiple times and is typically necessary when running on a
multi-homed host. If <br>
no -h option is specified, rpcbind will bind to INADDR_ANY,
which could lead to problems on a multi-homed host due to
rpcbind returning a UDP packet from a different IP <br>
address than it was sent to. Note that when specifying IP
addresses with -h, rpcbind will automatically add 127.0.0.1
and if IPv6 is enabled, ::1 to the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &acirc;Insecure&acirc; mode.
Allow calls to SET and UNSET from any host. Normally rpcbind
accepts these requests only from the loopback interface for
security reasons. This change <br>
is necessary for programs that were compiled with earlier
versions of the rpc library and do not make those requests
using the loopback interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Turn on libwrap connection
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Cause rpcbind to change to
the user daemon as soon as possible. This causes rpcbind to
use non-privileged ports for outgoing connections,
preventing non-privileged clients <br>
from using rpcbind to connect to services from a privileged
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Cause rpcbind to do a
&quot;warm start&quot; by read a state file when rpcbind
starts up. The state file is created when rpcbind
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
All RPC servers must be restarted if rpcbind is
restarted.</p>
