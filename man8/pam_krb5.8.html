<p>pam_krb5(8) System Administrator&rsquo;s Manual
pam_krb5(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_krb5 - Kerberos 5 authentication</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
auth required //usr/$LIB/security/pam_krb5.so <br>
session optional //usr/$LIB/security/pam_krb5.so <br>
account sufficient //usr/$LIB/security/pam_krb5.so <br>
password sufficient //usr/$LIB/security/pam_krb5.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pam_krb5.so module is designed to allow smooth
integration of Kerberos 5 password-checking for applications
which use PAM. It creates session-specific credential
caches. If <br>
the system is an AFS client, it will also attempt to obtain
tokens for the local cell, the cell which contains the
user&rsquo;s home directory, and any explicitly-configured
cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user logs in, the
module&rsquo;s authentication function performs a simple
password check and, if possible, obtains Kerberos 5
credentials, caching them for later use. When the <br>
application requests initialization of credentials (or opens
a session), the usual ticket files are created. When the
application subsequently requests deletion of credentials
<br>
or closing of the session, the module deletes the ticket
files. When the application requests account management, if
the module did not participate in authenticating the user,
<br>
it will signal libpam to ignore the module. If the module
did participate in authenticating the user, it will check
for an expired user password and verify the user&rsquo;s
authoriza&acirc; <br>
tion using the .k5login file of the user being
authenticated, which is expected to be accessible to the
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
debug turns on debugging via syslog(3). Debugging messages
are logged with priority LOG_DEBUG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug_sensitive <br>
turns on debugging of sensitive information via syslog(3).
Debug messages are logged with priority LOG_DEBUG.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">afs_cells=cell.example.com[,...]
<br>
tells pam_krb5.so to obtain tokens for the named cells, in
addition to the local cell, for the user. The module will
guess the principal name of the AFS service for the <br>
named cells, or it can be specified by giving cell in the
form cellname=principalname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always_allow_localname <br>
tells pam_krb5.so, when performing an authorization check
using the target user&rsquo;s .k5login file, to always allow
access when the principal name being authenticated maps to
<br>
the local user&rsquo;s name (as configured using the
auth_to_local_names and auth_to_local settings in
krb5.conf(5), if your implementation provides those
settings). Otherwise, <br>
if the file exists and can be read, but the principal is not
explicitly listed, access is typically denied. This setting
is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">armor = true|false|service [...]
<br>
attempt to use armoring when communicating with the KDC.
This option is currently mainly only useful for testing, as
the keytab method should not be expected to work when <br>
the module is called from an unprivileged process, and the
pkinit method requires that the KDC is properly configured
to offer anonymous PKINIT, and that the client is <br>
also properly configured to trust the KDC&rsquo;s CA. The
default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">armor_strategy = keytab,pkinit
<br>
controls how the module will attempt to obtain tickets for
use as armor. The value should be a comma-separated list of
methods. Supported methods include ketyab and <br>
pkinit. The default is keytab,pkinit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">banner=Kerberos 5 <br>
tells pam_krb5.so how to identify itself when users attempt
to change their passwords. The default setting is
&quot;Kerberos 5&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccache_dir=/tmp <br>
tells pam_krb5.so which directory to use for storing
credential caches. The default setting is /tmp.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccname_template=FILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX
<br>
specifies the location in which to place the user&rsquo;s
session-specific credential cache. This value is treated as
a template, and these sequences are substituted: <br>
%u login name <br>
%U login UID <br>
%p principal name <br>
%r principal&rsquo;s realm name <br>
%h home directory <br>
%d the default ccache directory (as set with ccache_dir)
<br>
%P the current process ID <br>
%% literal &rsquo;%&rsquo; <br>
If the resulting template does not end with
&quot;XXXXXX&quot;, a suffix will be added to the configured
value. If not set, the module attempts to read the default
used by libkrb5 <br>
from krb5.conf(5), and if one is not found, the default is
FILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chpw_prompt <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to allow expired passwords to be changed
during authentication attempts. While this is the
traditional behavior exhibited by &quot;kinit&quot;, it is
inconsistent <br>
with the behavior expected by PAM, which expects
authentication to (appear to) succeed, only to have password
expiration be flagged by a subsequent call to the account
<br>
management function. Some applications which don&rsquo;t
handle password expiration correctly will fail
unconditionally if the user&rsquo;s password is expired, and
this flag can be <br>
used to attempt to work around this bug in those
applications. The default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cred_session <br>
specifies that pam_krb5 should create and destroy credential
caches, as it does when the calling application opens and
closes a PAM session, when the calling application <br>
establishes and deletes PAM credentials. This is done to
compensate for applications which expect to create a
credential cache but which don&rsquo;t use PAM session
management. <br>
It is usually a harmless redundancy in applications which
don&rsquo;t require it, so this option is enabled by default
except for these services: &quot;sshd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external=sshd <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to use Kerberos credentials provided by
the calling application during session setup. This is most
often useful for obtaining AFS tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_afs=true|false|service
[...] <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to completely ignore the presence of AFS,
preventing any attempts to obtain new tokens on behalf of
the calling application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_k5login <br>
specifies that pam_krb5 should skip checking the
user&rsquo;s .k5login file to verify that the principal name
of the client being authenticated is authorized to access
the user <br>
account. (Actually, the check is performed by a function
offered by the Kerberos library, which controls which files
it will consult.) The default is to perform the <br>
check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_unknown_principals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_unknown_spn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_unknown_upn <br>
specifies that not pam_krb5 should return a PAM_IGNORE code
to libpam instead of PAM_USER_UNKNOWN for users for whom the
determined principal name is expired or does not <br>
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keytab=FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab
<br>
tells pam_krb5.so the location of a keytab to use when
validating credentials obtained from KDCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimum_uid=0 <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to ignore authentication attempts by users
with UIDs below the specified number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multiple_ccaches <br>
specifies that pam_krb5 should maintain multiple credential
caches for this service, because it both sets credentials
and opens a PAM session, but it sets the KRB5CCNAME <br>
variable after doing only one of the two. This option is
usually not necessary for most services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_initial_prompt <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to not ask for a password before
attempting authentication, and to instead allow the Kerberos
library to trigger a request for a password only in cases
<br>
where one is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_subsequent_prompt <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to only provide the previously-entered
password in response to any request for a password which the
Kerberos library might make. If the calling applica&acirc;
<br>
tion does not properly support PAM conversations (possibly
due to limitations of a network protocol which it is
serving), this may be need to be used to prevent the
appli&acirc; <br>
cation from supplying the user&rsquo;s current password in a
password-changing situations when a new password is called
for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_user_check <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to not check if a user exists on the local
system, to skip authorization checks using the user&rsquo;s
.k5login file, and to create ccaches owned by the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent process&rsquo;s UID. This is useful for situations
where a non-privileged server process needs to use
Kerberized services on behalf of remote users who may not
have local <br>
access. Note that such a server should have an encrypted
connection with its client in order to avoid allowing the
user&rsquo;s password to be eavesdropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_validate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_validate=vlock <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to not attempt to use the local keytab to
verify that the TGT obtained from the realm&rsquo;s servers
has not been spoofed. The libdefaults ver&acirc; <br>
ify_ap_req_nofail setting can affect whether or not errors
reading the keytab which are encountered during validation
will be suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null_afs <br>
tells pam_krb5.so, when it attempts to set tokens, to try to
get credentials for services with names which resemble
afs@REALM before attempting to get credentials for
ser&acirc; <br>
vices with names resembling afs/cell@REALM. The default is
to assume that the cell&rsquo;s name is the instance in the
AFS service&rsquo;s Kerberos principal name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preauth_options=[] <br>
controls the preauthentication options which pam_krb5 passes
to libkrb5, if the system-defaults need to be overridden.
The list is treated as a template, and these <br>
sequences are substituted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u login name <br>
%U login UID <br>
%p principal name <br>
%r principal&rsquo;s realm name <br>
%h home directory <br>
%d the default ccache directory <br>
%P the current process ID <br>
%% literal &rsquo;%&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of recognized values
should be listed in the kinit(1) manual page as parameters
for its -X option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwhelp=filename <br>
specifies the name of a text file whose contents will be
displayed to clients who attempt to change their passwords.
There is no default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realm=realm <br>
overrides the default realm set in /etc/krb5.conf, which
pam_krb5.so will attempt to authenticate users to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tokens</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tokens=imap <br>
signals that pam_krb5.so should create a new AFS PAG and
obtain AFS tokens during authentication in addition to
session setup. This is primarily useful in server
applica&acirc; <br>
tions which need to access a user&rsquo;s files but which do
not open PAM sessions before doing so. A properly-written
server will not need this flag set in order to function <br>
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace turns on libkrb5&rsquo;s
library tracing. Trace messages are logged to syslog(3) with
priority LOG_DEBUG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">try_first_pass <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to check the previously-entered password
as with use_first_pass, but to prompt the user for another
one if the previously-entered one fails. This is the <br>
default mode of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_first_pass <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to get the user&rsquo;s entered password
as it was stored by a module listed earlier in the stack,
usually pam_unix or pam_pwdb, instead of prompting the user
<br>
for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_authtok <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to never prompt for new passwords when
changing passwords. This is useful if you are using
pam_cracklib or pam_passwdqc to try to enforce use of less-
<br>
easy-to-guess passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_shmem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_shmem=sshd <br>
tells pam_krb5.so to pass credentials from the
authentication service function to the session management
service function using shared memory, or to do so for
specific <br>
services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">validate_user_user</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">validate_user_user=gnome-screensaver
<br>
specifies that, when attempting validation of the TGT, the
module should attempt user-to-user authentication using a
previously-obtainted TGT in the default ccache if val&acirc;
<br>
idation can&rsquo;t be performed using a keytab.</p>
