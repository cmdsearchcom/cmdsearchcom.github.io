<p>POWERCOM(8) NUT Manual POWERCOM(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
powercom - UPS driver for serial Powercom/Trust/Advice UPS
equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the powercom driver. For information about the core
driver, see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
This driver supports many similar kinds of serial UPS
hardware (as well as a few USB UPS models with USB-to-serial
adapters). The most common ones are the Trust 425/625, <br>
Powercom, and Advice Partner/King PR750. Others using the
same protocol may also work. For USB connections, you might
need usbhid-ups(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more specific guidance on
which driver is applicable for a USB connection, see the NUT
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following optional settings in the
ups.conf(5) file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linevoltage=value <br>
An integer specifying the line voltage. It can&acirc;t be
auto detected. Acceptable values are in the range of 110-120
or 220-240. The default is 230.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manufacturer=name <br>
Specify the manufacturer name, which also can&acirc;t be
auto detected. This is a user defined string, so any name is
acceptable. The default is PowerCom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modelname=name <br>
Specify the model name, which also can&acirc;t be auto
detected. This is a user defined string, so any name is
acceptable. The default is Unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serialnumber=value <br>
Like modelname above, but for the serial number. The default
is Unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type=name <br>
The exact type of the communication protocol within the
powercom family, that will be used to communicate with the
UPS. The type is named after the first modelname that was
<br>
coded with that protocol. The acceptable names are Trust,
Egys, KP625AP, IMP, KIN, BNT, BNT-other and OPTI. The
default is Trust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BNT-other is a special type for
other BNT models (such as the 1500A at 120V and can be used
to override ALL models using ALL of the following
values.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdownArguments={{minutes,seconds},whether_minutes_should_be_used}
<br>
The minutes and seconds that the UPS should wait between
receiving the shutdown command and actually shutting off.
The other argument should be set to the character n only
<br>
when the minutes value should be skipped and not sent to the
UPS. The default is type-dependent and is given below. The
braces and commas are mandatory. Note that there <br>
should be no whitespace characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numOfBytesFromUPS=value <br>
The number of bytes in a UPS frame: 16 is common, 11 for
Trust. The default is type-dependent and is given below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">methodOfFlowControl=name <br>
The method of serial communication flow control that is
engaged by the UPS. The default is type-dependent and is
given below. Acceptable names are dtr0rts1, dtr1 or <br>
no_flow_control.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">validationSequence={{index1,value1},{index2,value2},{index3,value3}}
<br>
(Only for types KP625AP, Trust, Egys.) 3 pairs to be used
for validating the UPS by comparing bytes of the raw data
with constant values. The index selects the byte from the
<br>
UPS (see numOfBytesFromUPS) and the value is for matching to
the byte. The default is type-dependent and is given below.
The braces and commas are mandatory, as the lack of <br>
white space characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frequency={A,B} <br>
(Only for types KP625AP, Trust, Egys.) A pair to convert the
raw frequency data to a human-readable frequency reading
using the function 1/(A*x+B). If the raw value x IS the <br>
frequency, then set A=1/(x^2) and B=0. The default is
type-dependent and is given below. Do note that the braces
and commas are mandatory as well, as the lack of whitespace
<br>
characters.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadPercentage={BatteryA,BatteryB,LineA,LineB}
<br>
(Only for types KP625AP, Trust, Egys.) A quad to convert the
raw load data to human readable load percentage reading
using the function A*x+B. If the raw value x IS the Load
<br>
Percent, then set A=1 and B=0. The default is type-dependent
and is given below. Do note that the braces and commas are
mandatory, as the lack of white space characters.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">batteryPercentage={Battery1,Battery2,Battery3,Line4,Line5}
<br>
(Only for KP625AP, Trust, Egys.) A 5 tuple to convert the
raw battery and line data to a human-readable battery and
line percentage reading using the functions (Battery) <br>
A*x+B*y+C and (Line) D*x+E. If the raw value x IS the
Battery Percent, then set A=1, B=0, C=0, D=1, E=0. The
default is type-dependent and is given below. Do note that
the <br>
braces and commas are mandatory, as the lack of white space
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">voltage={240A,240B,120A,120B}
<br>
(Only for types KP625AP, Trust, Egys.) A quad that is used
convert the raw voltage data to a human-readable voltage
reading using the function A*x+B. If the raw value x IS <br>
HALF the Voltage, then set A=2, B=0. The default is
type-dependent and is given below. Do note that the braces
and commas are mandatory, as well as the lack of whitespace
<br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULT VALUES FOR THE EXTRA
ARGUMENTS <br>
linevoltage = 230 <br>
manufacturer = PowerCom <br>
modelname = Unknown <br>
serialnumber = Unknown <br>
type = Trust</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the default values
for the extra arguments are type-dependent. However,
BNT-other is a special type that can be used to override ALL
values for ALL models.</p>
