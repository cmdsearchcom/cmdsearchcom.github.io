<p>PAM_ABL(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_ABL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_abl - PAM Auto Blacklist Module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Provides auto blacklisting of hosts and users responsible
for repeated failed authentication attempts. Generally
configured so that blacklisted users still see normal login
<br>
prompts but are guaranteed to fail to authenticate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This functionality is only
available to services which call PAM as root. If pam_abl is
called for uid != 0 it will silently succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Brute force password discovery attacks involve repeated
attempts to authenticate against a service using a
dictionary of common passwords. While it is desirable to
enforce strong <br>
passwords for users this is not always possible and in cases
where a weak password has been used brute force attacks can
be effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pam_abl module monitors
failed authentication attempts and automatically blacklists
those hosts (and accounts) that are responsible for large
numbers of failed attempts. Once <br>
a host is blacklisted it is guaranteed to fail
authentication even if the correct credentials are
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blacklisting is triggered when
the number of failed authentication attempts in a particular
period of time exceeds a predefined limit. Hosts which stop
attempting to authenticate <br>
will, after a period of time, be un-blacklisted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands can be specified which
will be run when a host or user switches state from being
blocked to clear or clear to blocked. See below or the
pam_abl.conf(5) manpage for the <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pam_abl is called for uid !=
0 it will silently succeed. If this was not the case it
would be possible for a malicious local user to poison the
pam_abl data by, for example, <br>
discovering the names of the hosts from which root typically
logs in and then constructing PAM authentication code to
lock out root login attempts from those hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Name Arguments Description</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug None Enable debug output
to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expose_account None Ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_warn None Disable warnings
which are otherwise output to <br>
syslog. try_first_pass None Ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_first_pass None Ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_mapped_pass None Ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config Path to the configuration
file. The configuration file contains additional <br>
arguments. In order for the pam_abl command <br>
line tool to work correctly most of the <br>
configuration should be placed in the config <br>
file rather than being provided by arguments. <br>
The format of the config file is described <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limits Minimum and maximum
number of attempts to It&acirc;s value should have the
following syntax <br>
keep. &quot;&lt;minimum&gt;-&lt;maximum&gt;&quot;. If you do
not block <br>
machines that do too many attempts, the db can <br>
easily become bloated. To prevent this we <br>
introduced this setting. As soon as there are <br>
a &lt;maximum&gt; number of attempts for a <br>
user/host, the number of stored attempts is <br>
reduced to &lt;minimum&gt;. A &lt;maximum&gt; of 0 means
<br>
no limits. Make sure that &lt;minimum&gt; is larger <br>
then any rule specified. We recommend a value <br>
of &quot;1000-1200&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db_home Directory for db locking
and logging files. Path to a directory where Berkeley DB can
<br>
place it&acirc;s locking and logging files. Make <br>
sure this dir is writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_db Path to host database
file. Path to the Berkeley DB which is used to log <br>
the host responsible for failed authentication <br>
attempts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_purge Purge time for the
host database. Defines how long failed hosts are retained in
<br>
the host database. Defaults to 1 day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_rule Rule for host
blacklisting. The rule (see below for format) which defines
<br>
the conditions under which a failed hosts will <br>
be blackisted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_whitelist Host that do not
need to be tracked. ;-seperated list of host that do not
need to <br>
be tracked. You can specify single IP <br>
addresses here or use subnets. For example <br>
1.1.1.1 or 1.1.1.1/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_blk_cmd Host block command
Deprecated for security reasons. Please use <br>
host_block_cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_clr_cmd Host clear command
Deprecated for security reasons. Please use <br>
host_clear_cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_block_cmd Host block
command Command that should be run when a host is <br>
checked, and is currently blocked. Within the <br>
command, the strings %u, %h and %s are <br>
substituted with username, host and service. <br>
Not all need to be used. Please see the <br>
manpage of pam_abl.conf for the correct <br>
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host_clear_cmd Host clear
command Command that should be run when a host is <br>
checked, and is currently clear. Within the <br>
command, the strings %u, %h and %s are <br>
substituted with username, host and service. <br>
Not all need to be used. Please see the <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_db Path to user database
file. Path to the Berkeley DB which is used to log <br>
the user responsible for failed authentication <br>
attempts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_purge Purge time for the
user database. Defines how long failed users are retained in
<br>
the user database. Defaults to 1 day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_rule Rule for user
blacklisting. The rule (see below for format) which defines
<br>
the conditions under which a failed users will <br>
be blackisted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_whitelist Users that do not
need to be tracked. ;-seperated list of users whose attempts
do <br>
not need to be recorded. This does not prevent <br>
the machine they are using from being blocked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_blk_cmd User block command
Deprecated for security reasons. Please use <br>
user_block_cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_clr_cmd User clear command
Deprecated for security reasons. Please use <br>
clear_block_cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_blk_cmd User block command
Command that should be run when a user is <br>
checked, and is currently blocked. Within the <br>
command, the strings %u, %h and %s are <br>
substituted with username, host and service. <br>
Not all need to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_clr_cmd User block command
Command that should be run when a user is <br>
checked, and is currently clear. Within the <br>
command, the strings %u, %h and %s are <br>
substituted with username, host and service. <br>
Not all need to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Typically pam_abl.so is added to the auth stack as a
required module just before whatever modules actually
perform authentication. Here&acirc;s a fragment of the PAM
config for a <br>
production server that is running pam_abl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth required
/lib/security/pam_env.so <br>
auth required /lib/security/pam_abl.so <br>
config=/etc/security/pam_abl.conf <br>
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so likeauth nullok
<br>
auth required /lib/security/pam_deny.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although all of accepted
arguments can be supplied here they will usually be placed
in a separate config file and linked to using the config
argument as in the above example. The <br>
pam_abl command line tool reads the external config file
(/etc/security/pam_abl.conf in this case) to find the
databases so in order for it work correctly an external
config <br>
should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
auth required /lib/security/pam_env.so <br>
auth required /lib/security/pam_abl.so
config=/etc/security/pam_abl.conf <br>
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so likeauth nullok
<br>
