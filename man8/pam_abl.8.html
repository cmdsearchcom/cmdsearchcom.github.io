pam_abl - PAM Auto Blacklist Module
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Provides auto blacklisting of hosts and users responsible for repeated failed
  authentication attempts. Generally configured so that blacklisted users still
  see normal login prompts but are guaranteed to fail to authenticate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This functionality is only available to services which call PAM as root. If
  pam_abl is called for uid != 0 it will silently succeed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Brute force password discovery attacks involve repeated attempts to authenticate
  against a service using a dictionary of common passwords. While it is
  desirable to enforce strong passwords for users this is not always possible
  and in cases where a weak password has been used brute force attacks can be
  effective.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The pam_abl module monitors failed authentication attempts and automatically
  blacklists those hosts (and accounts) that are responsible for large numbers
  of failed attempts. Once a host is blacklisted it is guaranteed to fail
  authentication even if the correct credentials are provided.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Blacklisting is triggered when the number of failed authentication attempts in a
  particular period of time exceeds a predefined limit. Hosts which stop
  attempting to authenticate will, after a period of time, be un-blacklisted.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Commands can be specified which will be run when a host or user switches state
  from being blocked to clear or clear to blocked. See below or the
  pam_abl.conf(5) manpage for the details.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If pam_abl is called for uid != 0 it will silently succeed. If this was not the
  case it would be possible for a malicious local user to poison the pam_abl
  data by, for example, discovering the names of the hosts from which root
  typically logs in and then constructing PAM authentication code to lock out
  root login attempts from those hosts.

      this we introduced this setting. As soon as there are a &lt;maximum&gt;
      number of attempts for a user/host, the number of stored attempts is
      reduced to &lt;minimum&gt;. A &lt;maximum&gt; of 0 means no limits. Make
      sure that &lt;minimum&gt; is larger then any rule specified. We recommend
      a value of &quot;1000-1200&quot;.</td>

Typically pam_abl.so is added to the auth stack as a required module just before
  whatever modules actually perform authentication. Here&#x2019;s a fragment of
  the PAM config for a production server that is running pam_abl:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
auth required   /lib/security/pam_env.so
auth required   /lib/security/pam_abl.so
                config=/etc/security/pam_abl.conf
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so likeauth nullok
auth required   /lib/security/pam_deny.so
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Although all of accepted arguments can be supplied here they will usually be
  placed in a separate config file and linked to using the config argument as in
  the above example. The pam_abl command line tool reads the external config
  file (/etc/security/pam_abl.conf in this case) to find the databases so in
  order for it work correctly an external config should be used.
