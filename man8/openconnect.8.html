<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program openconnect connects to Cisco
&quot;AnyConnect&quot; VPN servers, which use standard TLS
and DTLS protocols for data transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connection happens in two
phases. First there is a simple HTTPS connection over which
the user authenticates somehow - by using a certificate, or
password or SecurID, etc. <br>
Having authenticated, the user is rewarded with an HTTP
cookie which can be used to make the real VPN
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second phase uses that
cookie in an HTTPS CONNECT request, and data packets can be
passed over the resulting connection. In auxiliary headers
exchanged with the CONNECT <br>
request, a Session-ID and Master Secret for a DTLS
connection are also exchanged, which allows data transport
over UDP to occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--config=CONFIGFILE <br>
Read further options from CONFIGFILE before continuing to
process options from the command line. The file should
contain long-format options as would be accepted on the <br>
command line, but without the two leading -- dashes. Empty
lines, or lines where the first non-space character is a #
character, are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any option except the config
option may be specified in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b,--background <br>
Continue in background after startup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid-file=PIDFILE <br>
Save the pid to PIDFILE when backgrounding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c,--certificate=CERT <br>
Use SSL client certificate CERT which may be either a file
name or, if OpenConnect has been built with an appropriate
version of GnuTLS, a PKCS#11 URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e,--cert-expire-warning=DAYS
<br>
Give a warning when SSL client certificate has DAYS left
before expiry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k,--sslkey=KEY <br>
Use SSL private key KEY which may be either a file name or,
if OpenConnect has been built with an appropriate version of
GnuTLS, a PKCS#11 URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C,--cookie=COOKIE <br>
Use WebVPN cookie. COOKIE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cookie-on-stdin <br>
Read cookie from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d,--deflate <br>
Enable all compression, including stateful modes. By
default, only stateless compression algorithms are
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D,--no-deflate <br>
Disable all compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compression=MODE <br>
Set compression mode, where MODE is one of stateless , none
, or all .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, only stateless
compression algorithms which do not maintain state from one
packet to the next (and which can be used on UDP transports)
are enabled. By setting <br>
the mode to all stateful algorithms (currently only zlib
deflate) can be enabled. Or all compression can be disabled
by setting the mode to none .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-dpd=INTERVAL <br>
Use INTERVAL as minimum Dead Peer Detection interval for
CSTP and DTLS, forcing use of DPD even when the server
doesn&rsquo;t request it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g,--usergroup=GROUP <br>
Use GROUP as login UserGroup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h,--help <br>
Display help text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--http-auth=METHODS <br>
Use only the specified methods for HTTP authentication to a
server. By default, only Negotiate, NTLM and Digest
authentication are enabled. Basic authentication is also
<br>
supported but because it is insecure it must be explicitly
enabled. The argument is a comma-separated list of methods
to be enabled. Note that the order does not matter: <br>
OpenConnect will use Negotiate, NTLM, Digest and Basic
authentication in that order, if each is enabled, regardless
of the order specified in the METHODS string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i,--interface=IFNAME <br>
Use IFNAME for tunnel interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l,--syslog <br>
Use syslog for progress messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timestamp <br>
Prepend a timestamp to each progress message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passtos <br>
Copy TOS / TCLASS of payload packet into DTLS packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U,--setuid=USER <br>
Drop privileges after connecting, to become user USER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--csd-user=USER <br>
Drop privileges during CSD (Cisco Secure Desktop) script
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--csd-wrapper=SCRIPT <br>
Run SCRIPT instead of the CSD (Cisco Secure Desktop)
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m,--mtu=MTU <br>
Request MTU from server as the MTU of the tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--base-mtu=MTU <br>
Indicate MTU as the path MTU between client and server on
the unencrypted network. Newer servers will automatically
calculate the MTU to be used on the tunnel from this <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p,--key-password=PASS <br>
Provide passphrase for certificate file, or SRK (System Root
Key) PIN for TPM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P,--proxy=PROXYURL <br>
Use HTTP or SOCKS proxy for connection. A username and
password can be provided in the given URL, and will be used
for authentication. If authentication is required but no
<br>
credentials are given, GSSAPI and automatic NTLM
authentication using Samba&rsquo;s ntlm_auth helper tool may
be attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-auth=METHODS <br>
Use only the specified methods for HTTP authentication to a
proxy. By default, only Negotiate, NTLM and Digest
authentication are enabled. Basic authentication is also
<br>
supported but because it is insecure it must be explicitly
enabled. The argument is a comma-separated list of methods
to be enabled. Note that the order does not matter: <br>
OpenConnect will use Negotiate, NTLM, Digest and Basic
authentication in that order, if each is enabled, regardless
of the order specified in the METHODS string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-proxy <br>
Disable use of proxy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--libproxy <br>
Use libproxy to configure proxy automatically (when built
with libproxy support)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--key-password-from-fsid <br>
Passphrase for certificate file is automatically generated
from the fsid of the file system on which it is stored. The
fsid is obtained from the statvfs(2) or statfs(2) <br>
system call, depending on the operating system. On a Linux
or similar system with GNU coreutils, the fsid used by this
option should be equal to the output of the command: <br>
stat --file-system --printf=%i\n $CERTIFICATE <br>
It is not the same as the 128-bit UUID of the file
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q,--quiet <br>
Less output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q,--queue-len=LEN <br>
Set packet queue limit to LEN pkts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s,--script=SCRIPT <br>
Invoke SCRIPT to configure the network after connection.
Without this, routing and name service are unlikely to work
correctly. The script is expected to be compatible <br>
with the vpnc-script which is shipped with the
&quot;vpnc&quot; VPN client. See
http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/vpnc-script.html for
more information. This version of OpenCon&acirc; <br>
nect is configured to use /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, a relative directory
for the default script will be handled as starting from the
directory that the openconnect executable is running from,
rather than the <br>
current directory. The script will be invoked with the
command-based script host cscript.exe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S,--script-tun <br>
Pass traffic to &rsquo;script&rsquo; program over a UNIX
socket, instead of to a kernel tun/tap device. This allows
the VPN IP traffic to be handled entirely in userspace, for
example <br>
by a program which uses lwIP to provide SOCKS access into
the VPN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u,--user=NAME <br>
Set login username to NAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V,--version <br>
Report version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v,--verbose <br>
More output (may be specified multiple times for additional
output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x,--xmlconfig=CONFIG <br>
XML config file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--authgroup=GROUP <br>
Choose authentication login selection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--authenticate <br>
Authenticate only, and output the information needed to make
the connection a form which can be used to set shell
environment variables. When invoked with this option, <br>
openconnect will not make the connection, but if successful
will output something like the following to stdout: <br>

COOKIE=3311180634@13561856@1339425499@B315A0E29D16C6FD92EE...
<br>
HOST=10.0.0.1 <br>
FINGERPRINT=469bb424ec8835944d30bc77c77e8fc1d8e23a42 <br>
Thus, you can invoke openconnect as a non-privileged user
(with access to the user&rsquo;s PKCS#11 tokens, etc.) for
authentication, and then invoke openconnect separately to
<br>
make the actual connection as root: <br>
eval &lsquo;openconnect --authenticate
https://vpnserver.example.com&lsquo;; <br>
[ -n $COOKIE ] &amp;&amp; echo $COOKIE | <br>
sudo openconnect --cookie-on-stdin $HOST --servercert
$FINGERPRINT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cookieonly <br>
Fetch webvpn cookie only; don&rsquo;t connect</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--printcookie <br>
Print webvpn cookie before connecting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cafile=FILE <br>
Cert file for server verification</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-ipv6 <br>
Do not advertise IPv6 capability to server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dtls-ciphers=LIST <br>
Set OpenSSL ciphers to support for DTLS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dtls-local-port=PORT <br>
Use PORT as the local port for DTLS datagrams</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-http-traffic <br>
Enable verbose output of all HTTP requests and the bodies of
all responses received from the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-system-trust <br>
Do not trust the system default certificate authorities. If
this option is given, only certificate authorities given
with the --cafile option, if any, will be trusted <br>
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pfs Enforces Perfect Forward
Secrecy (PFS). That ensures that if the server&rsquo;s
long-term key is compromised, any session keys established
before the compromise will be unaf&acirc; <br>
fected. If this option is provided and the server does not
support PFS in the TLS channel the connection will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PFS is available in Cisco ASA
releases 9.1(2) and higher; a suitable cipher suite may need
to be manually enabled by the administrator using the ssl
encryption setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-dtls <br>
Disable DTLS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-http-keepalive <br>
Version 8.2.2.5 of the Cisco ASA software has a bug where it
will forget the client&rsquo;s SSL certificate when HTTP
connections are being re-used for multiple requests. So <br>
far, this has only been seen on the initial connection,
where the server gives an HTTP/1.0 redirect response with an
explicit Connection: Keep-Alive directive. OpenConnect <br>
as of v2.22 has an unconditional workaround for this, which
is never to obey that directive after an HTTP/1.0
response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, Cisco&rsquo;s support
team has failed to give any competent response to the bug
report and we don&rsquo;t know under what other
circumstances their bug might manifest itself. <br>
So this option exists to disable ALL re-use of HTTP sessions
and cause a new connection to be made for each request. If
your server seems not to be recognising your cer&acirc; <br>
tificate, try this option. If it makes a difference, please
report this information to the
openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-passwd <br>
Never attempt password (or SecurID) authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-xmlpost <br>
Do not attempt to post an XML authentication/configuration
request to the server; use the old style GET method which
was used by older clients and servers instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is a temporary
safety net, to work around potential compatibility issues
with the code which falls back to the old method
automatically. It causes OpenConnect <br>
to behave more like older versions (4.08 and below) did. If
you find that you need to use this option, then you have
found a bug in OpenConnect. Please see <br>
http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/mail.html and report
this to the developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-inter <br>
Do not expect user input; exit if it is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passwd-on-stdin <br>
Read password from standard input</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--protocol=PROTO <br>
Select VPN protocol PROTO to be used for the connection.
Supported protocols are anyconnect for Cisco AnyConnect (the
default), and nc for experimental support for Juniper <br>
Network Connect (also supported by Junos Pulse servers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--token-mode=MODE <br>
Enable one-time password generation using the MODE
algorithm. --token-mode=rsa will call libstoken to generate
an RSA SecurID tokencode, --token-mode=totp will call <br>
liboath to generate an RFC 6238 time-based password, and
--token-mode=hotp will call liboath to generate an RFC 4226
HMAC-based password. Yubikey tokens which generate <br>
OATH codes in hardware are supported with
--token-mode=yubioath</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--token-secret={
SECRET[,COUNTER] | @FILENAME } <br>
The secret to use when generating one-time
passwords/verification codes. Base 32-encoded TOTP/HOTP
secrets can be used by specifying &quot;base32:&quot; at the
beginning of the <br>
secret, and for HOTP secrets the token counter can be
specified following a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSA SecurID secrets can be
specified as an Android/iPhone URI or a raw numeric CTF
string (with or without dashes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Yubikey OATH the token
secret specifies the name of the credential to be used. If
not provided, the first OATH credential found on the device
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILENAME, if specified, can
contain any of the above strings. Or, it can contain a
SecurID XML (SDTID) seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is omitted, and
--token-mode is &quot;rsa&quot;, libstoken will try to use
the software token seed saved in ~/.stokenrc by the
&quot;stoken import&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reconnect-timeout <br>
Keep reconnect attempts until so much seconds are elapsed.
The default timeout is 300 seconds, which means that
openconnect can recover VPN connection after a temporary
<br>
network down time of 300 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resolve=HOST:IP <br>
Automatically resolve the hostname HOST to IP instead of
using the normal resolver to look it up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--servercert=HASH <br>
Accept server&rsquo;s SSL certificate only if the provided
fingerprint matches. The allowed fingerprint types are SHA1,
and SHA256. They are distinguished by the
&rsquo;sha1:&rsquo; or <br>
&rsquo;sha256:&rsquo; prefixes to the hex encoded hash. To
ease certain testing use-cases, a partial match of the hash
will also be accepted, if it is at least 4 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--useragent=STRING <br>
Use STRING as &rsquo;User-Agent:&rsquo; field value in HTTP
header. (e.g. --useragent &rsquo;Cisco AnyConnect VPN Agent
for Windows 2.2.0133&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local-hostname=STRING <br>
Use STRING as &rsquo;X-CSTP-Hostname:&rsquo; field value in
HTTP header. For example --local-hostname
&rsquo;mypc&rsquo;, will advertise the value
&rsquo;mypc&rsquo; as the suggested hostname to point to the
<br>
provided IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--os=STRING <br>
OS type to report to gateway. Recognized values are: linux,
linux-64, win, mac-intel, android, apple-ios. Reporting a
different OS type may affect the dynamic access <br>
policy (DAP) applied to the VPN session. If the gateway
requires CSD, it will also cause the corresponding CSD
trojan binary to be downloaded, so you may need to use <br>
--csd-wrapper if this code is not executable on the local
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
In the data phase of the connection, the following signals
are handled:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT performs a clean shutdown
by logging the session off, disconnecting from the gateway,
and running the vpnc-script to restore the network
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP disconnects from the
gateway and runs the vpnc-script, but does not log the
session off; this allows for reconnection later using
--cookie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
forces an immediate disconnection and reconnection; this can
be used to quickly recover from LAN IP address changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM <br>
exits immediately without logging off or running
vpnc-script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Note that although IPv6 has been tested on all platforms on
which openconnect is known to run, it depends on a suitable
vpnc-script to configure the network. The standard <br>
vpnc-script shipped with vpnc 0.5.3 is not capable of
setting up IPv6 routes; the one from
git://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git will be
required.</p>
