<p>STINIT(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual STINIT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
stinit - initialize SCSI magnetic tape drives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
stinit [-f conf-file] [-h] [-p] [-r] [-v] [devices...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents the tape control program stinit
can used to initialize SCSI tape drive modes at system
startup, after loading the tape driver as module, or after
<br>
introduction of new device to the SCSI subsystem at
run-time. The initialization is performed by sending ioctl
commands to the drive. The commands are defined in a text
file that <br>
is indexed using the inquiry data the drive returns
(manufacturer, device, revision). Values for all of the
general and mode-specific SCSI tape parameters up to Linux
version <br>
2.6.0 can be initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f conf-file <br>
Specifies the name of the text file containing the
definitions for different tape drive types. By default
stinit tries to find the definition file stinit.def or <br>
/etc/stinit.def (in this order).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print the usage
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p The definition file is parsed
but no tape drive initialization is attempted. This option
can be used for testing the integrity of a definition file
after changes have been <br>
made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Rewind every device being
initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v The more -v options
(currently up to two), the more verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DEVICES BEING INITIALIZED
<br>
If the program is started without arguments, it tries to
find all accessible SCSI tape devices and the device files
for the different modes of the devices. The tape drives are
<br>
searched in the scanning order of the kernel and searching
is stopped at the first non-existing tape. All of the found
devices are initialized if a matching description is found
<br>
from the parameter file. Note that a mode for a device is
not initialized if the corresponding device file is not
found even if a matching description for the mode exists.
The <br>
non-rewind device is preferred over the auto-rewind device
for each mode. If the directory /dev/tapes is found, the
devfs filesystem is assumed to be mounted on /dev.
Otherwise, <br>
the directories /dev/scsi and /dev are scanned for device
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCSI tape drives can be
initialized selectively using program arguments. A numeric
argument specifies the number of the tape drive in the
scanning order of the kernel. A file <br>
name specifies that the device corresponding to this name is
to be initialized. If the file name is given without the
directory specification, the program searches for the name
<br>
in the device directories /dev/scsi and /dev. Only full path
names are supported with devfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file is a simple text file that contains
descriptions of tape drives and the corresponding
initialization parameters. The parameter definition blocks
are delim&acirc; <br>
ited by {}. Specification of the drive description is
restarted after each parameter definition block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The drive descriptions and the
parameter definitions consist of pairs name = value. The
value is either a numeric parameter, a string not containing
blanks, or a quoted string. <br>
In case of a numeric parameter, the postfix k or M can be
used to give the value in units of 1024 or 1024 * 1024,
respectively. If the =value -part is omitted, the value
&quot;1&quot; is <br>
used. If the character # is found from an input line, the
rest of the line is discarded. This allows use of comments
in the definition file. The following example contains
defi&acirc; <br>
nitions for one type of tape drives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># The XY dat <br>
manufacturer=XY-COMPANY model = &quot;UVW DRIVE&quot; { <br>
scsi2logical=1 # Common definitions for all modes <br>
can-bsr can-partitions auto-lock <br>
# Definition of modes <br>
mode1 blocksize=0 compression=1 <br>
mode2 blocksize=1024 compression=1 <br>
mode3 blocksize=0 compression=0 <br>
mode4 blocksize = 1k compression=0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The devices are identified using
zero or more of the following keywords corresponding to the
data returned by the tape device as response to the SCSI
INQUIRY command. The matches <br>
are case-sensitive and performed up to the length defined in
the configuration file (permitting use of partial
matches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manufacturer= <br>
This keyword specifies the string that must match the vendor
identification returned by the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">model= This keyword defines the
string that must match the product identification returned
by the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revision= <br>
This keyword matched the string that must match the product
revision level returned by the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the matching
initializations are collected in the order they are defined
in the file. This means that common parameters can be
defined for all devices using zero keywords <br>
for a definition block. Another consequence is that, for
instance, some parameters can be easily given different
values for a specific firmware revision without repeating
the <br>
parameters common to all revisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tape parameters are defined
using the following keywords. More thorough description of
the parameters can be found from the st(4) man page (not up
to date when this is writ&acirc; <br>
ten) or from the file drivers/scsi/README.st in the Linux
kernel source tree. The keywords are matched using only the
first characters. The part of the keywords not used in <br>
matching is enclosed by []. The numeric values may be
specified either in decimal notation or hexadecimal notation
(using the prefix 0x).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drive-[buffering]=value <br>
The drive&rsquo;s buffering parameter is set to value. This
parameter if common for all modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cleaning <br>
The cleaning request notifying parameter is set to value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-w[ait] <br>
The immediate mode is used with commands like rewind if
value is non-zero (i.e., the driver does not wait for the
command to finish).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode=value <br>
This keyword starts definition of tape mode value. The
number of the mode must be between 1 and 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disab[led]=value <br>
This mode is disabled for this device if value is non-zero.
Can be used if some mode defined in a more general
definition should be disabled by a more specific definition
<br>
for some device (for example, for a device with buggy
firmware level).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block[size]=value <br>
The default tape block size is set to value. bytes. The
block size zero means variable block mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dens[ity]=value <br>
The tape density code is set to value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buff[ering]=value <br>
The buffered writes by the driver in fixed block mode are
enabled if value is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">async[-writes]=value <br>
Asynchronous writes by the driver are enabled if value is
non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read[-ahead]=value <br>
Read-ahead by the driver in fixed block mode is allowed if
value is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">two[-fms]=value <br>
Two filemarks are written when a file being written to is
closed if value is non-zero. By default, one filemark is
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comp[ression]=value <br>
Compression of the data by the drive is enabled if value is
non-zero. Note that the tape driver can&rsquo;t enable
compression for all drives that can compress data. Note also
<br>
that some drives define compression using density codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto[-lock]=value <br>
The tape drive door is locked automatically when the device
file is opened if value is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fast[-eom]=value <br>
The MTEOM command is performed using the SCSI command that
spaces directly to the end of medium if value is non-zero.
The drawback is that the file number in the status <br>
becomes invalid. By default, spacing to end of medium is
performed by spacing over filemarks until end of medium is
detected and the file number remains valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can-b[sr]=value <br>
Backspacing over records is used by the driver when
repositioning the tape when read-ahead is enabled if value
is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noblk[limits]=value <br>
The tape driver does not use the READ BLOCK LIMITS SCSI
command when the device is being opened if value is
non-zero. This is for the drives that do not support this
SCSI <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can-p[artitions]=value <br>
The support for tape partitions is enabled if value is
non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scsi2[logical]=value <br>
Logical block addresses are used in the MTSEEK and MTIOCPOS
commands if value is non-zero. The default is to use the
device-specific addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sili=value <br>
If value is non-zero, the SILI bit is set when reading in
variable block mode. This may speed up reading blocks
shorter than the read byte count. Set this only if you know
<br>
that the drive supports SILI and the HBA reliably returns
transfer residual byte counts. Requires kernel version &gt;=
2.6.26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defs-for-w[rites]=value <br>
The parameters defining the tape format (density, block
size, etc.) are forced when writing starts at the beginning
of a tape if value is non-zero. The default is to <br>
change there parameters each time the device is opened at
the beginning of a tape (or the mode is changed in the
middle of a tape).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysv=value <br>
The System V tape semantics are used if value is non-zero.
Otherwise the BSD semantics are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout=value <br>
The normal timeout for the device is set to value
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long-time[out]=value <br>
The long timeout for the device is set to value seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
The program exits with value one if the command line is
incorrect, the definition file is not found, or option -p is
given and parsing the definition file fails. In all other
<br>
cases the return value is zero (i.e., failing of
initialization is not currently signaled by the return
value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
With the exception of the -p option, the program can be used
only by the superuser. This is because the program uses
ioctls allowed only for the superuser.</p>
