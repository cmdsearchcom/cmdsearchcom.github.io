<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lircd - Decode infrared signals and provide them on a
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lircd [options] [config file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The main task of lircd is to decode the infrared signals and
provide an uniform interface for client applications.
Clients can connect to lircd through a Unix domain socket,
by <br>
default /var/run/lirc/lircd. Using this socket they will get
the infrared codes received by lircd and they can send
commands to lircd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
config file <br>
The configuration file, by default /etc/lirc/lircd.conf. A
relative path is interpreted from /etc/lirc. The default
configuration file includes all files in <br>
/etc/lircd.conf.d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each remote which should be
decoded by lircd usually requires that a specific file is
used e. g., by copying it to /etc/lirc/lirc.conf.d/. The
format is described in <br>
lircd.conf(5). Configuration files could be found using
irdb-get(1) or lirc-setup(1). It&rsquo;s also possible to
generate a config file using irrecord(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Common options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --device &lt;device&gt; <br>
Select the character device which lircd should read from.
The default is currently /dev/lirc0 on most systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the devinput driver,
you can use name=STRING or phys=STRING to select the device;
lircd will look in /dev/input to find a device with a
matching description. This <br>
is useful in case the device name isn&rsquo;t fixed. STRING
may contain the &rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;?&rsquo;
wildcards and &rsquo;&acute; to mark them as literal. Use
dmesg(1) to find the name and bus address <br>
(the names used under /dev/input/by-id are not always
usable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --driver &lt;driver&gt; <br>
The driver to use. Using --driver help lists all available
drivers, see DRIVER LOADING below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Displays short help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --allow-simulate <br>
Enable the SIMULATE command which can be issued using
irsend(1) or the client API. This will allow simulating
arbitrary IR events from the command line. Use this option
with <br>
caution because it will give all users with access to the
lircd socket wide control over the system. E.g., if you have
configured your system to shut down by a button press <br>
on your remote control, everybody will be able to shut down
your system from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --connect
[host[:port]][,[host[:port]]] <br>
Connects to other lircd servers that provide a network
socket at the given host and port number (see --listen). The
number of such connections is currently limited to 100. <br>
The connecting lircd instance will receive IR events from
the lircd instance it connects to. To connect to multiple
servers, add them as a comma separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --effective-user &lt;uid&gt;
<br>
If started as user root, lircd drops it privileges and runs
as user &lt;uid&gt; after opening files etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --immediate-init <br>
Lircd normally initializes the driver when the first client
connects. If this option is selected, the driver is instead
initialized immediately at start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --driver-options
key:value[|key:value...] <br>
Set one or more options for the driver. The argument is a
list of key:value pairs delimited by &rsquo;|&rsquo;. The
key can not contain spaces, but such are allowed in the
value part. <br>
Certain characters including &rsquo;#&rsquo; and
&rsquo;;&rsquo; are used as comment markers in the config
file and are not allowed anywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y, --dynamic-codes
[EXPERIMENTAL] <br>
Allows use of codes which have been decoded for one remote
but are not defined in lircd.conf. New codes are dynamically
created with a default name. This feature is experi&acirc;
<br>
mental and subject to all sorts of changes. It has not ben
tested thoroughly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --listen [[address:]port]]
<br>
Let lircd listen for network connections on the given
address/port. The default address is 0.0.0.0, which means
that connections on all network interfaces will be accepted.
<br>
The address must be given in dotted numerical form. The
default port is 8765. No security checks are currently
implemented. The listening lircd instance will send all IR
<br>
events to the connecting lircd instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --logfile &lt;logfile
path&gt; <br>
Select the lircd daemon log file. logfile is either the
string &rsquo;syslog&rsquo; indicating that syslog(1) should
be used or a log file path. The default is to use
syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --loglevel [level] <br>
Determine the amount of logging information. level can be a
symbolic syslog level: &rsquo;error&rsquo;,&rsquo;warning,
&rsquo;info&rsquo;, &rsquo;notice&rsquo; or
&rsquo;debug&rsquo;. lircd also defines three additional
levels <br>
&rsquo;trace&rsquo;, &rsquo;trace1&rsquo; and
&rsquo;trace2&rsquo; which gives even more messages
(&rsquo;trace2&rsquo; bringing the most). However, in the
log these messages are marked as &rsquo;debug&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The level can also be an integer
in the range 3 (almost no messages) to 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --options-file &lt;path&gt;
<br>
File containing default values for all options. A relative
path is interpreted from current directory. See [FILES]
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output &lt;output
socket&gt; <br>
Select Unix domain socket, which lircd will write remote key
codes to. The default currently is /var/run/lirc/lircd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --permission &lt;perm&gt;
<br>
Gives the file permission of the output socket if it has to
be created in octal representation. See chmod(1). If no
--permission option is given when the socket is initially
<br>
created the default is to give all users read and write
permissions (0666 in octal representation). If the socket
already exists this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pidfile &lt;path&gt; <br>
Select the lircd daemon pid file, defaults to
/var/run/lirc/lircd.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U --plugindir &lt;path&gt; <br>
Sets the directory from which lircd loads it&rsquo;s
userspace drivers. These are *.so files, by default found as
described under DRIVER LOADING. The argument is a
:-separated <br>
search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --release [suffix] <br>
Enables automatic generation of release events for each
button press. lircd will append the given suffix to the
button name for each release event. If no suffix is given
the <br>
default suffix is &rsquo;_UP&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --repeat-max &lt;limit&gt;
<br>
Sets an upper limit to the number of repeats when sending a
signal. The current default is 600. A SEND_START request
will repeat the signal this many times. Also, if the
num&acirc; <br>
ber of repeats in a SEND_ONCE request exceeds this number,
it will be replaced by this number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --uinput <br>
[DEPRECATED] Enable automatic generation of Linux input
events. Obsoleted by the lircd-uinput(8) tool and the
lircd-uinput.service systemd service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKET BROADCAST MESSAGES FORMAT
<br>
When decoding a button press or receiving a SIGHUP signal
lircd.conf lircd broadcasts messages to all connected
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each decoded button press a
package is made available on the socket. This is printable
data formatted as: <br>
&lt;code&gt; &lt;repeat count&gt; &lt;button name&gt;
&lt;remote control name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e.g., <br>
0000000000f40bf0 00 KEY_UP ANIMAX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">code <br>
A 16 hexadecimal digits number encoding of the IR signal.
It&rsquo;s usage in applications is deprecated and it should
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repeat count <br>
shows how long the user has been holding down a button. The
counter will start at 0 and increment each time a new IR
signal has been received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">button name <br>
is the name of a key defined in the lircd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote control name <br>
is the mandatory name attribute in the lircd.conf config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These packets are broadcasted to
all clients. The only other situation when lircd broadcasts
to all clients is when it receives the SIGHUP signal and
successfully re-reads its <br>
config file. Then it will send a SIGHUP packet to its
clients indicating that its configuration might have
changed. The sighup packet is three lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN <br>
SIGHUP <br>
END</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKET COMMAND INTERFACE <br>
Applications can also send commands to lircd over the socket
interface. The most common task is sending data, but there
are also other commands. Each command is a single
print&acirc; <br>
able line, terminated with a newline. For each command,
lircd replies with a reply package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEND_ONCE &lt;remote control&gt;
&lt;button name&gt; [repeats] <br>
Tell lircd to send the IR signal associated with the given
remote control and button name, and then repeat it repeats
times. repeats is a decimal number between 0 and <br>
repeat_max. The latter can be given as a --repeat-max
command line argument to lircd, and defaults to 600. If
repeats is not specified or is less than the minimum number
of <br>
repeats for the selected remote control, the minimum value
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEND_START &lt;remote control
name&gt; &lt;button name&gt; <br>
Tell lircd to start repeating the given button until it
receives a SEND_STOP command. However, the number of repeats
is limited to repeat_max. lircd won&rsquo;t accept any new
<br>
send commands while it is repeating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEND_STOP &lt;remote control
name&gt; &lt;button name&gt; <br>
Tell lircd to abort a SEND_START command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST [remote control] <br>
Without arguments lircd replies with a list of all defined
remote controls. Given a remote control argument, lircd
replies with a list of all keys defined in the given <br>
remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SET_INPUTLOG [path] <br>
Given a path, lircd will start logging all received data on
that file. The log is printable lines as defined in mode2(1)
describing pulse/space durations. Without a path, <br>
current logfile is closed and the logging is stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRV_OPTION key value <br>
Make lircd invoke the drvctl_func(DRVCTL_SET_OPTION, option)
with option being made up by the parsed key and value. The
return package reflects the outcome of the <br>
drvctl_func call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMULATE key data <br>
Given key data, instructs lircd to send this to all clients
i. e., to simulate that this key has been decoded. The key
data must be formatted exactly as the packet <br>
described in [SOCKET BROADCAST MESSAGES FORMAT], notably is
the number of digits in code and repeat count hardcoded.
This command is only accepted if the --allow-simulate <br>
command line option is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SET_TRANSMITTERS transmitter
mask <br>
Make lircd invoke the drvctl_func(LIRC_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK,
&amp;channels), where channels is the decoded value of
transmitter mask. See lirc(4) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
Tell lircd to send a version packet response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol guarantees that
broadcasted messages won&rsquo;t interfere with reply
packets. But broadcasts may appear at any point between
packets. The only exception are SIGHUP pack&acirc; <br>
ages. These may appear just after you have sent a command to
lircd, so you have to make sure you don&rsquo;t confuse them
with replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the reply packet
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN <br>
&lt;command&gt; <br>
[SUCCESS|ERROR] <br>
[DATA <br>
n <br>
n lines of data] <br>
END</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command was successful,
data is only sent for the commands that return some
information. Note that a packet containing 0 lines of data
can be a valid reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING AS REGULAR USER <br>
Traditionally lircd has been running as root since accessing
kernel devices like /dev/lirc0 by default requires root
privileges. However, running a long-running service like
<br>
this is a major security issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lirc distribution contains
example udev rules which makes /dev/lirc[0-9] , USB and
serial devices accessible by the lirc user. Using these
rules, it is possible to run lircd <br>
as a regular user and group such as lirc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/lirc/lircd.conf <br>
Main config file, see lircd.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf <br>
The options file. lircd handles the values under the [lircd]
section in this file. The location can be changed using the
-O/--options-file command-line option or using the <br>
environment variable LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH. The values here are
used as defaults for any option not present on command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH <br>
Options file path, see FILES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIRC_PLUGINDIR <br>
Plugin load path, se DRIVER LOADING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIRC_DEBUG_OPTIONS <br>
If set, enables debugging in early stages when the --debug
option is yet not parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRIVER LOADING <br>
Drivers are loaded dynamically. This is done from a
traditional *ux &Acirc;&acute;:&Acirc;&acute;-separated path
where each component in the path is searched (leading part
first, trailing last).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path used for this is
determined by (falling priority):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The --plugindir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The &rsquo;plugindir&rsquo;
entry in the [lircd] section of the lirc_options.conf
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The environment variable
LIRC_PLUGINDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A hardcoded default
(/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lirc/plugins).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
HUP On receiving SIGHUP lircd re-reads the lircd.conf
configuration file (but not lirc_options.conf) and adjusts
itself if the file has changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USR1 <br>
On receiving SIGUSR1 lircd makes a clean exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DAEMONS <br>
lircd is a daemon. You should start it in some init script
depending on your system. Besides the systemd setup which is
installed by default there are also example scripts for <br>
other distros and init systems in the contrib directory.</p>
