DOCHECKGROUPS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
docheckgroups - Process checkgroups and output a list of
changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
docheckgroups [-u] [include-pattern [exclude-pattern]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
docheckgroups is usually run by controlchan in order to
process checkgroups control messages. It reads a list of
newsgroups along with their descriptions on its standard
input. <br>
That list should be formatted like the newsgroups(5) file:
each line contains the name of a newsgroup followed by one
or more tabulations and its description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">docheckgroups will only check
the presence of newsgroups which match include-pattern (an
egrep expression like &quot;^comp..*$&quot; for newsgroups
starting with &quot;comp.&quot;) and which do not <br>
match exclude-pattern (also an egrep expression) except for
newsgroups mentioned in the pathetc/localgroups file. This
file is also formatted like the newsgroups(5) file and <br>
should contain local newsgroups which would otherwise be
mentioned for removal. There is no need to put local
newsgroups of hierarchies for which no checkgroups control
messages <br>
are sent, unless you manually process checkgroups texts for
them. Lines beginning with a hash sign (&quot;#&quot;) are
not taken into account in this file. All the newsgroups and
<br>
descriptions mentioned in pathetc/localgroups are appended
to the processed checkgroups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If exclude-pattern is given,
include-pattern should also be given before (you can use an
empty string (&quot;&quot;) if you want to include all the
newsgroups). Be that as it may, <br>
docheckgroups will only check newsgroups in the top-level
hierarchies which are present in the checkgroups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, docheckgroups checks the
active and newsgroups files and displays on its standard
output a list of changes, if any. It does not change
anything by default; it only points <br>
out what should be changed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Newsgroups which
should be removed (they are in the active file but not in
the checkgroups) and the relevant ctlinnd commands to
achieve that;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Newsgroups which
should be added (they are not in the active file but in the
checkgroups) and the relevant ctlinnd commands to achieve
that;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Newsgroups which
are incorrectly marked as moderated or unmoderated (they are
both in the active file and the checkgroups but their status
differs) and the relevant ctlinnd <br>
commands to fix that;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Descriptions
which should be removed (they are in the newsgroups file but
not in the checkgroups);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Descriptions
which should be added (they are not in the newsgroups file
but in the checkgroups).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of docheckgroups can
be fed into mod-active (it will pause the news server,
update the active file accordingly, reload it and resume the
work of the news server) or <br>
into the shell (commands for ctlinnd will be processed one
by one). In order to update the newsgroups file, the -u flag
must be given to docheckgroups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When processing a checkgroups
manually, it is always advisable to first check the raw
output of docheckgroups. Then, if everything looks fine, use
mod-active and the -u flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-u If this flag is given, docheckgroups will update the
newsgroups file: it removes obsolete descriptions and adds
new ones. It also sorts this file alphabetically and
improves <br>
its general format (see newsgroups(5) for an explanation of
the preferred number of tabulations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
So as to better understand how docheckgroups works, here are
examples with the following active file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a.first 0000000000 0000000001 y
<br>
a.second.announce 0000000000 0000000001 y <br>
a.second.group 0000000000 0000000001 y <br>
b.additional 0000000000 0000000001 y <br>
b.third 0000000000 0000000001 y <br>
c.fourth 0000000000 0000000001 y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the following newsgroups file
(using tabulations):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a.first First group. <br>
a.second.announce Announce group. <br>
a.second.group Second group. <br>
b.third Third group. <br>
c.fourth Fourth group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the following localgroups
file (using tabulations):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b.additional A local newsgroup I
want to keep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The checkgroups we process is in
the file test which contains:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a.first First group. <br>
a.second.announce Announce group. (Moderated) <br>
a.second.group Second group. <br>
b.third Third group. <br>
c.fourth Fourth group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If we run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat test | docheckgroups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">docheckgroups will output that
a.second.announce is incorrectly marked as unmoderated and
that its description is obsolete. Besides, two new
descriptions will be mentioned for <br>
addition (the new one for a.second.announce and the missing
description for b.additional -- it should indeed be in the
newsgroups file and not only in localgroups). Now that we
<br>
have checked the output of docheckgroups and that we agree
with the changes, we run it with the -u flag to update the
newsgroups file and we redirect the standard output to mod-
<br>
active to update the active file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat test | docheckgroups -u |
mod-active</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s all!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, suppose we run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat test | docheckgroups
&quot;^c..*$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nothing is output (indeed,
everything is fine for the c.* hierarchy). It would have
been similar if the test file had only contained the
checkgroups for the c.* hierarchy <br>
(docheckgroups would not have checked a.* and b.*, even if
they had been in include-pattern).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to check both a.* and
c.*, you can run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat test | docheckgroups
&quot;^a..*$|^c..*$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And if you want to check a.* but
not a.second.*, you can run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat test | docheckgroups
&quot;^a..*$&quot; &quot;^a.second..*$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In our example, docheckgroups
will then mention a.second.announce and a.second.group for
removal since they are in the active file (the same goes for
their descriptions). <br>
Notwithstanding, if you do want to keep a.second.announce,
just add this group to localgroups and docheckgroups will no
longer mention it for removal.</p>
