<p>CLONE(8) NUT Manual CLONE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
clone - UPS driver clone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the specific features of the
clone driver. For information about the core driver, see
nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This driver, which sits on top of another driver socket,
allows users to group clients to a particular outlet of a
device and deal with this output as if it was a normal
UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load.off=command <br>
Recommended. Set the command on the &quot;real&quot; UPS
driver that will be used to switch off the outlet. You need
both load.off and load.on in order to power cycle the
outlet. <br>
Otherwise, shutting down the clients powered by an outlet is
a one way street (see IMPORTANT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load.on=command <br>
Recommended. Set the command on the &quot;real&quot; UPS
driver that will be used to switch on the outlet. You need
both load.off and load.on in order to power cycle the
outlet. <br>
Otherwise, shutting down the clients powered by an outlet is
a one way street (see IMPORTANT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load.status=value <br>
Recommended. Set the variable on the &quot;real&quot; UPS
driver that will be used to indicate the outlet status (i.e.
on/off). If not specified, the clone driver will attempt to
keep <br>
track of the outlet status, but this is less reliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offdelay=num <br>
Set the timer (in seconds) before the outlet is turned off
after the shutdown condition (OB LB) for this outlet is met
or a command to shutdown was issued. Defaults to 120 <br>
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ondelay=num <br>
Set the timer (in seconds) for the outlet to switch on in
case the power returns after the oulet has been switched
off. Defaults to 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mincharge=value <br>
Set the remaining battery level when the clone UPS switches
to LB (percent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minruntime=value <br>
Set the remaining battery runtime when the clone UPS
switches to LB (seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION <br>
The port specification in the ups.conf(5) reference the
driver socket that the &quot;real&quot; UPS driver is using.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[realups] <br>
driver = usbhid-ups <br>
port = auto</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[clone-outlet-1] <br>
driver = clone <br>
port = usbhid-ups-realups <br>
load.on = outlet.1.load.on <br>
load.off = outlet.1.load.off <br>
load.status = outlet.1.status <br>
[...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT <br>
Unlike a real UPS, you should not configure a upsmon master
for this driver. When a upsmon master sees the OB LB flags
and tells the upsd server it is OK to initiate the shutdown
<br>
sequence, the server will latch the FSD status and it will
not be possible to restart the systems connected without
restarting the upsd server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will be a problem if the
power returns after the clone UPS initiated the shutdown
sequence on it&acirc;s outlet, but returns before the real
UPS begins shutting down. The solution <br>
is in the clone driver, that will insert the FSD flag if
needed without the help of a upsmon master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The clone UPS will follow the status on the real UPS driver.
You can only make the clone UPS shutdown earlier than the
real UPS driver, not later. If the real UPS driver <br>
initiates a shutdown, the clone UPS driver will immediately
follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that the commands to
shutdown/restart an outlet on the real UPS drivers are not
affected, so if you tell the real UPS driver to shutdown the
outlet of the clone UPS <br>
driver, your clients will lose power without warning.</p>
