<p>DNSSEC-SETTIME(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-SETTIME(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-settime - Set the key timing metadata for a DNSSEC
key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-settime [-f] [-K directory] [-L ttl] [-P date/offset]
[-A date/offset] [-R date/offset] [-I date/offset] [-D
date/offset] [-h] [-v level] [-E engine] {keyfile}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnssec-settime reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the
key timing metadata as specified by the -P, -A, -R, -I, and
-D options. The metadata can then be used by <br>
dnssec-signzone or other signing software to determine when
a key is to be published, whether it should be used for
signing a zone, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of these options is set
on the command line, then dnssec-settime simply prints the
key timing metadata already stored in the key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When key metadata fields are
changed, both files of a key pair (Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key and
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private) are regenerated. Metadata fields
are stored in the private <br>
file. A human-readable description of the metadata is also
placed in comments in the key file. The private file&rsquo;s
permissions are always set to be inaccessible to anyone
other <br>
than the owner (mode 0600).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f <br>
Force an update of an old-format key with no metadata
fields. Without this option, dnssec-settime will fail when
attempting to update a legacy key. With this option, the key
<br>
will be recreated in the new format, but with the original
key data retained. The key&rsquo;s creation date will be set
to the present time. If no other values are specified, then
<br>
the key&rsquo;s publication and activation dates will also
be set to the present time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K directory <br>
Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L ttl <br>
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is
converted into a DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a
zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there
was <br>
already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing
TTL would take precedence. Setting the default TTL to 0 or
none removes it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Emit usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v level <br>
Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E engine <br>
Use the given OpenSSL engine. When compiled with PKCS#11
support it defaults to pkcs11; the empty name resets it to
no engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMING OPTIONS <br>
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;, it is interpreted as an
offset from the present time. For convenience, <br>
if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes
&rsquo;y&rsquo;, &rsquo;mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;w&rsquo;,
&rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;mi&rsquo;, then
the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour
days, ignoring leap years), <br>
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is
computed in seconds. To unset a date, use
&rsquo;none&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone.
After that date, the key will be included in the zone but
will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After
that date, the key will be included in the zone and used to
sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that
date, the key will be flagged as revoked. It will be
included in the zone and will be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that
date, the key will still be included in the zone, but it
will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that
date, the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It
may remain in the key repository, however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S predecessor key <br>
Select a key for which the key being modified will be an
explicit successor. The name, algorithm, size, and type of
the predecessor key must exactly match those of the key <br>
being modified. The activation date of the successor key
will be set to the inactivation date of the predecessor. The
publication date will be set to the activation date <br>
minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30
days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
publication and activation dates must be separated by at
least this much time. If the activation date is <br>
specified but the publication date isn&rsquo;t, then the
publication date will default to this much time before the
activation date; conversely, if the publication date is <br>
specified but activation date isn&rsquo;t, then activation
will be set to this much time after publication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the key is being set to be an
explicit successor to another key, then the default
prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with date offsets, if the
argument is followed by one of the suffixes &rsquo;y&rsquo;,
&rsquo;mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;w&rsquo;, &rsquo;d&rsquo;,
&rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;mi&rsquo;, then the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, <br>
hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the
interval is measured in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINTING OPTIONS <br>
dnssec-settime can also be used to print the timing metadata
associated with a key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
Print times in UNIX epoch format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p C/P/A/R/I/D/all <br>
Print a specific metadata value or set of metadata values.
The -p option may be followed by one or more of the
following letters to indicate which value or values to
print: C <br>
for the creation date, P for the publication date, A for the
activation date, R for the revocation date, I for the
inactivation date, or D for the deletion date. To print all
<br>
of the metadata, use -p all.</p>
