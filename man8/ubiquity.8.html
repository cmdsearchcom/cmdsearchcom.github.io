<p>UBIQUITY(8) Ubuntu System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
UBIQUITY(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ubiquity &acirc; install Ubuntu from a live CD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ubiquity [--desktop file] [--debug] [--pdb] [--cdebconf]
[--automatic] [--only] [--query] [frontend]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ubiquity is a graphical installer for Ubuntu, written
largely in Python, using debian-installer (d-i) as a backend
for many of its functions. It is normally invoked from a
desktop <br>
icon, and presents a &quot;wizard&quot;-style graphical user
interface. ubiquity must be run as root, and will escalate
privileges for itself using gksudo, kdesu, kdesudo, or sudo
as appro&acirc; <br>
priate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ubiquity has multiple frontends,
including one written using GTK+ (gtk_ui) and one written
for KDE (kde_ui). The first non-option argument, if any, is
interpreted as the name of <br>
the frontend to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--desktop file <br>
This option is passed through to gksudo to provide a better
description for its privilege-escalation message. It is only
relevant when using the gtk_ui frontend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Run in debugging mode, sending verbose information to
/var/log/installer/debug that may be useful to developers.
(The /var/log/syslog file is usually required in any case,
<br>
along with /var/log/partman in the case of problems related
to partitioning.) Note that passwords will be logged in
debugging mode!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pdb <br>
Drop into the Python debugger in the event of a crash. Only
effective if ubiquity is being run from a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cdebconf <br>
Use cdebconf instead of the traditional Perl debconf
implementation. In future this may provide enough memory
efficiency benefits to be made the default, but for now it
is <br>
not really worthwhile and is therefore for experimental use
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--automatic <br>
Skip over questions that have been pre-answered by use of a
preseed file. This is useful for unattended
installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--only <br>
Tell ubiquity that it is the only desktop program running so
that it can customize its user interface to better suit a
minimal environment. This allows the installer to be <br>
run standalone, reducing memory requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--query <br>
Print the frontend that would be used and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Ubiquity was formerly known as &quot;Espresso&quot;, and
originally as &quot;Ubuntu Express&quot;, which is written
and maintained by Javier Carranza
&lt;javier.carranza@interactors.coop&gt; and Juanje <br>
Ojeda Croissier &lt;juanje@interactors.coop&gt;. This
version draws on the work done on Ubuntu Express, but was
renamed to avoid confusion, to reduce awkward branding
considerations, <br>
and because Ubiquity concentrates on reusing
debian-installer code and reducing duplicated translation
and branding work as much as possible. Ubiquity has now
substantially <br>
diverged from Ubuntu Express and is an independent
project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ubiquity was mainly developed by
Colin Watson &lt;cjwatson@ubuntu.com&gt; and Evan Dandrea
&lt;ev@ubuntu.com&gt;, with contributions from many
others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mythbuntu_ui frontend was
developed by Mario Limonciello
&lt;superm1@ubuntu.com&gt;.</p>
