<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gdnsd-plugin-weighted can be used to return one (or a
subset) of several address records, or one of several CNAME
records based on dynamic-weighted probabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - TOP LEVEL <br>
At the top level, there are three special parameter keys:
&quot;service_types&quot;, &quot;up_thresh&quot;, and
&quot;multi&quot;. &quot;multi&quot; is ignored for
CNAME-based resources. All of these keys are <br>
inherited and override-able at the per-resource and
per-address-family levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;service_types&quot; sets
how the applicable addresses or CNAMEs are monitored. The
top-level default &quot;service_types&quot; is
&quot;up&quot;, which is a built-in service type provided by
gdnsd. <br>
For more information about configuring non-default service
type&rsquo;s, see the main gdnsd.config(5)
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;multi&quot; is a boolean
that can be &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, and
defaults to &quot;false&quot;. &quot;multi&quot; controls
the behavior of the algorithm for selecting result
addresses, discussed in detail <br>
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;up_thresh&quot; defines a
floating point fraction of summed address weights in the
range &quot;(0.0 - 1.0]&quot;, defaulting to 0.5, and is
used to influence failure/failover behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other than those three, the rest
of the top level keys are the names of your resources, and
their values are the configuration of each resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - PER-RESOURCE
<br>
Inside a given resource&rsquo;s configuration hash, again
the three address-related parameters
&quot;services_types&quot;, &quot;multi&quot;, and
&quot;up_thresh&quot; may be specified to override their
settings <br>
per-resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two basic
configuration modes within a resource:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Explicit per-family address
sub-stanzas. In this mode, the resource contains one or more
of the keys &quot;addrs_v4&quot; and &quot;addrs_v6&quot;.
Usually one would use both together, as it&rsquo;s <br>
simpler to use the second option when configuring a single
address family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of each stanza
configure response RRs of the given address type for this
resource, and the 3 behavioral parameters
&quot;service_types&quot;, &quot;multi&quot;, and
&quot;up_thresh&quot; can be <br>
overridden per-address-family as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Automatic top-level detection
of just one address family or CNAMEs. In this mode, you can
configure the top-level of a resource with direct entries,
so long as they are <br>
matching set of a single type: all IPv4 addresses, all IPv6
address, or all CNAMEs, and the type will be
auto-detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resources which contain weighted
lists of CNAMEs rather than addresses can only be used with
&quot;DYNC&quot; RRs in zonefiles, whereas those that
contain only addresses can be used in <br>
either &quot;DYNC&quot; or &quot;DYNA&quot; RRs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - CNAMES <br>
When configuring cnames, the value of each item should be
&quot;[ CNAME, WEIGHT ]&quot;, and the resource will be
useful for &quot;DYNC&quot; zonefile records, resolving to a
weighted CNAME record <br>
in responses. The selection algorithm based on weights and
monitoring results is as documented below for addresses in
the THE UNGROUPED SINGLE CASE, since groups of CNAMEs <br>
cannot be configured, and the &quot;multi&quot; option is
not valid for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the CNAMEs are not
fully-qualified (do not end in &quot;.&quot;), the current
$ORIGIN value for the zonefile RR being queried will be
appended to complete the name, much as you would <br>
expect if the same not-fully-qualified name were substituted
into the zonefiles everywhere the relevant DYNC record
exists. Monitoring will be based on the
originally-configured <br>
CNAME text exactly as it was entered (including the terminal
dot or the lack thereof).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - ADDRESSES <br>
With the exception that &quot;addrs_v4&quot; and
&quot;addrs_v6&quot; must contain only addresses of the
correct family (or in the top-level auto-detect case, the
top level entries must all be of <br>
the same family), the two stanzas behave identically. When
both are present, they are both used in every
&quot;DYNA&quot; response (as gdnsd always includes
opposite-family records in the <br>
Additional section of A/AAAA queries).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within either address family
type, there are two different binary dimensions (multi -&gt;
true/false, and grouped-vs-ungrouped) upon which the
configuration and behavior hinge, <br>
leading to four different possible cases: ungrouped-single,
ungrouped-multi, grouped-single, and grouped-multi. Each
will be discussed in detail below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE UNGROUPED SINGLE CASE <br>
This is the simplest case. The code detects this case when
it sees that &quot;multi&quot; is false (the default), and
that the values of the keys are arrays rather than
sub-hashes. Each <br>
hash key is an address label, and each value is an array of
&quot;[ IPADDR, WEIGHT ]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When answering a query in this
case, first the weights are converted to dynamic weights.
The dynamic weight of an address is its configured weight if
the monitored state is <br>
&quot;UP&quot;, or zero if the monitored state is
&quot;DOWN&quot;. The dynamic weights are summed to produce
a dynamic weight total, and then a single address to respond
with is chosen from the <br>
set, with each address having the odds
&quot;addr_dynamic_weight / total_dynamic_weight&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the
&quot;total_dynamic_weight&quot; is less than
&quot;ceil(up_thresh * total_configured_weight)&quot;, then
the dynamic weights are all reset to their configured full
values so that <br>
the response odds are the same as if all were
&quot;UP&quot;, and resource-level failure is signalled to
any upper-layer meta-plugin (e.g. metafo or geoip) when
applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example (X could be a whole
resource, or an addrs_v4 stanza):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X =&gt; { <br>
multi =&gt; false # default <br>
# odds below assume no addresses are down: <br>
lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 45 ] # 25% chance (45/180) <br>
lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 33% chance (60/180) <br>
lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 75 ] # 42% chance (75/180) <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE UNGROUPED MULTI CASE <br>
This case is detected when, (as above) the values of the
keys are arrays of &quot;[ IPADDR, WEIGHT]&quot;, but the
parameter &quot;multi&quot; is true. The change from the
above behavior is <br>
primarily that multiple addresses from the weighted set can
be returned in each response. The &quot;maximum&quot;,
rather than the sum, of the dynamic weights (again, zero for
down <br>
addresses, configured-weight otherwise), is found, and the
odds of each address&rsquo;s inclusion in the response set
is &quot;addr_dyanmic_weight / max_dynamic_weight&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means all
non-&quot;DOWN&quot; addresses which share the group&rsquo;s
maximum dynamic weight value will always be included,
whereas others will be optionally included depending on the
<br>
odds. At least one address is always returned (because
logically, at least one address has the maximum weight,
giving it a 100% chance), and sometimes the full
non-&quot;DOWN&quot; set <br>
will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;up_thresh&quot; behaves as
in the previous case: If the sum of the dynamic weight
values is less than &quot;ceil(up_thresh *
total_configured_weight)&quot;, then the dynamic weights are
all <br>
set to their configured values and the result set is
calculated as if all were &quot;UP&quot;, while signalling
resource-level failure to upstream meta-plugins (geoip or
metafo).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X =&gt; { <br>
multi =&gt; true <br>
# odds below assume no addresses are down: <br>
lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 45 ] # 75% chance (45/60) <br>
lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 100% chance (60/60) <br>
lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 100% chance (60/60) <br>
# overall possible result-sets: <br>
# lb01,lb02,lb03 -&gt; 75% <br>
# lb02,lb03 -&gt; 25% <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE GROUPED SINGLE CASE <br>
The grouped cases are detected when the keys&rsquo; values
are sub-hashes at the outer level rather than arrays of
&quot;[ IPADDR, WEIGHT]&quot;. In the grouped case, first
the set is divided <br>
into named groups, and then within each group individual
addresses are configured as &quot;addrlabel =&gt; [ IPADDR,
WEIGHT ]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X =&gt; { <br>
group1 =&gt; { <br>
lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 10 ] <br>
lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 20 ] <br>
lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 30 ] <br>
} <br>
group2 =&gt; { <br>
lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.7, 10 ] <br>
lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.8, 20 ] <br>
lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.9, 30 ] <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The grouped single case, of
course, occurs when the configuration layout is as shown
above, and the &quot;multi&quot; parameter is
&quot;false&quot; (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In grouped-single mode,
essentially the groups are weighted against each other
similarly to the single case for ungrouped addresses,
resulting in the choice of a single group <br>
from the set of groups. Then the addresses within the chosen
group are weighted against each other in multi-style,
returning potentially more than one address from the chosen
<br>
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifically, each group&rsquo;s
odds of being the single group chosen is
&quot;group_dyn_weight / total_dyn_weight&quot;, where the
group&rsquo;s dynamic weight is the sum of the dynamic
weights <br>
within it (&quot;DOWN&quot; addresses are zero), and the
total dynamic weight is the dynamic sum of all groups. Then
within each group, the odds of each address being included
in the <br>
multi-response set is &quot;addr_dyn_weight /
group_max_dyn_weight&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;up_thresh&quot; operates
on all groups as a whole, and if the non-&quot;DOWN&quot;
sum of all weights in all groups fails to meet the standard
of &quot;ceil(up_thresh * <br>
total_sum_configured_weight)&quot;, then all addresses will
be treated as if they are &quot;UP&quot; for selection
purposes, and resource-level failure will be signalled
upstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE GROUPED MULTI CASE <br>
You can probably infer this one&rsquo;s behavior from
reading about the previous three cases. The difference from
the previous grouped-single case is that the multi-vs-single
<br>
behaviors are reversed. Multiple groups are chosen based on
the dynamic maximum weight between the groups, and a single
weighted address is returned from the subset within each
<br>
chosen group. All of the details above logically apply in
the way you would expect, as all of these four cases
internally share the same code and logic, they just apply
<br>
different bits of it to different subsets of the
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL NOTES ON ADDRESS MODE
CASES ABOVE <br>
Note that any time multi-selection is in effect at a layer
(the top layer when multi is true, or within a group when
when multi is false), the minimum count of chosen items will
<br>
be the count of items that share the maximum weight within
the set. e.g. a set of items with weights &quot;30, 30, 30,
20, 20&quot; will always choose at least 3/5 items (because
the <br>
first three have 100% odds of inclusion), and the total
response set will range as high as all 5 items with some
probability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A practical use-case example for
grouped-single:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Splitting groups on subnet
boundaries in grouped-single mode gives the result that a
single response packet never mixes subnets. This would
enable your DNS-based balancing to <br>
defeat certain forms of client-level Destination Address
Selection interference, while still returning multiple
addresses per response (all from one subnet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A practical use-case for
grouped-multi:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose you have a large set of
addresses which can be logically grouped into subsets that
have some shared failure risk (e.g. subpartitions of a
datacenter which share <br>
infrastructure). With grouped-multi behavior, clients will
get up to N (count of groups) addresses in a round-robin
response, but a given response set will never contain two
<br>
addresses from the same group/subset. This maximizes the
chance that the client can successfully fail over to another
address in the list when its primary selection fails, since
<br>
the total set in each response does not share any per-subset
failure mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITS <br>
All weights must be positive integer values greater than
zero and less than 2^20 (1048576).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a limit of 64
addresses, address-groups, or cnames at the top level of a
resource (or per address family in the addrs_v4/addrs_v6
cases), and a limit of 64 addresses <br>
within each address group in the grouped modes.</p>
