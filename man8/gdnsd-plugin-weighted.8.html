<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>gdnsd-plugin-weighted</b> can be used to return one (or a subset) of several
  address records, or one of several CNAME records based on dynamic-weighted
  probabilities.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_TOP_LEVEL"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_TOP_LEVEL">CONFIGURATION
  - TOP LEVEL</a></h1>
At the top level, there are three special parameter keys:
  &quot;service_types&quot;, &quot;up_thresh&quot;, and &quot;multi&quot;.
  &quot;multi&quot; is ignored for CNAME-based resources. All of these keys are
  inherited and override-able at the per-resource and per-address-family levels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;service_types&quot; sets how the applicable addresses or CNAMEs are
  monitored. The top-level default &quot;service_types&quot; is &quot;up&quot;,
  which is a built-in service type provided by gdnsd. For more information about
  configuring non-default service type's, see the main <i>gdnsd.config</i>(5)
  documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;multi&quot; is a boolean that can be &quot;true&quot; or
  &quot;false&quot;, and defaults to &quot;false&quot;. &quot;multi&quot;
  controls the behavior of the algorithm for selecting result addresses,
  discussed in detail later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;up_thresh&quot; defines a floating point fraction of summed address
  weights in the range &quot;(0.0 - 1.0]&quot;, defaulting to 0.5, and is used
  to influence failure/failover behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other than those three, the rest of the top level keys are the names of your
  resources, and their values are the configuration of each resource.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_PER-RESOURCE"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_PER-RESOURCE">CONFIGURATION
  - PER-RESOURCE</a></h1>
Inside a given resource's configuration hash, again the three address-related
  parameters &quot;services_types&quot;, &quot;multi&quot;, and
  &quot;up_thresh&quot; may be specified to override their settings
  per-resource.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two basic configuration modes within a resource:
<div class="Pp"></div>
1) Explicit per-family address sub-stanzas. In this mode, the resource contains
  one or more of the keys &quot;addrs_v4&quot; and &quot;addrs_v6&quot;. Usually
  one would use both together, as it's simpler to use the second option when
  configuring a single address family.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The contents of each stanza configure response RRs of the given address type for
  this resource, and the 3 behavioral parameters &quot;service_types&quot;,
  &quot;multi&quot;, and &quot;up_thresh&quot; can be overridden
  per-address-family as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2) Automatic top-level detection of just one address family or CNAMEs. In this
  mode, you can configure the top-level of a resource with direct entries, so
  long as they are matching set of a single type: all IPv4 addresses, all IPv6
  address, or all CNAMEs, and the type will be auto-detected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Resources which contain weighted lists of CNAMEs rather than addresses can only
  be used with &quot;DYNC&quot; RRs in zonefiles, whereas those that contain
  only addresses can be used in either &quot;DYNC&quot; or &quot;DYNA&quot; RRs.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_CNAMES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_CNAMES">CONFIGURATION
  - CNAMES</a></h1>
When configuring cnames, the value of each item should be &quot;[ CNAME, WEIGHT
  ]&quot;, and the resource will be useful for &quot;DYNC&quot; zonefile
  records, resolving to a weighted CNAME record in responses. The selection
  algorithm based on weights and monitoring results is as documented below for
  addresses in the <b>THE UNGROUPED SINGLE CASE</b>, since groups of CNAMEs
  cannot be configured, and the &quot;multi&quot; option is not valid for them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the CNAMEs are not fully-qualified (do not end in &quot;.&quot;), the current
  $ORIGIN value for the zonefile RR being queried will be appended to complete
  the name, much as you would expect if the same not-fully-qualified name were
  substituted into the zonefiles everywhere the relevant DYNC record exists.
  Monitoring will be based on the originally-configured CNAME text exactly as it
  was entered (including the terminal dot or the lack thereof).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_ADDRESSES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_ADDRESSES">CONFIGURATION
  - ADDRESSES</a></h1>
With the exception that &quot;addrs_v4&quot; and &quot;addrs_v6&quot; must
  contain only addresses of the correct family (or in the top-level auto-detect
  case, the top level entries must all be of the same family), the two stanzas
  behave identically. When both are present, they are both used in every
  &quot;DYNA&quot; response (as gdnsd always includes opposite-family records in
  the Additional section of A/AAAA queries).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Within either address family type, there are two different binary dimensions
  (multi -&gt; true/false, and grouped-vs-ungrouped) upon which the
  configuration and behavior hinge, leading to four different possible cases:
  ungrouped-single, ungrouped-multi, grouped-single, and grouped-multi. Each
  will be discussed in detail below:
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_UNGROUPED_SINGLE_CASE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_UNGROUPED_SINGLE_CASE">THE
  UNGROUPED SINGLE CASE</a></h1>
This is the simplest case. The code detects this case when it sees that
  &quot;multi&quot; is false (the default), and that the values of the keys are
  arrays rather than sub-hashes. Each hash key is an address label, and each
  value is an array of &quot;[ IPADDR, WEIGHT ]&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When answering a query in this case, first the weights are converted to dynamic
  weights. The dynamic weight of an address is its configured weight if the
  monitored state is &quot;UP&quot;, or zero if the monitored state is
  &quot;DOWN&quot;. The dynamic weights are summed to produce a dynamic weight
  total, and then a single address to respond with is chosen from the set, with
  each address having the odds &quot;addr_dynamic_weight /
  total_dynamic_weight&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, if the &quot;total_dynamic_weight&quot; is less than
  &quot;ceil(up_thresh * total_configured_weight)&quot;, then the dynamic
  weights are all reset to their configured full values so that the response
  odds are the same as if all were &quot;UP&quot;, and resource-level failure is
  signalled to any upper-layer meta-plugin (e.g. metafo or geoip) when
  applicable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example (X could be a whole resource, or an addrs_v4 stanza):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  X =&gt; {
    multi =&gt; false # default
    # odds below assume no addresses are down:
    lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 45 ] # 25% chance (45/180)
    lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 33% chance (60/180)
    lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 75 ] # 42% chance (75/180)
  }
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_UNGROUPED_MULTI_CASE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_UNGROUPED_MULTI_CASE">THE
  UNGROUPED MULTI CASE</a></h1>
This case is detected when, (as above) the values of the keys are arrays of
  &quot;[ IPADDR, WEIGHT]&quot;, but the parameter &quot;multi&quot; is true.
  The change from the above behavior is primarily that multiple addresses from
  the weighted set can be returned in each response. The &quot;maximum&quot;,
  rather than the sum, of the dynamic weights (again, zero for down addresses,
  configured-weight otherwise), is found, and the odds of each address's
  inclusion in the response set is &quot;addr_dyanmic_weight /
  max_dynamic_weight&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means all non-&quot;DOWN&quot; addresses which share the group's maximum
  dynamic weight value will always be included, whereas others will be
  optionally included depending on the odds. At least one address is always
  returned (because logically, at least one address has the maximum weight,
  giving it a 100% chance), and sometimes the full non-&quot;DOWN&quot; set will
  be returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;up_thresh&quot; behaves as in the previous case: If the sum of the dynamic
  weight values is less than &quot;ceil(up_thresh *
  total_configured_weight)&quot;, then the dynamic weights are all set to their
  configured values and the result set is calculated as if all were
  &quot;UP&quot;, while signalling resource-level failure to upstream
  meta-plugins (geoip or metafo).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  X =&gt; {
    multi =&gt; true
    # odds below assume no addresses are down:
    lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 45 ] # 75% chance (45/60)
    lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 100% chance (60/60)
    lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 100% chance (60/60)
    # overall possible result-sets:
    # lb01,lb02,lb03 -&gt; 75%
    # lb02,lb03 -&gt; 25%
  }
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_GROUPED_SINGLE_CASE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_GROUPED_SINGLE_CASE">THE
  GROUPED SINGLE CASE</a></h1>
The grouped cases are detected when the keys' values are sub-hashes at the outer
  level rather than arrays of &quot;[ IPADDR, WEIGHT]&quot;. In the grouped
  case, first the set is divided into named groups, and then within each group
  individual addresses are configured as &quot;addrlabel =&gt; [ IPADDR, WEIGHT
  ]&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   X =&gt; {
     group1 =&gt; {
       lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 10 ]
       lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 20 ]
       lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 30 ]
     }
     group2 =&gt; {
       lb01 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.7, 10 ]
       lb02 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.8, 20 ]
       lb03 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.9, 30 ]
     }
   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The grouped single case, of course, occurs when the configuration layout is as
  shown above, and the &quot;multi&quot; parameter is &quot;false&quot; (the
  default).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In grouped-single mode, essentially the groups are weighted against each other
  similarly to the single case for ungrouped addresses, resulting in the choice
  of a single group from the set of groups. Then the addresses within the chosen
  group are weighted against each other in multi-style, returning potentially
  more than one address from the chosen group.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specifically, each group's odds of being the single group chosen is
  &quot;group_dyn_weight / total_dyn_weight&quot;, where the group's dynamic
  weight is the sum of the dynamic weights within it (&quot;DOWN&quot; addresses
  are zero), and the total dynamic weight is the dynamic sum of all groups. Then
  within each group, the odds of each address being included in the
  multi-response set is &quot;addr_dyn_weight / group_max_dyn_weight&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;up_thresh&quot; operates on all groups as a whole, and if the
  non-&quot;DOWN&quot; sum of all weights in all groups fails to meet the
  standard of &quot;ceil(up_thresh * total_sum_configured_weight)&quot;, then
  all addresses will be treated as if they are &quot;UP&quot; for selection
  purposes, and resource-level failure will be signalled upstream.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_GROUPED_MULTI_CASE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_GROUPED_MULTI_CASE">THE
  GROUPED MULTI CASE</a></h1>
You can probably infer this one's behavior from reading about the previous three
  cases. The difference from the previous grouped-single case is that the
  multi-vs-single behaviors are reversed. Multiple groups are chosen based on
  the dynamic maximum weight between the groups, and a single weighted address
  is returned from the subset within each chosen group. All of the details above
  logically apply in the way you would expect, as all of these four cases
  internally share the same code and logic, they just apply different bits of it
  to different subsets of the problem.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GENERAL_NOTES_ON_ADDRESS_MODE_CASES_ABOVE"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERAL_NOTES_ON_ADDRESS_MODE_CASES_ABOVE">GENERAL
  NOTES ON ADDRESS MODE CASES ABOVE</a></h1>
Note that any time multi-selection is in effect at a layer (the top layer when
  multi is true, or within a group when when multi is false), the minimum count
  of chosen items will be the count of items that share the maximum weight
  within the set. e.g. a set of items with weights &quot;30, 30, 30, 20,
  20&quot; will always choose at least 3/5 items (because the first three have
  100% odds of inclusion), and the total response set will range as high as all
  5 items with some probability.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A practical use-case example for grouped-single:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Splitting groups on subnet boundaries in grouped-single mode gives the result
  that a single response packet never mixes subnets. This would enable your
  DNS-based balancing to defeat certain forms of client-level Destination
  Address Selection interference, while still returning multiple addresses per
  response (all from one subnet).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A practical use-case for grouped-multi:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose you have a large set of addresses which can be logically grouped into
  subsets that have some shared failure risk (e.g. subpartitions of a datacenter
  which share infrastructure). With grouped-multi behavior, clients will get up
  to N (count of groups) addresses in a round-robin response, but a given
  response set will never contain two addresses from the same group/subset. This
  maximizes the chance that the client can successfully fail over to another
  address in the list when its primary selection fails, since the total set in
  each response does not share any per-subset failure mode.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITS">LIMITS</a></h1>
All weights must be positive integer values greater than zero and less than 2^20
  (1048576).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a limit of 64 addresses, address-groups, or cnames at the top level of
  a resource (or per address family in the addrs_v4/addrs_v6 cases), and a limit
  of 64 addresses within each address group in the grouped modes.
