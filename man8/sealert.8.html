This manual page describes the <b>sealert</b> program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
sealert is the user interface component (either GUI or command line) to the
  setroubleshoot system. setroubleshoot is used to diagnose SELinux denials and
  attempts to provide user friendly explanations for a SELinux denial (e.g. AVC)
  and recommendations for how one might adjust the system to prevent the denial
  in the future.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a standard configuration setroubleshoot is composed of two components,
  setroubleshootd and sealert.
<div class="Pp"></div>
setroubleshootd is a system daemon which runs with root privileges and listens
  for audit events emitted from the kernel related to SELinux. The audit daemon
  must be running. The audit daemon sends a dbus message to the setroubleshootd
  daemon when the system gets an SELinux AVC denial. The setroubleshootd daemon
  then runs a series of analysis plugins which examines the audit data related
  to the AVC. It records the results of the analysis and signals any clients
  which have attached to the setroubleshootd daemon that a new alert has been
  seen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
sealert can be run in either a GUI mode or a command line mode. In both
  instances sealert run as a user process with the privileges associated with
  the user. In GUI mode it attaches to a setroubleshootd server instance and
  listens for notifications of new alerts. When a new alert arrives it alerts
  the desktop user via a notification in the status icon area. The user may then
  click on the alert notification which will open an alert browser. In addition
  to the current alert sealert communicates with the setroubleshootd daemon to
  access all prior alerts stored in the setroubleshoot database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user may elect to tag any given alert as &quot;ignore&quot; in the browser
  which prevents any future notification for the given alert. This is useful
  when a user is already aware of a reoccurring problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
sealert may also be run in command line mode. The two most useful command line
  options are -l to &quot;lookup&quot; an alert ID and -a to &quot;analyze&quot;
  a log file. When setroubleshootd generates a new alert it assigns it a local
  ID and writes this as a syslog message. The -l lookup option may then be used
  to retrieve the alert from the setroubleshootd alert database and write it to
  stdout. This is most useful when setroubleshootd is being run on a headless
  system without the GUI desktop alert facility. The -a analyze option is
  equivalent to the &quot;Scan Logfile&quot; command in the browser. The log
  file is scanned for audit messages, analysis is performed, alerts generated,
  and then written to stdout.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOG_FILE_SCANNING"><a class="selflink" href="#LOG_FILE_SCANNING">LOG
  FILE SCANNING</a></h1>
You may ask sealert to parse a file accumulating all the audit messages it finds
  in that file. As each audit event is recognized it is presented for analysis
  which may generate an alert report if the analysis was successful. If the same
  type of event is seen multiple times resulting in the same report the results
  are coalesced into a single report. The report count field will indicate the
  number of times the tool thought it saw the same issue. The report will also
  include a list of every line number on which it found an audit record which
  contributed to the coalesced report. This will allow you to coordinate the
  contents of the file with the analysis results if need be.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Log file scanning may be initiated from the sealert browser via the
  File::ScanLogFile menu or from the command line via 'sealert -a filename'.
  Please note that sealert runs as a user level process with the permissions of
  the user running it. Many system log files are readable by root only. To work
  around this if you have root access one can copy the file as root to a
  temporary file and change its permissions. This is a good solution when
  scanning via the GUI as a normal user. Or you might consider su'ing to root
  and run the analysis via the command line (e.g. sealert -a filename).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The audit records in the log file must be valid syntactically correct audit
  messages or the parser will ignore them.
