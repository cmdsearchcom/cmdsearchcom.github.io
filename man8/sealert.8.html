<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sealert - setroubleshoot client tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sealert [-b] [-f local_id] [-h] [-s] [-S] [-l id] [-a file]
[-u] [-p] [-P plugin_name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page describes the sealert program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sealert is the user interface
component (either GUI or command line) to the setroubleshoot
system. setroubleshoot is used to diagnose SELinux denials
and attempts to provide user <br>
friendly explanations for a SELinux denial (e.g. AVC) and
recommendations for how one might adjust the system to
prevent the denial in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a standard configuration
setroubleshoot is composed of two components,
setroubleshootd and sealert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setroubleshootd is a system
daemon which runs with root privileges and listens for audit
events emitted from the kernel related to SELinux. The audit
daemon must be running. The <br>
audit daemon sends a dbus message to the setroubleshootd
daemon when the system gets an SELinux AVC denial. The
setroubleshootd daemon then runs a series of analysis
plugins <br>
which examines the audit data related to the AVC. It records
the results of the analysis and signals any clients which
have attached to the setroubleshootd daemon that a new <br>
alert has been seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sealert can be run in either a
GUI mode or a command line mode. In both instances sealert
run as a user process with the privileges associated with
the user. In GUI mode it <br>
attaches to a setroubleshootd server instance and listens
for notifications of new alerts. When a new alert arrives it
alerts the desktop user via a notification in the status
<br>
icon area. The user may then click on the alert notification
which will open an alert browser. In addition to the current
alert sealert communicates with the setroubleshootd <br>
daemon to access all prior alerts stored in the
setroubleshoot database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user may elect to tag any
given alert as &quot;ignore&quot; in the browser which
prevents any future notification for the given alert. This
is useful when a user is already aware of a <br>
reoccurring problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sealert may also be run in
command line mode. The two most useful command line options
are -l to &quot;lookup&quot; an alert ID and -a to
&quot;analyze&quot; a log file. When setroubleshootd
gener&acirc; <br>
ates a new alert it assigns it a local ID and writes this as
a syslog message. The -l lookup option may then be used to
retrieve the alert from the setroubleshootd alert database
<br>
and write it to stdout. This is most useful when
setroubleshootd is being run on a headless system without
the GUI desktop alert facility. The -a analyze option is
equivalent to <br>
the &quot;Scan Logfile&quot; command in the browser. The log
file is scanned for audit messages, analysis is performed,
alerts generated, and then written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG FILE SCANNING <br>
You may ask sealert to parse a file accumulating all the
audit messages it finds in that file. As each audit event is
recognized it is presented for analysis which may generate
<br>
an alert report if the analysis was successful. If the same
type of event is seen multiple times resulting in the same
report the results are coalesced into a single report. The
<br>
report count field will indicate the number of times the
tool thought it saw the same issue. The report will also
include a list of every line number on which it found an
audit <br>
record which contributed to the coalesced report. This will
allow you to coordinate the contents of the file with the
analysis results if need be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log file scanning may be
initiated from the sealert browser via the File::ScanLogFile
menu or from the command line via &rsquo;sealert -a
filename&rsquo;. Please note that sealert runs as a <br>
user level process with the permissions of the user running
it. Many system log files are readable by root only. To work
around this if you have root access one can copy the file
<br>
as root to a temporary file and change its permissions. This
is a good solution when scanning via the GUI as a normal
user. Or you might consider su&rsquo;ing to root and run the
anal&acirc; <br>
ysis via the command line (e.g. sealert -a filename).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The audit records in the log
file must be valid syntactically correct audit messages or
the parser will ignore them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b --browser <br>
Launch the browser</p>
