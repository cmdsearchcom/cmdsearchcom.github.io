<p>offcputime(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
offcputime(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
offcputime - Summarize off-CPU time by kernel stack trace.
Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
offcputime [-h] [-u] [-p PID] [-v] [-f] [duration]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program shows stack traces and task names that were
blocked and &quot;off-CPU&quot;, and the total duration they
were not running: their &quot;off-CPU time&quot;. It works
by tracing when <br>
threads block and when they return to CPU, measuring both
the time they were off-CPU and the blocked stack trace and
the task name. This data is summarized in the kernel using
<br>
an eBPF map, and by summing the off-CPU time by unique stack
trace and task name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output summary will help you
identify reasons why threads were blocking, and quantify the
time they were off-CPU. This spans all types of blocking
activity: disk I/O, network <br>
I/O, locks, page faults, involuntary context switches,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is complementary to CPU
profiling (e.g., CPU flame graphs) which shows the time
spent on-CPU. This shows the time spent off-CPU, and the
output, especially the -f format, <br>
can be used to generate an &quot;off-CPU time flame
graph&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool only works on Linux
4.6+. It uses the new &lsquo;BPF_STACK_TRACE&lsquo; table
APIs to generate the in-kernel stack traces. For kernels
older than 4.6, see the version under <br>
tools/old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: this tool only traces
off-CPU times that began and ended while tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Print output in folded stack
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PID Trace this process ID
only (filtered in-kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t TID Trace this thread ID only
(filtered in-kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Only trace user threads (no
kernel threads).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Only trace kernel threads (no
user threads).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Show stacks from user space
only (no kernel space stacks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Show stacks from kernel space
only (no user space stacks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Insert delimiter between
kernel/user stacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Output folded format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stack-storage-size
STACK_STORAGE_SIZE <br>
Change the number of unique stack traces that can be stored
and displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duration <br>
Duration to trace, in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Trace all thread blocking events, and summarize (in-kernel)
by kernel stack trace and total off-CPU time: <br>
# offcputime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace for 5 seconds only: <br>
# offcputime 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace for 5 seconds, and emit
output in folded stack format (suitable for flame graphs):
<br>
# offcputime -f 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace PID 185 only: <br>
# offcputime -p 185</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERHEAD <br>
This summarizes unique stack traces in-kernel for
efficiency, allowing it to trace a higher rate of events
than methods that post-process in user space. The stack
trace and time <br>
data is only copied to user space once, when the output is
printed. While these techniques greatly lower overhead,
scheduler events are still a high frequency event, as they
can <br>
exceed 1 million events per second, and so caution should
still be used. Test before production use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the overhead is still a
problem, take a look at the MINBLOCK_US tunable in the code.
If your aim is to chase down longer blocking events, then
this could be increased to fil&acirc; <br>
ter shorter blocking events, further lowering overhead.</p>
