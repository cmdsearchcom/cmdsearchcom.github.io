<p>rpc.mountd(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
rpc.mountd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rpc.mountd - NFS mount daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/rpc.mountd [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The rpc.mountd daemon implements the server side of the NFS
MOUNT protocol, an NFS side protocol used by NFS version 2
[RFC1094] and NFS version 3 [RFC1813].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An NFS server maintains a table
of local physical file systems that are accessible to NFS
clients. Each file system in this table is referred to as an
exported file system, or <br>
export, for short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file system in the export
table has an access control list. rpc.mountd uses these
access control lists to determine whether an NFS client is
permitted to access a given <br>
file system. For details on how to manage your NFS
server&rsquo;s export table, see the exports(5) and
exportfs(8) man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mounting exported NFS File
Systems <br>
The NFS MOUNT protocol has several procedures. The most
important of these are MNT (mount an export) and UMNT
(unmount an export).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A MNT request has two arguments:
an explicit argument that contains the pathname of the root
directory of the export to be mounted, and an implicit
argument that is the sender&rsquo;s <br>
IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When receiving a MNT request
from an NFS client, rpc.mountd checks both the pathname and
the sender&rsquo;s IP address against its export table. If
the sender is permitted to access <br>
the requested export, rpc.mountd returns an NFS file handle
for the export&rsquo;s root directory to the client. The
client can then use the root file handle and NFS LOOKUP
requests <br>
to navigate the directory structure of the export.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmtab File <br>
The rpc.mountd daemon registers every successful MNT request
by adding an entry to the /var/lib/nfs/rmtab file. When
receivng a UMNT request from an NFS client, rpc.mountd
sim&acirc; <br>
ply removes the matching entry from /var/lib/nfs/rmtab, as
long as the access control list for that export allows that
sender to access the export.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients can discover the list of
file systems an NFS server is currently exporting, or the
list of other clients that have mounted its exports, by
using the showmount(8) command. <br>
showmount(8) uses other procedures in the NFS MOUNT protocol
to report information about the server&rsquo;s exported file
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, however, that there is
little to guarantee that the contents of /var/lib/nfs/rmtab
are accurate. A client may continue accessing an export even
after invoking UMNT. If <br>
the client reboots without sending a UMNT request, stale
entries remain for that client in /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d kind or --debug kind <br>
Turn on debugging. Valid kinds are: all, auth, call, general
and parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F or --foreground <br>
Run in foreground (do not daemonize)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f export-file or --exports-file
export-file <br>
This option specifies the exports file, listing the clients
that this server is prepared to serve and parameters to
apply to each such mount (see exports(5)). By default, <br>
export information is read from /etc/exports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or --help <br>
Display usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o num or --descriptors num <br>
Set the limit of the number of open file descriptors to num.
The default is to leave the limit unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N mountd-version or
--no-nfs-version mountd-version <br>
This option can be used to request that rpc.mountd do not
offer certain versions of NFS. The current version of
rpc.mountd can support both NFS version 2, 3 and 4. If the
<br>
either one of these version should not be offered,
rpc.mountd must be invoked with the option --no-nfs-version
&lt;vers&gt; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n or --no-tcp <br>
Don&rsquo;t advertise TCP for mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p num or -P num or --port num
<br>
Specifies the port number used for RPC listener sockets. If
this option is not specified, rpc.mountd will try to consult
/etc/services, if gets port succeed, set the same <br>
port for all listener socket, otherwise chooses a random
ephemeral port for each listener socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to fix
the port value of rpc.mountd&rsquo;s listeners when NFS
MOUNT requests must traverse a firewall between clients and
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H prog or --ha-callout prog
<br>
Specify a high availability callout program. This program
receives callouts for all MOUNT and UNMOUNT requests. This
allows rpc.mountd to be used in a High Availability <br>
NFS (HA-NFS) environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The callout program is run with
4 arguments. The first is mount or unmount depending on the
reason for the callout. The second will be the name of the
client performing <br>
the mount. The third will be the path that the client is
mounting. The last is the number of concurrent mounts that
we believe the client has of that path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This callout is not needed with
2.6 and later kernels. Instead, mount the nfsd filesystem on
/proc/fs/nfsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --state-directory-path
directory <br>
Specify a directory in which to place statd state
information. If this option is not specified the default of
/var/lib/nfs is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reverse-lookup <br>
rpc.mountd tracks IP addresses in the rmtab file. When a
DUMP request is made (by someone running showmount -a, for
instance), it returns IP addresses instead of host&acirc;
<br>
names by default. This option causes rpc.mountd to perform a
reverse lookup on each IP address and return that hostname
instead. Enabling this can have a substantial neg&acirc;
<br>
ative effect on performance in some situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t N or --num-threads=N or
--num-threads N <br>
This option specifies the number of worker threads that
rpc.mountd spawns. The default is 1 thread, which is
probably enough. More threads are usually only needed for
<br>
NFS servers which need to handle mount storms of hundreds of
NFS mounts in a few seconds, or when your DNS server is slow
or unreliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u or --no-udp <br>
Don&rsquo;t advertise UDP for mounting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V version or --nfs-version
version <br>
This option can be used to request that rpc.mountd offer
certain versions of NFS. The current version of rpc.mountd
can support both NFS version 2 and the newer version 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v or --version <br>
Print the version of rpc.mountd and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g or --manage-gids <br>
Accept requests from the kernel to map user id numbers into
lists of group id numbers for use in access control. An NFS
request will normally (except when using Kerberos <br>
or other cryptographic authentication) contains a user-id
and a list of group-ids. Due to a limitation in the NFS
protocol, at most 16 groups ids can be listed. If you <br>
use the -g flag, then the list of group ids received from
the client will be replaced by a list of group ids
determined by an appropriate lookup on the server. Note that
<br>
the &rsquo;primary&rsquo; group id is not affected so a
newgroup command on the client will still be effective. This
function requires a Linux Kernel with version at least
2.6.21.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_WRAPPERS SUPPORT <br>
You can protect your rpc.mountd listeners using the
tcp_wrapper library or iptables(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the tcp_wrapper
library supports only IPv4 networking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add the hostnames of NFS peers
that are allowed to access rpc.mountd to /etc/hosts.allow.
Use the daemon name mountd even if the rpc.mountd binary has
a different name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hostnames used in either access
file will be ignored when they can not be resolved into IP
addresses. For further information see the tcpd(8) and
hosts_access(5) man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 and TI-RPC support <br>
TI-RPC is a pre-requisite for supporting NFS on IPv6. If
TI-RPC support is built into rpc.mountd, it attempts to
start listeners on network transports marked
&rsquo;visible&rsquo; in <br>
/etc/netconfig. As long as at least one network transport
listener starts successfully, rpc.mountd will operate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/exports input file for exportfs, listing exports,
export options, and access control lists</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/nfs/rmtab table of
clients accessing server&rsquo;s exports</p>
