mount.cifs - mount using the Common Internet File System (CIFS)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 1.00ex; text-indent: -1.00ex;">mount.cifs
  {service} {mount-point} [-o&#x00A0;options]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.
<div class="Pp"></div>
mount.cifs mounts a Linux CIFS filesystem. It is usually invoked indirectly by
  the <b>mount</b>(8) command when using the &quot;-t cifs&quot; option. This
  command only works in Linux, and the kernel must support the cifs filesystem.
  The CIFS protocol is the successor to the SMB protocol and is supported by
  most Windows servers and many other commercial servers and Network Attached
  Storage appliances as well as by the popular Open Source server Samba.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mount.cifs utility attaches the UNC name (exported network resource)
  specified as <i>service</i> (using //server/share syntax, where
  &quot;server&quot; is the server name or IP address and &quot;share&quot; is
  the name of the share) to the local directory <i>mount-point</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options to <i>mount.cifs</i> are specified as a comma-separated list of
  key=value pairs. It is possible to send options other than those listed here,
  assuming that the cifs filesystem kernel module (cifs.ko) supports them.
  Unrecognized cifs mount options passed to the cifs vfs kernel code will be
  logged to the kernel log.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>mount.cifs</i> causes the cifs vfs to launch a thread named cifsd. After
  mounting it keeps running until the mounted resource is unmounted (usually via
  the umount utility).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>mount.cifs -V</i> command displays the version of cifs mount helper.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>modinfo cifs</i> command displays the version of cifs module.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
username= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">specifies the username to connect as. If this
  is not given, then the environment variable <i>USER</i> is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier versions of mount.cifs also allowed one to specify the username in a
  &quot;user%password&quot; or &quot;workgroup/user&quot; or
  &quot;workgroup/user%password&quot; to allow the password and workgroup to be
  specified as part of the username. Support for those alternate username
  formats is now deprecated and should no longer be used. Users should use the
  discrete &quot;password=&quot; and &quot;domain=&quot; to specify those
  values. While some versions of the cifs kernel module accept &quot;user=&quot;
  as an abbreviation for this option, its use can confuse the standard mount
  program into thinking that this is a non-superuser mount. It is therefore
  recommended to use the full &quot;username=&quot; option name.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
password= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">specifies the CIFS password. If this option is
  not given then the environment variable <i>PASSWD</i> is used. If the password
  is not specified directly or indirectly via an argument to mount,
  <i>mount.cifs</i> will prompt for a password, unless the guest option is
  specified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that a password which contains the delimiter character (i.e. a comma
  &#x00B4;,&#x00B4;) will fail to be parsed correctly on the command line.
  However, the same password defined in the PASSWD environment variable or via a
  credentials file (see below) or entered at the password prompt will be read
  correctly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
credentials= <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">specifies a file that contains a username
  and/or password and optionally the name of the workgroup. The format of the
  file is:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
		username= <i>value</i>
		password= <i>value</i>
		domain= <i>value</i>
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is preferred over having passwords in plaintext in a shared file, such as
  /etc/fstab. Be sure to protect any credentials file properly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
uid= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">sets the uid that will own all files or
  directories on the mounted filesystem when the server does not provide
  ownership information. It may be specified as either a username or a numeric
  uid. When not specified, the default is uid 0. The mount.cifs helper must be
  at version 1.10 or higher to support specifying the uid in non-numeric form.
  See the section on FILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS below for more
  information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
forceuid
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">instructs the client to ignore any uid
  provided by the server for files and directories and to always assign the
  owner to be the value of the uid= option. See the section on FILE AND
  DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS below for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
cruid= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">sets the uid of the owner of the credentials
  cache. This is primarily useful with sec=krb5. The default is the real uid of
  the process performing the mount. Setting this parameter directs the upcall to
  look for a credentials cache owned by that user.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
gid= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">sets the gid that will own all files or
  directories on the mounted filesystem when the server does not provide
  ownership information. It may be specified as either a groupname or a numeric
  gid. When not specified, the default is gid 0. The mount.cifs helper must be
  at version 1.10 or higher to support specifying the gid in non-numeric form.
  See the section on FILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS below for more
  information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
forcegid
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">instructs the client to ignore any gid
  provided by the server for files and directories and to always assign the
  owner to be the value of the gid= option. See the section on FILE AND
  DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS below for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
port= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">sets the port number on which the client will
  attempt to contact the CIFS server. If this value is specified, look for an
  existing connection with this port, and use that if one exists. If one doesn't
  exist, try to create a new connection on that port. If that connection fails,
  return an error. If this value isn't specified, look for an existing
  connection on port 445 or 139. If no such connection exists, try to connect on
  port 445 first and then port 139 if that fails. Return an error if both
  fail.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
servernetbiosname= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify the server netbios name (RFC1001 name)
  to use when attempting to setup a session to the server. Although rarely
  needed for mounting to newer servers, this option is needed for mounting to
  some older servers (such as OS/2 or Windows 98 and Windows ME) since when
  connecting over port 139 they, unlike most newer servers, do not support a
  default server name. A server name can be up to 15 characters long and is
  usually uppercased.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
servern= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Synonym for <i>servernetbiosname</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
netbiosname= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When mounting to servers via port 139,
  specifies the RFC1001 source name to use to represent the client netbios
  machine name when doing the RFC1001 netbios session initialize.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
file_mode= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the server does not support the CIFS Unix
  extensions this overrides the default file mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
dir_mode= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the server does not support the CIFS Unix
  extensions this overrides the default mode for directories.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
ip= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">sets the destination IP address. This option
  is set automatically if the server name portion of the requested UNC name can
  be resolved so rarely needs to be specified by the user.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
domain= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">sets the domain (workgroup) of the user</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
guest
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">don&#x00B4;t prompt for a password</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
iocharset
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Charset used to convert local path names to
  and from Unicode. Unicode is used by default for network path names if the
  server supports it. If iocharset is not specified then the nls_default
  specified during the local client kernel build will be used. If server does
  not support Unicode, this parameter is unused.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
ro
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">mount read-only</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
rw
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">mount read-write</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
setuids
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the CIFS Unix extensions are negotiated
  with the server the client will attempt to set the effective uid and gid of
  the local process on newly created files, directories, and devices (create,
  mkdir, mknod). If the CIFS Unix Extensions are not negotiated, for newly
  created files and directories instead of using the default uid and gid
  specified on the the mount, cache the new file&#x00B4;s uid and gid locally
  which means that the uid for the file can change when the inode is reloaded
  (or the user remounts the share).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nosetuids
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The client will not attempt to set the uid and
  gid on on newly created files, directories, and devices (create, mkdir, mknod)
  which will result in the server setting the uid and gid to the default
  (usually the server uid of the user who mounted the share). Letting the server
  (rather than the client) set the uid and gid is the default.If the CIFS Unix
  Extensions are not negotiated then the uid and gid for new files will appear
  to be the uid (gid) of the mounter or the uid (gid) parameter specified on the
  mount.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perm
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Client does permission checks (vfs_permission
  check of uid and gid of the file against the mode and desired operation), Note
  that this is in addition to the normal ACL check on the target machine done by
  the server software. Client permission checking is enabled by default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
noperm
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Client does not do permission checks. This can
  expose files on this mount to access by other users on the local client
  system. It is typically only needed when the server supports the CIFS Unix
  Extensions but the UIDs/GIDs on the client and server system do not match
  closely enough to allow access by the user doing the mount. Note that this
  does not affect the normal ACL check on the target machine done by the server
  software (of the server ACL against the user name provided at mount
  time).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
dynperm
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Instructs the server to maintain ownership and
  permissions in memory that can&#x00B4;t be stored on the server. This
  information can disappear at any time (whenever the inode is flushed from the
  cache), so while this may help make some applications work, it&#x00B4;s
  behavior is somewhat unreliable. See the section below on FILE AND DIRECTORY
  OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
cache=
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Cache mode. See the section below on CACHE
  COHERENCY for details. Allowed values are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;none: do not cache file data at
  all</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;strict: follow the CIFS/SMB2 protocol
  strictly</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;loose: allow loose caching
  semantics</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default in kernels prior to 3.7 was &quot;loose&quot;. As of kernel 3.7 the
  default is &quot;strict&quot;.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
directio
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not do inode data caching on files opened
  on this mount. This precludes mmaping files on this mount. In some cases with
  fast networks and little or no caching benefits on the client (e.g. when the
  application is doing large sequential reads bigger than page size without
  rereading the same data) this can provide better performance than the default
  behavior which caches reads (readahead) and writes (writebehind) through the
  local Linux client pagecache if oplock (caching token) is granted and held.
  Note that direct allows write operations larger than page size to be sent to
  the server. On some kernels this requires the cifs.ko module to be built with
  the CIFS_EXPERIMENTAL configure option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is will be deprecated in 3.7. Users should use cache=none instead on
  more recent kernels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
strictcache
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use for switching on strict cache mode. In
  this mode the client reads from the cache all the time it has Oplock Level II,
  otherwise - read from the server. As for write - the client stores a data in
  the cache in Exclusive Oplock case, otherwise - write directly to the server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is will be deprecated in 3.7. Users should use cache=strict instead
  on more recent kernels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
rwpidforward
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Forward pid of a process who opened a file to
  any read or write operation on that file. This prevent applications like WINE
  from failing on read and write if we use mandatory brlock style.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
mapchars
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Translate six of the seven reserved characters
  (not backslash, but including the colon, question mark, pipe, asterik, greater
  than and less than characters) to the remap range (above 0xF000), which also
  allows the CIFS client to recognize files created with such characters by
  Windows&#x00B4;s POSIX emulation. This can also be useful when mounting to
  most versions of Samba (which also forbids creating and opening files whose
  names contain any of these seven characters). This has no effect if the server
  does not support Unicode on the wire. Please note that the files created with
  mapchars mount option may not be accessible if the share is mounted without
  that option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nomapchars
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not translate any of these seven characters
  (default)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
intr
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">currently unimplemented</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nointr
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(default) currently unimplemented</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
hard
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The program accessing a file on the cifs
  mounted file system will hang when the server crashes.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
soft
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(default) The program accessing a file on the
  cifs mounted file system will not hang when the server crashes and will return
  errors to the user application.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
noacl
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not allow POSIX ACL operations even if
  server would support them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The CIFS client can get and set POSIX ACLs (getfacl, setfacl) to Samba servers
  version 3.0.10 and later. Setting POSIX ACLs requires enabling both CIFS_XATTR
  and then CIFS_POSIX support in the CIFS configuration options when building
  the cifs module. POSIX ACL support can be disabled on a per mount basis by
  specifying &quot;noacl&quot; on mount.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
cifsacl
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option is used to map CIFS/NTFS ACLs
  to/from Linux permission bits, map SIDs to/from UIDs and GIDs, and get and set
  Security Descriptors.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See sections on <i>CIFS/NTFS ACL, SID/UID/GID MAPPING, SECURITY DESCRIPTORS</i>
  for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
backupuid= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">File access by this user shall be done with
  the backup intent flag set. Either a name or an id must be provided as an
  argument, there are no default values.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See section <i>ACCESSING FILES WITH BACKUP INTENT</i> for more details</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
backupgid= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">File access by users who are members of this
  group shall be done with the backup intent flag set. Either a name or an id
  must be provided as an argument, there are no default values.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See section <i>ACCESSING FILES WITH BACKUP INTENT</i> for more details</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nocase
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Request case insensitive path name matching
  (case sensitive is the default if the server suports it).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
ignorecase
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Synonym for <i>nocase</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
sec=
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Security mode. Allowed values are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;none - attempt to connection as a null
  user (no name)</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;krb5 - Use Kerberos version 5
  authentication</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;krb5i - Use Kerberos authentication
  and forcibly enable packet signing</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;ntlm - Use NTLM password hashing</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;ntlmi - Use NTLM password hashing and
  force packet signing</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;ntlmv2 - Use NTLMv2 password
  hashing</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;ntlmv2i - Use NTLMv2 password hashing
  and force packet signing</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;ntlmssp - Use NTLMv2 password hashing
  encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP message</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;ntlmsspi - Use NTLMv2 password hashing
  encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP message, and force packet signing</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default in mainline kernel versions prior to v3.8 was sec=ntlm. In v3.8, the
  default was changed to sec=ntlmssp.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the server requires signing during protocol negotiation, then it may be
  enabled automatically. Packet signing may also be enabled automatically if
  it's enabled in /proc/fs/cifs/SecurityFlags.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nobrl
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not send byte range lock requests to the
  server. This is necessary for certain applications that break with cifs style
  mandatory byte range locks (and most cifs servers do not yet support
  requesting advisory byte range locks).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
sfu
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When the CIFS Unix Extensions are not
  negotiated, attempt to create device files and fifos in a format compatible
  with Services for Unix (SFU). In addition retrieve bits 10-12 of the mode via
  the SETFILEBITS extended attribute (as SFU does). In the future the bottom 9
  bits of the mode mode also will be emulated using queries of the security
  descriptor (ACL). [NB: requires version 1.39 or later of the CIFS VFS. To
  recognize symlinks and be able to create symlinks in an SFU interoperable form
  requires version 1.40 or later of the CIFS VFS kernel module.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
serverino
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use inode numbers (unique persistent file
  identifiers) returned by the server instead of automatically generating
  temporary inode numbers on the client. Although server inode numbers make it
  easier to spot hardlinked files (as they will have the same inode numbers) and
  inode numbers may be persistent (which is userful for some sofware), the
  server does not guarantee that the inode numbers are unique if multiple server
  side mounts are exported under a single share (since inode numbers on the
  servers might not be unique if multiple filesystems are mounted under the same
  shared higher level directory). Note that not all servers support returning
  server inode numbers, although those that support the CIFS Unix Extensions,
  and Windows 2000 and later servers typically do support this (although not
  necessarily on every local server filesystem). Parameter has no effect if the
  server lacks support for returning inode numbers or equivalent. This behavior
  is enabled by default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
noserverino
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Client generates inode numbers itself rather
  than using the actual ones from the server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See section <i>INODE NUMBERS</i> for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nounix
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Disable the CIFS Unix Extensions for this
  mount. This can be useful in order to turn off multiple settings at once. This
  includes POSIX acls, POSIX locks, POSIX paths, symlink support and retrieving
  uids/gids/mode from the server. This can also be useful to work around a bug
  in a server that supports Unix Extensions.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See section <i>INODE NUMBERS</i> for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nouser_xattr
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not allow getfattr/setfattr to get/set
  xattrs, even if server would support it otherwise. The default is for xattr
  support to be enabled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
rsize= <i>bytes</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Maximum amount of data that the kernel will
  request in a read request in bytes. Prior to kernel 3.2.0, the default was
  16k, and the maximum size was limited by the CIFSMaxBufSize module parameter.
  As of kernel 3.2.0, the behavior varies according to whether POSIX extensions
  are enabled on the mount and the server supports large POSIX reads. If they
  are, then the default is 1M, and the maxmimum is 16M. If they are not
  supported by the server, then the default is 60k and the maximum is around
  127k. The reason for the 60k is because it's the maximum size read that
  windows servers can fill. Note that this value is a maximum, and the client
  may settle on a smaller size to accomodate what the server supports. In
  kernels prior to 3.2.0, no negotiation is performed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
wsize= <i>bytes</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Maximum amount of data that the kernel will
  send in a write request in bytes. Prior to kernel 3.0.0, the default and
  maximum was 57344 (14 * 4096 pages). As of 3.0.0, the default depends on
  whether the client and server negotiate large writes via POSIX extensions. If
  they do, then the default is 1M, and the maximum allowed is 16M. If they do
  not, then the default is 65536 and the maximum allowed is 131007.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this value is just a starting point for negotiation in 3.0.0 and up.
  The client and server may negotiate this size downward according to the
  server's capabilities. In kernels prior to 3.0.0, no negotiation is performed.
  It can end up with an existing superblock if this value isn't specified or
  it's greater or equal than the existing one.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
fsc
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enable local disk caching using FS-Cache for
  CIFS. This option could be useful to improve performance on a slow link,
  heavily loaded server and/or network where reading from the disk is faster
  than reading from the server (over the network). This could also impact the
  scalability positively as the number of calls to the server are reduced. But,
  be warned that local caching is not suitable for all workloads, for e.g.,
  read-once type workloads. So, you need to consider carefully the
  situation/workload before using this option. Currently, local disk caching is
  enabled for CIFS files opened as read-only.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTE: This feature is available only in the recent kernels that have been built
  with the kernel config option CONFIG_CIFS_FSCACHE. You also need to have
  cachefilesd daemon installed and running to make the cache operational.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
multiuser
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Map user accesses to individual credentials
  when accessing the server. By default, CIFS mounts only use a single set of
  user credentials (the mount credentials) when accessing a share. With this
  option, the client instead creates a new session with the server using the
  user's credentials whenever a new user accesses the mount. Further accesses by
  that user will also use those credentials. Because the kernel cannot prompt
  for passwords, multiuser mounts are limited to mounts using sec= options that
  don't require passwords.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With this change, it's feasible for the server to handle permissions
  enforcement, so this option also implies &quot;noperm&quot;. Furthermore, when
  unix extensions aren't in use and the administrator has not overriden
  ownership using the uid= or gid= options, ownership of files is presented as
  the current user accessing the share.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
actimeo= <i>arg</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The time (in seconds) that the CIFS client
  caches attributes of a file or directory before it requests attribute
  information from a server. During this period the changes that occur on the
  server remain undetected until the client checks the server again.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, the attribute cache timeout is set to 1 second. This means more
  frequent on-the-wire calls to the server to check whether attributes have
  changed which could impact performance. With this option users can make a
  tradeoff between performance and cache metadata correctness, depending on
  workload needs. Shorter timeouts mean better cache coherency, but frequent
  increased number of calls to the server. Longer timeouts mean a reduced number
  of calls to the server but looser cache coherency. The actimeo value is a
  positive integer that can hold values between 0 and a maximum value of 2^30 *
  HZ (frequency of timer interrupt) setting.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
noposixpaths
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If unix extensions are enabled on a share,
  then the client will typically allow filenames to include any character
  besides '/' in a pathname component, and will use forward slashes as a
  pathname delimiter. This option prevents the client from attempting to
  negotiate the use of posix-style pathnames to the server.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
posixpaths
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Inverse of <i>noposixpaths</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
prefixpath=
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">It's possible to mount a subdirectory of a
  share. The preferred way to do this is to append the path to the UNC when
  mounting. However, it's also possible to do the same by setting this option
  and providing the path there.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
vers=
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">SMB protocol version. Allowed values are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;1.0 - The classic CIFS/SMBv1 protocol.
  This is the default.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;2.0 - The SMBv2.002 protocol. This was
  initially introduced in Windows Vista Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2008.
  Note that the initial release version of Windows Vista spoke a slightly
  different dialect (2.000) that is not supported.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;2.1 - The SMBv2.1 protocol that was
  introduced in Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008R2.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;3.0 - The SMBv3.0 protocol that was
  introduced in Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note too that while this option governs the protocol version used, not all
  features of each version are available.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--verbose
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print additional debugging information for the
  mount. Note that this parameter must be specified before the -o. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt --verbose -o user=username</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SERVICE_FORMATTING_AND_DELIMITERS"><a class="selflink" href="#SERVICE_FORMATTING_AND_DELIMITERS">SERVICE
  FORMATTING AND DELIMITERS</a></h1>
It&#x00B4;s generally preferred to use forward slashes (/) as a delimiter in
  service names. They are considered to be the &quot;universal delimiter&quot;
  since they are generally not allowed to be embedded within path components on
  Windows machines and the client can convert them to blackslashes (\)
  unconditionally. Conversely, backslash characters are allowed by POSIX to be
  part of a path component, and can&#x00B4;t be automatically converted in the
  same way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
mount.cifs will attempt to convert backslashes to forward slashes where
  it&#x00B4;s able to do so, but it cannot do so in any path component following
  the sharename.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INODE_NUMBERS"><a class="selflink" href="#INODE_NUMBERS">INODE
  NUMBERS</a></h1>
When Unix Extensions are enabled, we use the actual inode number provided by the
  server in response to the POSIX calls as an inode number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When Unix Extensions are disabled and &quot;serverino&quot; mount option is
  enabled there is no way to get the server inode number. The client typically
  maps the server-assigned &quot;UniqueID&quot; onto an inode number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the UniqueID is a different value from the server inode number. The
  UniqueID value is unique over the scope of the entire server and is often
  greater than 2 power 32. This value often makes programs that are not compiled
  with LFS (Large File Support), to trigger a glibc EOVERFLOW error as this
  won&#x00B4;t fit in the target structure field. It is strongly recommended to
  compile your programs with LFS support (i.e. with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64) to
  prevent this problem. You can also use &quot;noserverino&quot; mount option to
  generate inode numbers smaller than 2 power 32 on the client. But you may not
  be able to detect hardlinks properly.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CACHE_COHERENCY"><a class="selflink" href="#CACHE_COHERENCY">CACHE
  COHERENCY</a></h1>
With a network filesystem such as CIFS or NFS, the client must contend with the
  fact that activity on other clients or the server could change the contents or
  attributes of a file without the client being aware of it. One way to deal
  with such a problem is to mandate that all file accesses go to the server
  directly. This is performance prohibitive however, so most protocols have some
  mechanism to allow the client to cache data locally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CIFS protocol mandates (in effect) that the client should not cache file
  data unless it holds an opportunistic lock (aka oplock) or a lease. Both of
  these entities allow the client to guarantee certain types of exclusive access
  to a file so that it can access its contents without needing to continually
  interact with the server. The server will call back the client when it needs
  to revoke either of them and allow the client a certain amount of time to
  flush any cached data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The cifs client uses the kernel's pagecache to cache file data. Any I/O that's
  done through the pagecache is generally page-aligned. This can be problematic
  when combined with byte-range locks as Windows' locking is mandatory and can
  block reads and writes from occurring.
<div class="Pp"></div>
cache=none means that the client never utilizes the cache for normal reads and
  writes. It always accesses the server directly to satisfy a read or write
  request.
<div class="Pp"></div>
cache=strict means that the client will attempt to follow the CIFS/SMB2 protocol
  strictly. That is, the cache is only trusted when the client holds an oplock.
  When the client does not hold an oplock, then the client bypasses the cache
  and accesses the server directly to satisfy a read or write request. By doing
  this, the client avoids problems with byte range locks. Additionally, byte
  range locks are cached on the client when it holds an oplock and are
  &quot;pushed&quot; to the server when that oplock is recalled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
cache=loose allows the client to use looser protocol semantics which can
  sometimes provide better performance at the expense of cache coherency. File
  access always involves the pagecache. When an oplock or lease is not held,
  then the client will attempt to flush the cache soon after a write to a file.
  Note that that flush does not necessarily occur before a write system call
  returns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the case of a read without holding an oplock, the client will attempt to
  periodically check the attributes of the file in order to ascertain whether it
  has changed and the cache might no longer be valid. This mechanism is much
  like the one that NFSv2/3 use for cache coherency, but it particularly
  problematic with CIFS. Windows is quite &quot;lazy&quot; with respect to
  updating the &quot;LastWriteTime&quot; field that the client uses to verify
  this. The effect is that cache=loose can cause data corruption when multiple
  readers and writers are working on the same files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because of this, when multiple clients are accessing the same set of files, then
  cache=strict is recommended. That helps eliminate problems with cache
  coherency by following the CIFS/SMB2 protocols more strictly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note too that no matter what caching model is used, the client will always use
  the pagecache to handle mmap'ed files. Writes to mmap'ed files are only
  guaranteed to be flushed to the server when msync() is called, or on close().
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default in kernels prior to 3.7 was &quot;loose&quot;. As of 3.7, the
  default is &quot;strict&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CIFS/NTFS_ACL,_SID/UID/GID_MAPPING,_SECURITY_DESCRIPTORS"><a class="selflink" href="#CIFS/NTFS_ACL,_SID/UID/GID_MAPPING,_SECURITY_DESCRIPTORS">CIFS/NTFS
  ACL, SID/UID/GID MAPPING, SECURITY DESCRIPTORS</a></h1>
This option is used to work with file objects which posses Security Descriptors
  and CIFS/NTFS ACL instead of UID, GID, file permission bits, and POSIX ACL as
  user authentication model. This is the most common authentication model for
  CIFS servers and is the one used by Windows.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Support for this requires both CIFS_XATTR and CIFS_ACL support in the CIFS
  configuration options when building the cifs module.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A CIFS/NTFS ACL is mapped to file permission bits using an algorithm specified
  in the following Microsoft TechNet document:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463216.aspx</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order to map SIDs to/from UIDs and GIDs, the following is required:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a kernel upcall to the cifs.idmap
  utility set up via request-key.conf(5)</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;winbind support configured via
  nsswitch.conf(5) and smb.conf(5)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please refer to the respective manpages of cifs.idmap(8) and winbindd(8) for
  more information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Security descriptors for a file object can be retrieved and set directly using
  extended attribute named system.cifs_acl. The security descriptors presented
  via this interface are &quot;raw&quot; blobs of data and need a userspace
  utility to either parse and format or to assemble it such as
  <b>getcifsacl</b>(1) and <b>setcifsacl</b>(1) respectively.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some of the things to consider while using this mount option:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;There may be an increased latency when
  handling metadata due to additional requests to get and set security
  descriptors.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;The mapping between a CIFS/NTFS ACL
  and POSIX file permission bits is imperfect and some ACL information may be
  lost in the translation.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;If either upcall to cifs.idmap is not
  setup correctly or winbind is not configured and running, ID mapping will
  fail. In that case uid and gid will default to either to those values of the
  share or to the values of uid and/or gid mount options if specified.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACCESSING_FILES_WITH_BACKUP_INTENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ACCESSING_FILES_WITH_BACKUP_INTENT">ACCESSING
  FILES WITH BACKUP INTENT</a></h1>
For an user on the server, desired access to a file is determined by the
  permissions and rights associated with that file. This is typically
  accomplished using owenrship and ACL. For a user who does not have access
  rights to a file, it is still possible to access that file for a specific or a
  targeted purpose by granting special rights. One of the specific purposes is
  to access a file with the intent to either backup or restore i.e. backup
  intent. The right to access a file with the backup intent can typically be
  granted by making that user a part of the built-in group Backup Operators.
  Thus, when this user attempts to open a file with the backup intent, open
  request is sent by setting the bit FILE_OPEN_FOR_BACKUP_INTENT as one of the
  CreateOptions.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As an example, on a Windows server, a user named testuser, cannot open this file
  with such a security descriptor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
REVISION:0x1
<div style="height: 0.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
CONTROL:0x9404
<div style="height: 0.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
OWNER:Administrator
<div style="height: 0.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
GROUP:Domain Users
<div style="height: 0.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
ACL:Administrator:ALLOWED/0x0/FULL
<div class="Pp"></div>
But the user testuser, if it becomes part of the group Backup Operators, can
  open the file with the backup intent.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any user on the client side who can authenticate as such a user on the server,
  can access the files with the backup intent. But it is desirable and
  preferable for security reasons amongst many, to restrict this special right.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The mount option backupuid is used to restrict this special right to a user
  which is specified by either a name or an id. The mount option backupgid is
  used to restrict this special right to the users in a group which is specified
  by either a name or an id. Only users maching either backupuid or backupgid
  shall attempt to access files with backup intent. These two mount options can
  be used together.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_AND_DIRECTORY_OWNERSHIP_AND_PERMISSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_AND_DIRECTORY_OWNERSHIP_AND_PERMISSIONS">FILE
  AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS</a></h1>
The core CIFS protocol does not provide unix ownership information or mode for
  files and directories. Because of this, files and directories will generally
  appear to be owned by whatever values the uid= or gid= options are set, and
  will have permissions set to the default file_mode and dir_mode for the mount.
  Attempting to change these values via chmod/chown will return success but have
  no effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the client and server negotiate unix extensions, files and directories will
  be assigned the uid, gid, and mode provided by the server. Because CIFS mounts
  are generally single-user, and the same credentials are used no matter what
  user accesses the mount, newly created files and directories will generally be
  given ownership corresponding to whatever credentials were used to mount the
  share.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the uid&#x00B4;s and gid&#x00B4;s being used do not match on the client and
  server, the forceuid and forcegid options may be helpful. Note however, that
  there is no corresponding option to override the mode. Permissions assigned to
  a file when forceuid or forcegid are in effect may not reflect the the real
  permissions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When unix extensions are not negotiated, it&#x00B4;s also possible to emulate
  them locally on the server using the &quot;dynperm&quot; mount option. When
  this mount option is in effect, newly created files and directories will
  receive what appear to be proper permissions. These permissions are not stored
  on the server however and can disappear at any time in the future (subject to
  the whims of the kernel flushing out the inode cache). In general, this mount
  option is discouraged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It&#x00B4;s also possible to override permission checking on the client
  altogether via the noperm option. Server-side permission checks cannot be
  overriden. The permission checks done by the server will always correspond to
  the credentials used to mount the share, and not necessarily to the user who
  is accessing the share.

This command may be used only by root, unless installed setuid, in which case

  into the mountpoint prior to the mount in order to be able to mount onto it.

The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading debug
  information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem. In the
  directory /proc/fs/cifs are various configuration files and pseudo files which
  can display debug information. There are additional startup options such as
  maximum buffer size and number of buffers which only may be set when the
  kernel cifs vfs (cifs.ko module) is loaded. These can be seen by running the
  modinfo utility against the file cifs.ko which will list the options that may
  be passed to cifs during module installation (device driver load). For more
  information see the kernel file fs/cifs/README.
