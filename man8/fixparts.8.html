<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fixparts - MBR partition table repair utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fixparts device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
FixParts (aka fixparts) is a text-mode menu-driven program
for repairing certain types of problems with Master Boot
Record (MBR) partition tables. The program has three design
<br>
goals, although a few additional features are supported, as
well:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It can remove stray GUID
Partition Table (GPT) data, which can be left behind on a
disk that was once used as a GPT disk but then incompletely
converted to the more common <br>
(as of 2011) MBR form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It can repair mis-sized
extended partitions -- either partitions that extend beyond
the physical end of the disk or that overlap with nearby
primary partitions. FixParts <br>
is designed in such a way that this type of repair occurs
automatically, so if it&rsquo;s the only problem with your
disk, you can launch the program and then immediately save
<br>
the partition table, making no manual changes, and the
program will fix the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* You can change primary
partitions into logical partitions or vice-versa, within
constraints imposed by the MBR data structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional features include the
ability to change partition type codes or boot/active flags,
to delete partitions, and to recompute CHS values. With the
possible exception of <br>
recomputing CHS values, these secondary features are better
performed with fdisk, because fixparts&rsquo; design means
that it&rsquo;s likely to alter partition numbering even
when such <br>
changes are not requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fixparts program employs a
user interface similar to that of Linux&rsquo;s fdisk, but
fixparts is much more specialized. Most importantly, you
can&rsquo;t create new partitions with fix&acirc; <br>
parts, although you can change primary/logical
assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the MBR scheme, partitions
come in three varieties:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary <br>
These partitions are defined in the first sector of the hard
disk and are limited in number to four. Some OSes, such as
Windows and FreeBSD, must boot from a primary par&acirc;
<br>
tition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extended <br>
Extended partitions are specialized primary partitions. They
serve as holding areas for logical partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logical <br>
A disk can contain an arbitrary number of logical partitions
(fixparts, however, imposes a limit of 124 logical
partitions). All the logical partitions reside inside a <br>
single extended partition, and are defined using a
linked-list data structure. This fact means that every
logical partition must be preceded by at least one sector of
<br>
unallocated space to hold its defining data structure (an
Extended Boot Record, or EBR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These distinctions mean that
primary and logical partitions cannot be arbitrarily
interspersed. A disk can contain one to three primary
partitions, a block of one or more logical <br>
partitions, and one to three more primary partitions (for a
total of three primary partitions, not counting the extended
partition). Primary partitions may not be sandwiched <br>
between logical partitions, since this would mean placing a
primary partition within an extended partition (which is
just a specific type of primary partition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike most disk utilities,
fixparts&rsquo; user interface ignores extended partitions.
Internally, the program discards the information on the
original extended partition and, when <br>
you tell it to save its changes, it generates a new extended
partition to contain the then-defined logical partitions.
This is done because most of the repairs and manipulations
<br>
the tool performs require generating a fresh extended
partition, so keeping the original in the user interface
would only be a complication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another unusual feature of
fixparts&rsquo; user interface is that partition numbers do
not necessarily correlate with primary/logical status. In
most utilities, partitions 1-4 corre&acirc; <br>
spond to primary partitions, whereas partitions 5 and up are
logical partitions. In fixparts, any partition number may be
assigned primary or logical status, so long as the rules
<br>
for layout described earlier are obeyed. When the partition
table is saved, partitions will be assigned appropriately
and then tools such as the Linux kernel and fdisk will give
<br>
them conventional numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it first starts, fixparts
performs a scan for GPT data. If the disk looks like a
conventional GPT disk, fixparts refuses to run. If the disk
appears to be a conventional MBR <br>
disk but GPT signatures are present in the GPT primary or
secondary header areas, fixparts offers to delete this
extraneous data. If you tell it to do so, the program
immediately <br>
wipes the GPT header or headers. (If only one header was
found, only that one header will be erased, to minimize the
risk of damaging a boot loader or other data that might have
<br>
overwritten just one of the GPT headers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the exception of optionally
erasing leftover GPT data when it first starts, fixparts
keeps all changes in memory until the user writes changes
with the w command. Thus, you <br>
can adjust your partitions in the user interface and abort
those changes by typing q to quit without saving
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The fixparts utility supports no command-line options,
except for specification of the target device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most interactions with fixparts
occur with its interactive text-mode menu. Specific
functions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Toggle the active/boot flag.
This flag is required by some boot loaders and OSes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Recompute the
cylinder/head/sector (CHS) values for all partitions. CHS
addressing mode is largely obsolete, but some OSes and
utilities complain if they don&rsquo;t like the <br>
CHS values. Note that fixparts&rsquo; CHS values are likely
to be incorrect on disks smaller than about 8 GiB except on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Change a partition&rsquo;s
status to logical. This option will only work if the current
partition layout supports such a change. Note that if
changing a partition&rsquo;s status in <br>
this way is not currently possible, making some other change
may make it possible. For instance, omitting a partition
that precedes the target partition may enable con&acirc;
<br>
verting a partition to logical form if there had been no
free sectors between the two partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Omit a partition. Once
omitted, the partition will still appear in the fixparts
partition list, but it will be flagged as omitted. You can
subsequently convert it to pri&acirc; <br>
mary or logical form with the r or l commands, respectively.
When you save your changes with w, though, the partition
will be lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Display basic partition
summary data. This includes partition&rsquo;s number, the
boot/active flag&rsquo;s status, starting and ending sector
numbers, primary/logical/omitted status, <br>
whether or not the partition may be converted to logical
form, and the partition&rsquo;s MBR types code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit from the program without
saving your changes. Use this option if you just wanted to
view information or if you make a mistake and want to back
out of all your <br>
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Change a partition&rsquo;s
status to primary. This option will only work if the current
partition layout supports such a change. Note that every
partition can theoretically <br>
become a primary partition, although in some configurations,
making this change will require omitting some partitions. If
fixparts refuses to allow changing a partition <br>
to primary, you may need to convert other partitions to
logical form or omit them entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Sort partition entries. This
option orders partitions in the display to match their
on-disk positions, which can make understanding the disk
layout easier in some cases. <br>
This option has no effect on the ultimate ordering of
logical partitions, which are sorted before being saved. The
order of primary partitions in the final saved partition
<br>
table may be affected by this option. In both cases, as
already noted, the partition numbers displayed by fixparts
may not be the same as those used by the kernel or
dis&acirc; <br>
played by other partitioning tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Change a partition&rsquo;s
type code. You enter the type code using a one-byte
hexadecimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Write data. Use this command
to save your changes and exit from the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Print the menu. Type this
command (or any other unrecognized command) to see a summary
of available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As of January 2013 (version 0.8.6), fixparts should be
considered beta software. Known bugs and limitations
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program compiles correctly
only on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows. Linux
versions for x86-64 (64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC
(32-bit) have been tested, <br>
with the x86-64 version having seen the most testing. Under
FreeBSD, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions have been
tested. Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X and Win&acirc;
<br>
dows have been tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The FreeBSD version of the
program can&rsquo;t write changes to the partition table to
a disk when existing partitions on that disk are mounted.
(The same problem exists with <br>
many other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.)
This limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program can load only up
to 128 partitions (4 primary partitions and 124 logical
partitions). This limit can be raised by changing the
#define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in <br>
the basicmbr.h source code file and recompiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program can read
partitions only if the disk has correct LBA partition
descriptors. These descriptors should be present on any disk
over 8 GiB in size or on smaller <br>
disks partitioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program makes no effort to
preserve partition numbers. This can have consequences for
boot loaders and for mounting filesystems via /etc/fstab. It
may be necessary to <br>
edit configuration files or even to re-install your boot
loader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program may change the order
of partitions in the partition table.</p>
