<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_wr_mode - write (modify) SCSI mode page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_wr_mode [--contents=H,H...] [--dbd] [--force] [--help]
[--len=10|6] [--mask=M,M...] [--page=PG[,SPG]] [--save]
[--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Writes a modified mode page to DEVICE. Uses the SCSI MODE
SENSE (6 or 10 byte variant) command to fetch the existing
mode data which includes a mode page (or subpage). It then
<br>
combines that with the contents, potentially masked, and
writes the modified mode page with the SCSI MODE SELECT (6
or 10 byte variant) command. This utility does not modify
the <br>
block descriptor(s); if any block descriptors are fetched by
the MODE SENSE command then the same block descriptors are
written back with the following MODE SELECT command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a contents argument is not
given then the various components (i.e. header, block
descriptor(s) and mode page) of the &quot;current&quot;
values of the existing mode page are printed <br>
out. In this case the mode page is not altered on the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the contents are specified,
and a mask is not specified, then the contents must match
the existing mode page in various aspects unless the --force
option is given. These <br>
include length, mode page code and subpage code if
applicable. If all is well then the contents string is
written to DEVICE as the new mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both contents and mask
strings are specified then only bit positions in the
contents corresponding to set bits in the mask are taken
while the existing mode page supplies bit <br>
positions corresponding to clear bits. When a mask is given
then the mask and/or the contents may be shorter than the
existing mode page. If the mask is shorter than the
con&acirc; <br>
tents then the remaining bytes are taken from the contents.
If the contents are shorter than the existing mode page then
the remaining bytes are taken from the existing mod
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The force option allows the
contents string to be written as the new mode page without
any prior checks on the existing mode page. This should only
be required for vendor spe&acirc; <br>
cific mode pages. The existing mode data is ignored apart
from the block descriptors which can be suppressed with the
--dbd option if need be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing individual fields in a
mode page is probably more easily done with the sdparm
utility. Fields can be identified by acronym or by a
numerical descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --contents=H,H... <br>
where H,H... is a string of comma separated hex numbers each
of which should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff
inclusive). A (single) space separated string of hex <br>
numbers is also allowed but the list needs to be in quotes.
This is the new contents of the mode page to be written to
DEVICE, potentially filtered by the mask string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --contents=- <br>
reads contents string from stdin. The hex numbers in the
string may be comma, space, tab or linefeed (newline)
separated. If a line contains &quot;#&quot; then the
remaining charac&acirc; <br>
ters on that line are ignored. Otherwise each non separator
character should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff
inclusive). This forms the new contents of the mode page
<br>
to be written to DEVICE, potentially filtered by the mask
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dbd <br>
disable block descriptors (DBD flag in cdb). Some device
types include block descriptors in the mode data returned by
a MODE SENSE command. If so the same block descrip&acirc;
<br>
tors are written by the MODE SELECT command. This option
instructs the MODE SENSE command not to return any block
descriptors. This would be a sensible default for this <br>
utility apart from the fact that not all SCSI devices
support the DBD bit in the cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
force the contents string to be taken as the new mode page,
or at least doesn&rsquo;t do checks on the existing mode
page. Note that DEVICE may still reject the new contents for
<br>
the mode page. Cannot be given with the --mask=M,M...
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --len=10 | 6 <br>
length of the SCSI commands (cdb) sent to DEVICE. The
default is 10 so 10 byte MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT commands
are issued. Some old devices don&rsquo;t support the 10 byte
<br>
variants hence this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mask=M,M... <br>
where M,M... is a string of comma separated hex numbers each
of which should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff
inclusive). A (single) space separated string of hex <br>
numbers is also allowed but the list needs to be in quotes.
The mask chooses (bit by bit) whether the new mode page
comes from the contents (mask bit set) or from the <br>
existing mode page (mask bit clear). If the mask string is
shorter than the contents string then the remaining bytes
are taken from the contents string. If the contents <br>
string is shorter than the existing mode page then the
remaining bytes are taken from the existing mode page (i.e.
they are left unaltered).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --page=PG <br>
where PG is the page code value to fetch and modify. The
page code is in hex and should be between 0 and 3e
inclusive. Notice that page code 3f to fetch all mode pages
is <br>
disallowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --page=PG,SPG <br>
where PG is the page code value and SPG is the subpage code
value to fetch and modify. Both values are in hex. The
subpage code should be between 0 and fe inclusive. <br>
Notice that subpage code ff to fetch all mode subpages (for
a given mode page or all mode pages in the case of 3f,ff) is
disallowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --save <br>
changes the &quot;saved&quot; mode page when MODE SELECT is
successful. By default (i.e. when --save is not used) only
the &quot;current&quot; mode page values are changed when
MODE SELECT is <br>
successful. In this case the new mode page will stay in
effect until the device is reset (e.g. power cycled). When
it restarts the &quot;saved&quot; values for the mode page
will <br>
be re-instated. So to make changes permanent use the --save
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This utility does not check whether the contents string is
trying to modify parts of the mode page which are
changeable. The device should do that and if some part is
not change&acirc; <br>
able then it should report: &quot;Invalid field in parameter
list&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some mode pages are not
saveable. If so an attempt to use the --save option should
cause an error to be reported from the device: &quot;Illegal
field in cdb&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device is required to do
various checks before it accepts a new mode page. If these
checks fail then the mode page is not altered and either a
&quot;parameter list length error&quot; <br>
or an &quot;invalid field in parameter list&quot; error is
returned by the device in the sense data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recommended way to modify a
mode page is to read it with a MODE SENSE, modify some part
of it then write it back to the device with a MODE SELECT
command. For example, read&acirc; <br>
ing an existing mode page can be accomplished with
&rsquo;sg_modes -p=1a -r /dev/sdb &gt; mp_1a.txt&rsquo; (the
power condition mode page). The mp_1a.txt file can be edited
and then used as the <br>
contents string to this utility (e.g. &rsquo;sg_wr_mode -p
1a -s -c - /dev/sdb &lt; mp_1a.txt&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two fields differ between what
is read from the device with MODE SENSE and what is written
to the device with MODE SELECT: the mode data length is
reserved (i.e. zero(es)) in a <br>
MODE SELECT command while the PS bit ((sub)page byte 0 bit
7) in each mode (sub)page is reserved (zero) in a MODE
SELECT command. The PS bit given in the contents string is
<br>
zeroed unless the --force option is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This utility can be used together with the sg_modes utility.
To re-instate the default mode page values (i.e. the mode
page values chosen by the manufacturer of the device) as
<br>
both the current and saved mode page values the following
sequence could be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sg_modes --control=2 --page=1a
-r /dev/sda &gt; t <br>
$ sg_wr_mode --page=1a --contents=- --save /dev/sda &lt;
t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next is an example of using a
mask to modify the &quot;idle condition counter&quot; of the
&quot;power condition&quot; mode page (0x1a) from 0x28 to
0x37. Note that the change is not saved so the <br>
&quot;idle condition counter&quot; will revert to 0x28 after
the next power cycle. The output from sg_modes is
abridged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sg_modes --page=1a /dev/hdc
<br>
&gt;&gt; Power condition (mmc), page_control: current <br>
00 1a 0a 00 03 00 00 00 28 00 00 01 2c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sg_wr_mode -p 1a -c
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37 -m 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ff /dev/hdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sg_modes -p 1a /dev/hdc <br>
&gt;&gt; Power condition (mmc), page_control: current <br>
00 1a 0a 00 03 00 00 00 37 00 00 01 2c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_wr_mode is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
