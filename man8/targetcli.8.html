<p>targetcli(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
targetcli(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
targetcli - administration shell for storage targets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
targetcli is a shell for viewing, editing, and saving the
configuration of the kernel&rsquo;s target subsystem, also
known as LIO. It enables the administrator to assign local
storage <br>
resources backed by either files, volumes, local SCSI
devices, or ramdisk, and export them to remote systems via
network fabrics, such as iSCSI or FCoE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration layout is
tree-based, similar to a filesystem, and is navigated in a
similar manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
targetcli</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">targetcli [cmd]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoke targetcli as root to
enter the configuration shell, or follow with a command to
execute but do not enter the shell. Use ls to list nodes
below the current path. Moving <br>
around the tree is accomplished by the cd command, or by
entering the new location directly. Objects are created
using create, removed using delete. Use help &lt;cmd&gt; for
addi&acirc; <br>
tional usage information. Tab-completion is available for
commands and command arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration changes in
targetcli are made immediately to the underlying kernel
target configuration. Settings will not be retained across
reboot unless saveconfig is either <br>
explicitly called, or implicitly by exiting the shell with
the global preference auto_save_on_exit set to true, the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICKSTART <br>
To create an iSCSI target and share a file-backed LUN
without any auth checks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo targetcli <br>
/&gt; backstores/fileio create test /tmp/test.img 100m <br>
/&gt; iscsi/ create iqn.2006-04.example.com:test-target <br>
/&gt; cd iscsi/iqn.2006-04.example.com:test-target/tpg1/
<br>
tpg1/&gt; luns/ create /backstores/fileio/test <br>
tpg1/&gt; set attribute generate_node_acls=1 <br>
tpg1/&gt; exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although by default targetcli
saves the running configuration upon exit, a
distribution-specific service must be enabled to restore the
saved configuration on reboot. See distri&acirc; <br>
bution documentation for specifics, but for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo systemctl enable
target.service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See EXAMPLES below for more
detailed information on commands and using the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKSTORES <br>
Backstores are different kinds of local storage resources
that the kernel target uses to &quot;back&quot; the SCSI
devices it exports. The mappings to local storage resources
that each <br>
backstore creates are called storage objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILEIO <br>
Allows files to be treated as disk images. When storage
objects of this type are created, they can support either
write-back or write-thru operation. Using write-back enables
the <br>
local filesystem cache, which will improve performance but
increase the risk of data loss. It is also possible to use
fileio with local block device files, if buffered operation
<br>
is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fileio also supports using an
existing file, or creating a new file. New files are
sparsely allocated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCK <br>
Allows a local disk block device to be shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSCSI <br>
Allows a local SCSI device of any type to be shared. It is
generally advised to prefer the block backstore if sharing a
block SCSI device is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RAMDISK <br>
Allows kernel memory to be shared as a block SCSI device.
Since memory is volatile, the contents of the ramdisk will
be lost if the system restarts, and this backstore is best
<br>
used for testing only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also supports
&quot;nullio&quot; mode, which is not backed by any storage.
It discards all writes, and returns all-zeroes for
reads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGETS <br>
Targets are instances of a fabric, which adapts the kernel
target to a specific transport protocol such as iSCSI, Fibre
Channel, or SBP-2. Creating a target in targetcli enables
<br>
that target to be configured. The name of the target, its
WWN (world wide name), may link the configuration to a
specific hardware endpoint, like SRP for example, or it may
not, <br>
like iSCSI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aside from
&quot;backstores&quot;, all other top-level configuration
nodes in targetcli are fabrics that may have targets created
for them. Fabrics that require hardware are only listed if
<br>
the hardware is present and configured properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING A TARGET <br>
Use the create command within a fabric&rsquo;s node to
create a target. If the fabric&rsquo;s targets are tied to
hardware then targetcli will constrain the WWN to available
hardware WWNs. <br>
These can be shown via tab-completion. If the fabric is not
tied to hardware, such as iSCSI, then targetcli will either
auto-generate a WWN if none is given, or check that the <br>
given WWN has the correct format. All WWNs are prefaced by
their type, such as &quot;iqn&quot;, &quot;naa&quot;, or
&quot;ib&quot;, and may be given with or without colons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iSCSI supports multiple WWN
formats: iqn, naa, and eui. Other fabrics support single
formats only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING A TARGET <br>
Not all fabrics have the same capabilities. Targets on
different fabrics will have different configuration node
layouts. iSCSI has the most to configure; other fabrics
present <br>
subsets of iSCSI&rsquo;s feature set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING ISCSI <br>
iSCSI has the most options for configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TPGS <br>
TPGs (Target Portal Groups) allow the iSCSI to support
multiple complete configurations within one target. This is
useful for complex quality-of-service configurations.
targetcli <br>
will automatically create one TPG when the target is
created, and almost all setups only need one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTALS <br>
An iSCSI target may be reached via multiple IP addresses and
ports. These addr:port pairs are called portals. Both IPv4
and IPv6 addresses are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a target is created,
targetcli automatically creates a default portal listening
on all IPv4 addresses (shown as 0.0.0.0) on port 3260. If a
different configuration is <br>
needed, the default portal can be removed and portals
configured as desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the hardware supports it,
iSER (iSCSI Extensions for RDMA) may be enabled via the
enable_iser command within each portal&rsquo;s node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LUNS <br>
The kernel target exports SCSI Logical Units, also called
LUNs. This section links the previously-defined storage
objects with the target, and defines which number (the
Logical <br>
Unit Number) the device will use. Note that if ACLs are
being used, a lun mapping must be created under the ACL that
refers back to the TPG LUN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACLS <br>
ACLs (Access Control Lists) allow different configuration,
depending on the initiator that is connecting to the target.
This includes both per-initiator authentication settings
<br>
as well as per-initiator LUN mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create &lt;wwn&gt; in the acls
node creates an ACL for an initiator, and create within the
ACL creates a LUN mapping. (This can either refer to the TPG
LUN, or to the storage object, <br>
in which case the TPG LUN will be configured as well.)
Global setting auto_add_mapped_luns affects this, see
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
iSCSI supports authentication via the CHAP protocol, which
uses a username and password. The initiator may be required
to supply valid credentials to the target, and the target
<br>
may also be required to supply credentials back to the
initiator. The latter is referred to as mutual
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, authentication
credentials may be different for each session phase
(Discovery or Normal), and authentication in a Normal
session may be set at the TPG level, or per- <br>
ACL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discovery Authentication <br>
iSCSI Discovery sessions allow the initiator to connect to a
portal and discover targets with the SendTargets command,
but not access them. The four parameters userid, password,
<br>
mutual_userid, and mutual_password are configured via set
discovery_auth command within the top-level iscsi
configuration node. 1-way authentication is enabled if
userid and <br>
password are both set, and mutual authentication is enabled
if all four are set. Authentication is disabled by unsetting
the parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal Authentication <br>
Similarly, the four parameters userid, password,
mutual_userid, and mutual_password are configured via set
auth command within the TPG node and ACL nodes. However, LIO
only uses <br>
one or the other, depending on the TPG&rsquo;s
generate_node_acls attribute setting. If generate_node_acls
is 1, the TPG-wide settings will be used. If
generate_node_acls is 0, then <br>
the user-created ACLs&rsquo; settings will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable generate_node_acls with
set attribute generate_node_acls=1 within the TPG node. This
can be thought of as &quot;ignore ACLs mode&quot; -- both
authentication and LUN mapping will <br>
then use the TPG settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No Authentication <br>
Authentication is disabled by clearing the TPG
&quot;authentication&quot; attribute: set attribute
authentication=0. Although initiator names are trivially
forgeable, generate_node_acls <br>
still works here to either ignore user-defined ACLs and
allow all, or check that an ACL exists for the connecting
initiator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING FIBRE CHANNEL
(QLA2XXX) <br>
Operation as a target requires that
/sys/module/qla2xxx/parameters/qlini_mode report
&quot;disabled&quot;. This may require passing the
qlini_mode=disabled parameter to the qla2xxx module <br>
when it loads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING FIBRE CHANNEL OVER
ETHERNET (TCM_FC) <br>
Ensure fcoeadm -i shows a working endpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING SRP <br>
SRP (SCSI RDMA Protocol) requires that RDMA-capable hardware
is present. It uses &quot;ib&quot; WWNs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING LOOPBACK <br>
Storage objects may be re-exported as local SCSI devices
with this fabric.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING OTHER FABRICS <br>
Other fabrics may be present. They are for specialized uses.
Use at your own risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
DEFINING A STORAGE OBJECT WITHIN A BACKSTORE <br>
backstores/fileio create disk1 /disks/disk1.img 140M <br>
Creates a storage object named disk1 with the given path and
size. targetcli supports common size abbreviations like
&rsquo;M&rsquo;, &rsquo;G&rsquo;, and &rsquo;T&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPORTING A STORAGE OBJECT VIA
ISCSI <br>
iscsi/ create <br>
Creates an iSCSI target with a default WWN. It will also
create an initial target portal group called tpg1.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">iqn.2003-01.org.linux-iscsi.test2.x8664:sn123456789012/tpg1/
<br>
An example of changing to the configuration node for the
given target&rsquo;s first target portal group (TPG). This
is equivalent to giving the command prefixed by
&quot;cd&quot;. (Although more <br>
can be useful for certain setups, most configurations have a
single TPG per target. In this case, configuring the TPG is
equivalent to configuring the overall target.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">portals/ create <br>
Add a portal, i.e. an IP address and TCP port via which the
target can be contacted by initiators. Only required if the
default 0.0.0.0:3260 portal is not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luns/ create
/backstores/fileio/disk1 <br>
Create a new LUN in the TPG, attached to the storage object
that has previously been defined. The storage object now
shows up under the /backstores configuration node as
acti&acirc; <br>
vated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acls/ create
iqn.1994-05.com.redhat:4321576890 <br>
Creates an ACL (access control list) entry for the given
iSCSI initiator.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">acls/iqn.1994-05.com.redhat:4321576890
create 2 0 <br>
Gives the initiator access to the first exported LUN (lun0),
which the initiator will see as lun2. The default is to give
the initiator read/write access; if read-only access was
<br>
desired, an additional &quot;1&quot; argument would be added
to enable write-protect. (Note: if global setting
auto_add_mapped_luns is true, this step is not
necessary.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPORTING A STORAGE OBJECT VIA
FCOE <br>
tcm_fc/ create 20:00:00:19:99:a8:34:bc <br>
Create an FCoE target with the given WWN. targetcli can
tab-complete the WWN based on registered FCoE interfaces. If
none are found, verify that they are properly configured and
<br>
are shown in the output of fcoeadm -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcm_fc/20:00:00:19:99:a8:34:bc/
<br>
If auto_cd_after_create is set to false, change to the
configuration node for the given target, equivalent to
giving the command prefixed by cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luns/ create
/backstores/fileio/disk1 <br>
Create a new LUN for the interface, attached to a previously
defined storage object. The storage object now shows up
under the /backstores configuration node as activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acls/ create
00:99:88:77:66:55:44:33 <br>
Create an ACL (access control list), for defining the
resources each initiator may access. The default behavior is
to auto-map existing LUNs to the ACL; see help for more
infor&acirc; <br>
mation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LUN should now be accessible
via FCoE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER COMMANDS <br>
saveconfig <br>
Save the current configuration settings to a file, from
which settings will be restored if the system is rebooted.
By default, this will save the configuration to
/etc/tar&acirc; <br>
get/saveconfig.json.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is executed from
the configuration root node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restoreconfig <br>
Restore target configuration from a file, the default is the
file listed under saveconfig. This will fail if there is
already an established config, unless the clear_existing
<br>
option is set to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is executed from
the configuration root node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clearconfig <br>
Clears the entire current local configuration. The parameter
confirm=true must also be given, as a precaution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is executed from
the configuration root node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sessions [ list | detail ] [sid]
<br>
Lists the current open sessions or a specific session, with
or without details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is executed from
the configuration root node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit <br>
Leave the configuration shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTINGS GROUPS <br>
Settings are broken into groups. Individual settings are
accessed by get &lt;group&gt; &lt;setting&gt; and set
&lt;group&gt; &lt;setting&gt;=&lt;value&gt;, and the
settings of an entire group may be displayed <br>
by get &lt;group&gt;. All except for global are associated
with a particular configuration node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL <br>
Shell-related user-specific settings are in global, and are
visible from all configuration nodes. They are mostly shell
display options, but some starting with auto_ affect shell
<br>
behavior and may merit customization. These include
auto_save_on_exit, which controls if exiting targetcli saves
the configuration; auto_add_mapped_luns, to automatically
add <br>
existing LUNs to new ACLs, and new LUNS to existing ACLs;
and auto_cd_after_create, to change working path to
newly-created nodes. Global settings are user-specific and
are <br>
saved to ~/.targetcli/ upon exit, unlike other groups, which
are system-wide and kept in /etc/target/saveconfig.json.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKSTORE-SPECIFIC <br>
attribute <br>
/backstore/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;name&gt; configuration node.
Contains values relating to the backstore and storage
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ISCSI-SPECIFIC <br>
discovery_auth <br>
/iscsi configuration node. Set the normal and mutual
authentication userid and password for discovery sessions,
as well as enabling or disabling it. By default it is
disabled -- <br>
no authentication is required for discovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parameter <br>
/iscsi/&lt;target_iqn&gt;/tpgX configuration node.
ISCSI-specific parameters such as AuthMethod,
MaxBurstLength, IFMarker, DataDigest, and similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attribute <br>
/iscsi/&lt;target_iqn&gt;/tpgX configuration node. Contains
implementation-specific settings for the TPG, such as
authentication, to enforce or disable authentication for the
full-fea&acirc; <br>
ture phase (i.e. non-discovery).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth <br>
/iscsi/&lt;target_iqn&gt;/tpgX/acls/&lt;initiator_iqn&gt;
configuration node. Set the userid and password for
full-feature phase for this ACL.</p>
