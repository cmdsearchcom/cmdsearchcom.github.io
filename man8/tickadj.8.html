<p>tickadj(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual tickadj(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tickadj - set time-related kernel variables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tickadj [ tick ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tickadj [ -Aqs ] [ -a tickadj ]
[ -t tick ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The tickadj program reads, and optionally modifies, several
timekeeping-related variables in older kernels that do not
have support for precision ttimekeeping, including HP-UX,
<br>
SunOS, Ultrix, SGI and probably others. Those machines
provide means to patch the kernel /dev/kmem. Newer machines
with kernel time support, including Solaris, Tru64, FreeBSD
and <br>
Linux, should NOT use the program, even if it appears to
work, as it will destabilize the kernel time support. Use
the ntptime program instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The particular variables that
can be changed with tickadj include tick, which is the
number of microseconds added to the system time for a clock
interrupt, tickadj, which sets <br>
the slew rate and resolution used by the adjtime system
call, and dosynctodr, which indicates to the kernels on some
machines whether they should internally adjust the system
<br>
clock to keep it in line with time-of-day clock or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, only the tick variable
is supported and the only allowed argument is the tick
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, with no arguments,
tickadj reads the variables of interest in the kernel and
displays them. At the same time, it determines an
&quot;optimal&quot; value for the value of the <br>
tickadj variable if the intent is to run the ntpd Network
Time Protocol (NTP) daemon, and prints this as well. Since
the operation of tickadj when reading the kernel mimics the
<br>
operation of similar parts of the ntpd program fairly
closely, this can be useful when debugging problems with
ntpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that tickadj should be run
with some caution when being used for the first time on
different types of machines. The operations which tickadj
tries to perform are not guaran&acirc; <br>
teed to work on all Unix machines and may in rare cases
cause the kernel to crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
-a tickadj <br>
Set the kernel variable tickadj to the value
tickadjspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Set the kernel variable
tickadj to an internally computed &quot;optimal&quot;
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tick Set the kernel variable
tick to the value tick specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Set the kernel variable
dosynctodr to zero, which disables the hardware time-of-year
clock, a prerequisite for running the ntpd daemon under
SunOS 4.x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Normally, tickadj is quite
verbose about what it is doing. The -q flag tells it to shut
up about everything except errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/vmunix /unix /dev/kmem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Fiddling with kernel variables at run time as a part of
ordinary operations is a hideous practice which is only
necessary to make up for deficiencies in the implementation
of <br>
adjtime in many kernels and/or brokenness of the system
clock in some vendors&rsquo; kernels. It would be much
better if the kernels were fixed and the tickadj program
went away.</p>
