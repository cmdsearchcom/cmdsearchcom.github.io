<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
courieruucp - Sample Courier mail filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
makeuucpneighbors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Courier mail server is capable of sending and receiving
mail via UUCP. Courier does not implement UUCP directly, but
instead uses third-party UUCP software, which you must <br>
install separately. Courier&rsquo;s UUCP support is provided
automatically by the courieruucp module, which is compiled
and installed by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Courier sends mail via UUCP by
issuing a request via uux to execute the rmail command on
the remote UUCP node. Courier passes the message envelope
sender to rmail via the -f <br>
flag, and lists the message envelope recipients as the
remaining arguments. Message envelope addresses and E-mail
addresses in the headers of the message will be
appropriately <br>
rewritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Courier will only send mail via
UUCP if it knows about the recipient&rsquo;s UUCP node. The
configuration file /etc/courier/uucpneighbors is a plain
text configuration file. The <br>
makeuucpneighbors script compiles this configuration file
into a binary database that is read by Courier. Changes to
/etc/courier/uucpneighbors do not take effect until <br>
makeuucpneighbors is executed, and Courier is restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/courier/uucpneighbors may
also be a subdirectory instead of a plain text file, in
which case the contents of all text files in this
subdirectory is automatically <br>
concatenated by the makeuucpneighbors script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contents of /etc/courier/uucpme
<br>
This configuration file must be initialized to contain the
UUCP node name that this machine is known to its neighbors.
If /etc/courier/uucpme does not exist, Courier uses the <br>
first node name of the hostname specified by the
/etc/courier/me configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contents of
/etc/courier/uucpneighbors <br>
Note that in addition to creating this configuration file
you must also configure your UUCP software to appropriately
route UUCP mail to the specified nodes, which is a <br>
completely separate task. Blank lines in this file are
ignored. Lines that start with the # character are comments,
and are also ignored. The remaining lines are in the
following <br>
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">node&lt;TAB&gt;flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">node is a UUCP node, such as
&quot;apple&quot; or &quot;food!fruits!apple&quot;.
&lt;TAB&gt; is a single tab character, and flags is zero or
more of single character flags described below. The tab <br>
character can be ommited if there are no flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is an entry for node in
/etc/courier/uucpneighbors then Courier will accept mail for
any address of the form &quot;node!user&quot;, but not
&quot;node!nodule!user&quot;. In order to accept <br>
mail for &quot;node!nodule!user&quot; you must enter both
&quot;node&quot; and &quot;node!nodule&quot;, unless you use
the F or the G flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F <br>
Unrestricted forwarding. This flag will accept any UUCP path
that starts with the specified node. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">food&lt;TAB&gt;F <br>
This will accept &quot;food!fruits!apple&quot;,
&quot;food!fruits!banana&quot;,
&quot;food!drinks!orangejuice&quot;, and so on. You may
simply list all your immediate UUCP neighbors using the F
flag, and <br>
accept mail to any address that&rsquo;s reachable via any
neighbor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G <br>
This is a gateway. This flag is identical to the F flag,
except that rmail is executed on the specified node.
Normally, Courier will issue a uux request to run rmail on
the <br>
last node, for example &quot;uux food!fruits!rmail
apple&quot;. Using G instead of F will run rmail on the
listed node, for example &quot;uux food!rmail
fruits!apple&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R <br>
This is a relay. This flag is used where neither F or G
flags are appropriate, but you want to run rmail on this
node. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">food!fruits <br>
food&lt;TAB&gt;R <br>
In this example mail to &quot;food!fruits!apple&quot; is
sent by executing &quot;uux food!rmail fruits!apple&quot;.
If the R flag is not specified, then Courier will request
&quot;uux <br>
food!fruits!rmail apple&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contents of
/etc/courier/module.uucp <br>
This is the standard Courier module configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXDELS <br>
Maximum simultaneous UUCP deliveries. This setting is a bit
misleading. From Courier&rsquo;s viewpoint, a delivery
consists only of running uux to queue up the message via
UUCP. <br>
Once uux returns, the message is delivered, as far as
Courier is concerned. UUCP is responsible for getting the
message the rest of the way. Therefore, UUCP deliveries tend
<br>
to be fairly quick, and it is not necessary to configure a
large number of concurrent courieruucp processes, since each
one will terminate quickly. Once uux terminates, the <br>
UUCP software is responsible for queueing and sending the
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXHOST <br>
Maximum simultaneous UUCP deliveries to the same UUCP node.
Since UUCP deliveries tend to be fairly quick, it is not
usually necessary to use MAXHOST to limit concurrent <br>
deliveries to the same UUCP node, so MAXHOST should
generally be set to the same value as MAXDELS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXRCPT <br>
Maximum recipients per message. When the same message is
sent to multiple recipients on the same UUCP node, Courier
is capable of asking to run rmail only one, and listing <br>
all the recipients together. MAXRCPT specifies the upper
limit on the number of recipients that are batched together.
You want to set a limit based on any limitations on the <br>
length of command lines that&rsquo;s imposed by the
operating system. Sending the same message to different UUCP
nodes is always handled as separate deliveries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEADER AND ADDRESS REWRITING
<br>
Courier is certainly capable of relaying mail between the
Internet - via ESMTP - and UUCP-land, rewriting headers and
addresses appropriately. The address rewriting rules are
<br>
fixed, but they are expected to work in nearly every case.
If you find yourself in some oddball situation, you&rsquo;ll
just have to invest the time to add custom header rewriting
<br>
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are example.com, and your
UUCP node is example, then &lt;user@example.com&gt; gets
rewritten as example!user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internet mail may be sent via
ESMTP to your UUCP neighbor apple!john by sending it to
&lt;apple!john@example.com&gt;. When that&rsquo;s forwarded
via UUCP the return address of <br>
&lt;someone@domain.com&gt; will be rewritten as
example!domain.com!someone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apple!john will get the mail
with this return address, which should be repliable back to
the sender. Courier&rsquo;s UUCP module will receive the
UUCP address domain.com!someone, and <br>
translate it back as &lt;someone@domain.com&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Courier does not support defining multiple UUCP node names
in /etc/courier/uucpme.</p>
