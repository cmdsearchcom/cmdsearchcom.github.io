<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ypserv - NIS Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/ypserv [-d] [-p port] [-f|--foreground]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Network Information Service (NIS) provides a simple
network lookup service consisting of databases and
processes. The databases are gdbm files in a directory tree
rooted at <br>
/var/yp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ypserv daemon is typically
activated at system startup. ypserv runs only on NIS server
machines with a complete NIS database. On other machines
using the NIS services, you <br>
have to run ypbind as client or under Linux you could use
the libc with NYS support. ypbind must run on every machine
which has NIS client processes; ypserv may or may not be
<br>
running on the same node, but must be running somewhere on
the network. On startup ypserv parses the file
/etc/ypserv.conf. It is also possible to pass OPTIONS to
ypserv using <br>
the environment variable YPSERV_ARGS and this variable can
be set in /etc/sysconfig/network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --debug <br>
Causes the server to run in debugging mode. Normally, ypserv
reports only errors (access violations, dbm failures) using
the syslog(3) facility. In debug mode, the server <br>
does not background itself and prints extra status messages
to stderr for each request that it revceives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --port port <br>
ypserv will bind itself to this port. This makes it possible
to have a router filter packets to the NIS ports, so that
access to the NIS server from hosts on the Internet can <br>
be restricted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Prints the version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
will not put itself into background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
In general, any remote user can issue an RPC to ypserv and
retrieve the contents of your NIS maps, if he knows your
domain name. To prevent such unauthorized transactions,
ypserv <br>
supports a feature called securenets which can be used to
restrict access to a given set of hosts. At startup ypserv
will attempt to load the securenets information from a file
<br>
called /var/yp/securenets . This file contains entries that
consist of a netmask and a network pair separated by white
spaces. Lines starting with &acirc;#&acirc; are considered
to be <br>
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A sample securenets file might
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># allow connections from local
host -- necessary <br>
host 127.0.0.1 <br>
# same as 255.255.255.255 127.0.0.1 <br>
# <br>
# allow connections from any host <br>
# on the 131.234.223.0 network <br>
255.255.255.0 131.234.223.0 <br>
# allow connections from any host <br>
# between 131.234.214.0 and 131.234.215.255 <br>
255.255.254.0 131.234.214.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ypserv receives a request
from an address that fails to match a rule, the request will
be ignored and a warning message will be logged. If the
/var/yp/securenets file does not <br>
exist, ypserv will allow connections from any host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the /etc/ypserv.conf you
could specify some access rules for special maps and hosts.
But it is not very secure, it makes the life only a little
bit harder for a potential <br>
hacker. If a mapname doesn&Acirc;&acute;t match a rule,
ypserv will look for the YP_SECURE key in the map. If it
exists, ypserv will only allow requests on a reserved
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For security reasons, ypserv
will only accept ypproc_xfr requests for updating maps from
the same master server as the old one. This means, you have
to reinstall the slave <br>
servers if you change the master server for a map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Sending the signal SIGHUP to the server can lead to a
deadlock or crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Network Information Service
(NIS) was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages (YP). The
functionality of the two remains the same; only the name has
changed. The name Yellow Pages <br>
is a registered trademark in the United Kingdom of British
Telecommunications plc, and may not be used without
