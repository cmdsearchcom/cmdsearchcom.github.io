<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program is part of the <b>samba</b>(7) suite.
<div class="Pp"></div>
smbd is the server daemon that provides filesharing and printing services to
  Windows clients. The server provides filespace and printer services to clients
  using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol. This is compatible with the LanManager
  protocol, and can service LanManager clients. These include MSCLIENT 3.0 for
  DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, OS/2,
  DAVE for Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An extensive description of the services that the server can provide is given in
  the man page for the configuration file controlling the attributes of those
  services (see <b>smb.conf</b>(5). This man page will not describe the
  services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects of running the
  server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that there are significant security implications to running this
  server, and the <b>smb.conf</b>(5) manual page should be regarded as mandatory
  reading before proceeding with installation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A session is created whenever a client requests one. Each client gets a copy of
  the server for each session. This copy then services all connections made by
  the client during that session. When all connections from its client are
  closed, the copy of the server for that client terminates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration file, and any files that it includes, are automatically
  reloaded every minute, if they change. You can force a reload by sending a
  SIGHUP to the server. Reloading the configuration file will not affect
  connections to any service that is already established. Either the user will
  have to disconnect from the service, or smbd killed and restarted.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-D|--daemon
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If specified, this parameter causes the server
  to operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the
  background, fielding requests on the appropriate port. Operating the server as
  a daemon is the recommended way of running smbd for servers that provide more
  than casual use file and print services. This switch is assumed if smbd is
  executed on the command line of a shell.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-F|--foreground
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If specified, this parameter causes the main
  smbd process to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the
  terminal. Child processes are still created as normal to service each
  connection request, but the main process does not exit. This operation mode is
  suitable for running smbd under process supervisors such as supervise and
  svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein's daemontools package, or the AIX process
  monitor.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-S|--log-stdout
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If specified, this parameter causes smbd to
  log to standard output rather than a file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-i|--interactive
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If this parameter is specified it causes the
  server to run &quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if the server
  is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting this parameter negates the
  implicit daemon mode when run from the command line. smbd will only accept one
  connection and terminate. It will also log to standard output, as if the -S
  parameter had been given.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-d|--debuglevel=level
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><i>level</i> is an integer from 0 to 10. The
  default value if this parameter is not specified is 0.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the
  activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious
  warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running
  - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only
  be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only
  by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
  extremely cryptic.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>log level</b>
  parameter in the smb.conf file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-V|--version
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prints the program version number.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-s|--configfile=&lt;configuration file&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The file specified contains the configuration
  details required by the server. The information in this file includes
  server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
  descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See smb.conf
  for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at
  compile time.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Base directory name for log/debug files. The
  extension <b>&quot;.progname&quot;</b> will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
  log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the <b>smb.conf</b>(5) option
  &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; to value &quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; from the command
  line. This overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
  configuration file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-?|--help
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print a summary of command line options.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--usage
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display brief usage message.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--no-process-group
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not create a new process group for
  smbd.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-b|--build-options
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prints information about how Samba was
  built.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-p|--port&lt;port number(s)&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><i>port number(s)</i> is a space or
  comma-separated list of TCP ports smbd should listen on. The default value is
  taken from the <b>ports</b> parameter in smb.conf
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default ports are 139 (used for SMB over NetBIOS over TCP) and port 445
  (used for plain SMB over TCP).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-P|--profiling-level&lt;profiling level&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><i>profiling level</i> is a number specifying
  the level of profiling data to be collected. 0 turns off profiling, 1 turns on
  counter profiling only, 2 turns on complete profiling, and 3 resets all
  profiling data.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
/etc/inetd.conf
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the server is to be run by the inetd
  meta-daemon, this file must contain suitable startup information for the
  meta-daemon.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/etc/rc
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">or whatever initialization script your system
  uses).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If running the server as a daemon at startup, this file will need to contain an
  appropriate startup sequence for the server.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/etc/services
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If running the server via the meta-daemon
  inetd, this file must contain a mapping of service name (e.g., netbios-ssn) to
  service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g., tcp).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is the default location of the
  <b>smb.conf</b>(5) server configuration file. Other common places that systems
  install this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and /etc/samba/smb.conf.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This file describes all the services the server is to make available to clients.
  See <b>smb.conf</b>(5) for more information.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
On some systems smbd cannot change uid back to root after a setuid() call. Such
  systems are called trapdoor uid systems. If you have such a system, you will
  be unable to connect from a client (such as a PC) as two different users at
  once. Attempts to connect the second user will result in access denied or
  similar.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
<b>PRINTER</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If no printer name is specified to printable
  services, most systems will use the value of this variable (or <b>lp</b> if
  this variable is not defined) as the name of the printer to use. This is not
  specific to the server, however.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PAM_INTERACTION"><a class="selflink" href="#PAM_INTERACTION">PAM
  INTERACTION</a></h1>
Samba uses PAM for authentication (when presented with a plaintext password),
  for account checking (is this account disabled?) and for session management.
  The degree too which samba supports PAM is restricted by the limitations of
  the SMB protocol and the <b>obey pam restrictions</b><b>smb.conf</b>(5)
  parameter. When this is set, the following restrictions apply:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;<i>Account Validation</i>: All
  accesses to a samba server are checked against PAM to see if the account is
  valid, not disabled and is permitted to login at this time. This also applies
  to encrypted logins.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;<i>Session Management</i>: When not
  using share level security, users must pass PAM's session checks before access
  is granted. Note however, that this is bypassed in share level security. Note
  also that some older pam configuration files may need a line added for session
  support.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VERSION"><a class="selflink" href="#VERSION">VERSION</a></h1>
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
Most diagnostics issued by the server are logged in a specified log file. The
  log file name is specified at compile time, but may be overridden on the
  command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number and nature of diagnostics available depends on the debug level used
  by the server. If you have problems, set the debug level to 3 and peruse the
  log files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most messages are reasonably self-explanatory. Unfortunately, at the time this
  man page was created, there are too many diagnostics available in the source
  code to warrant describing each and every diagnostic. At this stage your best
  bet is still to grep the source code and inspect the conditions that gave rise
  to the diagnostics you are seeing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TDB_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#TDB_FILES">TDB
  FILES</a></h1>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
Sending the smbd a SIGHUP will cause it to reload its smb.conf configuration
  file within a short period of time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To shut down a user's smbd process it is recommended that SIGKILL (-9)
  <i>NOT</i> be used, except as a last resort, as this may leave the shared
  memory area in an inconsistent state. The safe way to terminate an smbd is to
  send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The debug log level of smbd may be raised or lowered using <b>smbcontrol</b>(1)
  program (SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no longer used since Samba 2.2). This is to
  allow transient problems to be diagnosed, whilst still running at a normally
  low log level.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that as the signal handlers send a debug write, they are not re-entrant in
  smbd. This you should wait until smbd is in a state of waiting for an incoming
  SMB before issuing them. It is possible to make the signal handlers safe by
  un-blocking the signals before the select call and re-blocking them after,
  however this would affect performance.

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
  Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project
  similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources
  were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source
  software, available at ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the
  Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2
  was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was
  done by Alexander Bokovoy.</div>
