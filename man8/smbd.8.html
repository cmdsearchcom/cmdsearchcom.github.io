<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smbd - server to provide SMB/CIFS services to clients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
smbd [-D|--daemon] [-F|--foreground] [-S|--log-stdout]
[-i|--interactive] [-V] [-b|--build-options] [-d &lt;debug
level&gt;] [-l|--log-basename &lt;log directory&gt;] [-p
&lt;port number(s)&gt;] <br>
[-P &lt;profiling level&gt;] [-s &lt;configuration file&gt;]
[--no-process-group]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smbd is the server daemon that
provides filesharing and printing services to Windows
clients. The server provides filespace and printer services
to clients using the SMB (or <br>
CIFS) protocol. This is compatible with the LanManager
protocol, and can service LanManager clients. These include
MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows
95/98/ME, <br>
Windows NT, Windows 2000, OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and
smbfs for Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extensive description of the
services that the server can provide is given in the man
page for the configuration file controlling the attributes
of those services (see <br>
smb.conf(5). This man page will not describe the services,
but will concentrate on the administrative aspects of
running the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that there are
significant security implications to running this server,
and the smb.conf(5) manual page should be regarded as
mandatory reading before proceeding <br>
with installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session is created whenever a
client requests one. Each client gets a copy of the server
for each session. This copy then services all connections
made by the client during <br>
that session. When all connections from its client are
closed, the copy of the server for that client
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file, and any
files that it includes, are automatically reloaded every
minute, if they change. You can force a reload by sending a
SIGHUP to the server. <br>
Reloading the configuration file will not affect connections
to any service that is already established. Either the user
will have to disconnect from the service, or smbd killed
<br>
and restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-D|--daemon <br>
If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as
a daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the
background, fielding requests on the appropriate port. <br>
Operating the server as a daemon is the recommended way of
running smbd for servers that provide more than casual use
file and print services. This switch is assumed if smbd <br>
is executed on the command line of a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F|--foreground <br>
If specified, this parameter causes the main smbd process to
not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the
terminal. Child processes are still created as normal <br>
to service each connection request, but the main process
does not exit. This operation mode is suitable for running
smbd under process supervisors such as supervise and <br>
svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein&rsquo;s daemontools package,
or the AIX process monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S|--log-stdout <br>
If specified, this parameter causes smbd to log to standard
output rather than a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i|--interactive <br>
If this parameter is specified it causes the server to run
&quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if the
server is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting
this <br>
parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when run from the
command line. smbd will only accept one connection and
terminate. It will also log to standard output, as if the
<br>
-S parameter had been given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--debuglevel=level <br>
level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
parameter is not specified is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The higher this value, the more
detail will be logged to the log files about the activities
of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious
warnings will be <br>
logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running
- it generates a small amount of information about
operations carried out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Levels above 1 will generate
considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used
when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed
for use only by developers <br>
and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that specifying this
parameter here will override the log level parameter in the
smb.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V|--version <br>
Prints the program version number.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s|--configfile=&lt;configuration
file&gt; <br>
The file specified contains the configuration details
required by the server. The information in this file
includes server-specific information such as what printcap
file to <br>
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at <br>
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
<br>
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
&quot;.progname&quot; will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the
client.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<br>
Set the smb.conf(5) option &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; to value
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?|--help <br>
Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Display brief usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-process-group <br>
Do not create a new process group for smbd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b|--build-options <br>
Prints information about how Samba was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p|--port&lt;port number(s)&gt;
<br>
port number(s) is a space or comma-separated list of TCP
ports smbd should listen on. The default value is taken from
the ports parameter in smb.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default ports are 139 (used
for SMB over NetBIOS over TCP) and port 445 (used for plain
SMB over TCP).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P|--profiling-level&lt;profiling
level&gt; <br>
profiling level is a number specifying the level of
profiling data to be collected. 0 turns off profiling, 1
turns on counter profiling only, 2 turns on complete
profiling, <br>
and 3 resets all profiling data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/inetd.conf <br>
If the server is to be run by the inetd meta-daemon, this
file must contain suitable startup information for the
meta-daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/rc <br>
or whatever initialization script your system uses).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If running the server as a
daemon at startup, this file will need to contain an
appropriate startup sequence for the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/services <br>
If running the server via the meta-daemon inetd, this file
must contain a mapping of service name (e.g., netbios-ssn)
to service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g., <br>
tcp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
<br>
This is the default location of the smb.conf(5) server
configuration file. Other common places that systems install
this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and <br>
/etc/samba/smb.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file describes all the
services the server is to make available to clients. See
smb.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
On some systems smbd cannot change uid back to root after a
setuid() call. Such systems are called trapdoor uid systems.
If you have such a system, you will be unable to connect
<br>
from a client (such as a PC) as two different users at once.
Attempts to connect the second user will result in access
denied or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
PRINTER <br>
If no printer name is specified to printable services, most
systems will use the value of this variable (or lp if this
variable is not defined) as the name of the printer to <br>
use. This is not specific to the server, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM INTERACTION <br>
Samba uses PAM for authentication (when presented with a
plaintext password), for account checking (is this account
disabled?) and for session management. The degree too which
<br>
samba supports PAM is restricted by the limitations of the
SMB protocol and the obey pam restrictionssmb.conf(5)
parameter. When this is set, the following restrictions
apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Account
Validation: All accesses to a samba server are checked
against PAM to see if the account is valid, not disabled and
is permitted to login at this time. This also <br>
applies to encrypted logins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Session
Management: When not using share level security, users must
pass PAM&rsquo;s session checks before access is granted.
Note however, that this is bypassed in share level <br>
security. Note also that some older pam configuration files
may need a line added for session support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Most diagnostics issued by the server are logged in a
specified log file. The log file name is specified at
compile time, but may be overridden on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number and nature of
diagnostics available depends on the debug level used by the
server. If you have problems, set the debug level to 3 and
peruse the log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most messages are reasonably
self-explanatory. Unfortunately, at the time this man page
was created, there are too many diagnostics available in the
source code to warrant <br>
describing each and every diagnostic. At this stage your
best bet is still to grep the source code and inspect the
conditions that gave rise to the diagnostics you are
seeing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TDB FILES <br>
Samba stores it&rsquo;s data in several TDB (Trivial
Database) files, usually located in /var/lib/samba.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(*) information persistent
across restarts (but not necessarily important to
backup).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Sending the smbd a SIGHUP will cause it to reload its
smb.conf configuration file within a short period of
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To shut down a user&rsquo;s smbd
process it is recommended that SIGKILL (-9)NOT be used,
except as a last resort, as this may leave the shared memory
area in an inconsistent state. The <br>
safe way to terminate an smbd is to send it a SIGTERM (-15)
signal and wait for it to die on its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debug log level of smbd may
be raised or lowered using smbcontrol(1) program
(SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no longer used since Samba 2.2).
This is to allow transient problems to <br>
be diagnosed, whilst still running at a normally low log
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that as the signal handlers
send a debug write, they are not re-entrant in smbd. This
you should wait until smbd is in a state of waiting for an
incoming SMB before issuing <br>
them. It is possible to make the signal handlers safe by
un-blocking the signals before the select call and
re-blocking them after, however this would affect
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux <br>
kernel is developed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original Samba man pages
were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources were
converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at <br>
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to <br>
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
