<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcptraceroute6 - TCP/IPv6
traceroute tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
traceroute6 [-AdEILlnrSU] [-f min_hop] [-g hop] [ -i iface]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcptraceroute6 [-AdEnrS] [-f
min_hop] [-g hop] [ -i iface] [-l packet_size] [-m max_hop]
[-p port] [ -q attempts] [-s source] [-t tclass] [-w wait] [
-z delay_ms] &lt; host&acirc; <br>
name/address&gt; [port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTON <br>
rltraceroute6 is an IPv6 traceroute implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It displays the list of hops
along the network route between the local system and
specified destination, by sending packets while incrementing
their hop limit, until the final <br>
destination is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, rltraceroute6 sends
UDP probe packets toward the destination (that&rsquo;s the
historical default). However, it can also send TCP packets,
much like Michael C. Toren&rsquo;s <br>
tcptraceroute does on IPv4 networks; tcptraceroute6 sends
TCP packets by default (and mimics tcptraceroute command
line syntax). Finally, it can also send ICMPv6 Echo Request
<br>
packets, like some other traceroute implementations (such as
the one in Microsoft Windows); tracert6 does this by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must specify the name or
address of the host toward which the network route should be
determined. An optional additional parameter specifies
either the probe packets length <br>
(for UDP and ICMP packets), or the destination port
number/service name (for TCP packets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that TCP destination port
zero really is TCP port numbered 0 (which cannot be used via
the standard higer-level TCP/IP programming interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A Send TCP/ACK probe packets. That&rsquo;s very efficient
against stateless firewalls (e.g. the official Linux kernel
versions up to and including 2.4.31 and 2.6.14), and utterly
<br>
helpless against stateful ones. Note that TCP/ACK probing
cannot determine whether the destination TCP port is open or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable socket debugging
option (SO_DEBUG). Unless you are debugging the kernel, this
is probably not going to have any actual effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Send ECN-setup TCP/SYN probe
packets (as per RFC 3168) rather than non-ECN-setup TCP/SYN
probe packets. This has no effect unless command line optin
-S is specified as <br>
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F This option is ignored for
backward compatibility. IPv6 packets are never fragmented en
route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Override the initial IPv6
packets hop limit (default: 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Add an IPv6 route segment
within an IPv6 Routing Header. This enables loose source
routing. Currently, only &quot;Type 0&quot; routing header
is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display some help and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I (rltraceroute6 only) <br>
Send ICMPv6 Echo requests (like ping6) as probe packets.
That&rsquo;s the default for tracert6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Only send packets through the
specified interface. See also BUGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I (rltraceroute6 only) <br>
Send UDP-Lite (protocol 136) packets (with full checksum
coverage) as probe packets instead of normal UDP (protocol
17).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (rltraceroute6 only) <br>
Print the hop limit of received packets. This is mostly used
to detect asymmetric routing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (tcptraceroute6 only) <br>
Specify the size (bytes) of sent packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Override the maximum hop
limit (maximum number of hops). The default is 30 hops which
should be sufficient on the IPv6 Internet for some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Try to resolve each
hop&rsquo;s IPv6 address to a host name. This is the
default. This option is meant for backward compatibility
with tcptraceroute(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not try to resolve each
hop&rsquo;s IPv6 address to a host name. That may speed up
the traceroute significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p For rltraceroute6, specify
the base destination port number (default: 33434).
rltraceroute6 assumes that packets toward this port up to
this port plus the maximum hop <br>
limit are not in use by any program on the final destination
and that they are not blocked by some firewall. The fact
that this very assumption was not always correct, <br>
eventually lead to the development of the original IPv4
tcptraceroute by Michael Toren.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For tcptraceroute6, specify the
source port number (default: auto). Note that source port
number zero really means number zero, rather than some port
number that would be <br>
automatically assigned, as is the case with usual
softwares.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Override the number of probes
sent to each hop (default: 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Do not route packets, i.e. do
not send packets through a gateway that would be specified
by the routing table. See also BUGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Use TCP/SYN probe packets.
That&rsquo;s the default for tcptraceroute6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Specify the source address to
use for probe packets explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Use UDP probe packets.
That&rsquo;s the default for rltraceroute6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Specify the traffic class
(DSCP) for probe packets. See also BUGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U (rltraceroute6 only) <br>
Send UDP probe packets. That&rsquo;s the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display program version and
license and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Override the delay (in
seconds) to wait for response once a given probe packet was
sent (default: 5 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x This option is ignored for
seamless migration from IPv4 traceroute. The IPv6 header has
no checksum field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Specify a milliseconds delay
to wait between each probe with identical hop limit. This
can be useful to work-around ICMPv6 rate limitation on some
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
If a response is received, the round-trip time is printed.
In addition, specific symbols denote certain errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* No response <br>
No valid response received before the timeout delay (see -w
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!N No route to destination <br>
There is no entry for the destination network in the routing
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!A Communication with
destination administratively prohibited <br>
A firewall explicitly rejected the traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!S Beyond scope of source
address <br>
The address scope of the source address is too small to
reach the destination address. At the time of writing, this
can only happen when using a link-local source address <br>
to reach a global scope destination. (Note: some IPv4
traceroute implementations use !S for source route error
which is completely different)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!H Address unreachable <br>
The host address is not reachable for some other reasons,
particularly a link-layer failure (e.g. Neighbor discovery
failure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!P Unrecognized Next Header type
encountered <br>
The destination does not implement the layer-4 protocol
used. You should retry with ICMPv6 Echo Requests (-I command
line option) which MUST be supported by any IPv6 <br>
node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
rltraceroute6 should be setuid root to allow use by non
privileged users. It will drop its root privileges before
any attempt is made to send or receive data from the network
so <br>
as to reduce the possible impact of a security
vulnerability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
However useful they might be, -i and -r options are ignored
by the official Linux kernel at the time of writing this
manpage, and hence do not work as documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for option -t was broken
until Linux kernel version 2.6.18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage of Routing Header, with
option -g, triggers an OOPS on Linux kernel versions below
2.6.17.12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Receiving TCP/SYN-ACK packets
does not work on FreeBSD at all. This severely limits the
usefulness of tcptraceroute6 on FreeBSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packet length takes the IPv6
header and, if present, extension headers into account.
rltraceroute6 versions before 0.7.4 used it as IPv6 payload
length instead, i.e. did not <br>
include the layer-3 headers in the computation. Linux
iputils traceroute6 does not even include the UDP header. On
the whole, the packet length semantic is very inconsistent
<br>
among IPv6 traceroute implementations.</p>
