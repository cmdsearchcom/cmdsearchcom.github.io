<p>PPPCONFIG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
PPPCONFIG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pppconfig - configure pppd to connect to the Internet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pppconfig [--version] | [--help] | [[--dialog] |
[--whiptail] | [--gdialog] [--noname] | [providername]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pppconfig is a dialog based interactive, menu driven utility
to help automate setting up a dial out ppp connection. It
provides extensive explanations at each step. pppconfig <br>
supports PAP, CHAP, and chat methods of authentication. It
uses the standard ppp configuration files and sets ppp up so
that the standard pon and poff commands can be used to <br>
control ppp. Some features supported by pppconfig are: <br>
- Multiple ISP&rsquo;s with separate nameservers. <br>
- Modem detection. <br>
- Dynamic DNS. <br>
- Dial on demand. <br>
- Allow non-root users to run ppp. <br>
- Uses the gdialog GUI dialog replacement if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before running pppconfig you
should know what sort of authentication your isp requires,
the username and password that they want you to use, and the
phone number. If they <br>
require you to use chat authentication, you will also need
to know the login and password prompts and any other prompts
and responses required for login. If you can&rsquo;t get
this <br>
information from your isp you could try dialing in with
minicom and working through the procedure until you get the
garbage that indicates that ppp has started on the other
end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pppconfig allows you to
configure connections to multiple providers. For example,
you might call your isp &rsquo;provider&rsquo;, your
employer &rsquo;theoffice&rsquo; and your university
&rsquo;theschool&rsquo;. <br>
Then you can connect to your isp with &rsquo;pon&rsquo;,
your office with &rsquo;pon theoffice&rsquo;, and your
university with &rsquo;pon theschool&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can determine which serial
port your modem is on, but the serial port must already be
configured. This is normally done when installing Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can help you set your
nameservers, or, if your ISP uses &rsquo;dynamic DNS&rsquo;,
it can set up ppp to use that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can configure ppp for demand
dialing, so that your ppp connection will come up
automatically. It will not, however, start pppd for you. You
must still start pppd yourself <br>
(&rsquo;pon&rsquo; will do it). Pppd will then wait in the
background for you to attempt to access the Net and bring up
the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you select &quot;Static&quot;
in the &quot;Configure Nameservers&quot; screen pppconfig
will create a file in the /etc/ppp/resolv directory named
after the provider you are configuring and con&acirc; <br>
taining &quot;nameserver&quot; lines for each of the IP
numbers you gave. This file will be substituted for
/etc/resolv.conf when the connection comes up. The provider
name is passed in <br>
the ipparam variable so that 0dns-up knows which file to
use. The original resolv.conf will be put back when the
connection goes down. You can edit this file if you wish and
<br>
add such things as &quot;search&quot; or &quot;domain&quot;
directives or additional nameservers. Be sure and read the
resolv.conf man page first, though. The &quot;search&quot;
and &quot;domain&quot; directives <br>
probably do not do what you think they do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you select
&quot;dynamic&quot; in the &quot;Configure Nameservers&quot;
screen pppconfig will configure pppd for &rsquo;dynamic
DNS&rsquo; and create a file in the /etc/ppp/resolv
directory named after the <br>
provider you are configuring but containing nothing. When
the connection comes up the nameservers supplied by your ISP
will be added and the file substituted for <br>
/etc/resolv.conf. You can edit this file if you wish and add
such things as &quot;search&quot; or &quot;domain&quot;
directives or additional nameservers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you select &quot;None&quot;
in the &quot;Configure Nameservers&quot; screen pppconfig
will create no file in /etc/ppp/resolv and will leave
/etc/resolv.conf alone. ipparam is not set to the <br>
provider name and so is free for the administrator to
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/ppp/peers/provider is the standard pppd options file
for the default service provider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/peers/&lt;name&gt; is
the pppd options file for the provider that you have named
&lt;name&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/peers/provider.bak is a
backup copy of /etc/ppp/peers/provider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/chatscripts/provider is the
standard chat script for the default service provider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/chatscripts/&lt;name&gt; is
the chat script for the provider that you have named
&lt;name&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/chatscripts/provider.bak is
a backup copy of /etc/chatscripts/provider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/resolv is a directory
where resolv.conf files for each provider are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/0dns-up is a
script that arranges for the correct resolv.conf file to be
copied into place when a connection comes up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ip-down.d/0dns-down is
a script that arranges for the original resolv.conf file to
be copied into place when a connection goes down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/init.d/dns-clean is a
script that runs 0dns-down at bootup to clean up any mess
left by a crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/pppconfig is a
directory where temporary files created by 0dns-up are
stored.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/pppconfig/resolv.conf.bak.&lt;provider&gt;
is a backup copy of the original resolv.conf file. 0dns-down
restores /etc/resolv.conf from it.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/pppconfig/0dns.&lt;provider&gt;
is a backup copy of the resolv.conf file for
&lt;provider&gt;. 0dns-down uses it to determine if
/etc/resolv.conf has been overwritten by another <br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/pap-secrets and
/etc/ppp/chap-secrets are described in the pppd
documentation. pppconfig may add lines to these files and
will change lines that it previously added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
pppconfig requires pppd 2.3.7 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TO DO <br>
Add full support for MSCHAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Don&rsquo;t tell pppconfig to find your modem while pppd is
running.</p>
