Not all SCSI direct access devices need to be formatted and some have vendor
  specific formatting procedures. SCSI disks with rotating media are probably
  the largest group that do support a 'standard' format operation. They are
  typically factory formatted to a block size of 512 bytes with the largest
  number of blocks that the manufacturer recommends. The manufacturer's
  recommendation typically leaves aside a certain number of tracks, spread
  across the media, for reassignment of blocks to logical block addresses during
  the life of the disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This utility can format modern SCSI disks and potentially change their block
  size (if permitted) and the block count (i.e. number of accessible blocks on
  the media also known as &quot;resizing&quot;). Resizing a disk to less than
  the manufacturer's recommended block count is sometimes called &quot;short
  stroking&quot; (see NOTES section). Resizing the block count while not
  changing the block size may not require a format operation. The SBC-2 standard
  (see www.t10.org) has obsoleted the &quot;format device&quot; mode page. Many
  of the low level details found in that mode page are now left up to the
  discretion of the manufacturer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this utility is used without options (i.e. it is only given a DEVICE
  argument) it prints out the existing block size and block count derived from
  two sources. These two sources are a block descriptor in the response to a
  MODE SENSE command and the response to a READ CAPACITY command. The reason for
  this double check is to detect a &quot;format corrupt&quot; state (see NOTES
  section). This usage will not modify the disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this utility is used with the &quot;--format&quot; (or &quot;-F&quot;)
  option it will attempt to format the given DEVICE. There is a 10 second pause
  during which time the user is invited twice (5 seconds apart) to abort
  sg_format. This occurs just prior the SCSI FORMAT UNIT command being issued.
  See the NOTES section for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Protection information is optional and is made up of 8 additional bytes
  associated with each logical block. Four protection types are defined with
  protection type 0 being no additional protection bytes. See the PROTECTION
  TYPES section below for more information.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LISTS"><a class="selflink" href="#LISTS">LISTS</a></h1>
The SBC-3 draft (revision 29) defines PLIST, CLIST, DLIST and GLIST in section
  4.13 on &quot;Medium defects&quot;. Briefly, the PLIST is the
  &quot;primary&quot; list of manufacturer detected defects, the CLIST
  (&quot;certification&quot; list) contains those detected during the format
  operation, the DLIST is a list of defects that can be given to the format
  operation. The GLIST is the grown list which starts in the format process as
  CLIST+DLIST and can &quot;grow&quot; later due to automatic reallocation (see
  the ARRE and AWRE bits in the read-write error recovery mode page (see
  sdparm(8))) and use of the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command (see sg_reassign(8)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CMPLST bit (controlled by the <i>--cmplst=</i>0|1 option) determines whether
  the existing GLIST, when the format operation is invoked, is taken into
  account. The sg_format utility sets the FOV bit to zero which causes DPRY=0,
  so the PLIST is taken into account, and DCRT=0, so the CLIST is generated and
  used during the format process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sg_format utility does not permit a user to provide a defect list (i.e.
  DLIST).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROTECTION_TYPES"><a class="selflink" href="#PROTECTION_TYPES">PROTECTION
  TYPES</a></h1>
SBC-3 drafts have added several &quot;protection types&quot; to the
  &quot;protection information&quot; introduced in the SBC-2 standard. See the
  &quot;protection information&quot; section (section 4.21 in draft SBC-3 rev
  29). 8 bytes of protection information are added to each logical block (a 2
  byte &quot;logical block guard&quot; (CRC), a 2 byte &quot;logical block
  application guard&quot;, and a 4 byte &quot;logical block reference
  tag&quot;). SBC-3 defines 4 protection types (types 0 to 3) with protection
  type 0 meaning no protection information is maintained.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A device that supports protection information (i.e. supports one or more
  protection types of 1 or higher) sets the &quot;PROTECT&quot; bit in its
  standard INQUIRY response. It also sets the SPT field in the EXTENDED INQUIRY
  VPD page response to indicate which protection types it supports. The current
  protection type of a disk can be found in the &quot;P_TYPE&quot; and
  &quot;PROT_EN&quot; fields in the response of a READ CAPACITY (16) command
  (e.g. with the 'sg_readcap --long' utility).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Given that a device supports a particular protection type, a user can then
  choose to format that disk with that protection type by setting the
  &quot;FMTPINFO&quot; and &quot;Protection Field Usage&quot; fields in the
  FORMAT UNIT command. Those fields correspond to the <i>--fmtpinfo=FPI</i> and
  the <i>--pfu=PFU</i> options in this utility. The list below shows the four
  protection types followed by the options of this utility needed to select
  them:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>0</b> : --fmtpinfo=0 --pfu=0
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>1</b> : --fmtpinfo=2 --pfu=0
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>2</b> : --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=0
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>3</b> : --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The default value of <i>FPI</i> (in <i>--fmtpinfo=FPI</i>) is 0 and the default
  value of <i>PFU</i> (in <i>--pfu=PFU</i>) is 0. So if neither
  <i>--fmtpinfo=FPI</i> nor <i>--pfu=PFU</i> are given then protection type 0
  (i.e. no protection information) is chosen.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
The SBC-2 standard states that the REQUEST SENSE command should be used for
  obtaining progress indication when the format command is underway. However,
  tests on a selection of disks shows that TEST UNIT READY commands yield
  progress indications (but not REQUEST SENSE commands). So the current version
  of this utility defaults to using TEST UNIT READY commands to poll the disk to
  find out the progress of the format. The <i>--poll=PT</i> option has been
  added to control this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the <i>--format</i> option is given without the <i>--wait</i> option then
  the SCSI FORMAT UNIT command is issued with the IMMED bit set which causes the
  SCSI command to return after it has started the format operation. The
  <i>--early</i> option will cause sg_format to exit at that point. Otherwise
  the <i>DEVICE</i> is polled every 60 seconds with TEST UNIT READY or REQUEST
  SENSE commands until it reports an &quot;all clear&quot; (i.e. the format
  operation has completed). Normally these polling commands will result in a
  progress indicator (expressed as a percentage) being output to the screen. If
  the user gets bored watching the progress report then sg_format process can be
  terminated (e.g. with control-C) without affecting the format operation which
  continues. However a target or device reset (or a power cycle) will probably
  cause the device to become &quot;format corrupt&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the <i>--format</i> and <i>--wait</i> options are both given then this
  utility may take a long time to return. In this case care should be taken not
  to send any other SCSI commands to the disk as it may not respond leaving
  those commands queued behind the active format command. This may cause a
  timeout in the OS driver (in a lot shorter period than 15 hours applicable to
  some format operations). This may result in the OS resetting the disk leaving
  the format operation incomplete. This may leave the disk in a &quot;format
  corrupt&quot; state requiring another format to remedy the situation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the block size (i.e. the number of bytes in each block) is changed on a
  disk two SCSI commands must be sent: a MODE SELECT to change the block size
  followed by a FORMAT command. If the MODE SELECT command succeeds and the
  FORMAT fails then the disk may be in a state that the draft standard calls
  &quot;format corrupt&quot;. A block descriptor in a subsequent MODE SENSE will
  report the requested new block size while a READ CAPACITY command will report
  the existing (i.e. different) block size. Alternatively the READ CAPACITY
  command may fail, reporting the device is not ready, potentially requiring a
  format. The solution to this situation is to do a format again (and this time
  the new block size does not have to be given) or change the block size back to
  the original size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The SBC-2 standard states that the block count can be set back to the
  manufacturer's maximum recommended value in a format or resize operation. This
  can be done by placing an address of 0xffffffff (or the 64 bit equivalent) in
  the appropriate block descriptor field to a MODE SELECT command. In signed
  (two's complement) arithmetic that value corresponds to the manufacturer's
  maximum recommended value. To see exactly which SCSI commands are being
  executed and parameters passed add the &quot;-vvv&quot; option to the
  sg_format command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Short stroking is a technique to trade off capacity for performance. Rotating
  disk performance is usually highest on the outer tracks (i.e. lower logical
  block addresses) so by resizing or reformatting a disk to a smaller capacity,
  average performance will usually be increased.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other utilities may be useful in finding information associated with formatting.
  These include sg_inq(8) to fetch standard INQUIRY information (e.g. the
  PROTECT bit) and to fetch the EXTENDED INQUIRY VPD page (e.g. RTO and GRD_CHK
  bits). The sdparm(8) utility can be used to access and potentially change the
  now obsolete format mode page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
scsiformat is another utility available for formatting SCSI disks with Linux. It
  dates from 1997 (most recent update) and may be useful for disks whose
  firmware is of that vintage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>COUNT</i> numeric argument may include a multiplicative suffix or be
  given in hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the
  sg3_utils(8) man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The SCSI SANITIZE command was introduced in SBC-3 revision 27. It is closely
  related to the ATA sanitize disk feature set and can be used to remove all
  existing data from a disk. Sanitize is more likely to be implemented on modern
  disks (including SSDs) than FORMAT UNIT's security initialization feature (see
  the <i>--security</i> option) and in some cases much faster.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device names in other
  supported Operating Systems see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the first example below simply find out the existing block count and size
  derived from two sources: a block descriptor in a MODE SELECT command response
  and from the response of a READ CAPACITY commands. No changes are made:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now a simple format, leaving the block count and size as they were previously.
  The FORMAT UNIT command is executed in IMMED mode and the device is polled
  every 60 seconds to print out a progress indication:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format --format /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now the same format, but waiting (passively) until the format operation is
  complete:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format --format --wait /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next is a format in which the block size is changed to 520 bytes and the block
  count is set to the manufacturer's maximum value (for that block size). Note,
  not all disks support changing the block size:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format --format --size=520 /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now a resize operation so that only the first 0x10000 (65536) blocks on a disk
  are accessible. The remaining blocks remain unaltered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format --resize --count=0x10000 /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now resize the disk back to its normal (maximum) block count:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format --resize --count=-1 /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
One reason to format a SCSI disk is to add protection information. First check
  which protection types are supported by a disk (by checking the SPT field in
  the Extended inquiry VPD page together with the Protect bit in the standard
  inquiry response):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_vpd -p ei -l /dev/sdb
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 extended INQUIRY data VPD page:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ACTIVATE_MICROCODE=0
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 SPT=1 [protection types 1 and 2 supported]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ....
<div class="Pp"></div>
Format with type 1 protection:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format --format --fmtpinfo=2 /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
After a successful format with type 1 protection, READ CAPACITY(16) should show
  something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_readcap -l /dev/sdm
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Read Capacity results:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Protection: prot_en=1, p_type=0, p_i_exponent=0 [type 1 protection]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Logical block provisioning: lbpme=0, lbprz=0
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ....
<div class="Pp"></div>
To format with type 3 protection:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_format --format --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=1 /dev/sdm
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the disk shown above this will probably fail because the Extended inquiry
  VPD page showed only types 1 and 2 protection are supported.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
The exit status of sg_format is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
  sg3_utils(8) man page. Unless the <i>--wait</i> option is given, the exit
  status may not reflect the success of otherwise of the format. Using
  sg_turs(8) and sg_readcap(8) after the format operation may be wise.
