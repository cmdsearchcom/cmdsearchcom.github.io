<p>SG_FORMAT(8) SG3_UTILS SG_FORMAT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_format - format or resize a SCSI disk (perhaps change its
block size)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_format [--cmplst={0|1}] [--count=COUNT] [--dcrt]
[--early] [--fmtpinfo=FPI] [--format] [--help] [--long]
[--pfu=PFU] [--pie=PIE] [--pinfo] [--poll=PT] [--resize]

[--security] [--six] [--size=SIZE] [--verbose] [--version]
[--wait] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Not all SCSI direct access devices need to be formatted and
some have vendor specific formatting procedures. SCSI disks
with rotating media are probably the largest group that do
<br>
support a &rsquo;standard&rsquo; format operation. They are
typically factory formatted to a block size of 512 bytes
with the largest number of blocks that the manufacturer
recommends. The <br>
manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendation typically leaves aside a
certain number of tracks, spread across the media, for
reassignment of blocks to logical block addresses during the
life of <br>
the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can format modern
SCSI disks and potentially change their block size (if
permitted) and the block count (i.e. number of accessible
blocks on the media also known as <br>
&quot;resizing&quot;). Resizing a disk to less than the
manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended block count is sometimes
called &quot;short stroking&quot; (see NOTES section).
Resizing the block count while not <br>
changing the block size may not require a format operation.
The SBC-2 standard (see www.t10.org) has obsoleted the
&quot;format device&quot; mode page. Many of the low level
details found <br>
in that mode page are now left up to the discretion of the
manufacturer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this utility is used
without options (i.e. it is only given a DEVICE argument) it
prints out the existing block size and block count derived
from two sources. These two <br>
sources are a block descriptor in the response to a MODE
SENSE command and the response to a READ CAPACITY command.
The reason for this double check is to detect a &quot;format
cor&acirc; <br>
rupt&quot; state (see NOTES section). This usage will not
modify the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this utility is used with
the &quot;--format&quot; (or &quot;-F&quot;) option it will
attempt to format the given DEVICE. There is a 10 second
pause during which time the user is invited twice <br>
(5 seconds apart) to abort sg_format. This occurs just prior
the SCSI FORMAT UNIT command being issued. See the NOTES
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protection information is
optional and is made up of 8 additional bytes associated
with each logical block. Four protection types are defined
with protection type 0 being no <br>
additional protection bytes. See the PROTECTION TYPES
section below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. The options are arranged in alphabetical order based
on the long option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --cmplst={0|1} <br>
sets the CMPLST (&quot;complete list&quot;) bit in the
FORMAT UNIT cdb to 0 or 1. The default is 1 in which case
the existing GLIST (grown list) is ignored. If the value is
0 then <br>
the existing GLIST is taken into account. See the LISTS
section below. In most cases this bit should be left set;
some MO disk drives need this bit cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --count=COUNT <br>
where COUNT is the number of blocks to be formatted or media
to be resized to. Can be used with either --format or
--resize. With --format this option need not be given <br>
in which case it is assumed to be zero. With --format the
interpretation of COUNT is: <br>
(COUNT &gt; 0) : only format the first COUNT blocks and READ
<br>
CAPACITY will report COUNT blocks after format <br>
(COUNT = 0) and block size unchanged : use existing block
count <br>
(COUNT = 0) and block size changed : recommended maximum
block <br>
count for new block size <br>
(COUNT = -1) : use recommended maximum block count <br>
(COUNT &lt; -1) : illegal <br>
With --resize this option must be given and COUNT has this
interpretation: <br>
(COUNT &gt; 0) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report
COUNT <br>
blocks <br>
(COUNT = 0) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report 0
blocks <br>
(COUNT = -1) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report its
<br>
maximum number of blocks <br>
(COUNT &lt; -1) : illegal <br>
In both cases if the given COUNT exceeds the maximum number
of blocks (for the block size) then the disk reports an
error. See NOTES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --dcrt <br>
this option sets the DCRT bit in the FORMAT UNIT
command&rsquo;s parameter list header. It will &quot;disable
certification&quot;. Certification verifies that blocks are
usable during the <br>
format process. Using this option may speed the format. The
default action of this utility (i.e. when this option is not
given) is to clear the DCRT bit thereby request&acirc; <br>
ing &quot;media certification&quot;. When the DCRT bit is
set, the FOV bit must also be set hence sg_format does
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --early <br>
during a format operation, The default action of this
utility is to poll the disk every 60 seconds to determine
the progress of the format operation until it is finished.
<br>
When this option is given this utility will exit
&quot;early&quot;, that is as soon as the format operation
has commenced. Then the user can monitor the progress of the
ongoing for&acirc; <br>
mat operation with other utilities (e.g. sg_turs(8) or
sg_requests(8)). This option and --wait are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fmtpinfo=FPI <br>
sets the FMTPINFO field in the FORMAT UNIT cdb to a value
between 0 and 3. The default value is 0. The FMTPINFO field
from SBC-3 revision 16 is a 2 bit field (bits 7 and <br>
6 of byte 1 in the cdb). Prior to that it was a single bit
field (bit 7 of byte 1 in the cdb) and there was an
accompanying bit called RTO_REQ (bit 6 of byte 1 in the <br>
cdb). The deprecated options &quot;--pinfo&quot; and
&quot;--rto-req&quot; represent the older usage. This option
should be used in their place. See the PROTECTION TYPES
section below for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --format <br>
issue a SCSI FORMAT UNIT command. This will destroy all the
data held on the media. This option is required to change
the block size of a disk. The user is given a 10 <br>
second count down to ponder the wisdom of doing this, during
which time control-C (amongst other Unix commands) can be
used to kill this process before it does any damage. <br>
See NOTES section for implementation details and EXAMPLES
section for typical use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print out the usage information then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --long <br>
the default action of this utility is to assume 32 bit
logical block addresses. With 512 byte block size this
permits more than 2 terabytes (almost 2 ** 41 bytes) on a
<br>
single disk. This option selects commands and parameters
that allow for 64 bit logical block addresses. Specifically
this option sets the &quot;longlba&quot; flag in the MODE
SENSE <br>
(10) command and uses READ CAPACITY (16) rather than READ
CAPACITY (10). If this option is not given and READ CAPACITY
(10) or MODE SELECT detects a disk the needs more <br>
than 32 bits to represent its logical blocks then it is set
internally. This option does not set the LONGLIST bit in the
FORMAT UNIT command. The LONGLIST bit is set as <br>
required depending other parameters (e.g. when
&rsquo;--pie=PIE&rsquo; is greater than zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pfu=PFU <br>
sets the &quot;Protection Field Usage&quot; field in the
parameter block associated with a FORMAT UNIT command to
PFU. The default value is 0, the only other defined value
currently <br>
is 1. See the PROTECTION TYPES section below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --pie=PIE <br>
sets the &quot;Protection Interval Exponent&quot; field in
the parameter block associated with a FORMAT UNIT command to
PIE. The default value is 0. This field first appeared in
<br>
SBC-3 revision 18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pinfo <br>
this option is deprecated, use the --fmtpinfo=FPI option
instead. If used, then it sets bit 7 of byte 1 in the FORMAT
UNIT cdb and that is equivalent to setting --fmt&acirc; <br>
pinfo=2. [So if --pinfo is used (plus --fmtpinfo=FPI and
--pfu=PFU are not given or their arguments are 0) then
protection type 1 is selected.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --poll=PT <br>
where PT is the type of poll used. If PT is 0 then a TEST
UNIT READY command is used, otherwise a REQUEST SENSE
command is used. The default is currently 0 but this will
<br>
change to 1 in the near future. See the NOTES sections
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --resize <br>
rather than format the disk, it can be resized. This means
changing the number of blocks on the device reported by the
READ CAPACITY command. This option should be used <br>
with the --count=COUNT option. The contents of all logical
blocks on the media remain unchanged when this option is
used. This means that any resize operation can be <br>
reversed. This option cannot be used together with either
--format or a --size=SIZE whose argument is different to the
existing block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rto_req <br>
The option is deprecated, use the --fmtpinfo=FPI option
instead. If used, then it sets bit 6 of byte 1 in the FORMAT
UNIT cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --security <br>
sets the &quot;Security Initialization&quot; (SI) bit in the
FORMAT UNIT command&rsquo;s initialization pattern
descriptor within the parameter list. According to SBC-3 the
default ini&acirc; <br>
tialization pattern &quot;shall be written using a security
erasure write technique&quot;. See the NOTES section on the
SCSI SANITIZE command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --six <br>
Use 6 byte variants of MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT. The
default action is to use the 10 byte variants. Some MO
drives need this option set when doing a format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --size=SIZE <br>
where SIZE is the block size (i.e. number of bytes in each
block) to format the device to. The default value is
whatever is currently reported by the block descriptor in a
<br>
MODE SENSE command. If the block size given by this option
is different from the current value then a MODE SELECT
command is used to change it prior to the FORMAT UNIT <br>
command being started (as recommended in the draft
standard). Many SCSI disks have 512 byte sectors by default
and allow up to 16 bytes extra in a sector (i.e. 528 byte
<br>
sectors). If the given size in unacceptable with the disk,
most likely an &quot;Invalid field in parameter list&quot;
message will appear in sense data (requires the use of
&rsquo;-v&rsquo; to <br>
decode sense data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
&quot;-vvv&quot; gives a lot more debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wait <br>
the default format action is to set the &quot;IMMED&quot;
bit in the FORMAT UNIT command&rsquo;s (short) parameter
header. If this option (i.e. --wait) is given then the
&quot;IMMED&quot; bit is <br>
not set. If --wait is given the FORMAT UNIT command waits
until the format operation completes before returning its
response. This can be many hours on large disks. This <br>
utility sets a 15 hour timeout on such a FORMAT UNIT
command!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTS <br>
The SBC-3 draft (revision 29) defines PLIST, CLIST, DLIST
and GLIST in section 4.13 on &quot;Medium defects&quot;.
Briefly, the PLIST is the &quot;primary&quot; list of
manufacturer detected <br>
defects, the CLIST (&quot;certification&quot; list) contains
those detected during the format operation, the DLIST is a
list of defects that can be given to the format operation.
The GLIST <br>
is the grown list which starts in the format process as
CLIST+DLIST and can &quot;grow&quot; later due to automatic
reallocation (see the ARRE and AWRE bits in the read-write
error recov&acirc; <br>
ery mode page (see sdparm(8))) and use of the SCSI REASSIGN
BLOCKS command (see sg_reassign(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CMPLST bit (controlled by
the --cmplst=0|1 option) determines whether the existing
GLIST, when the format operation is invoked, is taken into
account. The sg_format utility <br>
sets the FOV bit to zero which causes DPRY=0, so the PLIST
is taken into account, and DCRT=0, so the CLIST is generated
and used during the format process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sg_format utility does not
permit a user to provide a defect list (i.e. DLIST).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTECTION TYPES <br>
SBC-3 drafts have added several &quot;protection types&quot;
to the &quot;protection information&quot; introduced in the
SBC-2 standard. See the &quot;protection information&quot;
section (section 4.21 in <br>
draft SBC-3 rev 29). 8 bytes of protection information are
added to each logical block (a 2 byte &quot;logical block
guard&quot; (CRC), a 2 byte &quot;logical block application
guard&quot;, and a 4 <br>
byte &quot;logical block reference tag&quot;). SBC-3 defines
4 protection types (types 0 to 3) with protection type 0
meaning no protection information is maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A device that supports
protection information (i.e. supports one or more protection
types of 1 or higher) sets the &quot;PROTECT&quot; bit in
its standard INQUIRY response. It also sets <br>
the SPT field in the EXTENDED INQUIRY VPD page response to
indicate which protection types it supports. The current
protection type of a disk can be found in the
&quot;P_TYPE&quot; and <br>
&quot;PROT_EN&quot; fields in the response of a READ
CAPACITY (16) command (e.g. with the &rsquo;sg_readcap
--long&rsquo; utility).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given that a device supports a
particular protection type, a user can then choose to format
that disk with that protection type by setting the
&quot;FMTPINFO&quot; and &quot;Protection Field <br>
Usage&quot; fields in the FORMAT UNIT command. Those fields
correspond to the --fmtpinfo=FPI and the --pfu=PFU options
in this utility. The list below shows the four protection
types <br>
followed by the options of this utility needed to select
them: <br>
0 : --fmtpinfo=0 --pfu=0 <br>
1 : --fmtpinfo=2 --pfu=0 <br>
2 : --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=0 <br>
3 : --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=1 <br>
The default value of FPI (in --fmtpinfo=FPI) is 0 and the
default value of PFU (in --pfu=PFU) is 0. So if neither
--fmtpinfo=FPI nor --pfu=PFU are given then protection type
0 <br>
(i.e. no protection information) is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The SBC-2 standard states that the REQUEST SENSE command
should be used for obtaining progress indication when the
format command is underway. However, tests on a selection of
<br>
disks shows that TEST UNIT READY commands yield progress
indications (but not REQUEST SENSE commands). So the current
version of this utility defaults to using TEST UNIT READY
<br>
commands to poll the disk to find out the progress of the
format. The --poll=PT option has been added to control
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --format option is
given without the --wait option then the SCSI FORMAT UNIT
command is issued with the IMMED bit set which causes the
SCSI command to return after it <br>
has started the format operation. The --early option will
cause sg_format to exit at that point. Otherwise the DEVICE
is polled every 60 seconds with TEST UNIT READY or REQUEST
<br>
SENSE commands until it reports an &quot;all clear&quot;
(i.e. the format operation has completed). Normally these
polling commands will result in a progress indicator
(expressed as a per&acirc; <br>
centage) being output to the screen. If the user gets bored
watching the progress report then sg_format process can be
terminated (e.g. with control-C) without affecting the <br>
format operation which continues. However a target or device
reset (or a power cycle) will probably cause the device to
become &quot;format corrupt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --format and --wait
options are both given then this utility may take a long
time to return. In this case care should be taken not to
send any other SCSI commands to the <br>
disk as it may not respond leaving those commands queued
behind the active format command. This may cause a timeout
in the OS driver (in a lot shorter period than 15 hours
appli&acirc; <br>
cable to some format operations). This may result in the OS
resetting the disk leaving the format operation incomplete.
This may leave the disk in a &quot;format corrupt&quot;
state <br>
requiring another format to remedy the situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the block size (i.e. the
number of bytes in each block) is changed on a disk two SCSI
commands must be sent: a MODE SELECT to change the block
size followed by a FORMAT com&acirc; <br>
mand. If the MODE SELECT command succeeds and the FORMAT
fails then the disk may be in a state that the draft
standard calls &quot;format corrupt&quot;. A block
descriptor in a subsequent <br>
MODE SENSE will report the requested new block size while a
READ CAPACITY command will report the existing (i.e.
different) block size. Alternatively the READ CAPACITY
command <br>
may fail, reporting the device is not ready, potentially
requiring a format. The solution to this situation is to do
a format again (and this time the new block size does not
<br>
have to be given) or change the block size back to the
original size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SBC-2 standard states that
the block count can be set back to the manufacturer&rsquo;s
maximum recommended value in a format or resize operation.
This can be done by placing an <br>
address of 0xffffffff (or the 64 bit equivalent) in the
appropriate block descriptor field to a MODE SELECT command.
In signed (two&rsquo;s complement) arithmetic that value
corre&acirc; <br>
sponds to the manufacturer&rsquo;s maximum recommended
value. To see exactly which SCSI commands are being executed
and parameters passed add the &quot;-vvv&quot; option to the
sg_format command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short stroking is a technique to
trade off capacity for performance. Rotating disk
performance is usually highest on the outer tracks (i.e.
lower logical block addresses) so by <br>
resizing or reformatting a disk to a smaller capacity,
average performance will usually be increased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other utilities may be useful in
finding information associated with formatting. These
include sg_inq(8) to fetch standard INQUIRY information
(e.g. the PROTECT bit) and to fetch <br>
the EXTENDED INQUIRY VPD page (e.g. RTO and GRD_CHK bits).
The sdparm(8) utility can be used to access and potentially
change the now obsolete format mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scsiformat is another utility
available for formatting SCSI disks with Linux. It dates
from 1997 (most recent update) and may be useful for disks
whose firmware is of that vin&acirc; <br>
tage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The COUNT numeric argument may
include a multiplicative suffix or be given in hexadecimal.
See the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SCSI SANITIZE command was
introduced in SBC-3 revision 27. It is closely related to
the ATA sanitize disk feature set and can be used to remove
all existing data from a disk. <br>
Sanitize is more likely to be implemented on modern disks
(including SSDs) than FORMAT UNIT&rsquo;s security
initialization feature (see the --security option) and in
some cases much <br>
faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device
names in other supported Operating Systems see the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first example below
simply find out the existing block count and size derived
from two sources: a block descriptor in a MODE SELECT
command response and from the response <br>
of a READ CAPACITY commands. No changes are made:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now a simple format, leaving the
block count and size as they were previously. The FORMAT
UNIT command is executed in IMMED mode and the device is
polled every 60 seconds to <br>
print out a progress indication:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format --format
/dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now the same format, but waiting
(passively) until the format operation is complete:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format --format --wait
/dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next is a format in which the
block size is changed to 520 bytes and the block count is
set to the manufacturer&rsquo;s maximum value (for that
block size). Note, not all disks support <br>
changing the block size:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format --format --size=520
/dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now a resize operation so that
only the first 0x10000 (65536) blocks on a disk are
accessible. The remaining blocks remain unaltered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format --resize
--count=0x10000 /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now resize the disk back to its
normal (maximum) block count:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format --resize --count=-1
/dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One reason to format a SCSI disk
is to add protection information. First check which
protection types are supported by a disk (by checking the
SPT field in the Extended inquiry <br>
VPD page together with the Protect bit in the standard
inquiry response):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_vpd -p ei -l /dev/sdb <br>
extended INQUIRY data VPD page: <br>
ACTIVATE_MICROCODE=0 <br>
SPT=1 [protection types 1 and 2 supported] <br>
....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format with type 1
protection:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format --format
--fmtpinfo=2 /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a successful format with
type 1 protection, READ CAPACITY(16) should show something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_readcap -l /dev/sdm <br>
Read Capacity results: <br>
Protection: prot_en=1, p_type=0, p_i_exponent=0 [type 1
protection] <br>
Logical block provisioning: lbpme=0, lbprz=0 <br>
....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To format with type 3
protection:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_format --format
--fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=1 /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the disk shown above this
will probably fail because the Extended inquiry VPD page
showed only types 1 and 2 protection are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_format is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page. Unless the --wait
option is given, the exit status may not reflect the success
<br>
of otherwise of the format. Using sg_turs(8) and
sg_readcap(8) after the format operation may be wise.</p>
