<p>ARPD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual ARPD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
arpd - userspace arp daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Usage: arpd [ -lkh? ] [ -a N ] [ -b dbase ] [ -B number ] [
-f file ] [-p interval ] [ -n time ] [ -R rate ] [
&lt;INTERFACES&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The arpd daemon collects gratuitous ARP information, saving
it on local disk and feeding it to the kernel on demand to
avoid redundant broadcasting due to limited size of the <br>
kernel ARP cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h -? Print help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Dump the arpd database to
stdout and exit. The output consists of three columns: the
interface index, the IP address of the interface, and the
MAC address of the inter&acirc; <br>
face. Negative entries for dead hosts are also shown, in
this case the MAC address is replaced by the word FAILED
followed by a colon and the most recent time when the <br>
fact that the host is dead was proven.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;FILE&gt; <br>
Read and load an arpd database from FILE in a text format
similar to that dumped by option -l. Exit after load,
possibly listing resulting database, if option -l is also
<br>
given. If FILE is -, stdin is read to get the ARP table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;DATABASE&gt; <br>
the location of the database file. The default location is
/var/lib/arpd/arpd.db</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &lt;NUMBER&gt; <br>
With this option, arpd not only passively listens for ARP
packets on the interface, but also sends broadcast queries
itself. NUMBER is the number of such queries to make <br>
before a destination is considered dead. When arpd is
started as kernel helper (i.e. with app_solicit enabled in
sysctl or even with option -k) without this option and <br>
still did not learn enough information, you can observe 1
second gaps in service. Not fatal, but not good.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Suppress sending broadcast
queries by the kernel. This option only makes sense together
with option -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;TIME&gt; <br>
Specifies the timeout of the negative cache. When resolution
fails, arpd suppresses further attempts to resolve for this
period. This option only makes sense together with <br>
option &rsquo;-k&rsquo;. This timeout should not be too much
longer than the boot time of a typical host not supporting
gratuitous ARP. Default value is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;TIME&gt; <br>
The time to wait in seconds between polling attempts to the
kernel ARP table. TIME may be a floating point number. The
default value is 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &lt;RATE&gt; <br>
Maximal steady rate of broadcasts sent by arpd in packets
per second. Default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B &lt;NUMBER&gt; <br>
The number of broadcasts sent by arpd back to back. Default
value is 3. Together with the -R option, this option ensures
that the number of ARP queries that are broadcast <br>
does not exceed B+R*T over any interval of time T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;INTERFACES&gt; is a list of
names of networking interfaces to watch. If no interfaces
are given, arpd monitors all the interfaces. In this case
arpd does not adjust sysctl parame&acirc; <br>
ters, it is assumed that the user does this himself after
arpd is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
When arpd receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, it exits
gracefully, syncing the database and restoring adjusted
sysctl parameters. On a SIGHUP it syncs the database to
disk. With <br>
SIGUSR1 it sends some statistics to syslog. The effect of
any other signals is undefined. In particular, they may
corrupt the database and leave the sysctl parameters in an
<br>
unpredictable state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
In order for arpd to be able to serve as ARP resolver, the
kernel must be compiled with the option CONFIG_ARPD and, in
the case when interface list in not given on command line,
<br>
variable app_solicit on interfaces of interest should be in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*. If this is not made arpd still
collects gratuitous ARP information in its database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db <br>
Start arpd to collect gratuitous ARP, but not messing with
kernel functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">killall arpd ; arpd -l -b
/var/tmp/arpd.db <br>
Look at result after some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 1
eth0 eth1 <br>
Enable kernel helper, leaving leading role to kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 3 -k
eth0 eth1 <br>
Completely replace kernel resolution on interfaces eth0 and
eth1. In this case the kernel still does unicast probing to
validate entries, but all the broadcast activity is <br>
suppressed and made under authority of arpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the mode in which arpd
normally is supposed to work. It is not the default to
prevent occasional enabling of too aggressive a mode.</p>
