Resolution manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
systemd-resolved.service</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-resolved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
systemd-resolved is a system service that provides network
name resolution to local applications. It implements a
caching and validating DNS/DNSSEC stub resolver, as well as
an <br>
LLMNR resolver and responder. Local applications may submit
network name resolution requests via three interfaces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The native,
fully-featured API systemd-resolved exposes on the bus. See
the API Documentation[1] for details. Usage of this API is
generally recommended to clients as it is <br>
asynchronous and fully featured (for example, properly
returns DNSSEC validation status and interface scope for
addresses as necessary for supporting link-local
networking).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The glibc
getaddrinfo(3) API as defined by RFC3493[2] and its related
resolver functions, including gethostbyname(3). This API is
widely supported, including beyond the Linux <br>
platform. In its current form it does not expose DNSSEC
validation status information however, and is synchronous
only. This API is backed by the glibc Name Service Switch
<br>
(nss(5)). Usage of the glibc NSS module nss-resolve(8) is
required in order to allow glibc&rsquo;s NSS resolver
functions to resolve host names via systemd-resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Additionally,
systemd-resolved provides a local DNS stub listener on IP
address 127.0.0.53 on the local loopback interface. Programs
issuing DNS requests directly, bypassing <br>
any local API may be directed to this stub, in order to
connect them to systemd-resolved. Note however that it is
strongly recommended that local programs use the glibc NSS
<br>
or bus APIs instead (as described above), as various network
resolution concepts (such as link-local addressing, or LLMNR
Unicode domains) cannot be mapped to the unicast DNS <br>
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DNS servers contacted are
determined from the global settings in
/etc/systemd/resolved.conf, the per-link static settings in
/etc/systemd/network/*.network files, the <br>
per-link dynamic settings received over DHCP and any DNS
server information made available by other system services.
See resolved.conf(5) and systemd.network(5) for details
about <br>
systemd&rsquo;s own configuration files for DNS servers. To
improve compatibility, /etc/resolv.conf is read in order to
discover configured system DNS servers, but only if it is
not a <br>
symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd-resolved synthesizes DNS
resource records (RRs) for the following cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The local,
configured hostname is resolved to all locally configured IP
addresses ordered by their scope, or &acirc; if none are
configured &acirc; the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2 (which is <br>
on the local loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is
the local host).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The hostnames
&quot;localhost&quot; and &quot;localhost.localdomain&quot;
(as well as any hostname ending in &quot;.localhost&quot; or
&quot;.localhost.localdomain&quot;) are resolved to the IP
addresses 127.0.0.1 <br>
and ::1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The hostname
&quot;gateway&quot; is resolved to all current default
routing gateway addresses, ordered by their metric. This
assigns a stable hostname to the current gateway, useful
<br>
for referencing it independently of the current network
configuration state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The mappings
defined in /etc/hosts are resolved to their configured
addresses and back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lookup requests are routed to
the available DNS servers and LLMNR interfaces according to
the following rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lookups for the
special hostname &quot;localhost&quot; are never routed to
the network. (A few other, special domains are handled the
same way.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Single-label
names are routed to all local interfaces capable of IP
multicasting, using the LLMNR protocol. Lookups for IPv4
addresses are only sent via LLMNR on IPv4, and <br>
lookups for IPv6 addresses are only sent via LLMNR on IPv6.
Lookups for the locally configured host name and the
&quot;gateway&quot; host name are never routed to LLMNR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Multi-label
names are routed to all local interfaces that have a DNS
sever configured, plus the globally configured DNS server if
there is one. Address lookups from the <br>
link-local address range are never routed to DNS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If lookups are routed to
multiple interfaces, the first successful response is
returned (thus effectively merging the lookup zones on all
matching interfaces). If the lookup <br>
failed on all interfaces, the last failing response is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Routing of lookups may be
influenced by configuring per-interface domain names. See
systemd.network(5) for details. Lookups for a hostname
ending in one of the per-interface <br>
domains are exclusively routed to the matching
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the resolved D-Bus API
Documentation[1] for information about the APIs
systemd-resolved provides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ETC/RESOLV.CONF <br>
Three modes of handling /etc/resolv.conf (see
resolv.conf(5)) are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A static file
/usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf is provided that lists the
127.0.0.53 DNS stub (see above) as only DNS server. This
file may be symlinked from /etc/resolv.conf in <br>
order to connect all local clients that bypass local DNS
APIs to systemd-resolved. This mode of operation is
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; systemd-resolved
maintains the /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf file for
compatibility with traditional Linux programs. This file may
be symlinked from /etc/resolv.conf and <br>
is always kept up-to-date, containing information about all
known DNS servers. Note the file format&rsquo;s limitations:
it does not know a concept of per-interface DNS servers and
<br>
hence only contains system-wide DNS server definitions. Note
that /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf should not be used
directly by applications, but only through a symlink <br>
from /etc/resolv.conf. If this mode of operation is used
local clients that bypass any local DNS API will also bypass
systemd-resolved and will talk directly to the known DNS
<br>
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Alternatively,
/etc/resolv.conf may be managed by other packages, in which
case systemd-resolved will read it for DNS configuration
data. In this mode of operation <br>
systemd-resolved is consumer rather than provider of this
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the selected mode of
operation for this file is detected fully automatically,
depending on whether /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf or <br>
lists 127.0.0.53 as DNS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGUSR1 <br>
Upon reception of the SIGUSR1 process signal
systemd-resolved will dump the contents of all DNS resource
record caches it maintains into the system logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
Upon reception of the SIGUSR2 process signal
systemd-resolved will flush all caches it maintains. Note
that it should normally not be necessary to request this
explicitly &acirc; <br>
except for debugging purposes &acirc; as systemd-resolved
flushes the caches automatically anyway any time the
host&rsquo;s network configuration changes.</p>
