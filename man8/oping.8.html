<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
oping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
oping [-4 | -6] [-c count] [-i interval] host [host [host
...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oping [-4 | -6] [-c count] [-i
interval] -f filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noping [-4 | -6] [-c count] [-i
interval] host [host [host ...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noping [-4 | -6] [-c count] [-i
interval] -f filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
oping uses ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 ECHO_REQUEST packets to measure
a hosts reachability and the network latency. In contrast to
the original ping(8) utility oping can send ICMP packets
<br>
to multiple hosts in parallel and wait for all ECHO_RESPONSE
packets to arrive. In contrast to the fping utility (URL is
listed in &quot;SEE ALSO&quot;) oping can use both, IPv4 and
IPv6 <br>
transparently and side by side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noping is an ncurses-based
front-end to liboping which displays ping statistics online
and highlights aberrant round-trip times if the terminal
supports colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-4 Force the use of IPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Force the use of IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c count <br>
Send (and receive) count ICMP packets, then stop and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Send one ICMP packet (per host) each interval seconds. This
can be a floating-point number to specify sub-second
precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w timeout <br>
Specifies the time to wait for an &quot;ECHO REPLY&quot;
packet before giving up, in seconds. This can be a floating
point number for sub-second precision. Defaults to 1.0
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t ttl <br>
Set the IP Time to Live to ttl. This must be a number
between (and including) 1 and 255. If omitted, the value 64
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I address <br>
Set the source address to use. You may either specify an IP
number or a hostname. You cannot pass the interface name, as
you can with GNU&rsquo;s ping(8) - use the -D option for
<br>
that purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D interface name <br>
Set the outgoing network device to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Instead of specifying hostnames on the command line, read
them from filename. If filename is -, read from
&quot;STDIN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If oping is installed with the
SetUID-bit, it will set the effective UID to the real UID
before opening the file. In the special (but common) case
that oping is owned by the <br>
super-user (UID 0), this means that privileges are
temporarily dropped before opening the file, in order to
prevent users from reading arbitrary files on the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your system doesn&rsquo;t
provide saved set-user IDs (this was an optional feature
before POSIX 2001), the behavior is different because it is
not possible to temporarily drop <br>
privileges. The alternative behavior is: If the real user ID
(as returned by getuid(2)) and the effective user ID (as
returned by geteuid(2)) differ, the only argument <br>
allowed for this option is &quot;-&quot; (i.e. standard
input).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O filename <br>
Write measurements in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format to
filename. This option writes three columns per row: wall
clock time in (fractional) seconds since epoch, <br>
hostname and the round trip time in milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q qos <br>
Specify the Quality of Service (QoS) for outgoing packets.
This is a somewhat tricky option, since the meaning of the
bits in the IPv4 header has been revised several times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The currently recommended method
is Differentiated Services which is used in IPv6 headers as
well. There are shortcuts for various predefined per-hop
behaviors (PHBs):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">be Selects the Best Effort
behavior. This is the default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ef Selects the Expedited
Forwarding (EF) per-hop behavior, as defined in RFC 3246.
This PHB is characterised by low delay, low loss and low
jitter, i.e. high priority <br>
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">va Selects the Voice Admitted
(VA) per-hop behavior, as defined in RFC 5865. This traffic
class is meant for Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic which uses
Call Admission Control <br>
(CAC) for reserving network capacity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afcp <br>
Selects one of 12 differentiated services code points
(DSCPs), which are organized in four classes with three
priorities each. Therefore, c must be a number between 1
<br>
through 4 and p must be a number between 1 through 3, for
example &quot;af13&quot;, &quot;af22&quot; and
&quot;af41&quot;. In each class, the lower priority number
takes precedence over the higher <br>
priority number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csn Selects one of the eight
Class Selector PHBs. n is a number between 0 through 7. The
class selectors have been defined to be compatible to the
Precedence field in the <br>
IPv4 header as defined in RFC 791. Please note that
&quot;cs0&quot; is synonymous to &quot;be&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old definition of the same
bits in the IPv4 header was as Type of Service (ToS) field,
specified in RFC 1349. It defined four possible values which
have appropriate <br>
aliases. Please note that this use of the bits is deprecated
and the meaning is limited to IPv4!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lowdelay <br>
Minimize delay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">throughput <br>
Maximize throughput</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reliability <br>
Maximize reliability</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mincost <br>
Minimize monetary cost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can also
specify the byte manually. You can use either a decimal
number (0-255), a hexadecimal number (0x00-0xff) or an octal
number (00-0377) using the <br>
usual &quot;0x&quot; and &quot;0&quot; prefixes for
hexadecimal and octal respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The printed lines will contain
information about the QoS field of received packets if
either a non-standard QoS setting was used on outgoing
packets or if the QoS byte of <br>
incoming packets is not zero. In other words, the QoS
information is omitted if both, the outgoing and the
incoming QoS bytes are zero. The received byte is always
<br>
interpreted as Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) and
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), even if the
deprecated Type of Service (ToS) aliases were used to
specify <br>
the bits of outgoing packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mark <br>
Linux only Sets the mark (an integer number) on outgoing
packets. This can be used by iptables(8) and other
networking infrastructure for filtering and routing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u|-U <br>
noping only -u forces UTF-8 output, -U disables UTF-8
output. If neither is given, the codeset is automatically
determined from the locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g
none|prettyping|boxplot|histogram <br>
noping only Selects the graph to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
Do not show a graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prettyping <br>
Show a graph with time on the x-axis, the y-axis shows the
round-trip time. This is the default graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your terminal supports
unicode and colors, they are used to improve the precision
of the data shown: a green box is drawn for round-trip times
up to one third of the <br>
configured timeout, the height representing the RTT. Longer
RTTs will start to fill the box yellow (with a green
background) and then red (with a yellow background). Lost
<br>
packages are drawn as a bold red explamation mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">boxplot <br>
Show a box plot where the x-axis, i.e. the width of the
window, is the round-trip time. The entire width of the
window it the ping interval, set with the -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The box is sized so it contains
50% of the replies. The vertical line shows the median. The
whiskers are sized to contain 95% of the replies -- 2.5%
below the whiskers <br>
and 2.5% above.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">|----------[#####|##########]--------------------------------------------|
<br>
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ <br>
2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histogram <br>
Show a histrogram of the round-trip times. The width of the
window is taken as round-trip time from 0ms on the left to
the interval (the -i option, default 1000ms) on the <br>
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The height of the graph is
scaled so that the most-used buckets vertically fills the
line. The buckets are colored green up to and including the
80th percentile, yellow <br>
up to and including the 95th percentile and red for the
remainder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Audible bell. Print a ASCII
BEL character ( or 0x07) when a packet is received before
the timeout occurs. This can be useful in order to monitory
hosts&rsquo; connectivity <br>
without looking physically at the console, for example to
trace network cables (start audible beep, disconnect cable
N: if beep stops, the cable was in use) or to tell when a
<br>
host returns from a reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This relies on the terminal bell
to be functional. To enable the terminal bell, use the
following instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the visual bell
is disabled in your terminal emulator, with the +vb
commandline flag or the following in your .Xresources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTerm*visualBell: false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the PC speaker
module is loaded in your kernel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modprobe pcspkr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; X11 has the
terminal bell enabled:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xset b on; xset b 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; and finally, if
you are using PulseAudio, that the module-x11-bell module is
loaded with a pre-loaded sample defined in your pulseaudio
configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-sample-lazy x11-bell
/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga <br>
load-module module-x11-bell sample=x11-bell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P percent <br>
Configures the latency percentile to report. percent must be
a number between zero and 100, exclusively in both cases. In
general, defaults to 95. If -c is given and a <br>
number less than 20, this would be the same as the maximum.
In this case the default is chosen so that it excludes the
maximum, e.g. if -c 5 is given, the default is 80. The <br>
calculated percentile is based on the last 900 packets (15
minutes with the default interval).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z percent <br>
If any hosts have a drop rate higher than percent, where
percent is a number between zero and 100 inclusively, exit
with a non-zero exit status. Since it is not possible to
<br>
have a higher drop rate than 100%, passing this limit will
effectively disable the feature (the default). Setting the
option to zero means that the exit status will only be <br>
zero if all replies for all hosts have been received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status will indicate
the number of hosts with more than percent packets lost, up
to a number of 255 failing hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLORS <br>
If supported by the terminal, noping will highlight the
round-trip times (RTT) using the colors green, yellow and
red. Green signals RTTs that are in the &quot;expected&quot;
range, yellow <br>
marks moderately unusual times and times that differ a lot
from the expected value are printed in red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information used to
categorize round-trip times is the percentile. RTTs in the
80th percentile are considered to be &quot;normal&quot; and
are printed in green. RTTs within the 95th <br>
percentile are considered &quot;moderately unusual&quot; and
are printed in yellow. RTTs above that are considered to be
&quot;unusual&quot; and are printed in red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE KEYBOARD CONTROLS
<br>
When running noping, the type of graph being displayed can
be changed by using the g key. A new host can be added at
any time with the a key.</p>
