<p>PWMCONFIG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
PWMCONFIG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pwmconfig - tests the PWM outputs of sensors and configures
fancontrol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pwmconfig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
pwmconfig will attempt to stop your fans, one at a time, for
approximately 5 seconds each. This may cause your processor
temperature to rise. Verify that all fans are running at
<br>
normal speed after this program has exited. pwmconfig does
its best to check that the fans are spinning when they are
supposed to, but due to the diversity of available
mother&acirc; <br>
boards and fans, it shouldn&rsquo;t be blindly trusted.
Always verify by yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is strongly recommended to
run pwmconfig at a time when there is no significant system
load, to minimize the risk of overheating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pwmconfig searches your sensors for pulse width modulation
(PWM) controls, and tests each one to see if it controls a
fan on your motherboard. Note that many motherboards do not
<br>
have PWM circuitry installed, even if your sensor chip
supports PWM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a connection is established
between a PWM control and a fan, pwmconfig can generate a
detailed correlation, to show how a given fan is responding
to various PWM duty cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lastly, pwmconfig will enter in
fancontrol configuration mode (unless you decide to skip
that part.) In this mode, you are invited to enter several
parameters which will deter&acirc; <br>
mine how the fancontrol daemon regulates the speed of one or
more fans in your system based on temperature measurements.
In particular, you will have the opportunity to establish
<br>
mappings between fans and temperature inputs, define the
temperature range over which the speed of the fan should be
adjusted dynamically, the minimum speed at which the fan
<br>
should spin, etc. See fancontrol(8) for additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The term &quot;PWM&quot; is used because most fan control
systems in computers are based on pulse width modulation.
Some motherboards however use DC variation instead. So, the
term &quot;PWM&quot; <br>
should be seen as a generic term for &quot;fan speed
control&quot;, regardless of the actual method used.</p>
