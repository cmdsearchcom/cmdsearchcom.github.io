<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rkhunter - RootKit Hunter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rkhunter {--check | --unlock | --update | --versioncheck |
<br>
--propupd [{filename | directory | package name},...] | <br>
--list [tests | {lang | languages} | rootkits | perl | <br>
propfiles] | <br>
--config-check | --version | --help} [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rkhunter is a shell script which carries out various checks
on the local system to try and detect known rootkits and
malware. It also performs checks to see if commands have
been <br>
modified, if the system startup files have been modified,
and various checks on the network interfaces, including
checks for listening applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rkhunter has been written to be
as generic as possible, and so should run on most Linux and
UNIX systems. It is provided with some support scripts
should certain commands be <br>
missing from the system, and some of these are perl scripts.
rkhunter does require certain commands to be present for it
to be able to execute. Additionally, some tests require <br>
specific commands, but if these are not present then the
test will be skipped. rkhunter needs to be run under a
Bourne-type shell, typically bash or ksh. rkhunter can be
run as a <br>
cron job or from the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND OPTIONS <br>
If no command option is given, then --help is assumed.
rkhunter will return a non-zero exit code if any error or
warning occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --check <br>
This command option tells rkhunter to perform various checks
on the local system. The result of each test will be
displayed on stdout. If anything suspicious is found, <br>
then a warning will be displayed. A log file of the tests
and the results will be automatically produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is suggested that this
command option is run regularly in order to ensure that the
system has not been compromised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unlock <br>
This command option simply unlocks (removes) the lock file.
If this option is used on its own, then no log file is
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update <br>
This command option causes rkhunter to check if there is a
later version of any of its text data files. A command-line
web browser, for example wget or lynx, must be <br>
present on the system when using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is suggested that this
command option is run regularly in order to ensure that the
data files are kept up to date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used via cron,
then it is recommended that the --nocolors option is also
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exit code of zero for this
command option means that no updates were available. An exit
code of one means that a download error occurred, and a code
of two means that <br>
no error occurred but updates were available and have been
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--propupd [{filename | directory
| package name},...] <br>
One of the checks rkhunter performs is to compare various
current file properties of various commands, against those
it has previously stored. This command option causes <br>
rkhunter to update its data file of stored values with the
current values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filename option is used,
then it must either be a full pathname, or a plain file name
(for example, &rsquo;awk&rsquo;). When used, then only the
entry in the file properties <br>
database for that file will be updated. If the directory
option is used, then only those files listed in the database
that are in the given directory will be updated. Sim&acirc;
<br>
ilarly, if the package name option is used, then only those
files in the database which are part of the specified
package will be updated. The package name must be the <br>
base part of the name, no version numbers should be included
- for example, &rsquo;coreutils&rsquo;. Package names will,
of course, only be stored in the file properties database if
a <br>
package manager is being used. If a package name is the same
as a file name - for example, &rsquo;file&rsquo; could refer
to the &rsquo;file&rsquo; command or to the RPM
&rsquo;file&rsquo; package (which <br>
contains the &rsquo;file&rsquo; command) - the package name
will be used. If no specific option is given, then the
entire database is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: It is the users
responsibility to ensure that the files on the system are
genuine and from a reliable source. rkhunter can only report
if a file has changed, but <br>
not on what has caused the change. Hence, if a file has
changed, and the --propupd command option is used, then
rkhunter will assume that the file is genuine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--versioncheck <br>
This command option causes rkhunter to check if there is a
later version of the program. A command-line web browser
must be present on the system when using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used via cron,
then it is recommended that the --nocolors option is also
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exit code of zero for this
command option means that no new version was available. An
exit code of one means that an error occurred downloading
the latest version num&acirc; <br>
ber, and a code of two means that no error occurred but a
new version is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list [tests | {lang |
languages} | rootkits | perl | propfiles] <br>
This command option will list some of the supported
capabilities of the program, and then exit. The tests option
lists the currently available test names (see the README
<br>
file for more details about test names). The languages
option lists the currently available languages, and the
rootkits option lists the rootkits that are searched for by
<br>
rkhunter. The perl option lists the installation status of
the perl command and perl modules that may be used by some
of the tests. Note that it is not required to install <br>
these modules. However, if rkhunter is forced to use perl to
execute a test then the module must be present. The
propfiles option will list the file names that are used to
<br>
generate the file properties database. If no specific option
is given, then all the lists, except for the file properties
database, are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --config-check <br>
This command option causes rkhunter to check its
configuration file(s), and then exit. The program will run
through its normal configuration checks as specified by the
<br>
enable and disable options on the command-line and in the
configuration files. That is, only the configuration options
for tests which would normally run are checked. In <br>
order to check all the configured options, then use the
--enable all --disable none options on the command line.
Additionally, the program will check to see if there are
<br>
any unrecognised configuration options. If any configuration
problems are found, then they will be displayed and the
return code will be set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is suggested that this option
is used whenever the configuration file(s) have been
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
This command option causes rkhunter to display its version
number, and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
This command option displays the help screen menu, and then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
rkhunter uses a configuration file, named rkhunter.conf, for
many of its configuration options. It can also use a local
configuration file, named rkhunter.conf.local, and a <br>
directory named rkhunter.d if it is present. Both the local
configuration file, and the local directory, must be in the
same directory as the main configuration file. The in&acirc;
<br>
staller does not create the local file or directory, but
one, or both, can be created by the user if required. If a
directory is used, then within the directory any file ending
<br>
in .conf will be treated as a local configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options can also be
specified on the command-line, and these will override the
equivalent configuration file options. The configuration
file options are well documented <br>
within the main configuration file itself. The following are
the command-line options. The defaults mentioned here are
the program defaults, unless explicitly stated as the
con&acirc; <br>
figuration file default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--appendlog <br>
By default a new log file will be created when rkhunter
runs, and the previous log file will be renamed by having
.old appended to its name. This option tells rkhunter to
<br>
append to the existing log file. If the log file does not
exist, then it will be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bindir &lt;directory&gt;...
<br>
This option modifies which directories rkhunter looks in to
find the various commands it requires (that is, its PATH).
The default is the root PATH, and an internal list <br>
of some common command directories. By default a specified
directory will be appended to the default list. However, if
the directory name begins with the &rsquo;+&rsquo;
character, <br>
then it will be prepended to the list (that is, it will be
put at the start of the list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cs2, --color-set2 <br>
By default rkhunter will display its test results in color.
The colors used are green for successful tests, red for
failed tests (warnings), and yellow for skipped tests. <br>
These colors are visible when a black background is used,
but are difficult to see on a white background. This option
tells rkhunter to use a different color set which is <br>
more suited to a white background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--configfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
The installation process will automatically tell rkhunter
where its configuration file is located. However, if
necessary, this option can be used to specify a different
<br>
pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a local configuration file,
or directory, is to be used, then it must reside in the same
directory as the configuration file specified by this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cronjob <br>
This is similar to the --check command option, but it
disables several of the interactive options. When this
option is used --check, --nocolors and --skip-keypress are
<br>
assumed. By default no output is sent to stdout, so the
--report-warnings-only option may be useful with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbdir &lt;directory&gt; <br>
The installation process will automatically configure where
the data files are stored for rkhunter. However, if
necessary, this option can be used to specify a different
<br>
directory. The directory can be read-only, after
installation, provided that neither of the --update or
--propupd options are specified, and that the --versioncheck
option <br>
is not specified if ROTATE_MIRRORS is set to 1 in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
This is a special option mainly for the developers. It
produces no output on stdout. Regular logging will continue
as per default or as specified by the --logfile option, <br>
and the debug output will be in a randomly generated
filename which starts with /tmp/rkhunter-debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable
&lt;test&gt;[,&lt;test&gt;...] <br>
This option tells rkhunter not to run the specified tests.
Read the README file for more information about test names.
By default no tests are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display-logfile <br>
This option will cause the logfile to be displayed on the
screen once rkhunter has finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable
&lt;test&gt;[,&lt;test&gt;...] <br>
This option tells rkhunter to only run the specified tests.
If only one test name, other than all, is given, then the
--skip-keypress option is assumed. Read the README <br>
file for more information about test names. By default all
tests are enabled. All the test names are listed below under
TESTS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hash {MD5 | SHA1 | SHA224 |
SHA256 | SHA384 | SHA512 | <br>
NONE | &lt;command&gt;} <br>
Both the file properties check and the --propupd command
option will use a hash function to determine a files current
hash value. This option tells rkhunter which hash <br>
function to use. The MD5 and SHA options will look for the
relevant command, and, if not found, a perl support script
will then be used to see if a perl module supporting <br>
the function has been installed. Alternatively, a specific
command may be specified. A value of NONE can be used to
indicate that the hash values should not be obtained or <br>
used as part of the file properties check. The default is
SHA256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systems using prelinking must
use either MD5, SHA1 or NONE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lang, --language
&lt;language&gt; <br>
This option specifies which language to use for the
displayed tests and results. The currently supported
languages can be seen by the --list command option. The
default <br>
is en (English). If a message to be displayed cannot be
found in the language file, then the English version will be
used. As such, the English language file must always <br>
be present. The --update command option will update the
language files when new versions are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --logfile [file] <br>
By default rkhunter will write out a log file. The default
location of the file is /var/log/rkhunter.log. However, this
location can be changed by using this option. If <br>
/dev/null is specified as the log file, then no log file
will be written. If no specific file is given, then the
default will be used. By default rkhunter will create a <br>
new log file each time it is run. Any previously existing
logfile is moved out of the way, and has .old appended to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noappend-log <br>
This option reverts rkhunter to its default behaviour of
creating a new log file rather than appending to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocf <br>
This option is only valid when the command-line --disable
option is used. When the --disable option is used, by
default, the configuration file option to disable tests is
<br>
also used to determine which tests to run. If only the
--disable option is to be used to determine which tests to
run, then --nocf must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocolors <br>
This option causes the result of each test to not be
displayed in a specific color. The default color, usually
the reverse of the background color, will be used (typically
<br>
this is just black and white).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nolog <br>
This option tells rkhunter not to write anything to a log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nomow, --no-mail-on-warning
<br>
The configuration file has an option which will cause a
simple email message to be sent to a user should rkhunter
detect any warnings during system checks. This com&acirc;
<br>
mand-line option overrides the configuration file option,
and prevents an email message from being sent. The
configuration file default is not to email a message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ns, --nosummary <br>
When the --check command option is used, by default a short
summary of results is displayed at the end. This option
prevents the summary from being displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--novl, --no-verbose-logging
<br>
During some tests rkhunter will log a lot of information.
Use of this option reduces the amount of logging, and so can
improve the performance of rkhunter. However, the <br>
log file will contain less information should any warnings
occur. By default verbose logging is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pkgmgr {RPM | DPKG | BSD |
BSDng | SOLARIS | NONE} <br>
This option is used during the file properties check or when
the --propupd command option is given. It tells rkhunter
that the current file property values should be <br>
obtained from the relevant package manager. See the README
file for more details of this option. The default is NONE,
which means not to use a package manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
This option tells rkhunter not to display any output. It can
be useful when only the exit code is going to be checked.
Other options may be used with this one, to force <br>
only specific items to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rwo, --report-warnings-only
<br>
This option causes only warning messages to be displayed.
This can be useful when rkhunter is run via cron. Other
options may be used to force other items of information <br>
to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sk, --skip-keypress <br>
When the --check command option is used, after certain
sections of tests, the user will be prompted to press the
return key in order to continue. This option disables that
<br>
feature, and rkhunter will run until all the tests have
completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option has not been
given, and the user is prompted to press the return key, a
single &rsquo;s&rsquo; character, in upper- or lowercase,
may be given followed by the return <br>
key. rkhunter will then continue the tests without prompting
the user again (as if this option had been given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary <br>
This option will cause the summary of test results to be
displayed. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog [facility.priority]
<br>
When the --check command option is used, this option will
cause the start and finish times to be logged to syslog. The
default is not to log anything to syslog, but if the <br>
option is used, then the default level is
authpriv.notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tmpdir &lt;directory&gt; <br>
The installation process will automatically configure where
temporary files are to be created. However, if necessary,
this option can be used to specify a different direc&acirc;
<br>
tory. The directory must not be a symbolic link, and must be
secure (root access only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--vl, --verbose-logging <br>
This option tells rkhunter that when it runs some tests, it
should log as much information as possible. This can be
useful when trying to diagnose why a warning has <br>
occurred, but it obviously also takes more time. The default
is to use verbose logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --autox <br>
When this option is used, rkhunter will try and detect if
the X Window system is in use. If it is in use, then the
second color set will automatically be used (see the <br>
--color-set2 option). This allows rkhunter to be run on, for
example, a server console (where X is not present, so the
default color set should be used), and on a users <br>
terminal (where X is in use, so the second color set should
be used). In both cases rkhunter will use the correct color
set. The configuration file default is to try and <br>
detect X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --no-autox <br>
This option prevents rkhunter from automatically detecting
if the X Window system is being used. See the --autox
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTS <br>
[This section to be written]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">additional_rkts <br>
This test is for SHORT_EXPLANATION. It works as part of
GROUP. Corresponding configuration file entries: ONE=one,
TWO=two and for white-listing THREE=three,three. Simple <br>
globbing (/dev/shm/file-*) works.</p>
