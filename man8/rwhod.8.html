<p>RWHOD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual RWHOD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rwhod &acirc; system status server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rwhod [-bpa] [-u user]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rwhod is the server which maintains the database used by the
rwho(1) and ruptime(1) programs. Its operation is predicated
on the ability to broadcast messages on a network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rwhod operates as both a
producer and consumer of status information. As a producer
of information it periodically queries the state of the
system and constructs status messages <br>
which are broadcast on a network. As a consumer of
information, it listens for other rwhod servers&rsquo;
status messages, validating them, then recording them in a
collection of files <br>
located in the directory /var/spool/rwho.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server transmits and
receives messages at the port indicated in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;rwho&rsquo;&rsquo; service specification; see
services(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -b flag is supplied, only
broadcast interfaces, such as ethernets, will be used. If
the -p flag is supplied, only point-to-point interfaces will
be used. If the -a flag is <br>
supplied, or no flags are supplied, all interfaces will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -u flag is supplied,
rwhod will run as the specified user instead of as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The messages sent and received,
are of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct outmp { <br>
char out_line[8]; /* tty name */ <br>
char out_name[8]; /* user id */ <br>
long out_time; /* time on */ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct whod { <br>
char wd_vers; <br>
char wd_type; <br>
char wd_fill[2]; <br>
int wd_sendtime; <br>
int wd_recvtime; <br>
char wd_hostname[32]; <br>
int wd_loadav[3]; <br>
int wd_boottime; <br>
struct whoent { <br>
struct outmp we_utmp; <br>
int we_idle; <br>
} wd_we[1024 / sizeof (struct whoent)]; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All fields are converted to
network byte order prior to transmission. The load averages
are as calculated by the w(1) program, and represent load
averages over the 5, 10, and 15 <br>
minute intervals prior to a server&rsquo;s transmission;
they are multiplied by 100 for representation in an integer.
The host name included is that returned by the
gethostname(2) sys&acirc; <br>
tem call, with any trailing domain name omitted. The array
at the end of the message contains information about the
users logged in to the sending machine. This information
<br>
includes the contents of the utmp(5) entry for each non-idle
terminal line and a value indicating the time in seconds
since a character was last received on the terminal
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages received by the rwho
server are discarded unless they originated at an rwho
server&rsquo;s port. In addition, if the host&rsquo;s name,
as specified in the message, contains any <br>
unprintable ASCII characters, the message is discarded.
Valid messages received by rwhod are placed in files named
whod.hostname in the directory /var/spool/rwho. These files
<br>
contain only the most recent message, in the format
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status messages are generated
approximately once every 3 minutes. Rwhod recomputes the
system boot time every 30 minutes because on some
(non-Linux) systems it is not a totally <br>
reliable process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
rwho(1), ruptime(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There should be a way to relay status information between
networks. People often interpret the server dying or network
communtication failures as a machine going down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The rwhod command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
