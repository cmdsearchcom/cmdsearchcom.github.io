<b class="Nm" title="Nm">Rwhod</b> is the server which maintains the database
  used by the <a class="Xr" title="Xr">rwho(1)</a> and
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">ruptime(1)</a> programs. Its operation is predicated
  on the ability to <i class="Em" title="Em">broadcast</i> messages on a
  network.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b class="Nm" title="Nm">Rwhod</b> operates as both a producer and consumer of
  status information. As a producer of information it periodically queries the
  state of the system and constructs status messages which are broadcast on a
  network. As a consumer of information, it listens for other
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">rwhod</b> servers' status messages, validating them,
  then recording them in a collection of files located in the directory
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/var/spool/rwho</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The server transmits and receives messages at the port indicated in the ``rwho''
  service specification; see <a class="Xr" title="Xr">services(5)</a>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-b</b> flag is supplied, only broadcast
  interfaces, such as ethernets, will be used. If the
  <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-p</b> flag is supplied, only point-to-point
  interfaces will be used. If the <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-a</b> flag is
  supplied, or no flags are supplied, all interfaces will be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-u</b> flag is supplied, rwhod will run as the
  specified user instead of as root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The messages sent and received, are of the form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre class="Li">
struct	outmp { 
	char	out_line[8];		/* tty name */ 
	char	out_name[8];		/* user id */ 
	long	out_time;		/* time on */ 
}; 
 
struct	whod { 
	char	wd_vers; 
	char	wd_type; 
	char	wd_fill[2]; 
	int	wd_sendtime; 
	int	wd_recvtime; 
	char	wd_hostname[32]; 
	int	wd_loadav[3]; 
	int	wd_boottime; 
	struct	whoent { 
		struct	outmp we_utmp; 
		int	we_idle; 
	} wd_we[1024 / sizeof (struct whoent)]; 
};
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All fields are converted to network byte order prior to transmission. The load
  averages are as calculated by the <a class="Xr" title="Xr">w(1)</a> program,
  and represent load averages over the 5, 10, and 15 minute intervals prior to a
  server's transmission; they are multiplied by 100 for representation in an
  integer. The host name included is that returned by the
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">gethostname(2)</a> system call, with any trailing
  domain name omitted. The array at the end of the message contains information
  about the users logged in to the sending machine. This information includes
  the contents of the <a class="Xr" title="Xr">utmp(5)</a> entry for each
  non-idle terminal line and a value indicating the time in seconds since a
  character was last received on the terminal line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Messages received by the <a class="Xr" title="Xr">rwho</a> server are discarded
  unless they originated at an <a class="Xr" title="Xr">rwho</a> server's port.
  In addition, if the host's name, as specified in the message, contains any
  unprintable ASCII characters, the message is discarded. Valid messages
  received by <b class="Nm" title="Nm">rwhod</b> are placed in files named
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">whod.hostname</i> in the directory
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/var/spool/rwho</i>. These files contain only the
  most recent message, in the format described above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Status messages are generated approximately once every 3 minutes.
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">Rwhod</b> recomputes the system boot time every 30
  minutes because on some (non-Linux) systems it is not a totally reliable
  process.

There should be a way to relay status information between networks. People often
  interpret the server dying or network communtication failures as a machine
  going down.
