<p>SG_WRITE_LONG(8) SG3_UTILS SG_WRITE_LONG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_write_long - send SCSI WRITE LONG command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_write_long [--16] [--cor_dis] [--help] [--in=IF]
[--lba=LBA] [--pblock] [--verbose] [--version] [--wr_uncor]
[--xfer_len=BTL] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Send the SCSI WRITE LONG (10 or 16 byte) command to DEVICE.
The buffer to be written to the DEVICE is filled with 0xff
bytes or read from the IF file. This buffer includes the
<br>
logical data (e.g. 512 bytes) and the ECC bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can be used to
generate a MEDIUM ERROR at a specific logical block address.
This can be useful for testing error handling. Prior to such
a test, the sg_dd utility <br>
could be used to copy the original contents of the logical
block address to some safe location. After the test the
sg_dd utility could be used to write back the original
contents <br>
of the logical block address. An alternate strategy would be
to read the &quot;long&quot; contents of the logical block
address with sg_read_long utility prior to testing and
restore it <br>
with this utility after testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Take care: If recoverable errors
are being injected (e.g. only one or a few bits changed so
that the ECC is able to correct the data) then care should
be taken with the settings <br>
in the &quot;read write error recovery&quot; mode page.
Specifically if the ARRE (for reads) and/or AWRE (for
writes) are set then recovered errors will cause the lba to
be reassigned <br>
(and the old location to be added to the grown defect list
(PLIST)). This is not easily reversed and uses (one of the
finite number of) the spare sectors set aside for this
pur&acirc; <br>
pose. If in doubt it is probably safest to clear the ARRE
and AWRE bits. These bits can be checked and modified with
the sdparm utility. For example: &quot;sdparm -c AWRE,ARRE
<br>
/dev/sda&quot; will clear the bits until the disk is power
cycled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --16 <br>
send a SCSI WRITE LONG (16) command to DEVICE. The default
action (in the absence of this option) is to send a SCSI
WRITE LONG (10) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cor_dis <br>
sets the correction disabled (i.e &rsquo;COR_DIS&rsquo;)
bit. This inhibits various other mechanisms such as
automatic block reallocation, error recovery and various
informational <br>
exception conditions being triggered. This bit is relatively
new in SBC-3 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --in=IF <br>
read data (binary) from file named IF and use it for the
SCSI WRITE LONG command. If IF is &quot;-&quot; then stdin
is read. If this option is not given then 0xff bytes are
used as <br>
fill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lba=LBA <br>
where LBA is the logical block address of the sector to
overwrite. Defaults to lba 0 which is a dangerous block to
overwrite on a disk that is in use. Assumed to be in <br>
decimal unless prefixed with &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or has a
trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;. If LBA is larger than can fit in
32 bits then the --16 option should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pblock <br>
sets the physical block (i.e &rsquo;PBLOCK&rsquo;) bit. This
instructs DEVICE to use the given data (unless --wr_uncor is
also given) to write to the physical block specified by LBA.
<br>
The default action is to write to the logical block
corresponding to the given lba. This bit is relatively new
in SBC-3 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
output version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wr_uncor <br>
sets the &quot;write uncorrected&quot; (i.e
&rsquo;WR_UNCOR&rsquo;) bit. This instructs the DEVICE to
flag the given lba (or the physical block that contains it
if --pblock is also given) as <br>
having an unrecoverable error associated with it. Note: no
data is transferred to DEVICE, other than the command (i.e.
the cdb). In the absence of this option, the default <br>
action is to use the provided data or 0xff bytes
(--xfer_len=BTL in length) and write it to DEVICE. This bit
is relatively new in SBC-3 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --xfer_len=BTL <br>
where BTL is the byte transfer length (default to 520). If
the given value (or the default) does not match the
&quot;long&quot; block size of the device, nothing is
written to <br>
DEVICE and the appropriate xfer_len value may be deduced
from the error response which is printed (to stderr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Various numeric arguments (e.g. LBA) may include
multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the
&quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 10 byte SCSI WRITE LONG
command limits the logical block address to a 32 bit
quantity. For larger LBAs use the --16 option for the SCSI
WRITE LONG (16) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This section outlines setting up a block with corrupted
data, checking the error condition, then restoring useful
contents to that sector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, if the data in a sector
is important, save it with the sg_read_long utility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_read_long --lba=0x1234
--out=0x1234_1.img -x BTL /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility may need to be
executed several time in order to determine what the correct
value for BTL is. Next use this utility to
&quot;corrupt&quot; that sector. That might be done <br>
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_long --lba=0x1234 -x
BTL /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will write a sector (and
ECC data) of 0xff bytes. Some disks may reject this (at
least one of the author&rsquo;s does). Another approach is
to copy the 0x1234_1.img file (to <br>
0x1234_2.img in this example) and change some values with a
hex editor. Then write the changed image with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_long --lba=0x1234
--in=0x1234_2.img -x BTL /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yet another approach is to use
the --wr_uncor option, if supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_long --lba=0x1234
--wr_uncor /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next we use the sg_dd utility to
check that the sector is corrupted. Here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_dd if=/dev/sda blk_sgio=1
skip=0x1234 of=. bs=512 count=1 verbose=4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that the
&quot;blk_sgio=1&quot; option is given. This is to make sure
that the sector is read (and no others) and the error is
fully reported. The &quot;blk_sgio=1&quot; option causes the
<br>
SG_IO ioctl to be used by sg_dd rather than the block
subsystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally we should restore sector
0x1234 to a non-corrupted state. A sector full of zeros
could be written with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
blk_sgio=1 seek=0x1234 bs=512 count=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will result in a sector
(block) with 512 bytes of 0x0 without a MEDIUM ERROR since
the ECC and associated data will be regenerated and thus
well formed. The &rsquo;blk_sgio=1&rsquo; <br>
option is even more important in this case as it may stop
the block subsystem doing a read before write (since the
read will most likely fail). Another approach is to write
back <br>
the original contents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_long --lba=0x1234
--in=0x1234_1.img -x BTL /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_write_long is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
