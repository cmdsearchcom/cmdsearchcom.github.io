<p>BELKINUNV(8) NUT Manual BELKINUNV(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
belkinunv - Driver for Belkin &quot;Universal UPS&quot; and
compatible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the belkin driver. For information about the core driver,
see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
The belkinunv driver is known to work with the Belkin
Universal UPS models F6C800-UNV and F6C120-UNV, and is
expected to work with other Belkin Universal UPS models. The
driver <br>
only supports serial communication, not USB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Trust UPS and older Belkin
units are not supported by this driver, and neither are the
Belkin Home Office models (F6H500-SER and so forth).
However, some Belkin models, such <br>
as the Regulator Pro, are supported by the belkin(8) driver,
and the Home Office models are supported using the
genericups(8) driver with upstype=7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOFT SHUTDOWN WORKAROUND <br>
One problem with the Belkin Universal UPS is that it cannot
enter a soft shutdown (shut down the load until AC power
returns) unless the batteries are completely depleted. Thus,
<br>
one cannot just shut off the UPS after operating system
shutdown; it will not come back on when the power comes back
on. Therefore, the belkinunv driver should never be used
with <br>
the -k option. Instead, the -x wait option is provided as a
workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When called with the -x wait
option, belkinunv behaves as a standalone program (i.e., it
does not fork into the background). It performs one simple
task: it connects to the UPS, <br>
waits for AC power to return, and then exits with status
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is meant to be used in a
shutdown script as follows: during a shutdown, after all
filesystems have been remounted read-only, and just before
the system would normally be <br>
halted: check /etc/killpower (or similar) to see if this
shutdown was caused by upsmon(8), and if yes, call belkinunv
-x wait. If AC power comes back on, belkinunv exits, and
<br>
things should be arranged so that the system reboots in this
case. If AC power does not come back on, the UPS will
eventually run out of batteries, kill the computer&acirc;s
power <br>
supply, and go into soft shutdown mode, which means
everything will reboot properly when the power returns. In
either case, a deadlock is avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, if an optional
integer argument is given to the -x wait option, this causes
belkinunv to wait not only for AC power to be present, but
also for the battery charge to <br>
reach the given level. I use this as part of my startup
scripts, to ensure that the batteries are sufficiently
charged before the computer continues booting. This should
be put <br>
very early in the startup script, before any filesystems are
mounted read/write, and before any filesystem checks are
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several other -x options are
provided to fine-tune this behavior. See the options below
for detailed descriptions. See the examples below for
examples of how to use belkinunv in <br>
shutdown and startup scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
See also nutupsdrv(8) for generic options. Never use the -k
option with this driver; it does not work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x wait[=level] <br>
When this option is used, belkinunv does not fork into the
background, but behaves as a standalone program. It connects
to the UPS and waits until AC power is present. If <br>
level is specified, it also waits until the battery charge
reaches at least the given level in percent. Then, and only
then, belkinunv exits. In addition, while belkinunv <br>
runs in this mode, it displays a status line with
information on the UPS status and battery level. This is
intended for use in the computer&acirc;s shutdown and
startup scripts, as <br>
described under Soft Shutdown Workaround above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x nohang <br>
This option only has an effect when used in conjunction with
the -x wait option. It causes belkinunv to exit if a
connection with the UPS cannot be established or is lost,
<br>
instead of retrying forever, which is the default behavior.
The -x nohang option should be used in a startup script, to
ensure the computer remains bootable even if the UPS <br>
has been disconnected during the power failure (for
instance, you attached your computer to a generator, carried
it to a neighbor&acirc;s house, or whatever).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x flash <br>
This option only has an effect when used in conjunction with
the -x wait option. It causes the UPS load to be shut off
for a short time (&quot;flashed&quot;) just after the AC
power <br>
has returned and the requested battery level (if any) has
been attained. This is useful if slaves are attached to this
UPS; the flash will cause all of them to reboot. Note <br>
that, due to the design of the Belkin UPS hardware, the load
shutdown lasts ca. 1&acirc;2 minutes; a shorter flash cannot
be performed reliably. Also, the computers will reboot at
<br>
the scheduled time, on battery power if necessary, even if
AC power fails again in the meantime. This should not be a
problem, as your startup scripts can catch this <br>
situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x silent <br>
This option only has an effect when used in conjunction with
the -x wait option. It suppresses the status line which
belkinunv would normally print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x dumbterm <br>
This option only has an effect when used in conjunction with
the -x wait option. It changes the way in which belkinunv
prints its status line. Normally, terminal control <br>
sequences are used to overwrite the same line with new
status information, each time the status is updated. This
may not work on all terminals. If the -x dumbterm option is
<br>
given, each status update is written on a new line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES <br>
battery.charge, battery.runtime <br>
not supported by all hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battery.voltage,
battery.voltage.nominal, input.frequency,
input.frequency.nominal <br>
e.g. 60 for 60Hz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input.sensitivity <br>
writable: normal/medium/low</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input.transfer.high <br>
writable: high transfer voltage point in V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input.transfer.low <br>
writable: low transfer voltage point in V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input.voltage,
input.voltage.maximum, input.voltage.minimum,
input.voltage.nominal, output.frequency, output.voltage,
ups.beeper.status <br>
writable. Values: enabled/disabled/muted. This variable
controls the state of the panel beeper. Enabled means sound
when the alarm is present, disabled means never sound, and
<br>
muted means the sound is temporarily disabled until the
alarm would normally stop sounding. In the muted state, the
beeper is automatically turned back on at the next event
<br>
(AC failure, battery test, etc). Also, the beeper
can&acirc;t be turned off during a critical event (low
battery). Note that not all UPS models support the
&quot;disabled&quot; state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.firmware, ups.load,
ups.model, ups.power.nominal <br>
e.g. 800 for an 800VA system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.status <br>
a list of flags; see the status flags below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.temperature <br>
not supported by all hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.test.result,
ups.delay.restart <br>
time to restart (read only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.delay.shutdown <br>
time to shutdown (read only). This is always a multiple of
60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.type <br>
ONLINE/OFFLINE/LINEINT. This describes the basic layout of
this UPS (for GUI clients which want to draw an animated
picture of power flow). An offline UPS has a direct <br>
connection from AC input to AC output, and also a connection
from AC input to the battery, and from the battery to AC
output. An online UPS lacks the direct connection from <br>
AC input to AC output, whereas a line interactive UPS lacks
the connection from AC input to the battery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
beeper.enable, beeper.disable, beeper.mute <br>
Enable, disable or mute the panel beeper. Note that if the
beeper is muted, it is automatically turned back on at the
next event (AC failure, battery test, etc). Also, the <br>
beeper can&acirc;t be turned muted during a critical event
(low battery).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset.input.minmax <br>
Reset the variables input.voltage.minimum and
input.voltage.maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.reboot <br>
Shut down load immediately for about 1&acirc;2 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.reboot.graceful <br>
After 40 second delay, shut down load for about 1&acirc;2
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.stayoff <br>
Shut down load immediately and stay off. The only way it can
be turned back on is by manually pressing the front panel
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.battery.start,
test.battery.stop <br>
Start/stop 10 second battery test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.failure.start,
test.failure.stop <br>
Start/stop &quot;deep&quot; battery test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS FLAGS <br>
OB <br>
load is on battery, including during tests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OFF <br>
load is off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OL <br>
load is online</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACFAIL <br>
AC failure. Note that this refers to the AC input, and thus
it is not the same as &quot;OB&quot;. An AC failure can
occur at any time, for instance, during a battery test, or
when the <br>
UPS load is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVER <br>
overload</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERHEAT <br>
overheat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMFAULT <br>
UPS fault</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LB <br>
low battery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHRG <br>
charging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPLETED <br>
the battery is depleted. When the UPS raises this flag, it
simultaneously switches off the load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RB <br>
replace battery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here is an example for how belkinunv should be used in a
computer&acirc;s shutdown script. These commands should go
in the very last part of the shutdown script, after all file
systems <br>
have been mounted read-only, and just before the computer
halts. Note that belkinunv must be installed in a directory
which is still readable at that point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># NEAR END OF SHUTDOWN SCRIPT:
<br>
# if shutdown was caused by UPS, perform Belkin UPS
workaround. <br>
if [ -f /etc/killpower ] ; then <br>
echo &quot;Waiting for AC power, or for UPS batteries to run
out...&quot; <br>
/usr/bin/belkinunv -x wait /dev/ttyS1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># we get here if the power came
back on. Reboot. <br>
echo &quot;Power is back. Rebooting...&quot; <br>
reboot <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And here is an example of how to
use belkinunv in the startup script. These commands should
go near the beginning of the startup script, before any file
systems are mounted <br>
read/write, and before any file system integrity checks are
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># NEAR BEGINNING OF STARTUP
SCRIPT: <br>
# if we are recovering from a power failure, wait for the
UPS to <br>
# charge to a comfortable level before writing anything to
disk <br>
if [ -f /etc/killpower ] ; then <br>
echo &quot;Waiting for UPS battery charge to reach
60%...&quot; <br>
/usr/bin/belkinunv -x wait=60 -x nohang /dev/ttyS1 <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
When used normally, belkinunv forks into the background and
its diagnostics are the same as for all NUT drivers, see
nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with the -x wait
option, the exit status is normally 0. If the -x nohang
option has also been specified, an exit status of 1
indicates that communication with the UPS <br>
was lost. If the -x flash option has been specified, an exit
status of 2 indicates that the timed shutdown has
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver does not support any extra settings in
ups.conf(5).</p>
