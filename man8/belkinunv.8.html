belkinunv - Driver for Belkin &quot;Universal UPS&quot; and compatible
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE">NOTE</a></h1>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the belkin
  driver. For information about the core driver, see <b>nutupsdrv</b>(8).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUPPORTED_HARDWARE"><a class="selflink" href="#SUPPORTED_HARDWARE">SUPPORTED
  HARDWARE</a></h1>
The belkinunv driver is known to work with the Belkin Universal UPS models
  F6C800-UNV and F6C120-UNV, and is expected to work with other Belkin Universal
  UPS models. The driver only supports serial communication, not USB.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Trust UPS and older Belkin units are not supported by this driver, and
  neither are the Belkin Home Office models (F6H500-SER and so forth). However,
  some Belkin models, such as the Regulator Pro, are supported by the
  <b>belkin</b>(8) driver, and the Home Office models are supported using the
  <b>genericups</b>(8) driver with upstype=7.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOFT_SHUTDOWN_WORKAROUND"><a class="selflink" href="#SOFT_SHUTDOWN_WORKAROUND">SOFT
  SHUTDOWN WORKAROUND</a></h1>
One problem with the Belkin Universal UPS is that it cannot enter a soft
  shutdown (shut down the load until AC power returns) unless the batteries are
  completely depleted. Thus, one cannot just shut off the UPS after operating
  system shutdown; it will not come back on when the power comes back on.
  Therefore, the belkinunv driver should never be used with the <b>-k</b>
  option. Instead, the <b>-x wait</b> option is provided as a workaround.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When called with the <b>-x wait</b> option, <b>belkinunv</b> behaves as a
  standalone program (i.e., it does not fork into the background). It performs
  one simple task: it connects to the UPS, waits for AC power to return, and
  then exits with status 0.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is meant to be used in a shutdown script as follows: during a shutdown,
  after all filesystems have been remounted read-only, and just before the
  system would normally be halted: check /etc/killpower (or similar) to see if
  this shutdown was caused by <b>upsmon</b>(8), and if yes, call <b>belkinunv -x
  wait</b>. If AC power comes back on, <b>belkinunv</b> exits, and things should
  be arranged so that the system reboots in this case. If AC power does not come
  back on, the UPS will eventually run out of batteries, kill the
  computer&#x2019;s power supply, and go into soft shutdown mode, which means
  everything will reboot properly when the power returns. In either case, a
  deadlock is avoided.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In addition, if an optional integer argument is given to the <b>-x wait</b>
  option, this causes <b>belkinunv</b> to wait not only for AC power to be
  present, but also for the battery charge to reach the given level. I use this
  as part of my startup scripts, to ensure that the batteries are sufficiently
  charged before the computer continues booting. This should be put very early
  in the startup script, before any filesystems are mounted read/write, and
  before any filesystem checks are performed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Several other <b>-x</b> options are provided to fine-tune this behavior. See the
  options below for detailed descriptions. See the examples below for examples
  of how to use <b>belkinunv</b> in shutdown and startup scripts.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
See also <b>nutupsdrv</b>(8) for generic options. Never use the <b>-k</b> option
  with this driver; it does not work properly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x wait</b>[=<i>level</i>]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When this option is used, <b>belkinunv</b>
  does not fork into the background, but behaves as a standalone program. It
  connects to the UPS and waits until AC power is present. If <i>level</i> is
  specified, it also waits until the battery charge reaches at least the given
  level in percent. Then, and only then, <b>belkinunv</b> exits. In addition,
  while <b>belkinunv</b> runs in this mode, it displays a status line with
  information on the UPS status and battery level. This is intended for use in
  the computer&#x2019;s shutdown and startup scripts, as described under Soft
  Shutdown Workaround above.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x nohang</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option only has an effect when used in
  conjunction with the <b>-x wait</b> option. It causes <b>belkinunv</b> to exit
  if a connection with the UPS cannot be established or is lost, instead of
  retrying forever, which is the default behavior. The <b>-x nohang</b> option
  should be used in a startup script, to ensure the computer remains bootable
  even if the UPS has been disconnected during the power failure (for instance,
  you attached your computer to a generator, carried it to a neighbor&#x2019;s
  house, or whatever).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x flash</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option only has an effect when used in
  conjunction with the <b>-x wait</b> option. It causes the UPS load to be shut
  off for a short time (&quot;flashed&quot;) just after the AC power has
  returned and the requested battery level (if any) has been attained. This is
  useful if slaves are attached to this UPS; the flash will cause all of them to
  reboot. Note that, due to the design of the Belkin UPS hardware, the load
  shutdown lasts ca. 1&#x2014;2 minutes; a shorter flash cannot be performed
  reliably. Also, the computers will reboot at the scheduled time, on battery
  power if necessary, even if AC power fails again in the meantime. This should
  not be a problem, as your startup scripts can catch this situation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x silent</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option only has an effect when used in
  conjunction with the <b>-x wait</b> option. It suppresses the status line
  which <b>belkinunv</b> would normally print.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x dumbterm</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option only has an effect when used in
  conjunction with the <b>-x wait</b> option. It changes the way in which
  <b>belkinunv</b> prints its status line. Normally, terminal control sequences
  are used to overwrite the same line with new status information, each time the
  status is updated. This may not work on all terminals. If the <b>-x
  dumbterm</b> option is given, each status update is written on a new
  line.</div>

Here is an example for how <b>belkinunv</b> should be used in a
  computer&#x2019;s shutdown script. These commands should go in the very last
  part of the shutdown script, after all file systems have been mounted
  read-only, and just before the computer halts. Note that <b>belkinunv</b> must
  be installed in a directory which is still readable at that point.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
# NEAR END OF SHUTDOWN SCRIPT:
# if shutdown was caused by UPS, perform Belkin UPS workaround.
if [ -f /etc/killpower ] ; then
   echo &quot;Waiting for AC power, or for UPS batteries to run out...&quot;
   /usr/bin/belkinunv -x wait /dev/ttyS1
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
   # we get here if the power came back on. Reboot.
   echo &quot;Power is back. Rebooting...&quot;
   reboot
fi
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
And here is an example of how to use <b>belkinunv</b> in the startup script.
  These commands should go near the beginning of the startup script, before any
  file systems are mounted read/write, and before any file system integrity
  checks are done.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
# NEAR BEGINNING OF STARTUP SCRIPT:
# if we are recovering from a power failure, wait for the UPS to
# charge to a comfortable level before writing anything to disk
if [ -f /etc/killpower ] ; then
   echo &quot;Waiting for UPS battery charge to reach 60%...&quot;
   /usr/bin/belkinunv -x wait=60 -x nohang /dev/ttyS1
fi
</pre>
</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
When used normally, <b>belkinunv</b> forks into the background and its
  diagnostics are the same as for all NUT drivers, see <b>nutupsdrv</b>(8).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When used with the <b>-x wait</b> option, the exit status is normally <b>0</b>.
  If the <b>-x nohang</b> option has also been specified, an exit status of
  <b>1</b> indicates that communication with the UPS was lost. If the <b>-x
  flash</b> option has been specified, an exit status of <b>2</b> indicates that
  the timed shutdown has failed.
