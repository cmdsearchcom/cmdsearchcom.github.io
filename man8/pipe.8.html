<p>PIPE(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual PIPE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pipe - Postfix delivery to external command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pipe [generic Postfix daemon options]
command_attributes...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pipe(8) daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue
manager to deliver messages to external commands. This
program expects to be run from the master(8) process
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message attributes such as
sender address, recipient address and next-hop host name can
be specified as command-line macros that are expanded before
the external command is exe&acirc; <br>
cuted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pipe(8) daemon updates queue
files and marks recipients as finished, or it informs the
queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a later
time. Delivery status <br>
reports are sent to the bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8)
daemon as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY <br>
Some destinations cannot handle more than one recipient per
delivery request. Examples are pagers or fax machines. In
addition, multi-recipient delivery is undesirable when <br>
prepending a Delivered-to: or X-Original-To: message
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To prevent Postfix from sending
multiple recipients per delivery request, specify</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">transport_destination_recipient_limit
= 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in the Postfix main.cf file,
where transport is the name in the first column of the
Postfix master.cf entry for the pipe-based delivery
transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX <br>
The external command attributes are given in the master.cf
file at the end of a service definition. The syntax is as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chroot=pathname (optional) <br>
Change the process root directory and working directory to
the named directory. This happens before switching to the
privileges specified with the user attribute, and <br>
before executing the optional directory=pathname directive.
Delivery is deferred in case of failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory=pathname (optional)
<br>
Change to the named directory before executing the external
command. The directory must be accessible for the user
specified with the user attribute (see below). The <br>
default working directory is $queue_directory. Delivery is
deferred in case of failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eol=string (optional, default: 0
<br>
The output record delimiter. Typically one wouldor 0 The
usual C-style backslash escape sequences are use either
recognized: dd (up to three <br>
octal digits) and \.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flags=BDFORXhqu.&gt; (optional)
<br>
Optional message processing flags. By default, a message is
copied unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B Append a blank line at the end
of each message. This is required by some mail user agents
that recognize &quot;From &quot; lines only when preceded by
a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D Prepend a &quot;Delivered-To:
recipient&quot; message header with the envelope recipient
address. Note: for this to work, the
transport_destination_recipient_limit must be 1 <br>
(see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The D flag also enforces loop
detection (Postfix 2.5 and later): if a message already
contains a Delivered-To: header with the same recipient
address, then the mes&acirc; <br>
sage is returned as undeliverable. The address comparison is
case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F Prepend a &quot;From sender
time_stamp&quot; envelope header to the message content.
This is expected by, for example, UUCP software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O Prepend an
&quot;X-Original-To: recipient&quot; message header with the
recipient address as given to Postfix. Note: for this to
work, the transport_destination_recipi&acirc; <br>
ent_limit must be 1 (see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for
details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Prepend a Return-Path: message
header with the envelope sender address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Indicate that the external
command performs final delivery. This flag affects the
status reported in &quot;success&quot; DSN (delivery status
notification) messages, and <br>
changes it from &quot;relayed&quot; into
&quot;delivered&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Fold the command-line
$original_recipient and $recipient address domain part (text
to the right of the right-most @ character) to lower case;
fold the entire com&acirc; <br>
mand-line $domain and $nexthop host or domain information to
lower case. This is recommended for delivery via UUCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quote white space and other
special characters in the command-line $sender,
$original_recipient and $recipient address localparts (text
to the left of the right- <br>
most @ character), according to an 8-bit transparent version
of RFC 822. This is recommended for delivery via UUCP or
BSMTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result is compatible with
the address parsing of command-line recipients by the
Postfix sendmail(1) mail submission command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The q flag affects only entire
addresses, not the partial address information from the
$user, $extension or $mailbox command-line macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Fold the command-line
$original_recipient and $recipient address localpart (text
to the left of the right-most @ character) to lower case.
This is recommended for <br>
delivery via UUCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. Prepend &quot;.&quot; to lines
starting with &quot;.&quot;. This is needed by, for example,
BSMTP software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; Prepend &quot;&gt;&quot; to
lines starting with &quot;From &quot;. This is expected by,
for example, UUCP software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null_sender=replacement
(default: MAILER-DAEMON) <br>
Replace the null sender address (typically used for delivery
status notifications) with the specified text when expanding
the $sender command-line macro, and when generat&acirc; <br>
ing a From_ or Return-Path: message header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the null sender replacement
text is a non-empty string then it is affected by the q flag
for address quoting in command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The null sender replacement text
may be empty; this form is recommended for content filters
that feed mail back into Postfix. The empty sender address
is not affected by <br>
the q flag for address quoting in command-line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: a null sender address
is easily mis-parsed by naive software. For example, when
the pipe(8) daemon executes a command such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wrong: command -f$sender --
$recipient</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the command will mis-parse the
-f option value when the sender address is a null string.
For correct parsing, specify $sender as an argument by
itself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right: command -f $sender --
$recipient</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=size_limit (optional) <br>
Don&rsquo;t deliver messages that exceed this size limit (in
bytes); return them to the sender instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user=username (required)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user=username:groupname <br>
Execute the external command with the user ID and group ID
of the specified username. The software refuses to execute
commands with root privileges, or with the privi&acirc; <br>
leges of the mail system owner. If groupname is specified,
the corresponding group ID is used instead of the group ID
of username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argv=command... (required) <br>
The command to be executed. This must be specified as the
last command attribute. The command is executed directly,
i.e. without interpretation of shell meta characters <br>
by a shell command interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the command argument vector,
the following macros are recognized and replaced with
corresponding information from the Postfix queue manager
delivery request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the form ${name},
the forms $name and $(name) are also recognized. Specify $$
where a single $ is wanted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${client_address} <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${extension} <br>
This macro expands to the extension part of a recipient
address. For example, with an address user+foo@domain the
extension is foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A command-line argument that

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information is modified by
the hqu flags for quoting and case folding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${sasl_method} <br>
This macro expands to the name of the SASL authentication
mechanism in the AUTH command when the Postfix SMTP server

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is available as of
Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${sender} <br>
This macro expands to the envelope sender address. By
default, the null sender address expands to MAILER-DAEMON;
this can be changed with the null_sender attribute, <br>
as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information is modified by
the q flag for quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${size} <br>

size, which is an approximation of the size of the message
as delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${user} <br>
This macro expands to the username part of a recipient
address. For example, with an address user+foo@domain the
username part is user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A command-line argument that

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Command exit status codes are expected to follow the
conventions defined in &lt;sysexits.h&gt;. Exit status 0
means normal successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of a non-zero exit
status, a limited amount of command output is reported in an
delivery status notification. When the output begins with a
4.X.X or 5.X.X enhanced <br>
status code, the status code takes precedence over the
non-zero exit status (Postfix version 2.3 and later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Problems and transactions are
logged to syslogd(8). Corrupted message files are marked so
that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt queue
for further inspection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
This program needs a dual personality 1) to access the
private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms, and 2) to execute
external commands as the specified user. It is therefore
secu&acirc; <br>
rity sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS <br>
Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically as pipe(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the
command &quot;postfix reload&quot; to speed up a change.</p>
