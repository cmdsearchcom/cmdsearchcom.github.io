<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-keyfromlabel - DNSSEC key generation tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-keyfromlabel {-l label} [-3] [-a algorithm] [-A
date/offset] [-c class] [-D date/offset] [-E engine] [-f
flag] [-G] [-I date/offset] [-k] [-K directory] [-L ttl]
<br>
[-n nametype] [-P date/offset] [-p protocol] [-R
date/offset] [-t type] [-v level] [-y] {name}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnssec-keyfromlabel gets keys with the given label from a
crypto hardware and builds key files for DNSSEC (Secure
DNS), as defined in RFC 2535 and RFC 4034.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the key is specified
on the command line. This must match the name of the zone
for which the key is being generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a algorithm <br>
Selects the cryptographic algorithm. The value of algorithm
must be one of RSAMD5, RSASHA1, DSA, NSEC3RSASHA1, NSEC3DSA,
RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECCGOST, ECDSAP256SHA256 or <br>
ECDSAP384SHA384. These values are case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no algorithm is specified,
then RSASHA1 will be used by default, unless the -3 option
is specified, in which case NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used
instead. (If -3 is used and an <br>
algorithm is specified, that algorithm will be checked for
compatibility with NSEC3.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1
is a mandatory to implement algorithm, and DSA is
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 2: DH automatically sets
the -k flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 <br>
Use an NSEC3-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If
this option is used and no algorithm is explicitly set on
the command line, NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E engine <br>
Specifies the name of the crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine).
When compiled with PKCS#11 support it defaults to
&quot;pkcs11&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l label <br>
Specifies the label of the key pair in the crypto hardware.
The label may be preceded by an optional OpenSSL engine
name, separated by a colon, as in
&quot;pkcs11:keylabel&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nametype <br>
Specifies the owner type of the key. The value of nametype
must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)),
HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a host (KEY)),
<br>
USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or OTHER
(DNSKEY). These values are case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
Compatibility mode: generates an old-style key, without any
metadata. By default, dnssec-keyfromlabel will include the
key&rsquo;s creation date in the metadata stored with the
<br>
private key, and other dates may be set there as well
(publication date, activation date, etc). Keys that include
this data may be incompatible with older versions of BIND;
<br>
the -C option suppresses them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c class <br>
Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have
the specified class. If not specified, class IN is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f flag <br>
Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY
record. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key)
and REVOKE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G <br>
Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it. This
option is incompatible with -P and -A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
dnssec-keyfromlabel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K directory <br>
Sets the directory in which the key files are to be
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
Generate KEY records rather than DNSKEY records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L ttl <br>
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is
converted into a DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a
zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there
was <br>
already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing
TTL would take precedence. Setting the default TTL to 0 or
none removes it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p protocol <br>
Sets the protocol value for the key. The protocol is a
number between 0 and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC). Other
possible values for this argument are listed in RFC 2535 and
<br>
its successors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Indicates the use of the key. type must be one of AUTHCONF,
NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH
refers to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF <br>
the ability to encrypt data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v level <br>
Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y <br>
Allows DNSSEC key files to be generated even if the key ID
would collide with that of an existing key, in the event of
either key being revoked. (This is only safe to use if <br>
you are sure you won&rsquo;t be using RFC 5011 trust anchor
maintenance with either of the keys involved.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMING OPTIONS <br>
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;, it is interpreted as an
offset from the present time. For convenience, <br>
if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes
&rsquo;y&rsquo;, &rsquo;mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;w&rsquo;,
&rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;mi&rsquo;, then
the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour
days, ignoring leap years), <br>
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is
computed in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone.
After that date, the key will be included in the zone but
will not be used to sign it. If not set, and if the -G <br>
option has not been used, the default is
&quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After
that date, the key will be included in the zone and used to
sign it. If not set, and if the -G option has not been <br>
used, the default is &quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that
date, the key will be flagged as revoked. It will be
included in the zone and will be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that
date, the key will still be included in the zone, but it
will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that
date, the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It
may remain in the key repository, however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATED KEY FILES <br>
When dnssec-keyfromlabel completes successfully, it prints a
string of the form Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii to the standard output.
This is an identification string for the key files it has
<br>
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; nnnn is the key
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; aaa is the
numeric representation of the algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; iiiii is the key
identifier (or footprint).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-keyfromlabel creates two
files, with names based on the printed string.
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key contains the public key, and
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private contains the private <br>
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .key file contains a DNS KEY
record that can be inserted into a zone file (directly or
with a $INCLUDE statement).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .private file contains
algorithm-specific fields. For obvious security reasons,
this file does not have general read permission.</p>
