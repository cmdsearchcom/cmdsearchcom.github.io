<b>really</b> checks whether the caller is allowed, and if it is it changes its
  uids and gids (and perhaps root directory) according to the command line
  options and executes the specified command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no options are specified, the uid will be set to 0 and the gids and root
  directory will be left unchanged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no command is specified, <b>really</b> will run <b>$SHELL -i</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A caller is allowed if it has write access to <b>/etc/inittab</b> and is also
  member of the group <b>root</b>. This is most easily achieved by making
  inittab group-writeable by some suitable group containing all the appropriate
  users, and making <b>/etc/inittab</b> group-owned by that group and
  group-writeable. The root group is perhaps a good choice if it isn't being
  used for anything else.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS">SECURITY
  CONSIDERATIONS</a></h1>
<b>really</b> is designed so that installing it setuid root is extremely
  unlikely to compromise the security of any system. It will check using
  <b>access</b>(2) whether the real user is allowed to write to
  <b>/etc/inittab</b> and if this check fails <b>really</b> will exit without
  even attempting to parse its command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>really</b> is <b>not</b> designed to be resistant to malicious command line
  arguments. Do not allow untrusted processes to pass options to really, or to
  specify the command to be run. Whether it is safe to allow relatively
  untrusted processes to pass options to the command which is to be run depends
  on the behaviour of that command and its security status.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Attempting to use <b>really</b> to drop privilege is dangerous unless the
  calling environment is very well understood. There are many inherited process
  properties and resources which might be used by the callee to escalate its
  privilege to that of the (root-equivalent) caller. For this function, it is
  usually better to use <b>userv</b> if possible.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<b>really</b> does not manipulate the environment at all. The calling program is
  run in exactly the same environment as the caller passes to <b>really</b>. In
  particular, <b>really</b> will not add <b>sbin</b> directories to <b>PATH</b>
  so <b>really</b>-enabled accounts will usually need to have these directories
  on their configured <b>PATH</b> to start with.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SHELL</b> is used to find the default shell to use in interactive mode (ie,
  when no command is specified).
