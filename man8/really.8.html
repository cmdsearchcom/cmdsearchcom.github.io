<p>really(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual really(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
really - gain privilege or run commands a different user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
really [options] [command args... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
really checks whether the caller is allowed, and if it is it
changes its uids and gids (and perhaps root directory)
according to the command line options and executes the
speci&acirc; <br>
fied command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no options are specified, the
uid will be set to 0 and the gids and root directory will be
left unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no command is specified,
really will run $SHELL -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A caller is allowed if it has
write access to /etc/inittab and is also member of the group
root. This is most easily achieved by making inittab
group-writeable by some suitable <br>
group containing all the appropriate users, and making
/etc/inittab group-owned by that group and group-writeable.
The root group is perhaps a good choice if it isn&rsquo;t
being used <br>
for anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-u username | --user username <br>
Sets the uid, gid, and supplementary group list, according
to username&rsquo;s entry in the password and group
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i username | --useronly
username <br>
Sets only the uid according to username&rsquo;s entry in the
password database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I uid | --uidonly uid <br>
Sets the uid to the numeric value uid (which need not
correspond to any existing user in the password
database).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g groupname | --group groupname
<br>
groupname is looked up in the group database and its gid is
appended to the process&rsquo;s supplementary groups list.
If this is the first gid specified it will also be set as
<br>
the primary gid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G gid | --gid gid <br>
gid is appended to the process&rsquo;s supplementary groups
list. (gid need not correspond to any existing group in the
group database.) If this is the first gid specified it <br>
will also be set as the primary gid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z | --groupsclear <br>
Clears the process&rsquo;s supplementary groups list. When
using this option you must also specify -g or -G. The
process&rsquo;s groups will then be exactly those specified.
The <br>
relative position of -z in the argument list is not
relevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R root-dir | --chroot root-dir
<br>
The program will have its root directory set to
root-dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use this option unless
you know what you are doing: Unlike chroot(8), the current
working directory will remain unchanged. This means that if
the current directory <br>
isn&rsquo;t underneath the specified new root, the program
will still be able to access files outside the new root by
using relative pathnames. If this isn&rsquo;t what you want,
<br>
please use the chroot utility instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Indicates the end of the
options. The next argument (if present) will be interpreted
as the command name, even if it starts with a hyphen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
really is designed so that installing it setuid root is
extremely unlikely to compromise the security of any system.
It will check using access(2) whether the real user is <br>
allowed to write to /etc/inittab and if this check fails
really will exit without even attempting to parse its
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">really is not designed to be
resistant to malicious command line arguments. Do not allow
untrusted processes to pass options to really, or to specify
the command to be run. <br>
Whether it is safe to allow relatively untrusted processes
to pass options to the command which is to be run depends on
the behaviour of that command and its security status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempting to use really to drop
privilege is dangerous unless the calling environment is
very well understood. There are many inherited process
properties and resources which <br>
might be used by the callee to escalate its privilege to
that of the (root-equivalent) caller. For this function, it
is usually better to use userv if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
really does not manipulate the environment at all. The
calling program is run in exactly the same environment as
the caller passes to really. In particular, really will not
add <br>
sbin directories to PATH so really-enabled accounts will
usually need to have these directories on their configured
PATH to start with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL is used to find the
default shell to use in interactive mode (ie, when no
command is specified).</p>
