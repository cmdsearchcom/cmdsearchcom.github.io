<p>NETPLUGD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
NETPLUGD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
netplugd &acirc; network cable hotplug management daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
netplugd [-FP] [-c config_file] [-i interface_pattern] [-p
pid_file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
netplugd is a daemon that responds to network link events
from the Linux kernel, such as a network interface losing or
acquiring a carrier signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an Ethernet-style network
interface on a host is plugged into a powered-up switch,
hub, or other host, the two use a carrier signal to
establish that the link is alive. The <br>
Linux kernel makes this information available through its
netlink(7) interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The netplugd daemon listens for
carrier detection and loss messages from the kernel&rsquo;s
netlink(7) subsystem. When a carrier signal is detected on
an interface, it runs a script to <br>
bring the interface up. When carrier is lost, netplugd runs
a script to bring the interface down. netplugd does not
define any policies for how to manage interfaces; it leaves
<br>
that to a script, /etc/netplug.d/netplug, which is described
in FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You tell netplugd which
interfaces it should manage by giving it a list of
shell-style glob patterns, which it matches against using
the fnmatch(3) function. For example, a pat&acirc; <br>
tern of eth[13] will tell netplugd to only manage eth1 and
eth3, if those interfaces exist. If the interfaces are not
known to the kernel at the time you start netplugd, perhaps
<br>
because they are unplugged PCMCIA network interfaces or
devices whose drivers have not yet been installed, netplugd
will start to manage them as soon as they are plugged in or
<br>
their drivers are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-F Run in the foreground; do not detach and run as a daemon.
Messages are logged to stdout or stderr, instead of using
the syslog(3) mechanism. This option is useful mainly <br>
for debugging your configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Prevent autoprobing for
interfaces. The netplugd daemon normally probes for all
possible interface names that might match the patterns you
tell it to manage. This is nec&acirc; <br>
essary in order to get network driver modules (the default
with almost all Linux distributions) loaded and set up, so
that they can provide link status notifications to the <br>
netplugd daemon. Autoprobing should always be safe, and
doesn&rsquo;t take long. Disable it with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config_file <br>
Specify the name of a file from which to read patterns that
describe the interfaces to manage. You can provide this
option multiple times to read from more than one file. <br>
If you do not provide this option at all, netplugd will
attempt to read from a default config file. If you do not
want netplugd to try to read from any real config files,
<br>
you can specify /dev/null as a config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface_pattern <br>
Specify a pattern that will be used to match interface names
that netplugd should manage. You can provide this option
multiple times to specify multiple patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid_file <br>
Write the daemon&rsquo;s process ID to the file pid_file. If
you tell netplugd to run in the foreground, this option is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/netplug.d/netplugd.conf <br>
Default config file to read, if none is specified on the
command line. The config file format is one pattern per
line, with white space, empty lines, and comments starting
<br>
with a # character ignored. Patterns are standard
shell-style glob patterns, e.g. &quot;eth[0-9]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/netplug.d/netplug <br>
The &quot;policy&quot; program (typically a shell script)
that netplugd uses to probe for interfaces, and to bring
them up or down in response to network link events. This
program <br>
is called with the name of the interface as its first
argument, and one of the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in A cable was plugged in, or
carrier came up. The command should bring the interface up.
The command is run asynchronously, and it should exit with
status 0 on suc&acirc; <br>
cess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">out A cable was plugged out, or
carrier went down. The command should bring the interface
down. The command is run asynchronously, and it should exit
with status 0 on <br>
success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">probe The command should load
and initialise the driver for this interface, if possible,
and bring the interface into the &quot;up&quot; state, so
that it can generate netlink(7) <br>
events. The command is run synchronously; it must exit with
status code 0 if it succeeds, otherwise with a non-zero exit
code or signal.</p>
