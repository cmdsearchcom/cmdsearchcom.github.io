<p>PAM_SSH(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
PAM_SSH(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_ssh &acirc; authentication and session management with
SSH private keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
[service-name] module-type control-flag pam_ssh
[options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The SSH authentication service module for PAM, pam_ssh
provides functionality for two PAM categories:
authentication and session management. In terms of the
module-type parameter, <br>
they are the &acirc;auth&acirc; and &acirc;session&acirc;
features. It also provides null functions for the remaining
categories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH Authentication Module <br>
The SSH authentication component verifies the identity of a
user by prompting the user for a passphrase and verifying
that it can decrypt at least one of the user&rsquo;s SSH
login (or <br>
authentication) keys using that passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user&rsquo;s SSH login keys
must be either located or symbolically linked into the
per-user dedicated folder ~/.ssh/login-keys.d/ in the
user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options may be
passed to the authentication module: <br>
debug syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.
<br>
use_first_pass <br>
If the authentication module is not the first in the stack,
and a previous module obtained the user&rsquo;s password,
that password is used to decrypt the user&rsquo;s SSH login
keys. <br>
If this fails, then the authentication module returns
failure without prompting the user for a passphrase. <br>
try_first_pass <br>
Similar to the use_first_pass option, except that if the
previously obtained password fails to decrypt any of the SSH
login keys, then the user is prompted for an SSH <br>
passphrase. <br>
nullok Allow SSH keys with no passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither use_first_pass nor
try_first_pass is specified, pam_ssh will unconditionally
ask for an SSH passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The now deprecated name
allow_blank_passphrase for nullok is kept for compatibility
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH Session Management Module
<br>
The SSH session management component initiates sessions by
launching an SSH agent, passing it any user&rsquo;s SSH
login keys successfully decrypted during the authentication
phase and <br>
any additional user SSH session keys successfully decrypted,
and sets dedicated environment variables accordingly; the
environment variable TMPDIR, which can be set through the
<br>
pam_tmpdir module for instance, is also honoured by being
passed to the SSH agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SSH session management
component terminates the session by killing the previously
launched SSH agent by sending it a SIGTERM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The traditional SSH keys
~/.ssh/identity, ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa,
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, and ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 are considered as the
default SSH session keys. Nonetheless, extra <br>
user SSH session keys can be either located or symbolically
linked into the per-user dedicated folder
~/.ssh/session-keys.d/ in the user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provided that they have been
successfully decrypted, the SSH session management passes to
the launched SSH agent first the session SSH keys in lexical
order, second the login SSH <br>
keys in lexical order, and finally the traditional SSH keys
in the reverse order cited above. Since the SSH agent keeps
in its memory for each passed key its first position (but
<br>
its last comment), each SSH key rank can be easily
overwritten with an appropriate symbolic link placed in
~/.ssh/session-keys.d/ or ~/.ssh/login-keys.d/; this is
especially true <br>
for the traditional SSH keys. The involved lexical order is
performed against the SSH key file basenames (according to
the C/POSIX locale character collation rules). Because <br>
actually their basenames are passed as comments, their
effective order might be easily checked with an appropriate
SSH agent helper as ssh-add(3). As final remark, keep in
mind <br>
that the SSH agent may place itself SSH keys with protocol 1
before SSH keys with protocol 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option may be
passed to the session management module: <br>
debug syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INFORMATION LEAKS <br>
Be careful with the using the try_first_pass option when
pam_ssh is the first authentication module because it will
then leak information about existing users without login
keys: <br>
such users will not be asked for a specific SSH passphrase,
whereas non-existing users and existing users with login
keys will be asked for a passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.ssh/ <br>
This directory is the default per-user location for all
user-specific SSH configuration and SSH authentication
information as expected by SSH and its friends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/identity <br>
~/.ssh/id_rsa <br>
~/.ssh/id_dsa <br>
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa <br>
~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <br>
Contains the traditional private key for authentication.
These files contain sensitive data and should be readable by
the user but not accessible by others: any tradi&acirc; <br>
tional private key file that is accessible by others is
simply ignored. While the SSH authentication component
ignores the traditional private keys, the SSH session
man&acirc; <br>
agement component passes any successfully decrypted
traditional key to the launched SSH agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/login-keys.d/ <br>
This directory is the dedicated per-user location for files
or symbolic links to files that contains SSH private keys
considered by the SSH authentication component. <br>
pam_ssh ignores any private key file that is accessible by
others or that possesses .disabled or .frozen as suffix.
Each login key successfully decrypted is passed by the <br>
SSH session management component to the launched SSH
agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/session-keys.d/ <br>
This directory is the dedicated per-user location for files
or symbolic links to files that contains (extra) SSH private
keys considered only by the SSH session management <br>
component. pam_ssh ignores any private key file that is
accessible by others or that possesses .disabled or .frozen
as suffix. Each session key successfully decrypted is <br>
passed to the launched SSH agent.</p>
