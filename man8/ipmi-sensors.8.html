<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipmi-sensors - display IPMI sensor information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmi-sensors [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ipmi-sensors displays current readings of sensors and sensor
data repository (SDR) information. The default display
outputs each sensor&rsquo;s record id, sensor name, sensor
type <br>
name, sensor reading (if appropriate), and the current
sensor event. More verbose information can be found using
the verbose options specified below. Ipmi-sensors does not
<br>
inform the user if a problem exists with a particular sensor
because sensor readings and events are not analyzed by
default. Users may wish to use the --output-sensor-state
<br>
option to output the analyzed sensor state. Some sensors may
have a sensor reading or sensor event of &quot;N/A&quot; if
the information is unavailable. This is typical of a sensor
that <br>
is not enabled or not owned by a BMC. Please see
--bridge-sensors option below to deal with sensors not owned
by a BMC. Sensors may output a sensor event of
&quot;Unknown&quot; if the sen&acirc; <br>
sor reading cannot be read. This is typical of a sensor that
is busy or a reading that cannot be calculated. If sensors
report &quot;Unrecognized State&quot;, it is indicative of
an unkown <br>
sensor type, typically an OEM sensor. If the sensor OEM
interpretation is available, the --interpret-oem-data may be
able to report the appropriate sensor state. Sensors need
not <br>
always report a sensor event. When a sensor event is not
present, &quot;OK&quot; is typically reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are general IPMI
options, tool specific options, trouble shooting
information, workaround information, examples, and known
issues. For a general introduction to <br>
FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7). To perform IPMI sensor
configuration, please see ipmi-sensors-config(8). To perform
some advanced SDR management, please see bmc-device(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
The following options are general options for configuring
IPMI communication and executing general tool commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D IPMIDRIVER,
--driver-type=IPMIDRIVER <br>

requests to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...,
--hostname=IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMIHOST2[:PORT],... <br>
Specify the remote host(s) to communicate with. Multiple
hostnames may be separated by comma or may be specified in a
range format; see HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below. An <br>
optional port can be specified with each host, which may be
useful in port forwarding or similar situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
<br>
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the
remote host. If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous)
username is assumed. The user must have atleast OPERATOR
<br>
privileges in order for this tool to operate fully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<br>
Specify the password to use when authenticationg with the
remote host. If not specified, a null password is assumed.
Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for <br>
IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --password-prompt <br>
Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in
process lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k K_G, --k-g=K_G <br>
Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the
remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not specified, a null key is
assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix <br>
the string with &rsquo;0x&rsquo;. E.g., the key
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; can be entered with the either the string
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; or the string &rsquo;0x616263&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --k-g-prompt <br>
Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to
20000 milliseconds (20 seconds) if not specified.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the packet retransmission timeout in milliseconds.
Defaults to 1000 milliseconds (1 second) if not specified.
The retransmission timeout cannot be larger than the <br>
session timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a AUTHENTICATION-TYPE,
--authentication-type=AUTHENTICATION-TYPE <br>
Specify the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The
currently available authentication types are NONE,
STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I CIPHER-SUITE-ID,
--cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID <br>
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0
communi&acirc; <br>
cation. The authentication algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signa&acirc; <br>
tures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The following cipher suite <br>
ids are currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Authentication Algorithm =
None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
= None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Authentication Algorithm =

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l PRIVILEGE-LEVEL,
--privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL <br>
Specify the privilege level to be used. The currently
available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-file=FILE <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W WORKAROUNDS,
--workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS <br>
Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
command line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
work&acirc; <br>
arounds (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Turn on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI-SENSORS OPTIONS <br>
The following options are specific to Ipmi-sensors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Output verbose sensor output. This option will output
additional information about sensors such as thresholds,
ranges, numbers, and event/reading type codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Output very verbose sensor
output. This option will output more additional information
than the verbose option such as information about events,
other sensor types, and <br>
oem sensors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --sdr-info <br>
Show sensor data repository (SDR) information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet-readings <br>
Do not output sensor reading values by default. This option
is particularly useful if you want to use hostranged output
across a cluster and want to consolidate the out&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r RECORD-IDS-LIST,
--record-ids=RECORD-IDS-LIST <br>
Specify sensors to show by record id. Multiple record ids
can be separated by commas or spaces. If both --record-ids
and --sensor-types are specified, --record-ids takes <br>
precedence. A special command line record id of
&quot;all&quot;, will indicate all record ids should be
shown (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R RECORD-IDS-LIST,
--exclude-record-ids=RECORD-IDS-LIST <br>
Specify sensors to not show by record id. Multiple record
ids can be separated by commas or spaces. A special command
line record id of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no record
ids <br>
should be excluded (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t SENSOR-TYPE-LIST,
--sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST <br>
Specify sensor types to show outputs for. Multiple types can
be separated by commas or spaces. If both --record-ids and
--sensor-types are specified, --record-ids takes <br>
precedence. A special command line type of &quot;all&quot;,
will indicate all types should be shown (may be useful for
overriding configured defaults). Users may specify sensor
<br>
types by string (see --list-sensor-types below) or by number
(decimal or hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T SENSOR-TYPE-LIST,
--exclude-sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST <br>
Specify sensor types to not show outputs for. Multiple types
can be eparated by commas or spaces. A special command line
type of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no types should be
<br>
excluded (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
Users may specify sensor types by string (see
--list-sensor-types below) or by number (decimal or
hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --list-sensor-types <br>
List sensor types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bridge-sensors <br>
By default, sensors readings are not attempted for sensors
on non-BMC owners. By setting this option, sensor requests
can be bridged to non-BMC owners to obtain sensor <br>
readings. Bridging may not work on some interfaces/driver
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shared-sensors <br>
Some sensors share the same sensor data record (SDR). This
is typically utilized for system event log (SEL) entries and
not for sensor readings. However, there may be some <br>
motherboards in which this format is utilized for multiple
active sensors, or the user simply has interest in seeing
the permutation of entries shared by a SDR entry. By <br>
setting this option, each sensor number shared by a record
will be iterated over and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interpret-oem-data <br>
Attempt to interpret OEM data, such as event data, sensor
readings, or general extra info, etc. If an OEM
interpretation is not available, the default output will be
gen&acirc; <br>
erated. Correctness of OEM interpretations cannot be
guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors may make in
products, firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION below for
<br>
confirmed supported motherboard interpretations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-not-available-sensors
<br>
Ignore not-available (i.e. N/A) sensors in output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-unrecognized-events
<br>
Ignore unrecognized sensor events. This will suppress output
of unrecognized events, typically shown as
&rsquo;Unrecognized Event = XXXXh&rsquo; in output. In
addition, unrecognized <br>
events will be ignored when calculating sensor state with
--output-sensor-state below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-event-bitmask <br>
Output event bitmask value instead of the string
representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-sensor-state <br>
Output sensor state in output. This will add an additional
output reporting if a sensor is in a NOMINAL, WARNING, or
CRITICAL state. The sensor state is an interpreted <br>
value based on the current sensor event. The sensor state
interpretations are determined by the configuration file
/etc/freeipmi//freeipmi_interpret_sensor.conf. See <br>
freeipmi_interpret_sensor.conf(5) for more information. This
option gives identical output to the sensor state previously
output by ipmimonitoring(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sensor-state-config-file=FILE
<br>
Specify an alternate sensor state configuration file. Option
ignored if --output-sensor-state not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--entity-sensor-names <br>
Output sensor names prefixed with their entity id and
instance number when appropriate. This may be necessary on
some motherboards to help identify what sensors are
refer&acirc; <br>
encing. For example, a motherboard may have multiple sensors
named &rsquo;TEMP&rsquo;. The entity id and instance number
may help clarify which sensor refers to &quot;Processor
1&quot; vs. <br>
&quot;Processor 2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-sensor-thresholds <br>
Output sensor thresholds in output. This will add columns to
the default output for lower non-recoverable, lower
critical, lower non-critical, upper non-critical, upper <br>
critical, and upper non-recoverable thresholds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sensor-type-output <br>
Do not show sensor type output for each entry. On many
systems, the sensor type is redundant to the name of the
sensor. This can especially be true if --entity-sen&acirc;
<br>
sor-names is specified. If the sensor name is sufficient, or
if the sensor type is of no interest to the user, this
option can be specified to condense output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--comma-separated-output <br>
Output fields in comma separated format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-header-output <br>
Do not output column headers. May be useful in
scripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-abbreviated-units <br>
Output non-abbreviated units (e.g. &rsquo;Amps&rsquo;
instead of &rsquo;A&rsquo;). May aid in disambiguation of
units (e.g. &rsquo;C&rsquo; for Celsius or Coulombs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--legacy-output <br>
Output in legacy format. Newer options may not be applicable
to legacy output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipmimonitoring-legacy-output
<br>
Output legacy format of legacy ipmimonitoring tool. Newer
options may not be applicable to legacy output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SDR CACHE OPTIONS <br>
This tool requires access to the sensor data repository
(SDR) cache for general operation. By default, SDR data will
be downloaded and cached on the local machine. The following
<br>
options apply to the SDR cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --flush-cache <br>
Flush a cached version of the sensor data repository (SDR)
cache. The SDR is typically cached for faster subsequent
access. However, it may need to be flushed and re-gen&acirc;
<br>
erated if the SDR has been updated on a system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --quiet-cache <br>
Do not output information about cache creation/deletion. May
be useful in scripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sdr-cache-recreate <br>
If the SDR cache is out of date or invalid, automatically
recreate the sensor data repository (SDR) cache. This option
may be useful for scripting purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sdr-cache-file=FILE <br>
Specify a specific sensor data repository (SDR) cache file
to be stored or read from. If this option is used when
multiple hosts are specified, the same SDR cache file <br>
will be used for all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sdr-cache-directory=DIRECTORY
<br>
Specify an alternate directory for sensor data repository
(SDR) caches to be stored or read from. Defaults to the home
directory if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED OPTIONS <br>
The following options manipulate hostranged output. See
HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information on
hostranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --buffer-output <br>
Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard
output until the node has completed its IPMI operation. When
specifying this option, data may appear to output <br>
slower to the user since the the entire IPMI operation must
complete before any data can be output. See HOSTRANGED
SUPPORT below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --consolidate-output <br>
Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output
from every node specified will be consolidated so that nodes
with identical output are not output twice. A <br>
header will list those nodes with the consolidated output.
When this option is specified, no output can be seen until
the IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If <br>
the user breaks out of the program early, all currently
consolidated output will be dumped. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F NUM, --fanout=NUM <br>
Specify multiple host fanout. A &quot;sliding window&quot;
(or fanout) algorithm is used for parallel IPMI
communication so that slower nodes or timed out nodes will
not impede par&acirc; <br>
allel communication. The maximum number of threads available
at the same time is limited by the fanout. The default is
64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --eliminate <br>
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by ipmidetect. This
attempts to remove the common issue of hostranged execution
timing out due to several nodes being removed <br>
from service in a large cluster. The ipmidetectd daemon must
be running on the node executing the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--always-prefix <br>
Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or
communicating in-band. This option is primarily useful for
scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if speci&acirc;
<br>
fied with the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED SUPPORT <br>
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma
separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the
general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt;
k, etc. The <br>
later form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19]
does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a
<br>
degenerate range: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This range syntax is meant only
as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming
convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list <br>
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of range usage
follow: <br>
foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 <br>
foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10 <br>
foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a reminder to the reader,
some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern
matching. Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to
enclose ranged lists within <br>
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple hosts are
specified by the user, a thread will be executed for each
host in parallel up to the configured fanout (which can be
adjusted via the -F option). This <br>
will allow communication to large numbers of nodes far more
quickly than if done in serial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, standard output from
each node specified will be output with the hostname
prepended to each line. Although this output is readable in
many situations, it may be dif&acirc; <br>
ficult to read in other situations. For example, output from
multiple nodes may be mixed together. The -B and -C options
can be used to change this default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In-band IPMI Communication will
be used when the host &quot;localhost&quot; is specified.
This allows the user to add the localhost into the
hostranged output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN problems involve a
misconfiguration of the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double
check to make sure the following are configured properly in
the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC: IP <br>
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connec&acirc; <br>
tions, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration <br>
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inband IPMI problems are
typically caused by improperly configured drivers or
non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are many of the
common issues for error messages. For additional support,
please e-mail the &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;username invalid&quot; -

generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. <br>
During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The
K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is
not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level
insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher user
privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may <br>
require authenticating to a different user which has a
higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level cannot be
obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege level you are
attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
allowed for this user. Please try <br>
again with a lower privilege. It may also be possible the
maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try <br>
again with an alternate authentication type or alternate
privilege level. It may also be possible the available
authentication types you can authenticate with are not
correctly <br>
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher suite id
unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may <br>
also be possible the available cipher suite ids are not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
- IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please
try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection timeout&quot; -
Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of potential
errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be <br>
resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the
network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration
and connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;session timeout&quot; -
The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect. If this
error occurs often, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are con&acirc; <br>
siderably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;device not found&quot; -
The specified device could not be found. Please check
configuration or inputs and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;message timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC busy&quot; - The BMC
is currently busy. It may be processing information or have
too many simultaneous sessions to manage. Please wait and
try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;could not find inband
device&quot; - An inband device could not be found. Please
check configuration or specify specific device or driver on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; - The
inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC
or service processor. The BMC or service processor may be
busy or (worst case) possibly non- <br>
functioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;internal IPMI error&quot;
- An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how
to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to
report the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;sensor config file parse
error&quot; - A parse error was found in the sensor
interpretation configuration file. Please see
freeipmi_interpret_sensor.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKAROUNDS <br>
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI
solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of
work&acirc; <br>
arounds currently available to handle discovered compliance
issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so
they will be transparent to the user. However, some will
<br>
require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardware listed below may
only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on.
Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
below. Similar machines from <br>
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds <br>
listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe your hardware has
an additional compliance issue that needs a workaround to be
implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or <br>
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumeio - This workaround flag
will assume inband interfaces communicate with system I/O
rather than being memory-mapped. This will work around
systems that report invalid base <br>
addresses. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;device not
supported&quot; or &quot;could not find inband device&quot;
errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spinpoll - This workaround flag
will inform some inband drivers (most notably the KCS
driver) to spin while polling rather than putting the
process to sleep. This may signifi&acirc; <br>
cantly improve the wall clock running time of tools because
an operating system scheduler&rsquo;s granularity may be
much larger than the time it takes to perform a single IPMI
message <br>
transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool
for a more useful task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authcap - This workaround flag
will skip early checks for username capabilities,
authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
authentication to succeed. It works <br>
around multiple issues in which the remote system does not
properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see <br>
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel <br>
SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochecksumcheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums <br>
due to implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise
valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes validation of packet integrity in a number of
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most
situations. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification time&acirc; <br>
out&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
&quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too.
Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F,
and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idzero - This workaround flag
will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client.
It works around IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs
to the client. Those hitting <br>
this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpectedauth - This workaround
flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked
as though they were expected. It works around an issue when
packets contain non-null <br>
authentication data when they should be null due to disabled
per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell
Pow&acirc; <br>
erEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forcepermsg - This workaround
flag will force per-message authentication to be used no
matter what is advertised by the remote system. It works
around an issue when per-message <br>
authentication is advertised as disabled on the remote
system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue <br>
observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endianseq - This workaround flag
will flip the endian of the session sequence numbers to
allow the session to continue properly. It works around IPMI
1.5 session sequence numbers <br>
that are the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noauthcodecheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command
responses. It works around systems that return <br>
invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the validity <br>
of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is
unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting this issue
may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session
timeout&quot;, or &quot;password veri&acirc; <br>
fication timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Xyratex
FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intel20 - This workaround flag
will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
password truncation if the <br>
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with <br>
Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermicro20 - This workaround
flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0
authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI
firmware. The issues covered include han&acirc; <br>
dling invalid length authentication codes. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors.
Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card.
Confirmed <br>
fixed on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sun20 - This workaround flag
will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and <br>
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround <br>
automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot;
workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opensesspriv - This workaround
flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s IPMI 2.0
connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing
algorithm used by the remote system. The privi&acirc; <br>
lege level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those
hit&acirc; <br>
ting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;,
&quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status
code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500
with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu <br>
II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and
Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is
automatically trig&acirc; <br>
gered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integritycheckvalue - This
workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check
value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity <br>
check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermi&acirc; <br>
cro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumemaxsdrrecordcount - This
workaround will inform SDR reading to stop reading after a
known maximum numer of SDR records have been read. This will
work around systems that <br>
have mis-implemented SDR reading functions that. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;SDR record count
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on unspecified Inspur
motherboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discretereading - This
workaround option will allow analog sensor readings (i.e.
rpm, degrees, etc.) to be read even if the event/reading
type code for the sensor is for a dis&acirc; <br>
crete sensor (i.e. assert vs. deassert). This option works
around poorly defined (and arguably illegal) SDR records
that expect analog sensor readings to be read alongside
dis&acirc; <br>
crete sensors. This option is confirmed to work around
issues on HP Proliant DL380 G7 and HP ProLiant ML310 G5
motherboards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignorescanningdisabled - This
workaround option will allow sensor readings to be read even
if the sensor scanning bit indicates a sensor is disabled.
This option works around <br>
motherboards that incorrectly indicate sensors as disabled.
This may problem may exist on your motherboard if sensors
are listed as &quot;N/A&quot; even if they should be
available. This <br>
option is confirmed to work around issues on Dell Poweredge
2900, Dell Poweredge 2950, Dell Poweredge R410, Dell
Poweredge R610, and HP Integrity rx3600 motherboards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumebmcowner - This workaround
option will allow sensor readings to be read if the sensor
owner is the BMC, but the reported sensor owner is not the
BMC. Typically, sensors <br>
owned by a non-BMC sensor owner must be bridged (e.g. with
the --bridge-sensors option), however if the non-BMC sensor
owner is invalid, bridging fails. This option works around
<br>
motherboards that incorrectly report an non-BMC sensor owner
by always assuming the sensor owner is the BMC. This problem
may exist on your motherboard if sensors are listed as <br>
&quot;N/A&quot; even if they should be available. This
option is confirmed to work around issues on Fujitsu RX300
and Fujitsu RX300S2 motherboards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreauthcode - This workaround
option will allow sensor readings to be read if the remote
machine is invalidly calculating authentication codes (i.e.
authentication hashes) <br>
when communicating over LAN. This problem may exist on your
system if the error &quot;session timeout&quot; errors or
there is an appearance of a hang. Users are cautioned on the
use of <br>
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the validity of a packet. However, in most organizations,
this is unlikely to be a security issue. The ignoring of
<br>
authentication packets is only limited to the period in
which sensor readings are done, and not for any portion of
the session authentication or session teardown. This option
is <br>
confirmed to work on Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II and
Inventec 5442/Dell Xanadu III. (Note: On the above systems,
this issue has only been observed when the --bridge-sensors
is <br>
used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some
motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not
support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection <br>
timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be worked around by
using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
--driver-type=LAN_2_0. Issue observed on HP Proliant DL
145.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OEM INTERPRETATION <br>
The following motherboards are confirmed to have atleast
some support by the --interpret-oem-data option. While
highly probable the OEM data interpretations would work
across <br>
other motherboards by the same manufacturer, there are no
guarantees. Some of the motherboards below may be rebranded
by vendors/distributors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
On older operating systems, if you input your username,
password, and other potentially security relevant
information on the command line, this information may be
discovered by <br>
other users when using tools like the ps(1) command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K <br>
options. Configuring security relevant information in the
FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way
to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent brute force
attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock up&quot;
after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need
to wait awhile in order to this tempo&acirc; <br>
rary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may authenticate
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some sensors may be output as
not available (i.e. N/A) because the owner of the sensor is
not the BMC. To attempt to bridge sensors and access sensors
not on the BMC, users may <br>
wish to try the -b or --bridge-sensors options.</p>
