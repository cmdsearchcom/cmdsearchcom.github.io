profile - Profile CPU usage by sampling stack traces. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.

This is a CPU profiler. It works by taking samples of stack traces at timed
  intervals. It will help you understand and quantify CPU usage: which code is
  executing, and by how much, including both user-level and kernel code.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default this samples at 49 Hertz (samples per second), across all CPUs. This
  frequency can be tuned using a command line option. The reason for 49, and not
  50, is to avoid lock-step sampling.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is also an efficient profiler, as stack traces are frequency counted in
  kernel context, rather than passing each stack to user space for frequency
  counting there. Only the unique stacks and counts are passed to user space at
  the end of the profile, greatly reducing the kernel&lt;-&gt;user transfer.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note: if another perf-based sampling session is active, the output may become
  polluted with their events. On older kernels, the ouptut may also become
  polluted with tracing sessions (when the kprobe is used instead of the
  tracepoint). This may be filtered in a future version if it becomes a problem.

CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This also requires Linux 4.6+ (BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE support), and the
  perf:perf_hrtimer tracepoint (currently a kernel patch). If the latter is
  unavailable, this will try to use kprobes as a fallback (of
  perf_misc_flags()), which may work or may not, depending on your kernel build.
  If the kprobe doesn't work, this tool will either error on instrumentation,
  or, instrument successfully but generate no output.

See &quot;[unknown]&quot; frames with bogus addresses? This can happen for
  different reasons. Your best approach is to get Linux perf to work first, and
  then to try this tool. Eg, &quot;perf record -F 49 -a -g -- sleep 1; perf
  script&quot;, and to check for unknown frames there.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The most common reason for &quot;[unknown]&quot; frames is that the target
  software has not been compiled with frame pointers, and so we can't use that
  simple method for walking the stack. The fix in that case is to use software
  that does have frame pointers, eg, gcc -fno-omit-frame-pointer, or Java's
  -XX:+PreserveFramePointer.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Another reason for &quot;[unknown]&quot; frames is JIT compilers, which don't
  use a traditional symbol table. The fix in that case is to populate a
  /tmp/perf-PID.map file with the symbols, which this tool should read. How you
  do this depends on the runtime (Java, Node.js).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you seem to have unrelated samples in the output, check for other sampling or
  tracing tools that may be running. The current version of this tool can
  include their events if profiling happened concurrently. Those samples may be
  filtered in a future version.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERHEAD"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERHEAD">OVERHEAD</a></h1>
This is an efficient profiler, as stack traces are frequency counted in kernel
  context, and only the unique stacks and their counts are passed to user space.
  Contrast this with the current &quot;perf record -F 99 -a&quot; method of
  profiling, which writes each sample to user space (via a ring buffer), and
  then to the file system (perf.data), which must be post-processed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This uses perf_event_open to setup a timer which is instrumented by BPF, and for
  efficiency it does not initialize the perf ring buffer, so the redundant perf
  samples are not collected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It's expected that the overhead while sampling at 49 Hertz (the default), across
  all CPUs, should be negligible. If you increase the sample rate, the overhead
  might begin to be measurable.
