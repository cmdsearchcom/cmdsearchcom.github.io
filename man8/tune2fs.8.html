<p>TUNE2FS(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual TUNE2FS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tune2fs - adjust tunable filesystem parameters on
ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems</p>

directory ] [ -O [^]feature[,...] ] [ -Q quota-options ] [
-T time-last-checked ] [ -U UUID ] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tune2fs allows the system administrator to adjust various
tunable filesystem parameters on Linux ext2, ext3, or ext4
filesystems. The current values of these options can be
dis&acirc; <br>
played by using the -l option to tune2fs(8) program, or by
using the dumpe2fs(8) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device specifier can either
be a filename (i.e., /dev/sda1), or a LABEL or UUID
specifier: &quot;LABEL=volume-name&quot; or
&quot;UUID=uuid&quot;. (i.e., LABEL=home or
UUID=e40486c6-84d5-4f2f- <br>
b99c-032281799c9d).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c max-mount-counts <br>
Adjust the number of mounts after which the filesystem will
be checked by e2fsck(8). If max-mount-counts is 0 or -1, the
number of times the filesystem is mounted will be <br>
disregarded by e2fsck(8) and the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Staggering the mount-counts at
which filesystems are forcibly checked will avoid all
filesystems being checked at one time when using journaled
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should strongly consider the
consequences of disabling mount-count-dependent checking
entirely. Bad disk drives, cables, memory, and kernel bugs
could all corrupt a <br>
filesystem without marking the filesystem dirty or in error.
If you are using journaling on your filesystem, your
filesystem will never be marked dirty, so it will not <br>
normally be checked. A filesystem error detected by the
kernel will still force an fsck on the next reboot, but it
may already be too late to prevent data loss at that <br>
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the -i option for
time-dependent checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C mount-count <br>
Set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted. If
set to a greater value than the max-mount-counts parameter
set by the -c option, e2fsck(8) will check the <br>
filesystem at the next reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e error-behavior <br>
Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are
detected. In all cases, a filesystem error will cause
e2fsck(8) to check the filesystem on the next boot. error-
<br>
behavior can be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue Continue normal
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remount-ro Remount filesystem
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">panic Cause a kernel panic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E extended-options <br>
Set extended options for the filesystem. Extended options
are comma separated, and may take an argument using the
equals (&rsquo;=&rsquo;) sign. The following extended
options are <br>
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear_mmp <br>
Reset the MMP block (if any) back to the clean state. Use
only if absolutely certain the device is not currently
mounted or being fscked, or major filesystem <br>
corruption can result. Needs &rsquo;-f&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmp_update_interval=interval
<br>
Adjust the initial MMP update interval to interval seconds.
Specifying an interval of 0 means to use the default
interval. The specified interval must be <br>
less than 300 seconds. Requires that the mmp feature be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stride=stride-size <br>
Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stride-size
filesystem blocks. This is the number of blocks read or
written to disk before moving to next disk. <br>
This mostly affects placement of filesystem metadata like
bitmaps at mke2fs(2) time to avoid placing them on a single
disk, which can hurt the performance. It <br>
may also be used by block allocator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stripe_width=stripe-width <br>
Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stripe-width
filesystem blocks per stripe. This is typically be
stride-size * N, where N is the number of data <br>
disks in the RAID (e.g. RAID 5 N+1, RAID 6 N+2). This allows
the block allocator to prevent read-modify-write of the
parity in a RAID stripe if possible when <br>
the data is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_alg=hash-alg <br>
Set the default hash algorithm used for filesystems with
hashed b-tree directories. Valid algorithms accepted are:
legacy, half_md4, and tea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount_opts=mount_option_string
<br>
Set a set of default mount options which will be used when
the file system is mounted. Unlike the bitmask-based default
mount options which can be specified <br>
with the -o option, mount_option_string is an arbitrary
string with a maximum length of 63 bytes, which is stored in
the superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ext4 file system driver will
first apply the bitmask-based default options, and then
parse the mount_option_string, before parsing the mount
options passed <br>
from the mount(8) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This superblock setting is only
honored in 2.6.35+ kernels; and not at all by the ext2 and
ext3 file system drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test_fs <br>
Set a flag in the filesystem superblock indicating that it
may be mounted using experimental kernel code, such as the
ext4dev filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^test_fs <br>
Clear the test_fs flag, indicating the filesystem should
only be mounted using production-level filesystem code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force the tune2fs operation
to complete even in the face of errors. This option is
useful when removing the has_journal filesystem feature from
a filesystem which has an <br>
external journal (or is corrupted such that it appears to
have an external journal), but that external journal is not
available. If the filesystem appears to require <br>
journal replay, the -f flag must be specified twice to
proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Removing an external
journal from a filesystem which was not cleanly unmounted
without first replaying the external journal can result in
severe data loss and <br>
filesystem corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g group <br>
Set the group which can use the reserved filesystem blocks.
The group parameter can be a numerical gid or a group name.
If a group name is given, it is converted to a <br>
numerical gid before it is stored in the superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i
interval-between-checks[d|m|w] <br>
Adjust the maximal time between two filesystem checks. No
suffix or d will interpret the number
interval-between-checks as days, m as months, and w as
weeks. A value of <br>
zero will disable the time-dependent checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is strongly recommended that
either -c (mount-count-dependent) or -i (time-dependent)
checking be enabled to force periodic full e2fsck(8)
checking of the filesystem. <br>
Failure to do so may lead to filesystem corruption (due to
bad disks, cables, memory, or kernel bugs) going unnoticed,
ultimately resulting in data loss or corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Add an ext3 journal to the
filesystem. If the -J option is not specified, the default
journal parameters will be used to create an appropriately
sized journal (given the <br>
size of the filesystem) stored within the filesystem. Note
that you must be using a kernel which has ext3 support in
order to actually make use of the journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used to create
a journal on a mounted filesystem, an immutable file,
.journal, will be created in the top-level directory of the
filesystem, as it is the <br>
only safe way to create the journal inode while the
filesystem is mounted. While the ext3 journal is visible, it
is not safe to delete it, or modify it while the
filesys&acirc; <br>
tem is mounted; for this reason the file is marked
immutable. While checking unmounted filesystems, e2fsck(8)
will automatically move .journal files to the invisible,
<br>
reserved journal inode. For all filesystems except for the
root filesystem, this should happen automatically and
naturally during the next reboot cycle. Since the root <br>
filesystem is mounted read-only, e2fsck(8) must be run from
a rescue floppy in order to effect this transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some distributions, such as
Debian, if an initial ramdisk is used, the initrd scripts
will automatically convert an ext2 root filesystem to ext3
if the /etc/fstab file <br>
specifies the ext3 filesystem for the root filesystem in
order to avoid requiring the use of a rescue floppy to add
an ext3 journal to the root filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J journal-options <br>
Override the default ext3 journal parameters. Journal
options are comma separated, and may take an argument using
the equals (&rsquo;=&rsquo;) sign. The following journal
options <br>
are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=journal-size <br>
Create a journal stored in the filesystem of size
journal-size megabytes. The size of the journal must be at
least 1024 filesystem blocks (i.e., 1MB if using <br>
1k blocks, 4MB if using 4k blocks, etc.) and may be no more
than 102,400 filesystem blocks. There must be enough free
space in the filesystem to create a <br>
journal of that size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">device=external-journal <br>
Attach the filesystem to the journal block device located on
external-journal. The external journal must have been
already created using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mke2fs -O journal_dev
external-journal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that external-journal must
be formatted with the same block size as filesystems which
will be using it. In addition, while there is support for
attaching <br>
multiple filesystems to a single external journal, the Linux
kernel and e2fsck(8) do not currently support shared
external journals yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of specifying a device
name directly, external-journal can also be specified by
either LABEL=label or UUID=UUID to locate the external
journal by <br>
either the volume label or UUID stored in the ext2
superblock at the start of the journal. Use dumpe2fs(8) to
display a journal device&rsquo;s volume label and <br>
UUID. See also the -L option of tune2fs(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one of the size or device
options can be given for a filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the contents of the
filesystem superblock, including the current values of the
parameters that can be set via this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L volume-label <br>
Set the volume label of the filesystem. Ext2 filesystem
labels can be at most 16 characters long; if volume-label is
longer than 16 characters, tune2fs will truncate it <br>
and print a warning. The volume label can be used by
mount(8), fsck(8), and /etc/fstab(5) (and possibly others)
by specifying LABEL=volume_label instead of a block
spe&acirc; <br>
cial device name like /dev/hda5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m reserved-blocks-percentage
<br>
Set the percentage of the filesystem which may only be
allocated by privileged processes. Reserving some number of
filesystem blocks for use by privileged processes is <br>
done to avoid filesystem fragmentation, and to allow system
daemons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to function
correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented <br>
from writing to the filesystem. Normally, the default
percentage of reserved blocks is 5%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M last-mounted-directory <br>
Set the last-mounted directory for the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o [^]mount-option[,...] <br>
Set or clear the indicated default mount options in the
filesystem. Default mount options can be overridden by mount
options specified either in /etc/fstab(5) or on the <br>
command line arguments to mount(8). Older kernels may not
support this feature; in particular, kernels which predate
2.4.20 will almost certainly ignore the default mount <br>
options field in the superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More than one mount option can
be cleared or set by separating features with commas. Mount
options prefixed with a caret character (&rsquo;^&rsquo;)
will be cleared in the filesys&acirc; <br>
tem&rsquo;s superblock; mount options without a prefix
character or prefixed with a plus character
(&rsquo;+&rsquo;) will be added to the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following mount options can
be set or cleared using tune2fs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Enable debugging code for
this filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsdgroups <br>
Emulate BSD behavior when creating new files: they will take
the group-id of the directory in which they were created.
The standard System V behavior is the <br>
default, where newly created files take on the fsgid of the
current process, unless the directory has the setgid bit
set, in which case it takes the gid from <br>
the parent directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it
is a directory itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_xattr <br>
Enable user-specified extended attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acl Enable Posix Access Control
Lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid16 Disables 32-bit UIDs and
GIDs. This is for interoperability with older kernels which
only store and expect 16-bit values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_data <br>
When the filesystem is mounted with journalling enabled, all
data (not just metadata) is committed into the journal prior
to being written into the main <br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_data_ordered <br>
When the filesystem is mounted with journalling enabled, all
data is forced directly out to the main file system prior to
its metadata being committed to the <br>
journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_data_writeback <br>
When the filesystem is mounted with journalling enabled,
data may be written into the main filesystem after its
metadata has been committed to the journal. <br>
This may increase throughput, however, it may allow old data
to appear in files after a crash and journal recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nobarrier <br>
The file system will be mounted with barrier operations in
the journal disabled. (This option is currently only
supported by the ext4 file system driver in <br>
2.6.35+ kernels.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block_validity <br>
The file system will be mounted with the block_validity
option enabled, which causes extra checks to be performed
after reading or writing from the file sys&acirc; <br>
tem. This prevents corrupted metadata blocks from causing
file system damage by overwriting parts of the inode table
or block group descriptors. This comes <br>
at the cost of increased memory and CPU overhead, so it is
enabled only for debugging purposes. (This option is
currently only supported by the ext4 file sys&acirc; <br>
tem driver in 2.6.35+ kernels.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard <br>
The file system will be mounted with the discard mount
option. This will cause the file system driver to attempt to
use the trim/discard feature of some stor&acirc; <br>
age devices (such as SSD&rsquo;s and thin-provisioned drives
available in some enterprise storage arrays) to inform the
storage device that blocks belonging to <br>
deleted files can be reused for other purposes. (This option
is currently only supported by the ext4 file system driver
in 2.6.35+ kernels.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodelalloc <br>
The file system will be mounted with the nodelalloc mount
option. This will disable the delayed allocation feature.
(This option is currently only supported <br>
by the ext4 file system driver in 2.6.35+ kernels.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O [^]feature[,...] <br>
Set or clear the indicated filesystem features (options) in
the filesystem. More than one filesystem feature can be
cleared or set by separating features with commas. <br>
Filesystem features prefixed with a caret character
(&rsquo;^&rsquo;) will be cleared in the filesystem&rsquo;s
superblock; filesystem features without a prefix character
or prefixed with a <br>
plus character (&rsquo;+&rsquo;) will be added to the
filesystem. For a detailed description of the file system
features, please see the man page ext4(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following filesystem
features can be set or cleared using tune2fs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir_index <br>
Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups for large
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir_nlink <br>
Allow more than 65000 subdirectories per directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extent Enable the use of extent
trees to store the location of data blocks in inodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extra_isize <br>
Enable the extended inode fields used by ext4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filetype <br>
Store file type information in directory entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flex_bg <br>
Allow bitmaps and inode tables for a block group to be
placed anywhere on the storage media. Tune2fs will not
reorganize the location of the inode tables and <br>
allocation bitmaps, as mke2fs(8) will do when it creates a
freshly formatted file system with flex_bg enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has_journal <br>
Use a journal to ensure filesystem consistency even across
unclean shutdowns. Setting the filesystem feature is
equivalent to using the -j option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">huge_file <br>
Support files larger than 2 terabytes in size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large_file <br>
Filesystem can contain files that are greater than 2GB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize_inode <br>
Reserve space so the block group descriptor table may grow
in the future. Tune2fs only supports clearing this
filesystem feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmp Enable or disable multiple
mount protection (MMP) feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sparse_super <br>
Limit the number of backup superblocks to save space on
large filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uninit_bg <br>
Allow the kernel to initialize bitmaps and inode tables
lazily, and to keep a high watermark for the unused inodes
in a filesystem, to reduce e2fsck(8) time. <br>
This first e2fsck run after enabling this feature will take
the full time, but subsequent e2fsck runs will take only a
fraction of the original time, depending <br>
on how full the file system is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After setting or clearing
sparse_super, uninit_bg, filetype, or resize_inode
filesystem features, e2fsck(8) must be run on the filesystem
to return the filesystem to a <br>
consistent state. Tune2fs will print a message requesting
that the system administrator run e2fsck(8) if necessary.
After setting the dir_index feature, e2fsck -D can be <br>
run to convert existing directories to the hashed B-tree
format. Enabling certain filesystem features may prevent the
filesystem from being mounted by kernels which do <br>
not support those features. In particular, the uninit_bg and
flex_bg features are only supported by the ext4
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p mmp_check_interval <br>
Set the desired MMP check interval in seconds. It is 5
seconds by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r reserved-blocks-count <br>
Set the number of reserved filesystem blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q quota-options <br>
Sets &rsquo;quota&rsquo; feature on the superblock and works
on the quota files for the given quota type. Quota options
could be one or more of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[^]usrquota <br>
Sets/clears user quota inode in the superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[^]grpquota <br>
Sets/clears group quota inode in the superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T time-last-checked <br>
Set the time the filesystem was last checked using e2fsck.
The time is interpreted using the current (local) timezone.
This can be useful in scripts which use a Logical <br>
Volume Manager to make a consistent snapshot of a
filesystem, and then check the filesystem during off hours
to make sure it hasn&rsquo;t been corrupted due to hardware
prob&acirc; <br>
lems, etc. If the filesystem was clean, then this option can
be used to set the last checked time on the original
filesystem. The format of time-last-checked is the <br>
international date format, with an optional time specifier,
i.e. YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]. The keyword now is also accepted,
in which case the last checked time will be set <br>
to the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem blocks.
user can be a numerical uid or a user name. If a user name
is given, it is converted to a numerical uid before <br>
it is stored in the superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U UUID <br>
Set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the
filesystem to UUID. The format of the UUID is a series of
hex digits separated by hyphens, like this: <br>
&quot;c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16&quot;. The UUID
parameter may also be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear clear the filesystem
UUID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">random generate a new
randomly-generated UUID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time generate a new time-based
UUID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UUID may be used by
mount(8), fsck(8), and /etc/fstab(5) (and possibly others)
by specifying UUID=uuid instead of a block special device
name like /dev/hda1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See uuidgen(8) for more
information. If the system does not have a good random
number generator such as /dev/random or /dev/urandom,
tune2fs will automatically use a <br>
time-based UUID instead of a randomly-generated UUID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
We haven&rsquo;t found any bugs yet. That doesn&rsquo;t mean
there aren&rsquo;t any...</p>
