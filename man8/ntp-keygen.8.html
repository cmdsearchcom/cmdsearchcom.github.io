<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program generates cryptographic data files used by the
NTPv4 authentication and identity schemes. It can generate
message digest keys used in symmetric key cryptography and,
<br>
if the OpenSSL software library has been installed, it can
generate host keys, sign keys, certificates and identity
keys used by the Autokey public key cryptography. The
message <br>
digest keys file is generated in a format compatible with
NTPv3. All other files are in PEM-encoded printable ASCII
format so they can be embedded as MIME attachments in mail
to <br>
other sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used to generate message
digest keys, the program produces a file containing ten
pseudo-random printable ASCII strings suitable for the MD5
message digest algorithm included <br>
in the distribution. If the OpenSSL library is installed, it
produces an additional ten hex-encoded random bit strings
suitable for the SHA1 and other message digest algorithms.
<br>
Printable ASCII keys can have length from one to 20
characters, inclusive. Bit string keys have length 20 octets
(40 hex characters). All keys are 160 bits in length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file can be edited later
with purpose-chosen passwords for the ntpq and ntpdc
programs. Each line of the file contains three fields, first
an integer between 1 and 65534, <br>
inclusive, representing the key identifier used in the
server and peer configuration commands. Next is the key type
for the message digest algorithm, which in the absence of
the <br>
OpenSSL library should be the string MD5 to designate the
MD5 message digest algorithm. If the OpenSSL library is
installed, the key type can be any message digest algorithm
sup&acirc; <br>
ported by that library. However, if compatibility with FIPS
140-2 is required, the key type must be either SHA or
SHA1.Finally is the key itself as a printable ASCII string
<br>
excluding the space and # characters. If not greater than 20
characters in length, the string is the key itself;
otherwise, it is interpreted as a hex-encoded bit string. As
is <br>
custom, # and the remaining characters on the line are
ignored. Later, this file can be edited to include the
passwords for the ntpq and ntpdc utilities. If this is the
only <br>
need, run ntp-keygen with the -M option and disregard the
remainder of this page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining generated files
are compatible with other OpenSSL applications and other
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) resources. Certificates
generated by this program should be <br>
compatible with extant industry practice, although some
users might find the interpretation of X509v3 extension
fields somewhat liberal. However, the identity keys are
probably <br>
not compatible with anything other than Autokey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most files used by this program
are encrypted using a private password. The -p option
specifies the password for local files and the -q option the
password for files sent to <br>
remote sites. If no local password is specified, the host
name returned by the Unix gethostname() function, normally
the DNS name of the host, is used. If no remote password is
<br>
specified, the local password is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pw option of the crypto
configuration command specifies the read password for
previously encrypted files. This must match the local
password used by this program. If not <br>
specified, the host name is used. Thus, if files are
generated by this program without password, they can be read
back by ntpd without password, but only on the same
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files and links are usually
installed in the directory /usr/local/etc, which is normally
in a shared filesystem in NFS-mounted networks and cannot be
changed by shared <br>
clients. The location of the keys directory can be changed
by the keysdir configuration command in such cases.
Normally, encrypted files for each host are generated by
that host <br>
and used only by that host, although exceptions exist as
noted later on this page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program directs commentary
and error messages to the standard error stream stderr and
remote files to the standard output stream stdout where they
can be piped to other <br>
applications or redirected to a file. The names used for
generated files and links all begin with the string ntpkey
and include the file type, generating host and filestamp, as
<br>
described in the Cryptographic Data Files section below</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING THE PROGRAM <br>
To test and gain experience with Autokey concepts, log in as
root and change to the keys directory, usually
/usr/local/etc. When run for the first time, or if all files
with <br>
names beginning ntpkey have been removed, use the ntp-keygen
command without arguments to generate a default RSA host key
and matching RSA-MD5 certificate with expiration date <br>
one year hence. If run again, the program uses the existing
keys and parameters and generates only a new certificate
with new expiration date one year hence; however, the
cer&acirc; <br>
tificate is not generated if the -e or -q options are
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the command on as many hosts
as necessary. Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH)
using ntp-keygen with the -T option and configure it to
synchronize from reliable <br>
Internet servers. Then configure the other hosts to
synchronize to the TH directly or indirectly. A certificate
trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately ascendant
host <br>
towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then
provided to the immediately descendant host on request. All
group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on
the <br>
TH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host key is used to encrypt
the cookie when required and so must be RSA type. By
default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
signatures. A different sign key <br>
can be assigned using the -S option and this can be either
RSA or DSA type. By default, the signature message digest
type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and sign
<br>
digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be
specified using the -c option. At the moment, legacy
considerations require the NTP packet header digest type to
be MD5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRUSTED HOSTS AND SECURE GROUPS
<br>
As described on the Authentication Options page, an NTP
secure group consists of one or more low-stratum THs as the
root from which all other group hosts derive synchronization
<br>
directly or indirectly. For authentication purposes all
hosts in a group must have the same group name specified by
the -i option and matching the ident option of the crypto
con&acirc; <br>
figuration command. The group name is used in the subject
and issuer fields of trusted, self-signed certificates and
when constructing the file names for identity keys. All
hosts <br>
must have different host names, either the default host name
or as specified by the -s option and matching the host
option of the crypto configuration command. Most
installations <br>
need not specify the -i option nor the host option. Host
names are used in the subject and issuer fields of
self-signed, nontrusted certificates and when constructing
the file <br>
names for host and sign keys and certificates. Host and
group names are used only for authentication purposes and
have nothing to do with DNS names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDENTITY SCHEMES <br>
As described on the Authentication Options page, there are
five identity schemes, three of which - IFF, GQ and MV -
require identity keys specific to each scheme. There are two
<br>
types of files for each scheme, an encrypted keys file and a
nonencrypted parameters file, which usually contains a
subset of the keys file. In general, NTP secondary servers
<br>
operating as certificate signing authorities (CSA) use the
keys file and clients use the parameters file. Both files
are generated by the TA operating as a certificate authority
<br>
(CA) on behalf of all servers and clients in the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters files are public;
they can be stored in a public place and sent in the clear.
The keys files are encrypted with the local password. To
retrieve the keys file, a <br>
host can send a mail request to the TA including its local
password. The TA encrypts the keys file with this password
and returns it as an attachment. The attachment is then <br>
copied intact to the keys directory with name given in the
first line of the file, but all in lower case and with the
filestamp deleted. Alternatively, the parameters file can be
<br>
retrieved from a secure web site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the TA generates
default host key, IFF keys and trusted certificate using the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntp-keygen -p local_passwd -T -I
-igroup_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each group host generates
default host keys and nontrusted certificate use the same
command line but omitting the -i option. Once these media
have been generated, the TA can then <br>
generate the public parameters using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntp-keygen -p local_passwd -e
&gt;parameters_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the -e option redirects
the unencrypted parameters to the standard output stream for
a mail application or stored locally for later distribution.
In a similar fashion the <br>
-q option redirects the encrypted server keys to the
standard output stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
-b modulus <br>
Set the modulus for generating identity keys to modulus
bits. The modulus defaults to 256, but can be set from 256
(32 octets) to 2048 (256 octets). Use the larger moduli <br>
with caution, as this can consume considerable computing
resources and increases the size of authenticated
packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c [ RSA-MD2 | RSA-MD5 | RSA-SHA
| RSA-SHA1 | RSA-MDC2 | RSA-RIPEMD160 | DSA-SHA | DSA-SHA1 ]
<br>
Select certificate and message digest/signature encryption
scheme. Note that RSA schemes must be used with a RSA sign
key and DSA schemes must be used with a DSA sign <br>
key. The default without this option is RSA-MD5. If
compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required, either the
DSA-SHA or DSA-SHA1 scheme must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cipher <br>
Select the cipher which is used to encrypt the files
containing private keys. The default is three-key triple DES
in CBC mode, equivalent to &quot;-C des-ede3-cbc&quot;. The
<br>
openssl tool lists ciphers available in &quot;openssl
-h&quot; output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable debugging. This option
displays the cryptographic data produced for eye-friendly
billboards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Extract the IFF or GQ public
parameters from the IFFkey or GQkey keys file previously
specified. Send the unencrypted data to the standard output
stream stdout. While the <br>
IFF parameters do not reveal the private group key, the GQ
parameters should be used with caution, as they include the
group key. Use the -q option with password <br>
instead. Note: a new certificate is not generated when this
option is present. This allows multiple commands with this
option but without disturbing existing media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Generate a new encrypted GQ
key file and link for the Guillou-Quisquater (GQ) identity
scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Generate a new encrypted RSA
public/private host key file and link. Note that if the sign
key is the same as the host key, generating a new host key
invalidates all cer&acirc; <br>
tificates signed with the old host key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i group <br>
Set the group name to group. This is used in the identity
file names. It must match the group name specified in the
ident option of the crypto configuration command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Generate a new encrypted IFF
key file and link for the Schnorr (IFF) identity scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m modulus <br>
Set the modulus for generating files to modulus bits. The
modulus defaults to 512, but can be set from 256 (32 octets)
to 2048 (256 octets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Generate a new MD5 key file
containing 16, 128-bit pseudo-random keys for symmetric
cryptography..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Generate a new private
certificate used by the PC identity scheme. By default, the
program generates public certificates. Note: the PC identity
scheme is not recommended <br>
for new installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p passwd <br>
Set the password for reading and writing encrypted files to
passwd. By default, the password is the host name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q passwd <br>
Extract the encrypted IFF or GQ server keys from the IFFkey
or GQkey key file previously generated. The data are sent to
the standard output stream stdout. Set the pass&acirc; <br>
word for writing the data, which is also the password to
read the data file in another host. By default, the password
is the host name. Note: a new certificate is not <br>
generated when this option is present. This allows multiple
commands with this option but without disturbing existing
media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S [ RSA | DSA ] <br>
Generate a new sign key of the specified type. By default,
the sign key is the host key and has the same type. If
compatibly with FIPS 140-2 is required, the sign key <br>
type must be DSA. Note that generating a new sign key
invalidates all certificates signed with the old sign
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s host Set the host name to
host. This is used in the host and sign key file names. It
must match the host name specified in the host option of the
crypto configuration command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Generate a trusted
certificate. By default, the program generates nontrusted
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V nkeys <br>
Generate server parameters MV and nkeys client keys for the
Mu-Varadharajan (MV) identity scheme. Note: support for this
option should be considered a work in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANDOM SEED FILE <br>
All cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have
means to randomize the entropy seed used to initialize the
internal pseudo-random number generator used by the <br>
OpenSSL library routines. If a site supports ssh, it is very
likely that means to do this are already available. The
entropy seed used by the OpenSSL library is contained in a
<br>
file, usually called .rnd, which must be available when
starting the ntp-keygen program or ntpd daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OpenSSL library looks for
the file using the path specified by the RANDFILE
environment variable in the user home directory, whether
root or some other user. If the RANDFILE <br>
environment variable is not present, the library looks for
the .rnd file in the user home directory. Since both the
ntp-keygen program and ntpd daemon must run as root, the
logi&acirc; <br>
cal place to put this file is in /.rnd or /root/.rnd. If the
file is not available or cannot be written, the program
exits with a message to the system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRYPTOGRAPHIC DATA FILES <br>
File and link names are in the form ntpkey_key_name.fstamp,
where key is the key or parameter type, name is the host or
group name and fstamp is the filestamp (NTP seconds) when
<br>
the file was created). By convention, key fields in
generated file names include both upper and lower case
alphanumeric characters, while key fields in generated link
names <br>
include only lower case characters. The filestamp is not
used in generated link names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key type is a string
defining the cryptographic function. Key types include
public/private keys host and sign, certificate cert and
several challenge/response key types. By <br>
convention, files used for challenges have a par subtype, as
in the IFF challenge IFFpar, while files for responses have
a key subtype, as in the GQ response GQkey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files begin with two
nonencrypted lines. The first line contains the file name in
the format ntpkey_key_host.fstamp. The second line contains
the datestamp in conventional <br>
Unix date format. Lines beginning with # are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remainder of the file
contains cryptographic data encoded first using ASN.1 rules,
then encrypted using the cipher selected with -C and given
password and finally written in <br>
PEM-encoded printable ASCII text preceded and followed by
MIME content identifier lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the symmetric keys
file is somewhat different than the other files in the
interest of backward compatibility. Since DES-CBC is
deprecated in NTPv4, the only key <br>
format of interest is MD5 alphanumeric strings. Following
the header the keys are entered one per line in the
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyno type key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where keyno is a positive
integer in the range 1-65,535, type is the string MD5
defining the key format and key is the key itself, which is
a printable ASCII string 16 characters <br>
or less in length. Each character is chosen from the 93
printable characters in the range 0x21 through 0x7f
excluding space and the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the keys used by the
ntpq and ntpdc programs are checked against passwords
requested by the programs and entered by hand, so it is
generally appropriate to specify <br>
these keys in human readable ASCII format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ntp-keygen program generates
a MD5 symmetric keys file ntpkey_MD5key_hostname.filestamp.
Since the file contains private shared keys, it should be
visible only to root and <br>
distributed by secure means to other subnet hosts. The NTP
daemon loads the file ntp.keys, so ntp-keygen installs a
soft link from this name to the generated file.
Subsequently, <br>
similar soft links must be installed by manual or automated
means on the other subnet hosts. While this file is not used
with the Autokey Version 2 protocol, it is needed to <br>
authenticate some remote configuration commands used by the
ntpq and ntpdc utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It can take quite a while to generate some cryptographic
values, from one to several minutes with modern
architectures such as UltraSPARC and up to tens of minutes
to an hour <br>
with older architectures such as SPARC IPC.</p>
