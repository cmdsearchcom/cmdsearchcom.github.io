<p>APT-MOVE(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
APT-MOVE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apt-move - move cache of Debian packages into a mirror
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apt-move [-c conffile] [-d dist] [-afqt] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The apt-move script is used to move a collection of Debian
package files into a proper archive hierarchy of the form
$LOCALDIR/pool/... where LOCALDIR is specified in the
con&acirc; <br>
figuration file. It is intended as a tool to help manage the
apt-get(8) file cache, but could be configured to work with
any collection of Debian packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, using the sync and
mirror commands, you can build your own local mirror of
portions of a selected binary and/or source
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running apt-move periodically
will assist in managing the resulting partial mirror by
(optionally) removing obsolete packages and creating valid
local Packages.gz and Sources.gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
The following commands are accepted by apt-move:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get [ dir ] <br>
This generates the master files using Packages and Sources
files from the apt(8) cache. The master files are used to
keep track of what packages are available, and where <br>
packages should be installed. If dir is specified, it will
be used in lieu of the LISTSTATE variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getlocal [ dir ] <br>
This is an alias of get. It may be removed in future
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move Moves a collection of
packages into the local mirror tree. Uses existing master
files (see get) to repair any mangling done to the package
names. Any packages that <br>
aren&rsquo;t listed in the master files or are obsolete will
be left in the file cache directory. Obsolete packages will
also be copied into the archive but they will be <br>
removed after the next delete operation. In the these two
cases, the package is considered to have been skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete Delete obsolete package
files. Configurable through the DELETE and MAXDELETE
settings in the /etc/apt-move.conf file (see the
CONFIGURATION section below). It also <br>
deletes any index files of packages that are no longer in
the archive. This means that you can simply delete packages
from the archive without affecting its consistency <br>
as long as you run the delete command afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">packages <br>
Builds new local versions of Packages.gz and Sources.gz
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsck Rebuilds all index files
used to make Packages and Sources files and reprocess all
packages in the archive by calling movefile on them. Use
this if you are upgrading from <br>
an old version (&lt;&lt; 4.2) of apt-move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update This is an alias,
equivalent to &rsquo;get move delete packages&rsquo;. This
is the preferred method for moving package files from your
cache into a local mirror.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local This is an alias,
equivalent to &rsquo;move delete packages&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localupdate <br>
This is an alias for update. It may be removed in future
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirror This command
automatically runs get, then uses /usr/lib/apt-move/fetch
and apt-get(8) to download any packages missing from your
mirror. The downloaded files will be <br>
installed into the repository using move. Finally, it runs
packages and exits. See the DIST and PKGTYPE settings in
/etc/apt-move.conf. Before using this command, you <br>
need to set up a $LOCALDIR/.exclude file containing patterns
to exclude unwanted files from your mirror. See the
SAMPLE.exclude file for an example. See also the Exclude
<br>
file section of NOTES below. Note that this command will
only mirror packages for the architecture that you are
running on. It will, however, mirror all source
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync Similar to the mirror
function, but only gets the packages that are currently
installed on your system. It uses dpkg(8) --get-selections
to find out what files to down&acirc; <br>
load. It will skip any files that match one of the patterns
in the $LOCALDIR/.exclude file (if it exists). sync will get
the latest versions of the packages, regardless <br>
of the version currently installed on your system (think
about it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exclude <br>
This command is used to test your $LOCALDIR/.exclude pattern
file. It will go through the master lists and print any file
that matches one of the patters in <br>
$LOCALDIR/.exclude. This will show you exactly what files
you have EXCLUDED from your mirror. The -t (test) flag has
no affect on this command. This uses your existing <br>
master files, and does not require an internet
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">movefile files... <br>
This command is similar to move. Instead of moving files
from FILECACHE, it will move the files specified on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copydir directory... <br>
This command is similar to movefile. Instead of moving files
from the command line, it will copy .deb files from the
specified directory. This is useful for copying the <br>
pool of a Debian CD to an apt repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listbin [ mirror | sync | repo ]
<br>
This command prints a list of packages which may serve as
the input to mirrorbin or mirrorsrc. If the argument is
mirror or sync, it will produce the same lists that the <br>
mirror and sync commands use. If the argument is repo, the
list produced will contain the packages that are currently
in the apt-move repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirrorbin <br>
This command will fetch the list of packages specified on
the standard input, and place them into the archive in the
same way as mirror does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirrorsrc <br>
This commands acts like mirrorbin, except that it fetches
source packages instead of binary ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The following options are available from the command
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Process all packages. By
default, commands like listbin and mirrorbin only process
packages that differ in version between the apt-move
repository and the archive being <br>
mirrored. This option causes all packages to be considered
even if the apt-move repository already contains the latest
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c conffile <br>
Use conffile as the configuration file instead of
/etc/apt-move.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dist <br>
Use dist as the default suite instead of the value of DIST
from the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Forces deletion of files even
when the percentage of files to delete exceeds the MAXDELETE
setting. This is useful if apt-move aborts with an error
saying that too many <br>
files would be deleted, and you want to delete the files
anyway. (Use with caution.) If you get this error, using -ft
will show you the complete list of files, so you can <br>
verify them before you use -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppresses normal output.
This option is useful when apt-move is used in a
non-interactive script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Makes a &rsquo;test
run&rsquo; and reports what WOULD be done for option but
does not modify any of the cache or mirror files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Before using apt-move, edit the /etc/apt-move.conf file to
match your local setup. Always remember to use the test
parameter after any change in your configuration to make
sure <br>
it will work like you want it to. You may also want to set
the DELETE option to no to turn off file deletes until
everything else is working successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file is read as a Bourne
shell script. So you must obey the syntactical rules of
sh(1). In particular, values with spaces in them must be
quoted with single or double <br>
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following settings are
recognized by apt-move (shown here with their defaults):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APTSITES=&quot;debian.midco.net
non-us.debian.org&quot; <br>
Set this to the names of sites in your /etc/apt/sources.list
that you wish to mirror. The value /all/ refers to all
non-file URIs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCALDIR=/mirrors/debian <br>
This is the full (absolute) path to your debian directory
(the top of your local mirror).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIST=stable <br>
This is the default suite assigned to packages when the
Release file is missing. It does not have any effect on
whether a suite is stored in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PKGTYPE=binary <br>
Set this to your choice of: binary, source or both to tell
the mirror, sync and movefile which type(s) of files to
get.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILECACHE=/var/cache/apt/archives
<br>
The directory where your local cache of packages are. The
default will work for the apt-get(8) packages, unless
you&rsquo;ve changed the configuration in
/etc/apt/apt.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTSTATE=/var/lib/apt/lists
<br>
The directory to your local cache of Packages files. The
default will work for the apt-get(8) packages, unless
you&rsquo;ve changed the configuration in
/etc/apt/apt.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE=no <br>
Determines whether obsolete packages (packages not listed in
the master file, or packages that have been superceded in
the repository) are to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXDELETE=20 <br>
Maximum percentage of files apt-move is allowed to delete
during a normal run. Anything exceeding this will produce an
error and abort the script. I added this as a pre&acirc;
<br>
caution so that you won&rsquo;t lose your entire mirror when
a new distribution is released. You can override this (with
caution) using the -f parameter with apt-move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYONLY=no <br>
If this is set to yes, then move and movefile will copy
instead of move. That is, the originals will be left
alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PKGCOMP=gzip <br>
This should be set to a space-separated list of compression
formats that apt-move should provide when generating
Packages and Sources files. The possible values are none,
<br>
gzip and bzip2. With the current apt package you should
include at least none, as otherwise apt will complain about
missing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTENTS=no <br>
If this is set to yes, then packages will generate Contents
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPGKEY= <br>
If this is set to non-empty string, then packages will sign
generated Release files with the specified key. You must
install gnupg before enabling this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the sync and mirror commands
to function correctly, you need to list your apt-move
repository at the top of /etc/apt/sources.list as a file
URI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/bin/apt-move <br>
The script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/apt-move.conf <br>
Configuration file for the script.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/man/man8/apt-move.8.gz
<br>
The manpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/MOVE_* <br>
The temporary files created at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/apt-move/fetch <br>
Utility to fetch files just like apt-get install -d. Except
that no dependency analysis is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.apt-move/*.{binary,
source}.local <br>
Put entries of local packages here. The fields are
&lsquo;&lsquo;package priority section source version
task&rsquo;&rsquo; for the binary file, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;package priority section version&rsquo;&rsquo;
for the <br>
source file. The version field may be set to a single dash
to refer to the latest version in the archive. Blank lines
and lines beginning with a hash are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
dpkg(8), apt-get(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Exclude file <br>
The mirror command uses a file in the $LOCALDIR/ directory
called &rsquo;.exclude&rsquo; which contains exclude
patterns that are applied against the files to be mirrored.
These patterns <br>
were created with the following limitation: they must work
the same with with grep(1), after any &rsquo;*&rsquo;
characters are removed. Unless you&rsquo;re careful setting
this up, you&rsquo;ll get <br>
unexpected results. Run &rsquo;apt-move -t mirror&rsquo;
first, to make sure you&rsquo;re getting the results you
intended. Another way to verify your exclude file is the use
the exclude command <br>
for apt-move to print a list of files your are excluding
from your mirror. See the sample <br>
.exclude file (SAMPLE.exclude) for an example of an .exclude
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mirroring <br>
The apt-move mirror and sync commands do not test for
available disk space. The current potato (main binary)
distribution is over 1Gb in size. Add the sources to that
and it <br>
can eat up the space on a partition really fast. I would
advise you to put your mirror somewhere other than the root
partition. Set up your exclude file and run apt-move -t
mir&acirc; <br>
ror and examine the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code names <br>
Since apt-move gets the suite names from Release files,
which usually use the names stable, testing and unstable,
the suites in the repository are named accordingly. You can
<br>
simulate the code names by creating symbolic links in the
dists directory. For example, in order to make testing
equivalent to sarge, you could run ln -s testing <br>
$LOCALDIR/dists/sarge. Alternatively, you could delete the
testing subdirectory and run ln -s sarge
$LOCALDIR/dists/testing. This will cause future executions
of the get opera&acirc; <br>
tion to use sarge whenever it sees testing in the Release
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
apt-move may exit with one of the following error
messages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Could not read configuration.
<br>
apt-move could not find the /etc/apt-move.conf file. Run the
install script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Could not create directory. <br>
For some reason, a necessary directory could not be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You failed to select a
distribution. <br>
You did not configure a DIST setting in
/etc/apt-move.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You specified an invalid package
type. <br>
You can only use binary, source or both for the PKGTYPE
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No master files exist! <br>
You need to run apt-ve with the get command at least once in
order to create the master files which determine where
packages are to be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bc calculation returned invalid
result <br>
apt-move uses the bc(1) program to determine when the number
of files to delete will exceed the MAXDELETE setting in
apt-move.conf. If you get this error, make sure that <br>
MAXDELETE is set to a number in the range of 1 to 100,
without the % sign. Otherwise you need to report this as a
bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too many files to delete! <br>
apt-move will report this error if the number of files to be
deleted exceeds the MAXDELETE setting in apt-move.conf. You
need to study the output to determine if this is <br>
normal (in which case you can override this using the force
parameter), or if its due to some drastic change on the
mirror site (like a new release) or possibly due to a <br>
partial download of the master Packages.gz or Sources.gz
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your current mirror directory is
incompatible... <br>
You have just upgraded from an old version of apt-move.
Update your configuration, then run apt-move fsck and
finally remove .apt-move/ancient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Could not read Release files.
<br>
apt-move could not read the release files needed to build
the master files. Make sure you have run apt-get update and
try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed to remove original files.
<br>
apt-move could not remove the original copies of files that
have just entered the apt-move archive. Make sure that you
have permission to delete those files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please remove $LOCALDIR/backup.
<br>
You must remove LOCALDIR/backup before running the fsck
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown DIST setting. <br>
The value of DIST must match the Archive field in the
Release file of the distribution that you are trying to
mirror.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot find index files for
APTSITES. <br>
apt-move could not find any index files for the get
operation. You should either run apt-get update, or run
apt-move with -f if only the *.local files have been
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The exclusion system was designed prior to the introduction
to the package pools. Hence its content still relates to the
old structure of the Debian archive. This is confusing <br>
and it should be replaced with a new exclusion system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DIST variable does not
control what is actually downloaded by the fetch utility. It
should have a similar effect to that of apt-get -t.</p>
