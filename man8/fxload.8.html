<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>fxload</b> is a program which downloads firmware to USB devices based on
  AnchorChips EZ-USB, Cypress EZ-USB FX, or Cypress EZ-USB FX2 microcontrollers.
  These have 8-bit 8051 cores with special extensions for USB I/O. The FX2
  supports high speed USB 2.0 transfers (480 Mbit/sec) as well as full speed USB
  1.1 transfers (12 Mbit/sec), while the earlier parts supports only full speed
  transfers. These controllers have several package options, and can be set up
  with external memory (on-chip memory is usually about 8K), EEPROMs, and ROMs
  when device costs allow.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This uses &quot;usbfs&quot; (older name: &quot;usbdevfs&quot;) to access
  devices, and issues vendor specific control requests to download and reset the
  EZ-USB devices. Normally, firmware will then &quot;renumerate&quot; by
  disconnecting from USB and then reconnecting as a new device. It then appears
  with new device descriptors and functionality, as provided by the firmware
  which has been downloaded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To support some non-firmware applications, this can also set up symbolic links
  for those usbfs names. It can also change their access modes. Both of these
  can help simplify software applications that need to talk to USB devices using
  user mode drivers, don't want to run with privileges or to examine all of the
  existing USB devices, and which don't need more kernel drivers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the <i>Linux-Hotplug</i> web site for information about how to use
  <b>fxload</b> to download device firmware when hotplugging USB devices, using
  driver-specific scripts stored in the <i>/etc/hotplug/usb</i> directory.

At least one of the following options must be specified. Note that as usual with
  UNIX and Linux commands, the order of command option flags does not matter.
  You may use these in any order.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I </b><i>hexfile</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Downloads the specified firmware file. This firmware is
      provided in standard Intel hexfile format. (Common naming conventions
      include <i>*.hex</i> and <i>*.ihx</i>.) Depending on the device and
      firmware in use, the <b>-s</b> option may also be necessary to specify a
      second stage loader. Firmware is normally downloaded to RAM and executed,
      but there is also an option for downloading into bootable I2C
    EEPROMs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-L </b><i>link</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Creates the specified symbolic link to the usbfs device
      path. This would typically be used to create a name in a directory that
      would be searched by an application. The symlink would be removed by some
      other component on device unplug.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m </b><i>mode</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Changes permissions on the &quot;usbfs&quot; device node.
      By default, those nodes are only accessible by privileged users, which
      doesn't help when the user mode device driver needs to run without root
      privileges. Note that usbfs mount options like <i>devmode=0666</i> are
      also available.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

Note that when downloading firmware that renumerates, there's no point in
  changing the device permissions or creating a symbolic link.

By default, <b>fxload</b> assumes the device uses an EZ-USB or EZ-USB FX. It
  also assumes that the device in question has been specified by USB kernel
  hotplugging conventions, using the <i>DEVICE</i> environment variable to name
  a &quot;usbfs&quot; file that can be used to talk to the device.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c </b><i>config</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Indicates the specified firmware should be downloaded to an
      I2C boot EEPROM rather than to RAM. The parameter is the EZ-USB FX or FX2
      configuration byte, and for AnchorChips devices the value should be zero.
      This requires a second stage loader that knows how to write to I2C EEPROMs
      specified using the <b>-s</b> option, as well as a device that's provided
      with an EEPROM large enough to store the boot firmware. After downloading
      to a device's EEPROM, you should retest it starting from power off.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s </b><i>loader</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This identifies the hex file holding a second stage loader
      (in the same hex file format as the firmware itself), which is loaded into
      internal memory. This loader understands additional vendor control
      requests, beyond the one built into all EZ-USB hardware, which are needed
      to write external RAM or EEPROM. As a last step when loading firmware,
      <b>fxload</b> normally overwrites this second stage loader with parts of
      the firmware residing on-chip.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Same as &quot;-t fx2&quot;.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t </b><i>type</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Indicates which type of microcontroller is used in the
      device; type may be one of <i>an21</i> (the original AnchorChips devices),
      <i>fx</i> (Cypress' updated version, the EZ-USB FX), or <i>fx2</i> (the
      Cypress EZ-USB FX2, supporting high speed transfers). Except when writing
      to EEPROM, all that normally matters when downloading firmware is whether
      or not the device uses an FX2.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prints some diagnostics, such as download addresses and
      sizes, to standard error. Repeat the flag (<b>-vv</b>, <b>-vvv</b>) to get
      more diagnostics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D </b><i>devpath</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the &quot;usbfs&quot; path name for the device in

      any <i>DEVICE</i> environment variable that may be set.</dd>

This program implements one extension to the standard &quot;hex file&quot;
  format. Lines beginning with a &quot;#&quot; character are ignored, and may be
  used to hold copyright statements and other information. Other tools may not
  handle hexfiles using this extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At this writing, &quot;usbfs&quot; is a kernel configuration option. That means
  that device drivers relying on user mode firmware downloading may need to
  depend on that kernel configuration option. A less preferable alternative
  involves compiling the firmware into the kernel and managing downloads and
  renumeration there. This is less preferable in part because much device
  firmware is provided with GPL-incompatible licensing, and in part because
  storing such firmware firmware wastes kernel memory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For EZ-USB family devices, the hardware's first stage loader (supporting the
  0xA0 vendor request) can't write into external memory. Configurations that put
  firmware into external memory thus need a second stage loader. For typical
  &quot;flat&quot; memory architectures, a loader supporting the 0xA3 vendor
  request is used to write into that memory. Similarly, a second stage loader
  that supports the 0xA2 vendor request is needed when writing boot firmware
  into an I2C EEPROM. These 0xA2 and 0xA3 vendor commands are conventions
  defined by Cypress. Devices that use bank switching or similar mechanisms to
  stretch the 64KByte address space may need different approach to loading
  firmware.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not all devices support EEPROM updates. Some EZ-USB based devices don't have an
  I2C EEPROM; many such EEPROMs are too small to store firmware; and some
  firmware can't be placed in bootable I2C EEPROMs.
