<p>FXLOAD(8) Linux Programmer&rsquo;s Manual FXLOAD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fxload - Firmware download to EZ-USB devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fxload [ -v ] [ -D devpath ] [ -I hexfile ] [ -2 ] [ -t type
] [ -c config ] [ -s loader ] <br>
fxload [ -D devpath ] [ -L link ] [ -m mode ] <br>
fxload [ -V ] [ -? ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fxload is a program which downloads firmware to USB devices
based on AnchorChips EZ-USB, Cypress EZ-USB FX, or Cypress
EZ-USB FX2 microcontrollers. These have 8-bit 8051 cores
<br>
with special extensions for USB I/O. The FX2 supports high
speed USB 2.0 transfers (480 Mbit/sec) as well as full speed
USB 1.1 transfers (12 Mbit/sec), while the earlier parts
<br>
supports only full speed transfers. These controllers have
several package options, and can be set up with external
memory (on-chip memory is usually about 8K), EEPROMs, and
<br>
ROMs when device costs allow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This uses &quot;usbfs&quot;
(older name: &quot;usbdevfs&quot;) to access devices, and
issues vendor specific control requests to download and
reset the EZ-USB devices. Normally, firmware will then <br>
&quot;renumerate&quot; by disconnecting from USB and then
reconnecting as a new device. It then appears with new
device descriptors and functionality, as provided by the
firmware which <br>
has been downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To support some non-firmware
applications, this can also set up symbolic links for those
usbfs names. It can also change their access modes. Both of
these can help simplify <br>
software applications that need to talk to USB devices using
user mode drivers, don&rsquo;t want to run with privileges
or to examine all of the existing USB devices, and which
don&rsquo;t <br>
need more kernel drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the Linux-Hotplug web site
for information about how to use fxload to download device
firmware when hotplugging USB devices, using driver-specific
scripts stored in the <br>
/etc/hotplug/usb directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTION LETTERS <br>
At least one of the following options must be specified.
Note that as usual with UNIX and Linux commands, the order
of command option flags does not matter. You may use these
<br>
in any order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I hexfile <br>
Downloads the specified firmware file. This firmware is
provided in standard Intel hexfile format. (Common naming
conventions include *.hex and *.ihx.) Depending on the <br>
device and firmware in use, the -s option may also be
necessary to specify a second stage loader. Firmware is
normally downloaded to RAM and executed, but there is also
<br>
an option for downloading into bootable I2C EEPROMs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L link <br>
Creates the specified symbolic link to the usbfs device
path. This would typically be used to create a name in a
directory that would be searched by an application. The <br>
symlink would be removed by some other component on device
unplug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mode <br>
Changes permissions on the &quot;usbfs&quot; device node. By
default, those nodes are only accessible by privileged
users, which doesn&rsquo;t help when the user mode device
driver needs <br>
to run without root privileges. Note that usbfs mount
options like devmode=0666 are also available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Identifies the version of
fxload being invoked, and exits without performing other
actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? Show usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when downloading
firmware that renumerates, there&rsquo;s no point in
changing the device permissions or creating a symbolic
link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
By default, fxload assumes the device uses an EZ-USB or
EZ-USB FX. It also assumes that the device in question has
been specified by USB kernel hotplugging conventions, using
<br>
the DEVICE environment variable to name a &quot;usbfs&quot;
file that can be used to talk to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config <br>
Indicates the specified firmware should be downloaded to an
I2C boot EEPROM rather than to RAM. The parameter is the
EZ-USB FX or FX2 configuration byte, and for <br>
AnchorChips devices the value should be zero. This requires
a second stage loader that knows how to write to I2C EEPROMs
specified using the -s option, as well as a <br>
device that&rsquo;s provided with an EEPROM large enough to
store the boot firmware. After downloading to a
device&rsquo;s EEPROM, you should retest it starting from
power off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s loader <br>
This identifies the hex file holding a second stage loader
(in the same hex file format as the firmware itself), which
is loaded into internal memory. This loader under&acirc;
<br>
stands additional vendor control requests, beyond the one
built into all EZ-USB hardware, which are needed to write
external RAM or EEPROM. As a last step when loading <br>
firmware, fxload normally overwrites this second stage
loader with parts of the firmware residing on-chip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Same as &quot;-t
fx2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Indicates which type of microcontroller is used in the
device; type may be one of an21 (the original AnchorChips
devices), fx (Cypress&rsquo; updated version, the EZ-USB
FX), or <br>
fx2 (the Cypress EZ-USB FX2, supporting high speed
transfers). Except when writing to EEPROM, all that normally
matters when downloading firmware is whether or not the <br>
device uses an FX2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints some diagnostics, such
as download addresses and sizes, to standard error. Repeat
the flag (-vv, -vvv) to get more diagnostics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D devpath <br>
Specifies the &quot;usbfs&quot; path name for the device in
question, such as /proc/bus/usb/004/080. This takes
precedence over any DEVICE environment variable that may be
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This program implements one extension to the standard
&quot;hex file&quot; format. Lines beginning with a
&quot;#&quot; character are ignored, and may be used to hold
copyright statements and other <br>
information. Other tools may not handle hexfiles using this
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this writing,
&quot;usbfs&quot; is a kernel configuration option. That
means that device drivers relying on user mode firmware
downloading may need to depend on that kernel
configura&acirc; <br>
tion option. A less preferable alternative involves
compiling the firmware into the kernel and managing
downloads and renumeration there. This is less preferable in
part <br>
because much device firmware is provided with
GPL-incompatible licensing, and in part because storing such
firmware firmware wastes kernel memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For EZ-USB family devices, the
hardware&rsquo;s first stage loader (supporting the 0xA0
vendor request) can&rsquo;t write into external memory.
Configurations that put firmware into exter&acirc; <br>
nal memory thus need a second stage loader. For typical
&quot;flat&quot; memory architectures, a loader supporting
the 0xA3 vendor request is used to write into that memory.
Similarly, a <br>
second stage loader that supports the 0xA2 vendor request is
needed when writing boot firmware into an I2C EEPROM. These
0xA2 and 0xA3 vendor commands are conventions defined by
<br>
Cypress. Devices that use bank switching or similar
mechanisms to stretch the 64KByte address space may need
different approach to loading firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all devices support EEPROM
updates. Some EZ-USB based devices don&rsquo;t have an I2C
EEPROM; many such EEPROMs are too small to store firmware;
and some firmware can&rsquo;t be placed <br>
in bootable I2C EEPROMs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DEVICE normally names a &quot;usbfs&quot; file that will be
used to talk to the device. This is provided by the Linux
kernel as part of USB hotplugging.</p>
