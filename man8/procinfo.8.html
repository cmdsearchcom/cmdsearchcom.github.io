<p>PROCINFO(8) Linux System Manual PROCINFO(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
procinfo - display system status gathered from /proc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
procinfo [ -fsmadiDSbrChv ] [ -nN ] [ -Ffile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
procinfo gathers some system data from the /proc directory
and prints it nicely formatted on the standard output
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meanings of the fields are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory: <br>
See the man page for free(1) (preferably the proc-version of
free (If you weren&rsquo;t around during the Linux 1.x days,
that&rsquo;s the only version of free you&rsquo;ll
have)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bootup: <br>
The time the system was booted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load average: <br>
The average number of jobs running, followed by the number
of runnable processes and the total number of processes (if
your kernel is recent enough), followed by the PID <br>
of the last process run (idem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user: The amount of time spent
running jobs in user space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice: The amount of time spent
running niced jobs in user space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system: <br>
The amount of time spent running in kernel space. Note: the
time spent servicing interrupts is not counted by the kernel
(and nothing that procinfo can do about it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle: The amount of time spent
doing nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">steal: The amount of time spent
the virtual CPU waiting for physical CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uptime: <br>
The time that the system has been up. The above four should
more or less add up to this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">page in: <br>
The number of disk block paged into core from disk. (A block
is almost always 1 kilobyte).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">page out: <br>
The reverse of the above. (What does that mean,
anyways?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap in: <br>
The number of memory pages paged in from swapspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap out: <br>
The number of memory pages paged out to swapspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context: <br>
The total number of context switches since bootup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disk 1-4: <br>
The number of times your hard disks have been accessed. This
won&rsquo;t work for 1.0.x/1.1.x kernels unless you have
applied the diskstat patch available elsewhere to your
ker&acirc; <br>
nel, and might give surprising results if all your hard
disks are of the same type (e.g. all IDE, all SCSI).
[I&rsquo;m not sure to what extend this is still true with
recent <br>
kernels, but I don&rsquo;t have a mixed system so I
can&rsquo;t check.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interrupts: <br>
This is either a single number for all IRQ channels together
if your kernel is older than version 1.0.5, or two rows of
numbers for each IRQ channel if your kernel is at <br>
version 1.0.5 or later. On Intel architecture there are
sixteen different IRQ channels, and their default meanings
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Timer channel 0 <br>
1 Keyboard <br>
2 Cascade for controller 2 (which controls IRQ 8-15) <br>
3 Serial Port 2 <br>
4 Serial Port 1 <br>
5 Parallel Port 2 <br>
6 Floppy Diskette Controller <br>
7 Parallel Port 1 <br>
8 Real-time Clock <br>
9 Redirected to IRQ2 <br>
10 -- <br>
11 -- <br>
12 -- <br>
13 Math Coprocessor <br>
14 Hard Disk Controller <br>
15 --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the meanings of the
IRQ channels for parallel ports, serial ports and those left
empty may have been changed depending on your hardware
setup. If that&rsquo;s the case <br>
on your machine, you&rsquo;re probably aware of it. If
you&rsquo;re not, upgrade to at least Linux 1.1.43 and let
procinfo enlighten you about who uses what.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules: <br>
The modules (loadable device drivers) installed on your
machine, with their sizes in kilobytes. (Only with -m or -a
option). Modules with a use count larger than 0 are <br>
marked with an asterisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character and Block Devices:
<br>
All available devices with their major numbers. (Only with
-m or -a option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Systems: <br>
All available file systems. (Only with -m or -a option).
Those that do not require an actual device (like procfs
itself) are noted between square brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f Run procinfo continuously full-screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nN Pause N second between
updates. This option implies -f. It may contain a decimal
point. The default is 5 seconds. When run by root with a
pause of 0 seconds, the program <br>
will run at the highest possible priority level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Show info about modules and
device drivers instead of CPU and memory stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Show all information that
procinfo knows how to find.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d For memory, CPU times,
paging, swapping, disk, context and interrupt stats, display
values per second rather than totals. This option implies
-f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Same as -d, except that
memory stats are displayed as totals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S When running with -d or -D,
always show values per second, even when running with -n N
with N greater than one second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ffile Redirect output to file
(usually a tty). Nice if, for example, you want to run
procinfo permanently on a virtual console or on a terminal,
by starting it from init(8) with <br>
a line like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p8:23:respawn:/usr/bin/procinfo
-biDn1 -F/dev/tty8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b If your kernel is recent
enough to display separate read and write numbers for disk
I/O, the -b flag makes procinfo display numbers of blocks
rather that numbers of I/O <br>
requests (neither of which is, alas, reliably translatable
into kilobytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Normally the IRQ portion of
the display is squeezed to only display non-zero IRQ
channels. With this option you&rsquo;ll get the full list,
but on Alphas and on Intel boxen with <br>
2.1.104 kernels or later procinfo won&rsquo;t fit inside a
80x24 screen anymore. Price of progress, I suppose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r This option adds an extra
line to the memory info showing &rsquo;real&rsquo; free
memory, just as free(1) does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a brief help
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS <br>
When running procinfo fullscreen, you can change its
behaviour by pressing n, d, D, S, i, m, a, r and b, which
have the same effect as the corresponding command line
options. In <br>
addition you can press q which quits the program; s which
switches back to the main screen after pressing m or a; t
which switches back to displaying totals after pressing d or
<br>
D; &lt;space&gt; which freezes the screen untill you press
another key again; C and R which sets and releases a
checkpoint in totals mode; and finally Ctrl-L which
refreshes the <br>
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc The proc file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
What, me worry?</p>
