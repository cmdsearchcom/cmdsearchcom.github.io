<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
upssched - Timer helper for scheduling events from
upsmon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
upssched</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
upssched should be run from upsmon(8) via the NOTIFYCMD. You
should never run it directly during normal operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
upssched was created to allow users to execute programs at
times relative to events being monitored by upsmon(8). The
original purpose was to allow for a shutdown to occur after
<br>
some fixed period on battery, but there are other uses that
are possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTEGRATION <br>
upssched needs to be called as the NOTIFYCMD in your
upsmon.conf(5). It determines what is happening based on the
UPSNAME and NOTIFYTYPE environment variables. You should
never <br>
have to deal with them directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the EXEC flag on the events
that you want to see in upssched. For example, to make sure
that upssched hears about ONLINE, ONBATT and LOWBATT events,
the flags would look like <br>
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFYFLAG ONLINE EXEC <br>
NOTIFYFLAG ONBATT EXEC <br>
NOTIFYFLAG LOWBATT EXEC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you also want to continue
writing to the syslog, just add it in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFYFLAG ONLINE SYSLOG+EXEC
<br>
NOTIFYFLAG ONBATT SYSLOG+EXEC <br>
NOTIFYFLAG LOWBATT SYSLOG+EXEC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a full list of notify flags,
see the upsmon(8) documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
See upssched.conf(5) for information on configuring this
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EARLY SHUTDOWNS <br>
To shut down the system early, define a timer that starts
due to an ONBATT condition. When it triggers, make your
CMDSCRIPT call your shutdown routine. It should finish by
<br>
calling upsmon -c fsd so that upsmon gets to shut down the
slaves in a controlled manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be sure you cancel the timer if
power returns (ONLINE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBOUNCING EVENTS <br>
If your UPS goes on and off battery frequently, you can use
this program to reduce the number of pager messages that are
sent out. Rather than sending pages directly from <br>
upsmon(8), use a short timer here. If the timer triggers
with the UPS still on battery, then send the page. If the
power returns before then, the timer can be cancelled and no
<br>
page is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND <br>
This program was written primarily to fulfill the requests
of users for the early shutdown scenario. The
&quot;outboard&quot; design of the program (relative to
upsmon) was intended to <br>
reduce the load on the average system. Most people
don&acirc;t have the requirement of shutting down after N
seconds on battery, since the usual OB+LB testing is
sufficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program was created
separately so those people don&acirc;t have to spend CPU
time and RAM on something that will never be used in their
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The design of the timer handler
is also geared towards minimizing impact. It will come and
go from the process list as necessary. When a new timer is
started, a process will be <br>
forked to actually watch the clock and eventually start the
CMDSCRIPT. When a timer triggers, it is removed from the
queue. Cancelling a timer will also remove it from the
queue. <br>
When no timers are present in the queue, the background
process exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you will only
see upssched running when one of two things is
happening:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There&acirc;s a
timer of some sort currently running</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; upsmon just
called it, and you managed to catch the brief instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final optimization handles
the possibility of trying to cancel a timer when there are
none running. If the timer daemon isn&acirc;t running, there
are no timers to cancel, and <br>
furthermore there is no need to start a clock-watcher. So,
it skips that step and exits sooner.</p>
