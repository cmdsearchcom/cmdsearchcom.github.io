<p>CUTTER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual CUTTER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cutter - cut tcp/ip connections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cutter ipaddress1 [ port1 [ ipaddress2 [ port2 ] ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cutter is an open source program that allows Linux firewall
administrators to abort TCP/IP connections routed over the
firewall or router on which it is run. it is not designed
<br>
to work on the systems hosting the server or client using
the connection, it only works on a linux firewall or router
over which the connection is made, and it must be run by the
<br>
root user of the firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Cutter has been designed for use as a administrators tool
for Linux firewalls. It&rsquo;s use (as is, or modified) for
any other purpose is not sanctioned by the author. So - do
not <br>
use this tool as a parachute, or to dry your cat, chill
meat, answer your phone, drive you car, teach your kids to
read or attack other people&rsquo;s computer systems or
networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This software has been designed
for legal and appropriate use by network security
administrators and the like. It has been written as part of
a larger Linux firewall project, <br>
targeting at controlling traffic from peer-to-peer software
such as Kazaa, iMesh and others into and out of a private
network. It is not designed as a tool for malicious use and
<br>
the author in no way sanctions such use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of the software should be
aware that it&rsquo;s actions are easily detectable using a
number of readily available network monitoring tools, and it
makes no attempt to disguise <br>
it&rsquo;s actions. Malicious use of &quot;cutter&quot;
could result in a jail sentence in a number of countries
around the world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The author is not responsible
for the results of using this software or documented
technique(whether in it&rsquo;s original form, or modified).
It is provided &quot;as is&quot; in the hope that <br>
it will be useful, but no guarantees are made about
it&rsquo;s use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Cutter can be called using one of the following four
syntaxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cutter ip-address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
cutter 10.10.0.45</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cuts all connections passing
through the firewall between any ports on the specified
ip-address (either a &quot;private&quot; or
&quot;public&quot; address) and any other hosts. This can be
<br>
used to close down all incoming connections to a particular
server, all outgoing connections from a particular client or
all outgoing connections to a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cutter ip-address port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
cutter 200.1.2.3 80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cuts all connections to or from
the specified ip-address/port pair. This allows the user to
be a little more specific than the previous example and
allows targeting of <br>
specific services on specific hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cutter ip-address-1 port-1
ip-address-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
cutter 200.1.2.3 22 10.10.0.45</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cuts all connections between
ip-address-2 and ip-address-1/port-1. This allows the user
to cut connections between a specified &quot;client&quot;
and a particular service on a spec&acirc; <br>
ified host. Our example closes host 10.10.0.45&rsquo;s SSH
connection to server 200.1.2.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cutter ip-address-1 port-1
ip-address-2 port-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
cutter 200.1.2.3 22 10.10.0.45 32451</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cuts the specific connection
between the two ip/port number pairs given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS <br>
Cutter 1.04 should be considered EXPERIMENTAL. The author is
releasing a tool that works on the systems which he has
access to (namely: IPCop and RedHat Linux), and he is
seek&acirc; <br>
ing input on it&rsquo;s use on other systems, ideas for
improvement, offers of sponsorship - etc.</p>
