<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUMMARY <br>
htcacheclean is used to keep the size of
mod_cache_disk&rsquo;s storage within a given size limit, or
limit on inodes in use. This tool can run either manually or
in daemon mode. When <br>
running in daemon mode, it sleeps in the background and
checks the cache directory at regular intervals for cached
content to be removed. You can stop the daemon cleanly by
send&acirc; <br>
ing it a TERM or INT signal. When run manually, a once off
check of the cache directory is made for cached content to
be removed. If one or more URLs are specified, each URL will
<br>
be deleted from the cache, if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-dinterval <br>
Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning every interval minutes.
This option is mutually exclusive with the -D, -v and -r
options. To shutdown the daemon cleanly, just send it <br>
a SIGTERM or SIGINT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do a dry run and don&rsquo;t
delete anything. This option is mutually exclusive with the
-d option. When doing a dry run and deleting directories
with -t, the inodes reported <br>
deleted in the stats cannot take into account the
directories deleted, and will be marked as an estimate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose and print
statistics. This option is mutually exclusive with the -d
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Clean thoroughly. This
assumes that the Apache web server is not running (otherwise
you may get garbage in the cache). This option is mutually
exclusive with the -d option <br>
and implies the -t option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Be nice. This causes slower
processing in favour of other processes. htcacheclean will
sleep from time to time so that (a) the disk IO will be
delayed and (b) the kernel <br>
can schedule other processes in the meantime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Delete all empty directories.
By default only cache files are removed, however with some
configurations the large number of directories created may
require attention. If <br>
your configuration requires a very large number of
directories, to the point that inode or file allocation
table exhaustion may become an issue, use of this option is
<br>
advised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppath Specify path as the root
directory of the disk cache. This should be the same value
as specified with the CacheRoot directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ppidfile <br>
Specify pidfile as the name of the file to write the process
ID to when daemonized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rround <br>
Specify round as the amount to round sizes up to, to
compensate for disk block sizes. Set to the block size of
the cache partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-llimit <br>
Specify limit as the total disk cache size limit. The value
is expressed in bytes by default (or attaching B to the
number). Attach K for Kbytes or M for MBytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Llimit <br>
Specify limit as the total disk cache inode limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Be intelligent and run only
when there was a modification of the disk cache. This option
is only possible together with the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a List the URLs currently
stored in the cache. Variants of the same URL will be listed
once for each variant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A List the URLs currently
stored in the cache, along with their attributes in the
following order: url, header size, body size, status, entity
version, date, expiry, request <br>
time, response time, body present, head request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETING A SPECIFIC URL <br>
If htcacheclean is passed one or more URLs, each URL will be
deleted from the cache. If multiple variants of an URL
exists, all variants would be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a reverse proxied URL is to
be deleted, the effective URL is constructed from the Host
header, the port, the path and the query. Note the
&rsquo;?&rsquo; in the URL must always be spec&acirc; <br>
ified explicitly, whether a query string is present or not.
For example, an attempt to delete the path / from the server
localhost, the URL to delete would be http://local&acirc;
<br>
host:80/?.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTING URLS IN THE CACHE <br>
By passing the -a or -A options to htcacheclean, the URLs
within the cache will be listed as they are found, one URL
per line. The -A option dumps the full cache entry after the
<br>
URL, with fields in the following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url The URL of the entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">header size <br>
The size of the header in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">body size <br>
The size of the body in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Status of the cached
response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entity version <br>
The number of times this entry has been revalidated without
being deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date Date of the response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expiry Expiry date of the
response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">request time <br>
Time of the start of the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">response time <br>
Time of the end of the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">body present <br>
If 0, no body is stored with this request, 1 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">head request <br>
If 1, the entry contains a cached HEAD request with no body,
0 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
htcacheclean returns a zero status (&quot;true&quot;) if all
operations were successful, 1 otherwise. If an URL is
specified, and the URL was cached and successfully removed,
0 is <br>
returned, 2 otherwise. If an error occurred during URL
removal, 1 is returned.</p>
