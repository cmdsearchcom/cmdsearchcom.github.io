<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
NetEm is an enhancement of the Linux traffic control
facilities that allow to add delay, packet loss, duplication
and more other characteristics to packets outgoing from a
<br>
selected network interface. NetEm is built using the
existing Quality Of Service (QOS) and Differentiated
Services (diffserv) facilities in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netem OPTIONS <br>
netem has the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit packets <br>
limits the effect of selected options to the indicated
number of next packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delay <br>
adds the chosen delay to the packets outgoing to chosen
network interface. The optional parameters allows to
introduce a delay variation and a correlation. Delay and
jitter val&acirc; <br>
ues are expressed in ms while correlation is percentage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distribution <br>
allow the user to choose the delay distribution. If not
specified, the default distribution is Normal. Additional
parameters allow to consider situations in which network has
<br>
variable delays depending on traffic flows concurring on the
same path, that causes several delay peaks and a tail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loss random <br>
adds an independent loss probability to the packets outgoing
from the chosen network interface. It is also possible to
add a correlation, but this option is now deprecated due to
<br>
the noticed bad behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loss state <br>
adds packet losses according to the 4-state Markov using the
transition probabilities as input parameters. The parameter
p13 is mandatory and if used alone corresponds to the <br>
Bernoulli model. The optional parameters allows to extend
the model to 2-state (p31), 3-state (p23 and p32) and
4-state (p14). State 1 corresponds to good reception, State
4 to <br>
independent losses, State 3 to burst losses and State 2 to
good reception within a burst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loss gemodel <br>
adds packet losses according to the Gilbert-Elliot loss
model or its special cases (Gilbert, Simple Gilbert and
Bernoulli). To use the Bernoulli model, the only needed
parameter <br>
is p while the others will be set to the default values
r=1-p, 1-h=1 and 1-k=0. The parameters needed for the Simple
Gilbert model are two (p and r), while three parameters (p,
<br>
r, 1-h) are needed for the Gilbert model and four (p, r, 1-h
and 1-k) are needed for the Gilbert-Elliot model. As known,
p and r are the transition probabilities between the bad
<br>
and the good states, 1-h is the loss probability in the bad
state and 1-k is the loss probability in the good state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ecn <br>
can be used optionally to mark packets instead of dropping
them. A loss model has to be used for this to be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">corrupt <br>
allows the emulation of random noise introducing an error in
a random position for a chosen percent of packets. It is
also possible to add a correlation through the proper
param&acirc; <br>
eter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicate <br>
using this option the chosen percent of packets is
duplicated before queuing them. It is also possible to add a
correlation through the proper parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reorder <br>
to use reordering, a delay option must be specified. There
are two ways to use this option (assuming &rsquo;delay
10ms&rsquo; in the options list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reorder 25% 50% gap 5 <br>
in this first example, the first 4 (gap - 1) packets are
delayed by 10ms and subsequent packets are sent immediately
with a probability of 0.25 (with correlation of 50% ) or
<br>
delayed with a probability of 0.75. After a packet is
reordered, the process restarts i.e. the next 4 packets are
delayed and subsequent packets are sent immediately or
delayed <br>
based on reordering probability. To cause a repeatable
pattern where every 5th packet is reordered reliably, a
reorder probability of 100% can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reorder 25% 50% <br>
in this second example 25% of packets are sent immediately
(with correlation of 50%) while the others are delayed by 10
ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rate <br>
delay packets based on packet size and is a replacement for
TBF. Rate can be specified in common units (e.g. 100kbit).
Optional PACKETOVERHEAD (in bytes) specify an per packet
<br>
overhead and can be negative. A positive value can be used
to simulate additional link layer headers. A negative value
can be used to artificial strip the Ethernet header (e.g.
<br>
-14) and/or simulate a link layer header compression scheme.
The third parameter - an unsigned value - specify the
cellsize. Cellsize can be used to simulate link layer
schemes. <br>
ATM for example has an payload cellsize of 48 bytes and 5
byte per cell header. If a packet is 50 byte then ATM must
use two cells: 2 * 48 bytes payload including 2 * 5 byte
<br>
header, thus consume 106 byte on the wire. The last optional
value CELLOVERHEAD can be used to specify per cell overhead
- for our ATM example 5. CELLOVERHEAD can be negative, <br>
but use negative values with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that rate throttling is
limited by several factors: the kernel clock granularity
avoid a perfect shaping at a specific level. This will show
up in an artificial packet com&acirc; <br>
pression (bursts). Another influence factor are network
adapter buffers which can also add artificial delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The main known limitation of Netem are related to timer
granularity, since Linux is not a real-time operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem rate 5kbit 20 100 5 <br>
delay all outgoing packets on device eth0 with a rate of
5kbit, a per packet overhead of 20 byte, a cellsize of 100
byte and a per celloverhead of 5 byte:</p>
