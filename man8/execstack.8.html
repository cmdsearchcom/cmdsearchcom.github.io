<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
execstack - tool to set, clear, or query executable stack
flag of ELF binaries and shared libraries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
execstack [OPTION...] [FILES]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
execstack is a program which sets, clears, or queries
executable stack flag of ELF binaries and shared libraries.
Linux has in the past allowed execution of instructions on
the <br>
stack and there are lots of binaries and shared libraries
assuming this behaviour. Furthermore, GCC trampoline code
for e.g. nested functions requires executable stack on many
<br>
architectures. To avoid breaking binaries and shared
libraries which need executable stack, ELF binaries and
shared libraries now can be marked as requiring executable
stack or <br>
not requiring it. This marking is done through the p_flags
field in the PT_GNU_STACK program header entry. If the
marking is missing, kernel or dynamic linker need to assume
it <br>
might need executable stack. The marking is done
automatically by recent GCC versions (objects using
trampolines on the stack are marked as requiring executable
stack, all other <br>
newly built objects are marked as not requiring it) and
linker collects these markings into marking of the whole
binary or shared library. The user can override this at
assembly <br>
time (through --execstack or --noexecstack assembler
options), at link time (through -z execstack or -z
noexecstack linker options) and using the execstack tool
also on an <br>
already linker binary or shared library. This tool is
especially useful for third party shared libraries where it
is known that they don&rsquo;t need executable stack or
testing <br>
proves it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-s --set-execstack <br>
Mark binary or shared library as requiring executable
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --clear-execstack <br>
Mark binary or shared library as not requiring executable
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --query <br>
Query executable stack marking of binaries and shared
libraries. For each file it prints either - when executable
stack is not required, X when executable stack is <br>
required or ? when it is unknown whether the object requires
or doesn&rsquo;t require executable stack (the marking is
missing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print execstack version and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? --help <br>
Print help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Print a short usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
Command line arguments should be names of ELF binaries and
shared libraries which should be modified or queried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
# execstack -s ~/lib/libfoo.so.1 <br>
will mark ~/lib/libfoo.so.1 as requiring executable stack.
<br>
# execstack -c ~/bin/bar <br>
will mark ~/bin/bar as not requiring executable stack. <br>
# execstack -q ~/lib/libfoo.so.1 ~/bin/bar <br>
will query executable stack marking of the given files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ld.so(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
execstack doesn&rsquo;t support yet marking of executables
if they do not have PT_GNU_STACK program header entry nor
they have room for program segment header table growth.</p>
