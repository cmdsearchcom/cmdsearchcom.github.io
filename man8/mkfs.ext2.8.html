<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mke2fs is used to create an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem,
usually in a disk partition. device is the special file
corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX). blocks-count is
<br>
the number of blocks on the device. If omitted, mke2fs
automagically figures the file system size. If called as
mkfs.ext3 a journal is created as if the -j option was
speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defaults of the parameters
for the newly created filesystem, if not overridden by the
options listed below, are controlled by the /etc/mke2fs.conf
configuration file. See <br>
the mke2fs.conf(5) manual page for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b block-size <br>
Specify the size of blocks in bytes. Valid block-size values
are 1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes per block. If omitted,
block-size is heuristically determined by the filesys&acirc;
<br>
tem size and the expected usage of the filesystem (see the
-T option). If block-size is preceded by a negative sign
(&rsquo;-&rsquo;), then mke2fs will use heuristics to
determine <br>
the appropriate block size, with the constraint that the
block size will be at least block-size bytes. This is useful
for certain hardware devices which require that the <br>
blocksize be a multiple of 2k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Check the device for bad
blocks before creating the file system. If this option is
specified twice, then a slower read-write test is used
instead of a fast read-only <br>
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cluster-size <br>
Specify the size of cluster in bytes for filesystems using
the bigalloc feature. Valid cluster-size values are from
2048 to 256M bytes per cluster. This can only be <br>
specified if the bigalloc feature is enabled. (See the ext4
(5) man page for more details about bigalloc.) The default
cluster size if bigalloc is enabled is 16 times <br>
the block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Use direct I/O when writing
to the disk. This avoids mke2fs dirtying a lot of buffer
cache memory, which may impact other applications running on
a busy server. This <br>
option will cause mke2fs to run much more slowly, however,
so there is a tradeoff to using direct I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E extended-options <br>
Set extended options for the filesystem. Extended options
are comma separated, and may take an argument using the
equals (&rsquo;=&rsquo;) sign. The -E option used to be -R
in ear&acirc; <br>
lier versions of mke2fs. The -R option is still accepted for
backwards compatibility, but is deprecated. The following
extended options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmp_update_interval=interval
<br>
Adjust the initial MMP update interval to interval seconds.
Specifying an interval of 0 means to use the default
interval. The specified interval must be <br>
less than 300 seconds. Requires that the mmp feature be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stride=stride-size <br>
Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stride-size
filesystem blocks. This is the number of blocks read or
written to disk before moving to the next <br>
disk, which is sometimes referred to as the chunk size. This
mostly affects placement of filesystem metadata like bitmaps
at mke2fs time to avoid placing them <br>
on a single disk, which can hurt performance. It may also be
used by the block allocator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stripe_width=stripe-width <br>
Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stripe-width
filesystem blocks per stripe. This is typically stride-size
* N, where N is the number of data- <br>
bearing disks in the RAID (e.g. for RAID 5 there is one
parity disk, so N will be the number of disks in the array
minus 1). This allows the block allocator <br>
to prevent read-modify-write of the parity in a RAID stripe
if possible when the data is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize=max-online-resize <br>
Reserve enough space so that the block group descriptor
table can grow to support a filesystem that has
max-online-resize blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lazy_itable_init[= &lt;0 to
disable, 1 to enable&gt;] <br>
If enabled and the uninit_bg feature is enabled, the inode
table will not be fully initialized by mke2fs. This speeds
up filesystem initialization noticeably, <br>
but it requires the kernel to finish initializing the
filesystem in the background when the filesystem is first
mounted. If the option value is omitted, it <br>
defaults to 1 to enable lazy inode table zeroing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lazy_journal_init[= &lt;0 to
disable, 1 to enable&gt;] <br>
If enabled, the journal inode will not be fully zeroed out
by mke2fs. This speeds up filesystem initialization
noticeably, but carries some small risk if the <br>
system crashes before the journal has been overwritten
entirely one time. If the option value is omitted, it
defaults to 1 to enable lazy journal inode zero&acirc; <br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root_owner[=uid:gid] <br>
Specify the numeric user and group ID of the root directory.
If no UID:GID is specified, use the user and group ID of the
user running mke2fs. In mke2fs 1.42 <br>
and earlier the UID and GID of the root directory were set
by default to the UID and GID of the user running the mke2fs
command. The root_owner= option allows <br>
explicitly specifying these values, and avoid side-effects
for users that do not expect the contents of the filesystem
to change based on the user running <br>
mke2fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test_fs <br>
Set a flag in the filesystem superblock indicating that it
may be mounted using experimental kernel code, such as the
ext4dev filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard <br>
Attempt to discard blocks at mkfs time (discarding blocks
initially is useful on solid state devices and sparse /
thin-provisioned storage). When the device <br>
advertises that discard also zeroes data (any subsequent
read after the discard and before write returns zero), then
mark all not-yet-zeroed inode tables as <br>
zeroed. This significantly speeds up filesystem
initialization. This is set as default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodiscard <br>
Do not attempt to discard blocks at mkfs time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f fragment-size <br>
Specify the size of fragments in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Force mke2fs to create a
filesystem, even if the specified device is not a partition
on a block special device, or if other parameters do not
make sense. In order to <br>
force mke2fs to create a filesystem even if the filesystem
appears to be in use or is mounted (a truly dangerous thing
to do), this option must be specified twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g blocks-per-group <br>
Specify the number of blocks in a block group. There is
generally no reason for the user to ever set this parameter,
as the default is optimal for the filesystem. (For <br>
administrators who are creating filesystems on RAID arrays,
it is preferable to use the stride RAID parameter as part of
the -E option rather than manipulating the number <br>
of blocks per group.) This option is generally used by
developers who are developing test cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bigalloc feature is
enabled, the -g option will specify the number of clusters
in a block group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G number-of-groups <br>
Specify the number of block groups that will be packed
together to create a larger virtual block group (or
&quot;flex_bg group&quot;) in an ext4 filesystem. This
improves meta-data <br>
locality and performance on meta-data heavy workloads. The
number of groups must be a power of 2 and may only be
specified if the flex_bg filesystem feature is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i bytes-per-inode <br>
Specify the bytes/inode ratio. mke2fs creates an inode for
every bytes-per-inode bytes of space on the disk. The larger
the bytes-per-inode ratio, the fewer inodes will <br>
be created. This value generally shouldn&rsquo;t be smaller
than the blocksize of the filesystem, since in that case
more inodes would be made than can ever be used. Be warned
<br>
that it is not possible to change this ratio on a filesystem
after it is created, so be careful deciding the correct
value for this parameter. Note that resizing a <br>
filesystem changes the numer of inodes to maintain this
ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I inode-size <br>
Specify the size of each inode in bytes. The inode-size
value must be a power of 2 larger or equal to 128. The
larger the inode-size the more space the inode table will
<br>
consume, and this reduces the usable space in the filesystem
and can also negatively impact performance. It is not
possible to change this value after the filesystem is <br>
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In kernels after 2.6.10 and some
earlier vendor kernels it is possible to utilize inodes
larger than 128 bytes to store extended attributes for
improved performance. <br>
Extended attributes stored in large inodes are not visible
with older kernels, and such filesystems will not be
mountable with 2.4 kernels at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default inode size is
controlled by the mke2fs.conf(5) file. In the mke2fs.conf
file shipped with e2fsprogs, the default inode size is 256
bytes for most file sys&acirc; <br>
tems, except for small file systems where the inode size
will be 128 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Create the filesystem with an
ext3 journal. If the -J option is not specified, the default
journal parameters will be used to create an appropriately
sized journal (given <br>
the size of the filesystem) stored within the filesystem.
Note that you must be using a kernel which has ext3 support
in order to actually make use of the journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J journal-options <br>
Create the ext3 journal using options specified on the
command-line. Journal options are comma separated, and may
take an argument using the equals (&rsquo;=&rsquo;) sign.
The fol&acirc; <br>
lowing journal options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=journal-size <br>
Create an internal journal (i.e., stored inside the
filesystem) of size journal-size megabytes. The size of the
journal must be at least 1024 filesystem <br>
blocks (i.e., 1MB if using 1k blocks, 4MB if using 4k
blocks, etc.) and may be no more than 10,240,000 filesystem
blocks or half the total file system size <br>
(whichever is smaller)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">device=external-journal <br>
Attach the filesystem to the journal block device located on
external-journal. The external journal must already have
been created using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mke2fs -O journal_dev
external-journal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that external-journal must
have been created with the same block size as the new
filesystem. In addition, while there is support for
attaching multiple <br>
filesystems to a single external journal, the Linux kernel
and e2fsck(8) do not currently support shared external
journals yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of specifying a device
name directly, external-journal can also be specified by
either LABEL=label or UUID=UUID to locate the external
journal by <br>
either the volume label or UUID stored in the ext2
superblock at the start of the journal. Use dumpe2fs(8) to
display a journal device&rsquo;s volume label and <br>
UUID. See also the -L option of tune2fs(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one of the size or device
options can be given for a filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename <br>
Read the bad blocks list from filename. Note that the block
numbers in the bad block list must be generated using the
same block size as used by mke2fs. As a result, the <br>
-c option to mke2fs is a much simpler and less error-prone
method of checking a disk for bad blocks before formatting
it, as mke2fs will automatically pass the correct <br>
parameters to the badblocks program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L new-volume-label <br>
Set the volume label for the filesystem to new-volume-label.
The maximum length of the volume label is 16 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m reserved-blocks-percentage
<br>
Specify the percentage of the filesystem blocks reserved for
the super-user. This avoids fragmentation, and allows
root-owned daemons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to <br>
function correctly after non-privileged processes are
prevented from writing to the filesystem. The default
percentage is 5%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M last-mounted-directory <br>
Set the last mounted directory for the filesystem. This
might be useful for the sake of utilities that key off of
the last mounted directory to determine where the <br>
filesystem should be mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Causes mke2fs to not actually
create a filesystem, but display what it would do if it were
to create a filesystem. This can be used to determine the
location of the <br>
backup superblocks for a particular filesystem, so long as
the mke2fs parameters that were passed when the filesystem
was originally created are used again. (With the -n <br>
option added, of course!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N number-of-inodes <br>
Overrides the default calculation of the number of inodes
that should be reserved for the filesystem (which is based
on the number of blocks and the bytes-per-inode <br>
ratio). This allows the user to specify the number of
desired inodes directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o creator-os <br>
Overrides the default value of the &quot;creator operating
system&quot; field of the filesystem. The creator field is
set by default to the name of the OS the mke2fs executable
was <br>
compiled for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O feature[,...] <br>
Create a filesystem with the given features (filesystem
options), overriding the default filesystem options. The
features that are enabled by default are specified by the
<br>
base_features relation, either in the [defaults] section in
the /etc/mke2fs.conf configuration file, or in the
[fs_types] subsections for the usage types as specified by
<br>
the -T option, further modified by the features relation
found in the [fs_types] subsections for the filesystem and
usage types. See the mke2fs.conf(5) manual page for <br>
more details. The filesystem type-specific configuration
setting found in the [fs_types] section will override the
global default found in [defaults].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem feature set will
be further edited using either the feature set specified by
this option, or if this option is not given, by the
default_features relation <br>
for the filesystem type being created, or in the [defaults]
section of the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem feature set is
comprised of a list of features, separated by commas, that
are to be enabled. To disable a feature, simply prefix the
feature name with a <br>
caret (&rsquo;^&rsquo;) or a minus (&rsquo;-&rsquo;)
character. Features with dependencies will not be removed
successfully. The pseudo-filesystem feature &quot;none&quot;
will clear all filesystem fea&acirc; <br>
tures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
features which can be set, please see <br>
the manual page ext4(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet execution. Useful if
mke2fs is run in a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r revision <br>
Set the filesystem revision for the new filesystem. Note
that 1.2 kernels only support revision 0 filesystems. The
default is to create revision 1 filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Write superblock and group
descriptors only. This is useful if all of the superblock
and backup superblocks are corrupted, and a last-ditch
recovery method is desired. <br>
It causes mke2fs to reinitialize the superblock and group
descriptors, while not touching the inode table and the
block and inode bitmaps. The e2fsck program should be <br>
run immediately after this option is used, and there is no
guarantee that any data will be salvageable. It is critical
to specify the correct filesystem blocksize when <br>
using this option, or there is no chance of recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t fs-type <br>
Specify the filesystem type (i.e., ext2, ext3, ext4, etc.)
that is to be created. If this option is not specified,
mke2fs will pick a default either via how the command <br>
was run (for example, using a name of the form mkfs.ext2,
mkfs.ext3, etc.) or via a default as defined by the
/etc/mke2fs.conf file. This option controls which
filesys&acirc; <br>
tem options are used by default, based on the fstypes
configuration stanza in /etc/mke2fs.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -O option is used to
explicitly add or remove filesystem options that should be
set in the newly created filesystem, the resulting
filesystem may not be supported <br>
by the requested fs-type. (e.g., &quot;mke2fs -t ext3 -O
extent /dev/sdXX&quot; will create a filesystem that is not
supported by the ext3 implementation as found in the Linux
ker&acirc; <br>
nel; and &quot;mke2fs -t ext3 -O ^has_journal
/dev/hdXX&quot; will create a filesystem that does not have
a journal and hence will not be supported by the ext3
filesystem code in <br>
the Linux kernel.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T usage-type[,...] <br>
Specify how the filesystem is going to be used, so that
mke2fs can choose optimal filesystem parameters for that
use. The usage types that are supported are defined in <br>
the configuration file /etc/mke2fs.conf. The user may
specify one or more usage types using a comma separated
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is is not
specified, mke2fs will pick a single default usage type
based on the size of the filesystem to be created. If the
filesystem size is less than or <br>
equal to 3 megabytes, mke2fs will use the filesystem type
floppy. If the filesystem size is greater than 3 but less
than or equal to 512 megabytes, mke2fs(8) will use the <br>
filesystem type small. If the filesystem size is greater
than or equal to 4 terabytes but less than 16 terabytes,
mke2fs(8) will use the filesystem type big. If the <br>
filesystem size is greater than or equal to 16 terabytes,
mke2fs(8) will use the filesystem type huge. Otherwise,
mke2fs(8) will use the default filesystem type default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U UUID <br>
Create the filesystem with the specified UUID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number of
mke2fs and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
MKE2FS_SYNC <br>
If set to non-zero integer value, its value is used to
determine how often sync(2) is called during inode table
initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKE2FS_CONFIG <br>
Determines the location of the configuration file (see
mke2fs.conf(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKE2FS_FIRST_META_BG <br>
If set to non-zero integer value, its value is used to
determine first meta block group. This is mostly for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKE2FS_DEVICE_SECTSIZE <br>
If set to non-zero integer value, its value is used to
determine physical sector size of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKE2FS_SKIP_CHECK_MSG <br>
If set, do not show the message of filesystem automatic
check caused by mount count or check interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>

Ts&rsquo;o &lt;tytso@mit.edu&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
mke2fs accepts the -f option but currently ignores it
because the second extended file system does not support
fragments yet. <br>
There may be other ones. Please, report them to the
