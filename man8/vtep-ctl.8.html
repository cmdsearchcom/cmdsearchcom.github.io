<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vtep-ctl - utility for querying and configuring a VTEP
database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vtep-ctl [options] -- [options] command [args] [-- [options]
command [args]]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The vtep-ctl program configures a VTEP database. See vtep(5)
for comprehensive documentation of the database schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vtep-ctl connects to an
ovsdb-server process that maintains a VTEP configuration
database. Using this connection, it queries and possibly
applies changes to the database, <br>
depending on the supplied commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vtep-ctl can perform any number
of commands in a single run, implemented as a single atomic
transaction against the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vtep-ctl command line begins
with global options (see OPTIONS below for details). The
global options are followed by one or more commands. Each
command should begin with -- <br>
by itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from
the following commands. (The -- before the first command is
optional.) The command itself starts with command-specific
<br>
options, if any, followed by the command name and any
arguments. See EXAMPLES below for syntax examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options affect the behavior vtep-ctl as a
whole. Some individual commands also accept their own
options, which are given just before the command name. If
the <br>
first command on the command line has options, then those
options must be separated from the global options by --.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--db=server <br>
Sets server as the database server that vtep-ctl contacts to
query or modify configuration. The default is
unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock. server must take one of
the <br>
following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl:ip:port <br>
The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4
or IPv6 address format. If ip is an IPv6 <br>
address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
ssl:[::1]:6640. The --private-key, --certificate, and
--ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp:ip:port <br>
Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4 or
IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with
square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:file <br>
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a local
named pipe that is represented by a file created in the path
file to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssl:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given SSL port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but specifying ip limits connections to those
from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If ip is an
IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack&acirc; <br>
ets, e.g.: pssl:6640:[::1]. The --private-key,
--certificate, and --ca-cert options are mandatory when this
form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptcp:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given TCP port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but ip may be specified to listen only for
connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If
ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square <br>
brackets, e.g.: ptcp:6640:[::1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punix:file <br>
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named file
for a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, listen on a local
named pipe. A file is created in the path file to mimic the
behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-syslog <br>
By default, vtep-ctl logs its arguments and the details of
any changes that it makes to the system log. This option
disables this logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
--verbose=vtep_ctl:syslog:warn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oneline <br>
Modifies the output format so that the output for each
command is printed on a single line. New-line characters
that would otherwise separate lines are printed as 0 and
<br>
any instances of &nbsp;that would otherwise appear in the
output are doubled. Prints a blank line for each command
that has no output. This option does not affect the
for&acirc; <br>
matting of output from the list or find commands; see Table
Formatting Options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run <br>
Prevents vtep-ctl from actually modifying the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t secs <br>
--timeout=secs <br>
By default, or with a secs of 0, vtep-ctl waits forever for
a response from the database. This option limits runtime to
approximately secs seconds. If the timeout <br>
expires, vtep-ctl will exit with a SIGALRM signal. (A
timeout would normally happen only if the database cannot be
contacted, or if the system is overloaded.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table Formatting Options <br>
These options control the format of output from the list and
find commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f format <br>
--format=format <br>
Sets the type of table formatting. The following types of
format are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">table 2-D text tables with
aligned columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list (default) <br>
A list with one column per line and rows separated by a
blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">html HTML tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csv Comma-separated values as
defined in RFC 4180.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">json JSON format as defined in
RFC 4627. The output is a sequence of JSON objects, each of
which corresponds to one table. Each JSON object has the
following members <br>
with the noted values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caption <br>
The table&rsquo;s caption. This member is omitted if the
table has no caption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headings <br>
An array with one element per table column. Each array
element is a string giving the corresponding column&rsquo;s
heading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data An array with one element
per table row. Each element is also an array with one
element per table column. The elements of this second-level
array are the <br>
cells that constitute the table. Cells that represent OVSDB
data or data types are expressed in the format described in
the OVSDB specification; other cells <br>
are simply expressed as text strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d format <br>
--data=format <br>
Sets the formatting for cells within output tables. The
following types of format are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string (default) <br>
The simple format described in the Database Values section
of ovs-vsctl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bare The simple format with
punctuation stripped off: [] and {} are omitted around sets,
maps, and empty columns, items within sets and maps are
space-separated, and <br>
strings are never quoted. This format may be easier for
scripts to parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">json JSON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The json output format always
outputs cells in JSON format, ignoring this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-heading <br>
This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise
appears in the first row of table output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pretty <br>
By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as
possible. This option causes JSON in output to be printed in
a more readable fashion. Members of objects and ele&acirc;
<br>
ments of arrays are printed one per line, with
indentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not affect JSON
in tables, which is always printed compactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bare Equivalent to
--format=list --data=bare --no-headings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public Key Infrastructure
Options <br>
-p privkey.pem <br>
--private-key=privkey.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
vtep-ctl&rsquo;s identity for outgoing SSL connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cert.pem <br>
--certificate=cert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies
the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the <br>
certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections
will use to verify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cacert.pem <br>
--ca-cert=cacert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
vtep-ctl should use to verify certificates presented to it
by SSL peers. (This may be the same certificate that <br>
SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on -c or
--certificate, or it may be a different one, depending on
the PKI design in use.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C none <br>
--ca-cert=none <br>
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
peers. This introduces a security risk, because it means
that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
<br>
trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
<br>
When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as
-C or --ca-cert. If it does not exist, then vtep-ctl will
attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL <br>
peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named
PEM file. If it is successful, it will immediately drop the
connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL <br>
connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by
the CA certificate thus obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option exposes the SSL
connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the
initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for
bootstrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only useful if
the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as part of the SSL
certificate chain. The SSL protocol does not require the
server to send the CA cer&acirc; <br>
tificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mutually
exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--peer-ca-cert=peer-cacert.pem
<br>
Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional
certificates to send to SSL peers. peer-cacert.pem should be
the CA certificate used to sign vtep-ctl&rsquo;s own
cer&acirc; <br>
tificate, that is, the certificate specified on -c or
--certificate. If vtep-ctl&rsquo;s certificate is
self-signed, then --certificate and --peer-ca-cert should
specify the <br>
same file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not useful in
normal operation, because the SSL peer must already have the
CA certificate for the peer to have any confidence in
vtep-ctl&rsquo;s identity. How&acirc; <br>
ever, this offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap
the CA certificate on its first SSL connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[spec] <br>
--verbose=[spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively. (If
--detach is specified, vtep-ctl <br>
closes its standard file descriptors, so logging to the
console will have no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be fil&acirc; <br>
tered out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8)
for a definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
--log-file is also specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
--verbose=dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vPATTERN:destination:pattern
<br>
--verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vFACILITY:facility <br>
--verbose=FACILITY:facility <br>
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can
be one of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, <br>
local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
local7. If this option is not specified, daemon is used as
the default for the local system syslog and local0 is <br>
used while sending a message to the target provided via the
--syslog-target option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file[=file] <br>
Enables logging to a file. If file is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
file name used if file is omitted is /var/log/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/vtep-ctl.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-target=host:port <br>
Send syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the
system syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-method=method <br>
Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog
daemon. Following forms are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libc, use libc
syslog() function. This is the default behavior. Downside of
using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actu&acirc; <br>
ally sent to the syslog daemon over /dev/log UNIX domain
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file, use
UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify
arbitrary message format with this option. However, rsyslogd
8.9 and older versions use hard <br>
coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket
use. If you want to use arbitrary message format with older
rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to <br>
localhost IP address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; udp:ip:port, use
UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary
message format also with older rsyslogd. When sending syslog
messages over UDP <br>
socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for
example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
the specified UDP port, accidental iptables <br>
rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and
there are some security considerations that apply to UDP
sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints version information to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The commands implemented by vtep-ctl are described in the
sections below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Physical Switch Commands <br>
These commands examine and manipulate physical switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--may-exist] add-ps pswitch
<br>
Creates a new physical switch named pswitch. Initially the
switch will have no ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --may-exist, attempting
to create a switch that exists is an error. With
--may-exist, this command does nothing if pswitch already
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] del-ps pswitch
<br>
Deletes pswitch and all of its ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, attempting
to delete a switch that does not exist is an error. With
--if-exists, attempting to delete a switch that does not
exist has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-ps <br>
Lists all existing physical switches on standard output, one
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps-exists pswitch <br>
Tests whether pswitch exists. If so, vtep-ctl exits
successfully with exit code 0. If not, vtep-ctl exits
unsuccessfully with exit code 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Port Commands <br>
These commands examine and manipulate VTEP physical
ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-ports pswitch <br>
Lists all of the ports within pswitch on standard output,
one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--may-exist] add-port pswitch
port <br>
Creates on pswitch a new port named port from the network
device of the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --may-exist, attempting
to create a port that exists is an error. With --may-exist,
this command does nothing if port already exists on
pswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] del-port [pswitch]
port <br>
Deletes port. If pswitch is omitted, port is removed from
whatever switch contains it; if pswitch is specified, it
must be the switch that contains port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, attempting
to delete a port that does not exist is an error. With
--if-exists, attempting to delete a port that does not exist
has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical Switch Commands <br>
These commands examine and manipulate logical switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--may-exist] add-ls lswitch
<br>
Creates a new logical switch named lswitch. Initially the
switch will have no locator bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --may-exist, attempting
to create a switch that exists is an error. With
--may-exist, this command does nothing if lswitch already
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] del-ls lswitch
<br>
Deletes lswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, attempting
to delete a switch that does not exist is an error. With
--if-exists, attempting to delete a switch that does not
exist has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-ls <br>
Lists all existing logical switches on standard output, one
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls-exists lswitch <br>
Tests whether lswitch exists. If so, vtep-ctl exits
successfully with exit code 0. If not, vtep-ctl exits
unsuccessfully with exit code 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-ls pswitch port vlan
lswitch <br>
Bind logical switch lswitch to the port/vlan combination on
the physical switch pswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unbind-ls pswitch port vlan <br>
Remove the logical switch binding from the port/vlan
combination on the physical switch pswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-bindings pswitch port <br>
List the logical switch bindings for port on the physical
switch pswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-replication-mode lswitch
replication-mode <br>
Set logical switch lswitch replication mode to
replication-mode; the only valid values for replication mode
are &quot;service_node&quot; and &quot;source_node&quot;.
For handling L2 broad&acirc; <br>
cast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic, packets can be
sent to all members of a logical switch referenced by a
physical switch. There are different modes to repli&acirc;
<br>
cate the packets. The default mode of replication is to send
the traffic to a service node, which can be a hypervisor,
server or appliance, and let the service node han&acirc;
<br>
dle replication to other transport nodes (hypervisors or
other VTEP physical switches). This mode is called service
node replication. An alternate mode of replication, <br>
called source node replication involves the source node
sending to all other transport nodes. Hypervisors are always
responsible for doing their own replication for <br>
locally attached VMs in both modes. Service node mode is the
default, if the replication mode is not explicitly set.
Service node replication mode is considered a basic <br>
requirement because it only requires sending the packet to a
single transport node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-replication-mode lswitch
<br>
Get logical switch lswitch replication mode. The only valid
values for replication mode are &quot;service_node&quot; and
&quot;source_node&quot;. An empty reply for replication mode
implies <br>
a default of &quot;service_node&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical Router Commands <br>
These commands examine and manipulate logical routers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--may-exist] add-lr lrouter
<br>
Creates a new logical router named lrouter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --may-exist, attempting
to create a router that exists is an error. With
--may-exist, this command does nothing if lrouter already
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] del-lr lrouter
<br>
Deletes lrouter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, attempting
to delete a router that does not exist is an error. With
--if-exists, attempting to delete a router that does not
exist has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-lr <br>
Lists all existing logical routers on standard output, one
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lr-exists lrouter <br>
Tests whether lrouter exists. If so, vtep-ctl exits
successfully with exit code 0. If not, vtep-ctl exits
unsuccessfully with exit code 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local MAC Binding Commands <br>
These commands examine and manipulate local MAC bindings for
the logical switch. The local maps are written by the VTEP
to refer to MACs it has learned on its physical ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-ucast-local lswitch mac
[encap] ip <br>
Map the unicast Ethernet address mac to the physical
location ip using encapsulation encap on lswitch. If encap
is not specified, the default is
&quot;vxlan_over_ipv4&quot;. The <br>
local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to MACs learned
on its physical ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-ucast-local lswitch mac <br>
Remove the local unicast Ethernet address mac map from
lswitch. The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to
MACs learned on its physical ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-mcast-local lswitch mac
[encap] ip <br>
Add physical location ip using encapsulation encap to the
local mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address mac
on lswitch. If encap is not specified, the default is <br>
&quot;vxlan_over_ipv4&quot;. The local mappings are used by
the VTEP to refer to MACs learned on its physical ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-mcast-local lswitch mac
[encap] ip <br>
Remove physical location ip using encapsulation encap from
the local mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address
mac on lswitch. If encap is not specified, the <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear-local-macs lswitch <br>
Clear the local MAC bindings for lswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-local-macs lswitch <br>
List the local MAC bindings for lswitch, one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote MAC Binding Commands <br>
These commands examine and manipulate local and remote MAC
bindings for the logical switch. The remote maps are written
by the network virtualization controller to refer to MACs
<br>
that it has learned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-ucast-remote lswitch mac
[encap] ip <br>
Map the unicast Ethernet address mac to the physical
location ip using encapsulation encap on lswitch. If encap
is not specified, the default is
&quot;vxlan_over_ipv4&quot;. The <br>
remote mappings are used by the network virtualization
platform to refer to MACs that it has learned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-ucast-remote lswitch mac
<br>
Remove the remote unicast Ethernet address mac map from
lswitch. The remote mappings are used by the network
virtualization platform to refer to MACs that it has
learned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-mcast-remote lswitch mac
[encap] ip <br>
Add physical location ip using encapsulation encap to the
remote mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address mac
on lswitch. If encap is not specified, the default <br>
is &quot;vxlan_over_ipv4&quot;. The remote mappings are used
by the network virtualization platform to refer to MACs that
it has learned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-mcast-remote lswitch mac
[encap] ip <br>
Remove physical location ip using encapsulation encap from
the remote mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address
mac on lswitch. If encap is not specified, the <br>
default is &quot;vxlan_over_ipv4&quot;. The remote mappings
are used by the network virtualization platform to refer to
MACs that it has learned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear-remote-macs lswitch <br>
Clear the remote MAC bindings for lswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-remote-macs lswitch <br>
List the remote MAC bindings for lswitch, one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manager Connectivity <br>
These commands manipulate the managers column in the Global
table and rows in the Managers table. When ovsdb-server is
configured to use the managers column for OVSDB
connec&acirc; <br>
tions (as described in the startup scripts provided with
Open vSwitch), this allows the administrator to use vtep-ctl
to configure database connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-manager <br>
Prints the configured manager(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-manager <br>
Deletes the configured manager(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-manager target... <br>
Sets the configured manager target or targets. Each target
may use any of the following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl:ip:port <br>
The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4
or IPv6 address format. If ip is an IPv6 <br>
address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
ssl:[::1]:6640. The --private-key, --certificate, and
--ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp:ip:port <br>
Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4 or
IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with
square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:file <br>
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a local
named pipe that is represented by a file created in the path
file to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssl:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given SSL port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but specifying ip limits connections to those
from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If ip is an
IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack&acirc; <br>
ets, e.g.: pssl:6640:[::1]. The --private-key,
--certificate, and --ca-cert options are mandatory when this
form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptcp:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given TCP port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but ip may be specified to listen only for
connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If
ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square <br>
brackets, e.g.: ptcp:6640:[::1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punix:file <br>
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named file
for a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, listen on a local
named pipe. A file is created in the path file to mimic the
behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database Commands <br>
These commands query and modify the contents of ovsdb
tables. They are a slight abstraction of the ovsdb interface
and as such they operate at a lower level than other
vtep-ctl <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Identifying Tables, Records, and
Columns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these commands has a
table parameter to identify a table within the database.
Many of them also take a record parameter that identifies a
particular record within a ta&acirc; <br>
ble. The record parameter may be the UUID for a record, and
many tables offer additional ways to identify records. Some
commands also take column parameters that identify a <br>
particular field within the records in a table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following tables are
currently defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global Top-level configuration
for a hardware VTEP. This table contains exactly one record,
identified by specifying . as the record name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manager <br>
Configuration for an OVSDB connection. Records may be
identified by target (e.g. tcp:1.2.3.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Physical_Switch <br>
A physical switch that implements a VTEP. Records may be
identified by physical switch name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Physical_Port <br>
A port within a physical switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical_Binding_Stats <br>
Reports statistics for the logical switch with which a VLAN
on a physical port is associated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical_Switch <br>
A logical Ethernet switch. Records may be identified by
logical switch name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ucast_Macs_Local <br>
Mapping of locally discovered unicast MAC addresses to
tunnels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ucast_Macs_Remote <br>
Mapping of remotely programmed unicast MAC addresses to
tunnels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mcast_Macs_Local <br>
Mapping of locally discovered multicast MAC addresses to
tunnels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mcast_Macs_Remote <br>
Mapping of remotely programmed multicast MAC addresses to
tunnels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Physical_Locator_Set <br>
A set of one or more physical locators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Physical_Locator <br>
Identifies an endpoint to which logical switch traffic may
be encapsulated and forwarded. Records may be identified by
physical locator name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Record names must be specified
in full and with correct capitalization. Names of tables and
columns are not case-sensitive, and -- and _ are treated
interchangeably. Unique <br>
abbreviations are acceptable, e.g. man or m is sufficient to
identify the Manager table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database Values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each column in the database
accepts a fixed type of data. The currently defined basic
types, and their representations, are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integer <br>
A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1,
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">real A floating-point
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean <br>
True or false, written true or false, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string An arbitrary Unicode
string, except that null bytes are not allowed. Quotes are
optional for most strings that begin with an English letter
or underscore and consist only <br>
of letters, underscores, hyphens, and periods. However, true
and false and strings that match the syntax of UUIDs (see
below) must be enclosed in double quotes to distin&acirc;
<br>
guish them from other basic types. When double quotes are
used, the syntax is that of strings in JSON, e.g.
backslashes may be used to escape special characters. The
<br>
empty string must be represented as a pair of double quotes
(&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUID Either a universally unique
identifier in the style of RFC 4122, e.g.
f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6, or an @name defined by
a get or create command within the same <br>
vtep-ctl invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple values in a single
column may be separated by spaces or a single comma. When
multiple values are present, duplicates are not allowed, and
order is not important. Con&acirc; <br>
versely, some database columns can have an empty set of
values, represented as [], and square brackets may
optionally enclose other non-empty sets or single values as
well. For a <br>
column accepting a set of integers, database commands accept
a range. A range is represented by two integers separated by
-. A range is inclusive. A range has a maximum size of <br>
4096 elements. If more elements are needed, they can be
specified in seperate ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few database columns are
&lsquo;&lsquo;maps&rsquo;&rsquo; of key-value pairs, where
the key and the value are each some fixed database type.
These are specified in the form key=value, where key and
<br>
value follow the syntax for the column&rsquo;s key type and
value type, respectively. When multiple pairs are present
(separated by spaces or a comma), duplicate keys are not
allowed, <br>
and again the order is not important. Duplicate values are
allowed. An empty map is represented as {}. Curly braces may
optionally enclose non-empty maps as well (but use <br>
quotes to prevent the shell from expanding
other-config={0=x,1=y} into other-config=0=x
other-config=1=y, which may not have the desired
effect).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database Command Syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists]
[--columns=column[,column]...] list table [record]... <br>
Lists the data in each specified record. If no records are
specified, lists all the records in table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --columns is specified, only
the requested columns are listed, in the specified order.
Otherwise, all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by
column name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if any specified record does not exist. With
--if-exists, the command ignores any record that does not
exist, without producing any <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--columns=column[,column]...]
find table [column[:key]=value]... <br>
Lists the data in each record in table whose column equals
value or, if key is specified, whose column contains a key
with the specified value. The following operators <br>
may be used where = is written in the syntax summary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= <br>
Selects records in which column[:key] equals, does not
equal, is less than, is greater than, is less than or equal
to, or is greater than or equal to value, respec&acirc; <br>
tively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider column[:key] and value
as sets of elements. Identical sets are considered equal.
Otherwise, if the sets have different numbers of elements,
then the set <br>
with more elements is considered to be larger. Otherwise,
consider a element from each set pairwise, in increasing
order within each set. The first pair that dif&acirc; <br>
fers determines the result. (For a column that contains
key-value pairs, first all the keys are compared, and values
are considered only if the two sets contain <br>
identical keys.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{=} {!=} <br>
Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&lt;=} Selects records in which
column[:key] is a subset of value. For example,
flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2 selects records in which the
flood-vlans column is the empty set or <br>
contains 1 or 2 or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&lt;} Selects records in which
column[:key] is a proper subset of value. For example,
flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2 selects records in which the
flood-vlans column is the empty set <br>
or contains 1 or 2 but not both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&gt;=} {&gt;} <br>
Same as {&lt;=} and {&lt;}, respectively, except that the
relationship is reversed. For example, flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2
selects records in which the flood-vlans column con&acirc;
<br>
tains both 1 and 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For arithmetic operators (= !=
&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=), when key is specified but a
particular record&rsquo;s column does not contain key, the
record is always omitted from the results. <br>
Thus, the condition other-config:mtu!=1500 matches records
that have a mtu key whose value is not 1500, but not those
that lack an mtu key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the set operators, when key
is specified but a particular record&rsquo;s column does not
contain key, the comparison is done against an empty set.
Thus, the condition <br>
other-config:mtu{!=}1500 matches records that have a mtu key
whose value is not 1500 and those that lack an mtu key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t forget to escape
&lt; or &gt; from interpretation by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --columns is specified, only
the requested columns are listed, in the specified order.
Otherwise all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by
column name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UUIDs shown for rows created
in the same vtep-ctl invocation will be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] [--id=@name] get
table record [column[:key]]... <br>
Prints the value of each specified column in the given
record in table. For map columns, a key may optionally be
specified, in which case the value associated with key in
<br>
the column is printed, instead of the entire map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist or key is specified, if key
does not exist in record. With --if-exists, a missing record
yields no output and <br>
a missing key prints a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If @name is specified, then the
UUID for record may be referred to by that name later in the
same vtep-ctl invocation in contexts where a UUID is
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both --id and the column
arguments are optional, but usually at least one or the
other should be specified. If both are omitted, then get has
no effect except to verify <br>
that record exists in table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--id and --if-exists cannot be
used together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] set table record
column[:key]=value... <br>
Sets the value of each specified column in the given record
in table to value. For map columns, a key may optionally be
specified, in which case the value associated with <br>
key in that column is changed (or added, if none exists),
instead of the entire map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist. With --if-exists, this
command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] add table record
column [key=]value... <br>
Adds the specified value or key-value pair to column in
record in table. If column is a map, then key is required,
otherwise it is prohibited. If key already exists in a <br>
map column, then the current value is not replaced (use the
set command to replace an existing value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist. With --if-exists, this
command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] remove table
record column value... <br>
[--if-exists] remove table record column key... <br>
[--if-exists] remove table record column key=value... <br>
Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from column
in record in table. The first form applies to columns that
are not maps: each specified value is removed from <br>
the column. The second and third forms apply to map columns:
if only a key is specified, then any key-value pair with the
given key is removed, regardless of its value; <br>
if a value is given then a pair is removed only if both key
and value match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not an error if the column
does not contain the specified key or value or pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist. With --if-exists, this
command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] clear table record
column... <br>
Sets each column in record in table to the empty set or
empty map, as appropriate. This command applies only to
columns that are allowed to be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist. With --if-exists, this
command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--id=@name] create table
column[:key]=value... <br>
Creates a new record in table and sets the initial values of
each column. Columns not explicitly set will receive their
default values. Outputs the UUID of the new row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If @name is specified, then the
UUID for the new row may be referred to by that name
elsewhere in the same vtep-ctl invocation in contexts where
a UUID is expected. Such <br>
references may precede or follow the create command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution (ovs-vsctl as exmaple)
<br>
Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only
when they can be reached directly or indirectly from the
Open_vSwitch table. Except for records in the <br>
QoS or Queue tables, records that are not reachable from the
Open_vSwitch table are automatically deleted from the
database. This deletion happens immediately, <br>
without waiting for additional ovs-vsctl commands or other
database activity. Thus, a create command must generally be
accompanied by additional commands within <br>
the same ovs-vsctl invocation to add a chain of references
to the newly created record from the top-level Open_vSwitch
record. The EXAMPLES section gives some <br>
examples that show how to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] destroy table
record... <br>
Deletes each specified record from table. Unless --if-exists
is specified, each records must exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all destroy table <br>
Deletes all records from the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution (ovs-vsctl as exmaple)
<br>
The destroy command is only useful for records in the QoS or
Queue tables. Records in other tables are automatically
deleted from the database when they become <br>
unreachable from the Open_vSwitch table. This means that
deleting the last reference to a record is sufficient for
deleting the record itself. For records in <br>
these tables, destroy is silently ignored. See the EXAMPLES
section below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait-until table record
[column[:key]=value]... <br>
Waits until table contains a record named record whose
column equals value or, if key is specified, whose column
contains a key with the specified value. Any of the
oper&acirc; <br>
ators !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, or &gt;= may be substituted for
= to test for inequality, less than, greater than, less than
or equal to, or greater than or equal to, respectively. <br>
(Don&rsquo;t forget to escape &lt; or &gt; from
interpretation by the shell.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no column[:key]=value
arguments are given, this command waits only until record
exists. If more than one such argument is given, the command
waits until all of them <br>
are satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution (ovs-vsctl as exmaple)
<br>
Usually wait-until should be placed at the beginning of a
set of ovs-vsctl commands. For example, wait-until bridge
br0 -- get bridge br0 datapath_id waits until a <br>
bridge named br0 is created, then prints its datapath_id
column, whereas get bridge br0 datapath_id -- wait-until
bridge br0 will abort if no bridge named br0 <br>
exists when ovs-vsctl initially connects to the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider specifying --timeout=0
along with --wait-until, to prevent vtep-ctl from
terminating after waiting only at most 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment [arg]... <br>
This command has no effect on behavior, but any database log
record created by the command will include the command and
its arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
