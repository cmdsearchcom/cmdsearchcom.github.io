<p>FANCONTROL(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FANCONTROL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fancontrol - automated software based fan speed
regulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fancontrol [configfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fancontrol is a shell script for use with lm_sensors. It
reads its configuration from a file, then calculates fan
speeds from temperatures and sets the corresponding PWM
outputs <br>
to the computed values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Please be careful when using the fan control features of
your mainboard, in addition to the risk of burning your CPU,
at higher temperatures there will be a higher wearout of
<br>
your other hardware components, too. So if you plan to use
these components in 50 years, maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t use
fancontrol at all. Also please keep in mind most fans
aren&rsquo;t <br>
designed to be powered by a PWMed voltage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practice it doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be a major issue, the fans will get slightly warmer,
just be sure to have a temperature alarm and/or shutdown
call, in case some fan fails, because <br>
you probably won&rsquo;t hear it anymore ;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
For easy configuration, there&rsquo;s a script named
pwmconfig(8) which lets you interactively write your
configuration file for fancontrol. Alternatively you can
write this file your&acirc; <br>
self using the information from this manpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since most of you are going to
use pwmconfig(8) script, the config file syntax will be
discussed last. First I&rsquo;m going to describe the
various variables available for changing <br>
fancontrol&rsquo;s behaviour:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERVAL <br>
This variable defines at which interval in seconds the main
loop of fancontrol will be executed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVPATH <br>
Maps hwmon class devices to physical devices. This lets
fancontrol check that the configuration file is still
up-to-date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVNAME <br>
Records hwmon class device names. This lets fancontrol check
that the configuration file is still up-to-date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FCTEMPS <br>
Maps PWM outputs to temperature sensors so fancontrol knows
which temperature sensors should be used for calculation of
new values for the corresponding PWM outputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FCFANS Records the association
between a PWM output and a fan input. Then fancontrol can
check the fan speed and restart it if it stops
unexpectedly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINTEMP <br>
The temperature below which the fan gets switched to minimum
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXTEMP <br>
The temperature over which the fan gets switched to maximum
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINSTART <br>
Sets the minimum speed at which the fan begins spinning. You
should use a safe value to be sure it works, even when the
fan gets old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINSTOP <br>
The minimum speed at which the fan still spins. Use a safe
value here, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINPWM The PWM value to use when
the temperature is below MINTEMP. Typically, this will be
either 0 if it is OK for the fan to plain stop, or the same
value as MINSTOP if you <br>
don&rsquo;t want the fan to ever stop. If this value
isn&rsquo;t defined, it defaults to 0 (stopped fan).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXPWM The PWM value to use when
the temperature is over MAXTEMP. If this value isn&rsquo;t
defined, it defaults to 255 (full speed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file format is
a bit strange:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLE=chip/pwmdev=value
chip/pwmdev2=value2 <br>
VARIABLE2=...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each variable has its own line.
The variable name is followed by an equal sign and the
device=value pairs. These consist of the path to the pwm
output for which the value is <br>
valid, equal sign followed by the value and are separated by
a blank. Path can be absolute or relative (from
/sys/bus/i2c/devices or /sys/class/hwmon depending on the
kernel ver&acirc; <br>
sion). Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINTEMP=hwmon0/device/pwm1=40
hwmon0/device/pwm2=54</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You have to play with the
temperature values a bit to get happy. For initial setup I
recommend using the pwmconfig script. Small changes can be
made by editing the config file <br>
directly following the rules above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon starting, fancontrol will
make sure that all referenced devices do exist and match
what they were at configuration time, and that all
referenced sysfs files do exist. If <br>
not, it will quit immediately, upon the assumption that the
configuration file may be out-of-sync with the loaded kernel
drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE ALGORITHM <br>
fancontrol first reads its configuration, writes it to
arrays and loops its main function. This function gets the
temperatures and fanspeeds from kernel driver files and
calcu&acirc; <br>
lates new speeds depending on temperature changes, but only
if the temp is between MINTEMP and MAXTEMP. After that, the
new values are written to the PWM outputs. Currently the
<br>
speed increases quadratically with rising temperature. This
way you won&rsquo;t hear your fans most of the time at
best.</p>
