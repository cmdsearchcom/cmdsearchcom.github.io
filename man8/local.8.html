<p>LOCAL(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual LOCAL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
local - Postfix local mail delivery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
local [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The local(8) daemon processes delivery requests from the
Postfix queue manager to deliver mail to local recipients.
Each delivery request specifies a queue file, a sender <br>
address, a domain or host to deliver to, and one or more
recipients. This program expects to be run from the
master(8) process manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local(8) daemon updates
queue files and marks recipients as finished, or it informs
the queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a
later time. Delivery status <br>
reports are sent to the bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8)
daemon as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CASE FOLDING <br>
All delivery decisions are made using the bare recipient
name (i.e. the address localpart), folded to lower case. See
also under ADDRESS EXTENSION below for a few exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM-WIDE AND USER-LEVEL
ALIASING <br>
The system administrator can set up one or more system-wide
sendmail-style alias databases. Users can have
sendmail-style ~/.forward files. Mail for name is delivered
to the <br>
alias name, to destinations in ~name/.forward, to the
mailbox owned by the user name, or it is sent back as
undeliverable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system administrator can
specify a comma/space separated list of ~/.forward like
files through the forward_path configuration parameter. Upon
delivery, the local delivery <br>
agent tries each pathname in the list until a file is
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delivery via ~/.forward files is
done with the privileges of the recipient. Thus, ~/.forward
like files must be readable by the recipient, and their
parent directory needs to <br>
have &quot;execute&quot; permission for the recipient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The forward_path parameter is
subject to interpolation of $user (recipient username),
$home (recipient home directory), $shell (recipient shell),
$recipient (complete recipient <br>
address), $extension (recipient address extension), $domain
(recipient domain), $local (entire recipient address
localpart) and $recipient_delimiter. The forms ${name?value}
and <br>
${name:value} expand conditionally to value when $name is
(is not) defined. Characters that may have special meaning
to the shell or file system are replaced by underscores.
<br>
The list of acceptable characters is specified with the
forward_expansion_filter configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alias or ~/.forward file may
list any combination of external commands, destination file
names, :include: directives, or mail addresses. See
aliases(5) for a precise descrip&acirc; <br>
tion. Each line in a user&rsquo;s .forward file has the same
syntax as the right-hand part of an alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an address is found in its
own alias expansion, delivery is made to the user instead.
When a user is listed in the user&rsquo;s own ~/.forward
file, delivery is made to the user&rsquo;s <br>
mailbox instead. An empty ~/.forward file means do not
forward mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent the mail
system from using up unreasonable amounts of memory, input
records read from :include: or from ~/.forward files are
broken up into chunks of length <br>
line_length_limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While expanding aliases,
~/.forward files, and so on, the program attempts to avoid
duplicate deliveries. The duplicate_filter_limit
configuration parameter limits the number of <br>
remembered recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIL FORWARDING <br>
For the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is re-submitted
as a new message, so that each recipient has a separate
on-file delivery status record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to stop mail forwarding
loops early, the software adds an optional Delivered-To:
header with the final envelope recipient address. If mail
arrives for a recipient that <br>
is already listed in a Delivered-To: header, the message is
bounced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILBOX DELIVERY <br>
The default per-user mailbox is a file in the UNIX mail
spool directory (/var/mail/user or /var/spool/mail/user);
the location can be specified with the mail_spool_directory
con&acirc; <br>
figuration parameter. Specify a name ending in / for
qmail-compatible maildir delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the per-user
mailbox can be a file in the user&rsquo;s home directory
with a name specified via the home_mailbox configuration
parameter. Specify a relative path name. <br>
Specify a name ending in / for qmail-compatible maildir
delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailbox delivery can be
delegated to an external command specified with the
mailbox_command_maps and mailbox_command configuration
parameters. The command executes with the priv&acirc; <br>
ileges of the recipient user (exceptions: secondary groups
are not enabled; in case of delivery as root, the command
executes with the privileges of default_privs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailbox delivery can be
delegated to alternative message transports specified in the
master.cf file. The mailbox_transport_maps and
mailbox_transport configuration parameters <br>
specify an optional message transport that is to be used for
all local recipients, regardless of whether they are found
in the UNIX passwd database. The fallback_transport_maps
<br>
and fallback_transport parameters specify an optional
message transport for recipients that are not found in the
aliases(5) or UNIX passwd database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of UNIX-style
mailbox delivery, the local(8) daemon prepends a &quot;From
sender time_stamp&quot; envelope header to each message,
prepends an X-Original-To: header with the <br>
recipient address as given to Postfix, prepends an optional
Delivered-To: header with the final envelope recipient
address, prepends a Return-Path: header with the envelope
<br>
sender address, prepends a &gt; character to lines beginning
with &quot;From &quot;, and appends an empty line. The
mailbox is locked for exclusive access while delivery is in
progress. In <br>
case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate the mailbox
to its original length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of maildir delivery,
the local daemon prepends an optional Delivered-To: header
with the final envelope recipient address, prepends an
X-Original-To: header with the <br>
recipient address as given to Postfix, and prepends a
Return-Path: header with the envelope sender address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTERNAL COMMAND DELIVERY <br>
The allow_mail_to_commands configuration parameter restricts
delivery to external commands. The default setting (alias,
forward) forbids command destinations in :include:
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, the process working
directory is changed to the path specified with
command_execution_directory (Postfix 2.2 and later). Failure
to change directory causes mail to be <br>
deferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command_execution_directory
parameter value is subject to interpolation of $user
(recipient username), $home (recipient home directory),
$shell (recipient shell), $recipient <br>
(complete recipient address), $extension (recipient address
extension), $domain (recipient domain), $local (entire
recipient address localpart) and $recipient_delimiter. The
<br>
forms ${name?value} and ${name:value} expand conditionally
to value when $name is (is not) defined. Characters that may
have special meaning to the shell or file system are <br>
replaced by underscores. The list of acceptable characters
is specified with the execution_directory_expansion_filter
configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command is executed directly
where possible. Assistance by the shell (/bin/sh on UNIX
systems) is used only when the command contains shell magic
characters, or when the com&acirc; <br>
mand invokes a shell built-in command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A limited amount of command
output (standard output and standard error) is captured for
inclusion with non-delivery status reports. A command is
forcibly terminated if it does <br>
not complete within command_time_limit seconds. Command exit
status codes are expected to follow the conventions defined
in &lt;sysexits.h&gt;. Exit status 0 means normal successful
<br>
completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Postfix version 2.3 and later
support RFC 3463-style enhanced status codes. If a command
terminates with a non-zero exit status, and the command
output begins with an enhanced <br>
status code, this status code takes precedence over the
non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A limited amount of message
context is exported via environment variables. Characters
that may have special meaning to the shell are replaced by
underscores. The list of accept&acirc; <br>
able characters is specified with the
command_expansion_filter configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL The recipient user&rsquo;s
login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME The recipient user&rsquo;s
home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER The bare recipient
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENSION <br>
The optional recipient address extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOMAIN The recipient address
domain part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGNAME <br>
The bare recipient name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL The entire recipient
address localpart (text to the left of the rightmost @
character).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT <br>
The entire recipient address, before any address rewriting
or aliasing (Postfix 2.5 and later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECIPIENT <br>
The entire recipient address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDER The entire sender
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional remote client
information is made available via the following environment
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT_ADDRESS <br>
Remote client network address. Available as of Postfix
2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT_HELO <br>
Remote client EHLO command parameter. Available as of
Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT_HOSTNAME <br>
Remote client hostname. Available as of Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT_PROTOCOL <br>
Remote client protocol. Available as of Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SASL_METHOD <br>
SASL authentication method specified in the remote client
AUTH command. Available as of Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SASL_SENDER <br>
SASL sender address specified in the remote client MAIL FROM
command. Available as of Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SASL_USERNAME <br>
SASL username specified in the remote client AUTH command.
Available as of Postfix 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PATH environment variable is
always reset to a system-dependent default path, and
environment variables whose names are blessed by the
export_environment configuration param&acirc; <br>
eter are exported unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current working directory is
the mail queue directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local(8) daemon prepends a
&quot;From sender time_stamp&quot; envelope header to each
message, prepends an X-Original-To: header with the
recipient address as given to Postfix, <br>
prepends an optional Delivered-To: header with the final
recipient envelope address, prepends a Return-Path: header
with the sender envelope address, and appends no empty
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTERNAL FILE DELIVERY <br>
The delivery format depends on the destination filename
syntax. The default is to use UNIX-style mailbox format.
Specify a name ending in / for qmail-compatible maildir
deliv&acirc; <br>
ery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The allow_mail_to_files
configuration parameter restricts delivery to external
files. The default setting (alias, forward) forbids file
destinations in :include: files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of UNIX-style
mailbox delivery, the local(8) daemon prepends a &quot;From
sender time_stamp&quot; envelope header to each message,
prepends an X-Original-To: header with the <br>
recipient address as given to Postfix, prepends an optional
Delivered-To: header with the final recipient envelope
address, prepends a &gt; character to lines beginning with
&quot;From <br>
&quot;, and appends an empty line. The envelope sender
address is available in the Return-Path: header. When the
destination is a regular file, it is locked for exclusive
access <br>
while delivery is in progress. In case of problems, an
attempt is made to truncate a regular file to its original
length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of maildir delivery,
the local daemon prepends an optional Delivered-To: header
with the final envelope recipient address, and prepends an
X-Original-To: header with <br>
the recipient address as given to Postfix. The envelope
sender address is available in the Return-Path: header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDRESS EXTENSION <br>
The optional recipient_delimiter configuration parameter
specifies how to separate address extensions from local
recipient names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with
&quot;recipient_delimiter = +&quot;, mail for name+foo is
delivered to the alias name+foo or to the alias name, to the
destinations listed in ~name/.forward+foo or in <br>
~name/.forward, to the mailbox owned by the user name, or it
is sent back as undeliverable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELIVERY RIGHTS <br>
Deliveries to external files and external commands are made
with the rights of the receiving user on whose behalf the
delivery is made. In the absence of a user context, the <br>
local(8) daemon uses the owner rights of the :include: file
or alias database. When those files are owned by the
superuser, delivery is made with the rights specified with
the <br>
default_privs configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages) <br>
RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).
Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue manager
can move them to the corrupt queue afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the setting of the
notify_classes parameter, the postmaster is notified of
bounces and of other trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
The local(8) delivery agent needs a dual personality 1) to
access the private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms, 2) to
impersonate the recipient and deliver to recipient-specified
<br>
files or commands. It is therefore security sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local(8) delivery agent
disallows regular expression substitution of $1 etc. in
alias_maps, because that would open a security hole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local(8) delivery agent will
silently ignore requests to use the proxymap(8) server
within alias_maps. Instead it will open the table directly.
Before Postfix version 2.2, <br>
the local(8) delivery agent will terminate with a fatal
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
For security reasons, the message delivery status of
external commands or of external files is never checkpointed
to file. As a result, the program may occasionally deliver
more <br>
than once to a command or external file. Better safe than
sorry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mutually-recursive aliases or
~/.forward files are not detected early. The resulting mail
forwarding loop is broken by the use of the Delivered-To:
message header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS <br>
Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as local(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the
command &quot;postfix reload&quot; to speed up a change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text below provides only a
parameter summary. See postconf(5) for more details
including examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY CONTROLS <br>

an &quot;owner-aliasname&quot; companion alias, set the
envelope sender address to the expansion of the
&quot;owner-aliasname&quot; alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner_request_special (yes) <br>
Give special treatment to owner-listname and
listname-request address localparts: don&rsquo;t split such
addresses when the recipient_delimiter is set to
&quot;-&quot;.</p>
