<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
opahostadmin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Host) Performs a number of
multi-step host initialization and verification operations,
including upgrading software or firmware, rebooting hosts,
and other operations. In gen&acirc; <br>
eral, operations performed by opahostadmin involve a login

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Securely prompts for user
password on remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">operation <br>
Performs the specified operation, which can be one or more
of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load Starts initial installation
of all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade Upgrades installation of
all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configipoib <br>
Creates ifcfg-ib1 using host IP address from /etc/hosts
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reboot Reboots hosts, ensures
they go down and come back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sacache Confirms sacache has all
hosts in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipoibping Verifies this host can
ping each host through IPoIB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpiperf Verifies latency and
bandwidth for each host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpiperfdeviation <br>
Verifies latency and bandwidth for each host against a
defined threshold (or relative to average host
performance).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
opahostadmin -c reboot <br>
opahostadmin upgrade <br>
opahostadmin -h &rsquo;elrond arwen&rsquo; reboot <br>
HOSTS=&rsquo;elrond arwen&rsquo; opahostadmin reboot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Details <br>
opahostadmin provides detailed logging of its results.
During each run, the following files are produced:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; test.res :
Appended with summary results of run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; test.log :
Appended with detailed results of run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; save_tmp/ :
Contains a directory per failed test with detailed logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; test_tmp*/ :
Intermediate result files while test is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option removes all log
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Results from opahostadmin are
grouped into test suites, test cases, and test items. A
given run of opahostadmin represents a single test suite.
Within a test suite, multiple test <br>
cases occur; typically one test case per host being operated
on. Some of the more complex operations may have multiple
test items per test case. Each test item represents a major
<br>
step in the overall test case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each opahostadmin run appends to
test.res and test.log, and creates temporary files in
test_tmp$PID in the current directory. test.res provides an
overall summary of operations <br>
performed and their results. The same information is also
displayed while opahostadmin is executing. test.log contains
detailed information about what was performed, including
<br>
the specific commands executed and the resulting output. The
test_tmp directories contain temporary files which reflect
tests in progress (or killed). The logs for any failures
<br>
are logged in the save_temp directory with a directory per
failed test case. If the same test case fails more than
once, save_temp retains the information from the first
failure. <br>
Subsequent runs of opahostadmin are appended to test.log.
Intel recommends reviewing failures and using the -c option
to remove old logs before subsequent runs of
opahostadmin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opahostadmin implicitly performs
its operations in parallel. However, as for the other tools,
FF_MAX_PARALLEL can be exported to change the degree of
parallelism. Twenty (20) <br>
parallel operations is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment Variables <br>
The following environment variables are also used by this
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTS List of hosts, used if -h
option not supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTS_FILE <br>
File containing list of hosts, used in absence of -f and
-h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF_MAX_PARALLEL <br>
Maximum concurrent operations are performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF_SERIALIZE_OUTPUT <br>
Serialize output of parallel operations (yes or no).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opahostadmin Operation Details
<br>
(Host) Intel recommends that you set up password SSH or SCP
for use during this operation. Alternatively, the -S option
can be used to securely prompt for a password, in which <br>
case the same password is used for all hosts. Alternately,
the password may be put in the environment or the
opafastfabric.conf file using FF_PASSWORD and
FF_ROOTPASS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load Performs an initial
installation of Intel(R) Omni-Path Software on a group of
hosts. Any existing installation is uninstalled and existing
configuration files are <br>
removed. Subsequently, the hosts are installed with a
default Intel(R) Omni-Path Software configuration. The -I
option can be used to select different install packages.
<br>
Default = oftools ipoib mpi The -r option can be used to
specify a release to install other than the one that this
host is presently running. The FF_PRODUCT. FF_PROD&acirc;
<br>
UCT_VERSION.tgz file (for example, IntelOPA-Basic.
version.tgz) is expected to exist in the directory specified
by -d. Default is the current working directory. The <br>
specified software is copied to all the selected hosts and
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade Upgrades all selected
hosts without modifying existing configurations. This
operation is comparable to the -U option when running
./INSTALL manually. The -r option can <br>
be used to upgrade to a release different from this host.
The default is to upgrade to the same release as this host.
The FF_PRODUCT. FF_PRODUCT_VERSION.tgz file (for <br>
example, IntelOPA-Basic. version.tgz) is expected to exist
in the directory specified by -d. (The default is the
current working directory.) The specified software is <br>
copied to all the end nodes and installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Only components that are
currently installed are upgraded. This operation fails for
hosts that do not have Intel(R) Omni-Path Software
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configipoib <br>
Creates a ifcfg-ib1 configuration file for each node using
the IP address found using the resolver on the node. The
standard Linux* resolver is used through the host <br>
command. (If running OFA Delta, this option configures
ifcfg-ib0 .)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the host is not found,
/etc/hosts on the node is checked. The -i option specifies
an IPoIB suffix to apply to the host name to create the
IPoIB host name for the <br>
node. The default suffix is -ib. The -m option specifies a
netmask other than the default for the given class of IP
address, such as when dividing a class A or B <br>
address into smaller IP subnets. IPoIB is configured for a
static IP address and is autostarted at boot. For the
Intel(R) OP Software Stack, the default /etc/syscon&acirc;
<br>
fig/ipoib.cfg file is used, which provides a redundant IPoIB
configuration using both ports of the first HFI in the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: opahostadmin configipoib
now supports DHCP (auto or static options) for configuring
the IPoIB interface. You must specify these options in
/etc/sysconfig/opa/opafastfab&acirc; <br>
ric.conf against the FF_IPOIB_CONFIG variable. If no options
are found, the static IP configuration is used by default.
If auto is specified, then one IP address from either <br>
static or dhcp is chosen. Static is used if the IP address
can be obtained out of /etc/hosts or the resolver, otherwise
DHCP is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reboot Reboots the given hosts
and ensures they go down and come back up by pinging them
during the reboot process. The ping rate is slow (5
seconds), so if the servers boot <br>
faster than this, false failures may be seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sacache Verifies the given hosts
can properly communicate with the SA and any cached SA data
that is up to date. To run this command, Intel(R) Omni-Path
Fabric software must be <br>
installed and running on the given hosts. The subnet manager
and switches must be up. If this test fails: opacmdall
&rsquo;opasaquery -o desc&rsquo; can be run against any
problem <br>
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This operation requires
that the hosts being queried are specified by a resolvable
TCP/IP host name. This operation FAILS if the selected hosts
are specified by IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipoibping Verifies IPoIB basic
operation by ensuring that the host can ping all other nodes
through IPoIB. To run this command, Intel(R) Omni-Path
Fabric software must be <br>
installed, IPoIB must be configured and running on the host,
and the given hosts, the SM, and switches must be up. The -i
option can specify an alternate IPoIB hostname <br>
suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpiperf Verifies that MPI is
operational and checks MPI end-to-end latency and bandwidth
between pairs of nodes (for example, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6). Use
this to verify switch <br>
latency/hops, PCI bandwidth, and overall MPI performance.
The test.res file contains the results of each pair of nodes
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option is available
for the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Host Software OFA Delta
packaging, but is not presently available for other
packagings of OFED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To obtain accurate results, this
test should be run at a time when no other stressful
applications (for example, MPI jobs or high stress file
system operations) are run&acirc; <br>
ning on the given hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bandwidth issues typically
indicate server configuration issues (for example, incorrect
slot used, incorrect BIOS settings, or incorrect HFI model),
or fabric issues (for <br>
example, symbol errors, incorrect link width, or speed).
Assuming opareport has previously been used to check for
link errors and link speed issues, the server
configura&acirc; <br>
tion should be verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that BIOS settings and
differences between server models can account for 10-20%
differences in bandwidth. For more details about BIOS
settings, consult the documenta&acirc; <br>
tion from the server supplier and/or the server PCI chipset
manufacturer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpiperfdeviation <br>
Enhanced version of mpiperf that verifies MPI performance.
Can be used to verify switch latency/hops, PCI bandwidth,
and overall MPI performance. It performs assorted <br>
pair-wise bandwidth and latency tests, and reports pairs
outside an acceptable tolerance range. The tool identifies
specific nodes that have problems and provides a <br>
concise summary of results. The test.res file contains the
results of each pair of nodes tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, concurrent mode is
used to quickly analyze the fabric and host performance.
Pairs that have 20% less bandwidth or 50% more latency than
the average pair are <br>
reported as failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool can be run in a
sequential or a concurrent mode. Sequential mode runs each
host against a reference host. By default, the reference
host is selected based on <br>
the best performance from a quick test of the first 40
hosts. In concurrent mode, hosts are paired up and all pairs
are run concurrently. Since there may be fabric con&acirc;
<br>
tention during such a run, any poor performing pairs are
then rerun sequentially against the reference host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concurrent mode runs the tests
in the shortest amount of time, however, the results could
be slightly less accurate due to switch contention. In
heavily oversubscribed <br>
fabric designs, if concurrent mode is producing unexpectedly
low performance, try sequential mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option is available
for the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Host Software OFA Delta
packaging, but is not presently available for other
packagings of OFED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To obtain accurate results, this
test should be run at a time when no other stressful
applications (for example, MPI jobs, high stress file system
operations) are running <br>
on the given hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bandwidth issues typically
indicate server configuration issues (for example, incorrect
slot used, incorrect BIOS settings, or incorrect HFI model),
or fabric issues (for <br>
example, symbol errors, incorrect link width, or speed).
Assuming opareport has previously been used to check for
link errors and link speed issues, the server
configura&acirc; <br>
tion should be verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that BIOS settings and
differences between server models can account for 10-20%
differences in bandwidth. A result 5-10% below the average
is typically not cause for <br>
serious alarm, but may reflect limitations in the server
design or the chosen BIOS settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details about BIOS
settings, consult the documentation from the server supplier
and/or the server PCI chipset manufacturer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The deviation application
supports a number of parameters which allow for more precise
control over the mode, benchmark and pass/fail criteria. The
parameters to use can <br>
be selected using the FF_DEVIATION_ARGS configuration
parameter in opafastfabric.conf</p>
