<p>usbmon(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual usbmon(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
usbmon - monitor USB traffic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
usbmon [ -i bus_num ] [ -s length ] [ -f0 | -fu | -fh ] [
-a0 | -a1 ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
usbmon allows to capture USB traffic for analysis in the
manner similar to tcpdump (8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make use of this program, you
need to have a Linux kernel which supports the binary
&quot;usbmon&quot; interface (e.g., Linux kernel 2.6.20 or
newer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i Listen on bus_num. If unspecified, usbmon attempts to
listen on the pseudo-bus number zero, which is supposed to
capture all packets on all buses. The default is a
conve&acirc; <br>
nient mode because the user does not have to figure out the
bus number where a specific device is attached. Also,
listening on pseudo-bus zero allows to capture events <br>
which happen when a bus is initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, it may be necessary to
specify a specific bus number to tap. Kernels before 2.6.22
do not implement the pseudo-bus zero at all. Performance of
USB stack and the <br>
usbmon is greater when a specific bus is monitored. In such
case, the desired bus number may be determined by examining
the output of lsusb(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Set the maximum length of USB
data to print. The default is to print 32 bytes just like
the kernel&rsquo;s text interface would. The capture size is
automatically adjusted to <br>
match unless set explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Select the output format as
one of: &rsquo;0&rsquo; for legacy format, &rsquo;u&rsquo;
for so-called &quot;1u&quot; format, &rsquo;h&rsquo; for
&quot;human-readable&quot; format. The human-readable format
is the default. Also, <br>
it changes over time, so programs should parse the
&quot;1u&quot; format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting the 1u format forces
usbmon to use the API which may not be available in the
kernel before version 2.6.22.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The human-readable format is not
intended for a programmatic parsing, and so changes from
release to release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Force the binary API version
to use: &rsquo;0&rsquo; for the legacy API in kernel 2.6.20
and up, &rsquo;1&rsquo; for the newer API in kernels after
2.6.22. Selection of output format may force <br>
the API to the minimum required to support the format. In
general, this option is only used when testing the kernel
component of usbmon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
The output of usbmon contains one text line per an event.
The event corresponds to I/O operations on the boundary of
Host Controller Driver (HCD). This includes events of the
<br>
following types: Submission, Callback, Error. Every line
consists of whitespace separated words. The number or
position of words may depend on the event type, but there is
a set <br>
of words, common for all types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most commonly used format is the
human-readable format. Its words, from left to right,
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- URB Tag. A single URB
generates several monitoring events during its life cycle.
The tag allows to corellate events with the URB. Tag is
usually derived from a kernel mode <br>
address. Human-readable format shortens the tag to make the
output more readable, so it&rsquo;s not the complete
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Timestamp. It consistes of the
number of seconds, period, and the fraction in
microseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Event Type. This type refers
to the format of the event, not URB type. Available types
are: S - submission, C - callback, E - submission error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &quot;Pipe word&quot; (the
name is historical and has nothing to do with pipes). This
is a composite word. It consists of four fields, separated
by colons: URB type and direction, Bus <br>
number, Device address, Endpoint number. Type and direction
are encoded with two bytes in the following manner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ci Co Control input and output
<br>
Zi Zo Isochronous input and output <br>
Ii Io Interrupt input and output <br>
Bi Bo Bulk input and output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The address information fields
may contain leading zeros. If the bus is specified with -i,
the Bus number field is redundant, but is kept for the ease
of parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Status word. This word may
have several fields, depending on the transfer type. Most
transfers only have the status field. Interrupt and
Isochronous transfers add an interval. <br>
For Isochronous, start frame and error count may be present.
For callback and error events, the status field contains an
integer number, which represents a &quot;status&quot; field
of the <br>
URB. For a submission event, status makes no sense, so the
field contains a single dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control submissions are an
exception, because they may have a setup packet. In such
case, the event contains a letter in place of the status
word. The letter is called &quot;setup <br>
tag&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Setup packet, if present,
consists of 5 words: one of each for bmRequestType,
bRequest, wValue, wIndex, wLength, as specified by the USB
Specification 2.0. These words are <br>
safe to decode if Setup Tag was &rsquo;s&rsquo;. Otherwise,
the setup packet was present, but not captured, and the
fields contain filler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The number of isochronous
frame descriptors (optional).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Isochronous descriptors
(optional). Like the &quot;pipe word&quot;, each descriptor
contains fields separated by colons: status, offset, and
length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Data Tag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Data (if Data Tag is
&rsquo;=&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data stream and its ASCII
representation follow on separate lines. Each line starts
with a space for the ease of identification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is the list of
words for the legacy format, from left to right:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- URB Tag. This is normally a
kernel mode address of the URB structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Timestamp in microseconds, a
decimal number. The timestamp&rsquo;s resolution depends on
available clock, and so it can be much worse than a
microsecond (if the implementation uses <br>
jiffies, for example). The number of microseconds is usually
truncated, so it can wrap if usbmon runs long enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Event Type. This type refers
to the format of the event, not URB type. Available types
are: S - submission, C - callback, E - submission error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &quot;Pipe&quot;. The pipe
concept is deprecated. This is a composite word, used to be
derived from information in pipes. It consists of three
fields, separated by colons: URB type and <br>
direction, Device address, Endpoint number. Type and
direction are encoded with two bytes in the following
manner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ci Co Control input and output
<br>
Zi Zo Isochronous input and output <br>
Ii Io Interrupt input and output <br>
Bi Bo Bulk input and output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device address and Endpoint
number are 3-digit and 2-digit (respectively) decimal
numbers, with leading zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- URB Status. In most cases,
this field contains a number, sometimes negative, which
represents a &quot;status&quot; field of the URB. This field
makes no sense for submissions, but is <br>
present anyway to help scripts with parsing. When an error
occurs, the field contains the error code. In case of a
submission of a Control packet, this field contains a Setup
Tag <br>
instead of an error code. It is easy to tell whether the
Setup Tag is present because it is never a number. Thus if
scripts find a number in this field, they proceed to read
<br>
Data Length. If they find something else, like a letter,
they read the setup packet before reading the Data
Length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Setup packet, if present,
consists of 5 words: one of each for bmRequestType,
bRequest, wValue, wIndex, wLength, as specified by the USB
Specification 2.0. These words are <br>
safe to decode if Setup Tag was &rsquo;s&rsquo;. Otherwise,
the setup packet was present, but not captured, and the
fields contain filler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Data Length. For submissions,
this is the requested length. For callbacks, this is the
actual length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Data tag. The usbmon may not
always capture data, even if length is nonzero. The data
words are present only if this tag is &rsquo;=&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Data words follow, in big
endian hexadecimal format. Notice that they are not machine
words, but really just a byte stream split into words to
make it easier to read. Thus, the <br>
last word may contain from one to four bytes. The length of
collected data is limited (see the -s parameter) and can be
less than the data length report in the Data Length
word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc/devices <br>
This file is read to determine the major of /dev/usbmonN if
such node does not exist in the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/usbmonN <br>
The usbmon attempts to open /dev/usbmon{N}, where N is the
bus number. If the node does not exist, usbmon creates
it.</p>
