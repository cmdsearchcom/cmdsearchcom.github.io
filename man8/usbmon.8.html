usbmon - monitor USB traffic
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>usbmon</b> [ <b>-i</b> <i>bus_num</i> ] [ <b>-s</b> <i>length</i> ] [
  <b>-f0</b> | <b>-fu</b> | <b>-fh</b> ] [ <b>-a0</b> | <b>-a1</b> ]

<b>usbmon</b> allows to capture USB traffic for analysis in the manner similar
  to <b>tcpdump</b> (8).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To make use of this program, you need to have a Linux kernel which supports the
  binary &quot;usbmon&quot; interface (e.g., Linux kernel 2.6.20 or newer).

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Listen on <i>bus_num</i>. If unspecified, <i>usbmon</i>
      attempts to listen on the pseudo-bus number zero, which is supposed to
      capture all packets on all buses. The default is a convenient mode because
      the user does not have to figure out the bus number where a specific
      device is attached. Also, listening on pseudo-bus zero allows to capture
      events which happen when a bus is initialized.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    However, it may be necessary to specify a specific bus number to tap.
      Kernels before 2.6.22 do not implement the pseudo-bus zero at all.
      Performance of USB stack and the usbmon is greater when a specific bus is
      monitored. In such case, the desired bus number may be determined by
      examining the output of lsusb(8).

      default. Also, it changes over time, so programs should parse the
      &quot;1u&quot; format.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Selecting the 1u format forces <i>usbmon</i> to use the API which may not be
      available in the kernel before version 2.6.22.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The human-readable format is not intended for a programmatic parsing, and so

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_FORMAT">OUTPUT
  FORMAT</a></h1>
The output of <i>usbmon</i> contains one text line per an event. The event
  corresponds to I/O operations on the boundary of Host Controller Driver (HCD).
  This includes events of the following types: Submission, Callback, Error.
  Every line consists of whitespace separated words. The number or position of
  words may depend on the event type, but there is a set of words, common for
  all types.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most commonly used format is the human-readable format. Its words, from left to
  right, are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
- URB Tag. A single URB generates several monitoring events during its life
  cycle. The tag allows to corellate events with the URB. Tag is usually derived
  from a kernel mode address. Human-readable format shortens the tag to make the
  output more readable, so it's not the complete address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Timestamp. It consistes of the number of seconds, period, and the fraction in
  microseconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Event Type. This type refers to the format of the event, not URB type.
  Available types are: S - submission, C - callback, E - submission error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- &quot;Pipe word&quot; (the name is historical and has nothing to do with
  pipes). This is a composite word. It consists of four fields, separated by
  colons: URB type and direction, Bus number, Device address, Endpoint number.
  Type and direction are encoded with two bytes in the following manner:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 Ci Co Control input and output
<br/>
 Zi Zo Isochronous input and output
<br/>
 Ii Io Interrupt input and output
<br/>
 Bi Bo Bulk input and output
<div class="Pp"></div>
The address information fields may contain leading zeros. If the bus is
  specified with -i, the Bus number field is redundant, but is kept for the ease
  of parsing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Status word. This word may have several fields, depending on the transfer
  type. Most transfers only have the status field. Interrupt and Isochronous
  transfers add an interval. For Isochronous, start frame and error count may be
  present. For callback and error events, the status field contains an integer
  number, which represents a &quot;status&quot; field of the URB. For a
  submission event, status makes no sense, so the field contains a single dash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control submissions are an exception, because they may have a setup packet. In
  such case, the event contains a letter in place of the status word. The letter
  is called &quot;setup tag&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Setup packet, if present, consists of 5 words: one of each for bmRequestType,
  bRequest, wValue, wIndex, wLength, as specified by the USB Specification 2.0.
  These words are safe to decode if Setup Tag was 's'. Otherwise, the setup
  packet was present, but not captured, and the fields contain filler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- The number of isochronous frame descriptors (optional).
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Isochronous descriptors (optional). Like the &quot;pipe word&quot;, each
  descriptor contains fields separated by colons: status, offset, and length.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Data Tag
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Data (if Data Tag is '=')
<div class="Pp"></div>
Data stream and its ASCII representation follow on separate lines. Each line
  starts with a space for the ease of identification.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following is the list of words for the legacy format, from left to right:
<div class="Pp"></div>
- URB Tag. This is normally a kernel mode address of the URB structure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Timestamp in microseconds, a decimal number. The timestamp's resolution
  depends on available clock, and so it can be much worse than a microsecond (if
  the implementation uses jiffies, for example). The number of microseconds is
  usually truncated, so it can wrap if usbmon runs long enough.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Event Type. This type refers to the format of the event, not URB type.
  Available types are: S - submission, C - callback, E - submission error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- &quot;Pipe&quot;. The pipe concept is deprecated. This is a composite word,
  used to be derived from information in pipes. It consists of three fields,
  separated by colons: URB type and direction, Device address, Endpoint number.
  Type and direction are encoded with two bytes in the following manner:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 Ci Co Control input and output
<br/>
 Zi Zo Isochronous input and output
<br/>
 Ii Io Interrupt input and output
<br/>
 Bi Bo Bulk input and output
<div class="Pp"></div>
Device address and Endpoint number are 3-digit and 2-digit (respectively)
  decimal numbers, with leading zeroes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- URB Status. In most cases, this field contains a number, sometimes negative,
  which represents a &quot;status&quot; field of the URB. This field makes no
  sense for submissions, but is present anyway to help scripts with parsing.
  When an error occurs, the field contains the error code. In case of a
  submission of a Control packet, this field contains a Setup Tag instead of an
  error code. It is easy to tell whether the Setup Tag is present because it is
  never a number. Thus if scripts find a number in this field, they proceed to
  read Data Length. If they find something else, like a letter, they read the
  setup packet before reading the Data Length.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Setup packet, if present, consists of 5 words: one of each for bmRequestType,
  bRequest, wValue, wIndex, wLength, as specified by the USB Specification 2.0.
  These words are safe to decode if Setup Tag was 's'. Otherwise, the setup
  packet was present, but not captured, and the fields contain filler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Data Length. For submissions, this is the requested length. For callbacks,
  this is the actual length.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Data tag. The usbmon may not always capture data, even if length is nonzero.
  The data words are present only if this tag is '='.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Data words follow, in big endian hexadecimal format. Notice that they are not
  machine words, but really just a byte stream split into words to make it
  easier to read. Thus, the last word may contain from one to four bytes. The
  length of collected data is limited (see the <i>-s</i> parameter) and can be
  less than the data length report in the Data Length word.
