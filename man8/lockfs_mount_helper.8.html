<p>LOCKFS_MOUNT_HELPER(8) System Administration
LOCKFS_MOUNT_HELPER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mount.lockfs - helper script for the mount command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mount.lockfs FILESYSTEM MOUNTPOINT [MOUNTFLAGS] -o
MOUNTOPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
/sbin/mount.lockfs is a symlink to
/lib/bilibop/lockfs_mount_helper. It is used as an helper
program by the mount(8) command for the &rsquo;lockfs&rsquo;
filesystem type entries in <br>
/etc/fstab. This script cannot be run manually, and fails if
the root filesystem is not already managed by
bilibop-lockfs. The expected way to run it and how it does
its job <br>
are the followings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Enable bilibop-lockfs: set
the BILIBOP_LOCKFS variable to true in bilibop.conf(5) and
reboot the computer; or reboot the computer and append the
&rsquo;lockfs&rsquo; kernel parameter to <br>
the boot commandline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. One time the future
&rsquo;/&rsquo; is set as an union filesystem mountpoint
from into the initramfs environment, the temporary and
writable fstab(5) on it is modified to replace
filesys&acirc; <br>
tem types of some entries by &rsquo;lockfs&rsquo;. Options
are also modified to remember the original fstype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. One time the union mount is
the new root filesystem, initscripts are executed: fstab(5)
is parsed by &rsquo;mount -a&rsquo;, and then mount(8) calls
mount.lockfs with the proper arguments <br>
when a &rsquo;lockfs&rsquo; fstype is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. mount.lockfs parses arguments
and checks if the filesystem has been whitelisted in
bilibop.conf(5), or not. If it is the case, the filesystem
is mounted normally and the fstab <br>
entry is modified to reflect the actual mount call. If
neither the filesystem nor the mountpoint have been
whitelisted, then the filesystem is mounted elsewhere and
readonly, <br>
a temporary filesystem is mounted with proper options, size,
permissions and ownership, and an aufs or overlay filesystem
(depending on the version of your kernel) is mounted <br>
on the MOUNTPOINT given as argument with the lower/readonly
and upper/writable branches previously set. The fstab entry
is replaced by three lines reflecting the actual mount <br>
calls. If something fails, mount.lockfs acts as if the
filesystem was whitelisted. See
/usr/share/doc/bilibop-lockfs/README.Debian for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
lockfs_mount_helper uses options and arguments as they are
given by mount(8) after it has parsed the corresponding
fstab(5) entry. So, options and arguments are mandatory,
mount <br>
flags are optional, and all come in the following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILESYSTEM <br>
Corresponding to the first field in fstab. This must be a
block device, or a symlink to a block device. If this field
is given with one of the UUID=* or LABEL=* formats, <br>
then the mount command translates it to the corresponding
device name before to call the helper program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUNTPOINT <br>
Corresponding to the second field in fstab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[MOUNTFLAGS] <br>
Generic flags passed to the mount commandline (the most
usual being -v and -n).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o MOUNTOPTIONS <br>
Corresponding to the fourth field in fstab. The mount
options are parsed by the helper script: if fstype=* is
encountered, it is removed from the options and used to
mount <br>
the readonly branch with this filesystem type. If ro,
noexec, nosuid or nodev options are encountered, they are
added to the list of mount options of the writable
branch.</p>
