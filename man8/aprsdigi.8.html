<p>APRSDIGI(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
APRSDIGI(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aprsdigi - APRS(&acirc;&cent;) digipeater</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aprsdigi options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Aprsdigi is a specialized Amateur Packet Radio (AX.25)
UI-frame digipeater for the Automatic Position Reporting
Systems, APRS(tm). It uses the Linux kernel AX.25 network
stack <br>
as well as the SOCK_PACKET facility to listen for packets on
one or more radio interfaces (ports) and repeat those
packets -- with several possible modifications -- on the
same <br>
or other interfaces. Aprsdigi can also use the Internet to
tunnel connections among other APRS digipeaters and nodes
using IPv4 or IPv6 UDP unicast or multicast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aprsdigi implements conventional
packet radio AX.25 digipeating, in which a packet is
digipeated if the next hop (non-repeated) digipeater
(&quot;via&quot;) callsign matches the AX.25 <br>
port&rsquo;s callsign and sub-station ID (SSID) or an alias
callsign and SSID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of extensions
to conventional digipeating that have been proposed for use
in the APRS community. Some of these features have been
adopted by Terminal Node <br>
Controller (TNC) manufacturers, notably Paccomm and
Kantronics. Aprsdigi implements most if not all of the
commercialy adopted and proposed features. See the APRS 1.0
Protocol <br>
Specification at www.tapr.org for protocol documentation.
Aprsdigi attempts to minimally comply with the protocol
specification as well as support experimental APRS features.
<br>
Specific features implemented include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Single-interface
conventional UI-frame digipeating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Cross-interface
digipeating (also known as bridging, routing or gatewaying)
and one-to-many fanout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Substitution of
a digipeated alias with the interface&rsquo;s callsign
(typically used to substitute RELAY, WIDE or TRACE
aliases).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; WIDEn-n flooding
algorithim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; TRACEn-n route
recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mic-Encoder(tm)
support, including SSID-based digipeating, decompression of
packets into the conventional APRS MIM format. (The
Mic-Encoder compression is also used by other <br>
products such as the Kenwood TH-D7A and D700, and TAPR
PIC-Encoder).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; TheNet X1J4 node
beacon text translation (removal of the &acirc;TheNet X1J4
(alias)&acirc; prefix from the btext).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
-v --verbose <br>
Produce verbose debugging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T --testing <br>
Test mode: listen to my packets too. This mode is useful for
off-air experimentation and configuration testing. Do not
use it on-air.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D --kill_dupes <br>
Suppress Duplicate packets. Remembers duplicate packets for
the number of seconds given by the -k option and will not
repeat them more than once. This reduces conjes&acirc; <br>
tion caused when several digipeaters that share a common
flooding alias (e.g. WIDE) have overlapping footprints,
causing geometric duplication of packets addressed via <br>
&acirc;WIDE,WIDE&acirc; for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L --kill_loops <br>
Suppress Looping packets. Similar in function to duplicate
packet suppression, but looks back through the list of
already digipeated callsigns in the packet&rsquo;s digipeat
<br>
list and kills any packets that list a callsign belonging to
this aprsdigi. Note that only real callsigns are compared.
Generic flooding aliases are not. Therefore, <br>
loop detection is only useful when callsign substitution is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V --version <br>
Print program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n|s|e|w --north|south|east|west
<br>
Set North|South|East|West SSID directional path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d --digipath <br>
Set SSID omnidirectional next-hops when operating in a non
flooding network (e.g. when WIDEn-n is not an option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --flood <br>
Set flooding alias. Use &acirc;-f WIDE&acirc; to enable
WIDEn-n flooding. Use -f multiple times to define several
flooding aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F --trace <br>
Set flooding trace callsign. Use &acirc;-F TRACE&acirc; to
enable TRACE and TRACEn-n flooding. Use -F multiple times to
define several trace aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --keep secs <br>
Remember old packets for this long for duplicate packet
detection. Default is 28 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l --logfile file <br>
Log digipeated packets to this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PER-INTERFACE OPTIONS <br>
Put these options before each -p --interface to set new
values as needed. The values you set are remembered for
subsequent -p&rsquo;s so options you want to set for all
interfaces <br>
need only be specified once, before the first -p. But you
have to remember to unset an option if you don&rsquo;t want
it to apply to subsequent interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C (-c) --[no]subst_mycall <br>
Do (not) perform callsign substitution. When enabled,
aliases are replaced with the interface&rsquo;s callsign
when repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M (-m) --[no]mice_xlate <br>
Do (not) perform Mic-E to MIM translation. When enabled,
compressed Mic-E reports are expanded into one MIM-style
position report packet and optionally a second <br>
telemetry packet if telemetry was supplied in the Mic-E
packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X (-x) --[no]x1j4_xlate <br>
Do (not) perform X1J4 translation. When enabled, the leading
&acirc;TheNet X1J4 (alias)&acirc; text is removed when
digipeated. This allows non-compliant APRS implementations
to <br>
detect an APRS position report in an X1J4 beacon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i --idinterval secs <br>
Seconds between ID transmissions. Set to 0 to disable IDs on
this interface. Default is 570 (9 minutes 30 seconds). IDs
are only sent if the interface transmitted <br>
anything since the last ID. ID packets are addressed to the
&acirc;ID&acirc; callsign, have no digipeat path, and list
the callsign and aliases for the interface the ID is being
<br>
transmitted on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t --tag text <br>
Text to append to received packets. Use -t - to reset to
empty. Use this, for example, when gatewaying Mic-E packets
from a voice repeater to the APRS net frequency <br>
to indicate where the report originated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 --3rdparty <br>
Enable 3rd party tunneling. Packets tunneled to a 3rd party
interface are sent with the unused digipeaters removed from
the digipeater list. Packets tunneled from a <br>
3rd party interface have the Source Path Header prepended to
the packet payload prefixed by the &quot;}&quot;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 --no3rdparty <br>
Enable transparent tunneling. No special tricks are done
when sending to or receiving from a tunneled interface. If
the interface does not natively support AX.25 <br>
addresses (from-call, to-call, and digipeater list), then
the address header is prepended to the payload in
&quot;cooked&quot; format. Likewise, a cooked prepended
header is <br>
stripped from a cooked interface and put back in the AX.25
address when going from a non-AX.25 to AX.25 interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o r --norx <br>
Disable receiving on the following interface(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o R --rx Enable receiving on
the following interface(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o t --notx <br>
Disable transmitting on the following interface(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o T --tx Enable transmitting on
the following interface(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o s --notxsame <br>
Disable retransmitting a received packet on the same
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o S --txsame <br>
Enable retransmitting a received packet on the same
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o d --duplicate intf <br>
Duplicate received packets without modification to the given
interface (port).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --interface
ax25:port:alias1,alias2,... <br>
AX25 interface name (port) and optional list of aliases. The
primary callsign is obtained from the interface&rsquo;s
configuration. (See ifconfig(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --interface
udp:host/port/ttl:alias1,alias2,... <br>
IP host name or address and list of aliases. IP addresses
may be IPv4 unicast or multicast or IPv6 unicast. The
primary callsign is obtained from the first alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --interface
unix:filename:alias1,alias2,... <br>
Unix file and list of aliases. Useful for debugging by
setting up a simulated APRS network on one machine. You may
want to make your FIFOs explicitly transmit- or <br>
receive-only to avoid confusion. The primary callsign is
obtained from the first alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B|b --[no]bud <br>
addr Is similar to a TNC-2&rsquo;s BUDLIST. Use -B --bud to
accept or -b --nobud to ignore packets from a sender or
group of senders. Budlists are attached to each inter&acirc;
<br>
face and can be reset with --bud - <br>
You can set up a global budlist once, or per-interface
budlists. The format of addr varies based on the interface
type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bud ax25:callsign-ssid matches
only a given digipeater callsign and SSID. For example, -B
ax25:n0clu-14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bud ax25:callsign matches all
SSIDs for the given callsign. For example -B ax25:n0clu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bud ip:hostname matches one
Internet host name (IPv6 or IPv4). For example -B
ip:n0clu.ampr.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bud ip:address/maskbits
matches all IP addresses that have the given prefix. For
example --bud ip:44.0.0.0/8 matches the entire class-A
network. --bud ip:192.168.0.0/16 <br>
matches the entire class-B network. --bud
ip:fe80::201:3ff:fe9a:38c6 matches a single IPv6 host. --bud
ip:2002:905::/32 matches the 32-bit IPv6 prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME CONTROLS <br>
aprsdigi responds to the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 Print cumulative
statistics. For each port, the following counters are
displayed: packets received and how many of those where
ignored, duplicates, loops, mic-E for&acirc; <br>
matted; packets transmitted and how many of those where
conventional digipeats, flooding digipeats (WIDEn-n),
SSID-based digipeats, and IDs. If a log file was
speci&acirc; <br>
fied with the -l --logfile option, then the statistics are
written to that file. Otherwise they are written to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 Prints the statistics
and then resets all counters to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other normal termination
signals cause final statistics to print before aprsdigi
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSID-BASED ROUTING <br>
SSID-based routing uses a non-zero sub-station ID in the
destination callsign, an empty digipeater path to indicate
that the APRS digipeater should repeat the packet after
fill&acirc; <br>
ing in an appropriate digipeater path. For example, a packet
sent to &acirc;T1QS4W-3&acirc; would be repeated with a
modifed destination of &acirc;APRS VIA WIDE3-3&acirc; (in a
network that supports <br>
WIDEn-n flooding). A packet sent to &acirc;APRS-11&acirc;
would be repeated to the West unproto path, as defined with
the --west option. A table of SSID values and their paths
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSID unproto path <br>
---- ------------ <br>
0 none <br>
1 WIDE1-1 <br>
2 WIDE2-2 <br>
3 WIDE3-3 <br>
4 WIDE4-4 <br>
5 WIDE5-5 <br>
6 WIDE6-6 <br>
7 WIDE7-7 <br>
8 NORTH UNPROTO path <br>
9 SOUTH UNPROTO path <br>
10 EAST UNPROTO path <br>
11 WEST UNPROTO path <br>
12 NORTH UNPROTO path + WIDE <br>
13 SOUTH UNPROTO path + WIDE <br>
14 EAST UNPROTO path + WIDE <br>
15 WEST UNPROTO path + WIDE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSID digipeating was first
introduced with the Mic-Encoder but works with any
destination callsign with a non-zero SSID. The theory behind
destination SSID digipeating is <br>
described in more detail in the APRSdos README, MIC-E.TXT.
Basically, the idea is to minimize packet lengths and to
have the manager of the WIDE APRS digipeater determine the
<br>
most appropriate directional digipeat paths, removing the
burden from the mobile user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aprsdigi also fits into a non
WIDEn-n network by using the same algorithm for selection of
subset of digipeaters from a list supplied with the
--digipath option as the MIC-E. <br>
That is, SSIDs of 1, 2 or 3 select that number of
digipeaters from the first three digipeaters in the
--digipath list. SSIDs of 4, 5, 6, or 7, start at the fourth
digipeater in <br>
the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLOODING ALIASES <br>
APRS flooding (WIDEn-n) digipeating works by repeating any
received packet whose next hop digipeater has a flooding
alias (specified with the --flood option), and the SSID is 1
<br>
or greater. The SSID is decremented by one, and the packet
is repeated. Furthermore, to prevent broadcast storms,
recently transmitted packets are remembered for a period of
<br>
time specified by the --keep option and are not repeated if
they are heard within that time period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike conventional digipeating,
in which the digipeater callsign/alias is flagged as
&acirc;repeated&acirc;, the flooding mode does not do this.
Once the SSID decrements to zero, then a <br>
flooding alias is treated just like any other alias, and
does get marked as repeated upon transmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACE and TRACEn-n ALIASES <br>
&acirc;Flooding&acirc; Trace aliases (TRACEn-n; --trace
option) are treated like flooding aliases with the addition
that, besides decrementing the SSID, the current
interface&rsquo;s callsign is <br>
inserted in front of the trace alias, providing a
record-route function. &acirc;Plain&acirc; trace aliases
(TRACE; also --trace option) are simply substituted in the
conventional ( <br>
--subst_mycall ) manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTI PORT OPERATION <br>
In single port operation, there is only one interface
specified with --interface. All packets are received and
some are retransmitted on the same interface, depending on
whether <br>
they match the criteria for retransmission after translation
of the digpeater path from one of the APRS-specific
formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mic-E TO-call
SSID-based route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; WIDEn-n/TRACEn-n
flooding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or a conventional next-hop
(non-repeated) digipeater matching the callsign or one of
the aliases for the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The decision to transmit is made
by matching the next hop callsign/alias with the table of
callsigns and aliases you supply to --interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In multi-port operation, this
same technique simply extends to several interfaces. Besides
each interface&rsquo;s unique callsign, you can give the
same alias to several interfaces. <br>
This results in a one-to-many fanout which might be useful
for dual frequency operation such as a general use APRS net
frequency and an event-specific frequency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using different flags for
Mic-E expansions, etc. you can tailor these fanouts
differently on each of these interfaces, perhaps keeping
Mic-E packets compressed on one fre&acirc; <br>
quency while decompressing them on another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPLICATING PACKETS <br>
The --dupe intf option will duplicate a packet received on
one interface to the interface name given. If you want to
duplicate to several other interface, repeat --dupe intf for
<br>
each interface. The packet is duplicated verbatim as
received. No callsign substitution, flooding or other
processing or checking such as whether the packet still has
any non- <br>
repeated digipeaters in the list is checked. This feature is
meant to provide a means to simply repeat received packets
verbatim, on an RF interface, for example, out an
inter&acirc; <br>
face that might be an Ethernet, that has APRS client
applications running on it (or aprsd listening on a UDP
interface). Digipeating without the normal processing can be
danger&acirc; <br>
ous since the digipeater list is never used up. Because of
this, packets received on a given interface will never be
blindly duplicated back to the same interface, regardless of
<br>
the option setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACE vs. TRACEN-N <br>
Note that TRACEn-n vs. plain TRACE do different things:
TRACEn-n *inserts* calls into the digipath while
decrementing ssid, e.g.: <br>
RELAY*,TRACE3-3 <br>
RELAY,N2YGK-7*,TRACE3-2 <br>
RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII*,TRACE3-1 <br>
RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII,N2MH-15*,TRACE3 <br>
RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII,N2MH-15,WA2YSM-14*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KILLING LOOPING PACKETS <br>
Kill looping packets (--kill_loops option): <br>
RELAY*,WIDE,WIDE,WIDE <br>
RELAY,N2YGK-7*,WIDE,WIDE <br>
RELAY,N2YGK-7,WIDE*,WIDE <br>
Normally n2ygk-7 would respond to this, but, by finding one
of mycall earlier in the path, I know to ignore it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Aprsdigi should not be confused with a Wes Johnson&rsquo;s
DOS program of the same name. This code has most recently
been tested with the Linux 2.4.20 kernel under Red Hat
Fedora Core <br>
1. The command line syntax is ugly and will eventually be
replaced by a configuration file. Short options are
deprecated and will dissappear in a future release. Please
use <br>
long options.</p>
