<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ftp-proxy - application level proxy for the FTP protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ftp-proxy [-c] [-d|-i] [-f file] [-n] [-v level] [-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
FTP-Proxy acts as an application level gateway between FTP
clients and servers. Its main purpose is to secure local FTP
servers against possibly insecure clients or malicious <br>
attacks. FTP-Proxy is believed to be immune against current
known attacks based on the FTP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTP-Proxy can be started from
the inetd (or xinetd, or any other) internet super daemon or
executed on its own as a standalone daemon, in which case it
will fork child processes <br>
to handle connections. The behaviour depends on the
ftp-proxy.conf(5) configuration option ServerType or the -i
and -d command line switches, where the latter two take
prece&acirc; <br>
dence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTP-Proxy features a rich set of
auditing and command restriction capabilities and is
specifically suited for deployment in firewall
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V Print the program&rsquo;s version information and
terminate with exit code 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Read the configuration file,
output its contents sorted by section and option name to
standard output, and terminate with exit code 0. This option
is mostly interesting <br>
for diagnostic purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Force FTP-Proxy to run in
standalone (daemon) mode, even if a ServerType inetd
directive exists in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Force FTP-Proxy to run in
inetd mode, even if a ServerType standalone directive exists
in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file to be read instead
of the standard /etc/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the default
path for the configuration file is a compile time option. It
can be changed using the --prefix and --sysconfdir options
when running the con&acirc; <br>
figure script - see also the INSTALL file for usage
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not detach from the
controlling terminal. This prevents the default of becoming
a daemon and is ignored if running in inetd mode. The main
purpose of this option is <br>
to support the AIX System Resource Controller or similar
setups, where several daemons are controlled by a master
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v level <br>
Enable diagnostic output to be sent to the file
/tmp/ftp-proxy.debug. The given level must be in the range
from 0 (no output at all) to 4 (maximum verbosity). See also
<br>
DIAGNOSTICS bellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT <br>
These signals instruct FTP-Proxy to abort any existing
transfer, close all connections and terminate the process.
If the target of the signal is a running FTP-Proxy
dae&acirc; <br>
mon, all current child processes wil also be terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP This signal will be
accepted if running in daemon mode and ignored in inetd
mode. <br>
It causes the FTP-Proxy to reread its configuration file and
to reopen the log destination if it was changed in the
configuration file, or rotated if it is a log file. <br>
See also dedicated rotation singnal SIGUSR1 bellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
This signal will be accepted if running in daemon mode and
ignored in inetd mode. <br>
It causes the FTP-Proxy to close its current logfile, rename
it to a date and time derived value, and open a new logfile.
This procedure is also known as Logfile Rota&acirc; <br>
tion. Child processes forked before the reception of this
signal and processes run from inetd will not be affected.
<br>
See also the ServerRoot configuration option in
ftp-proxy.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
When running FTP-Proxy in inetd mode, it is always an
excellent idea to check that the inetd configuration file
includes a line that invokes FTP-Proxy. An example for a
line in <br>
/etc/inetd.conf follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp stream tcp nowait root
/usr/sbin/ftp-proxy -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that this is just an
example and does not provide much security, like running as
a non-privileged user or using the TCP Wrapper
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The -v option is is only available if enabled using the
--enable-debug option when running the configure script -
see also the INSTALL file for usage description. This option
<br>
should be used with great care only. It is strongly
recommended to not to use it in production environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If debugging is activated, it
always adds output to the file /tmp/ftp-proxy.debug which is
created with 0666 mode. This allows child processes to open
and write the file after <br>
they have given up their root privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the configuration file
contains a ServerRoot directive, child processes and
processes run from inetd will try to open the file within
their chroot(2) environment. If this <br>
fails, e.g. because there is no /tmp directory, it is
silently ignored and no debug output is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the program
makes no attempt to erase the debug file after use. Thus it
will stay around with world writeability until the operator
manually removes it!</p>
