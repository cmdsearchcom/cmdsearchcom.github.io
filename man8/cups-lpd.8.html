<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cups-lpd - receive print jobs and report printer status to
lpd clients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cups-lpd [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -n ] [ -o option=value
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cups-lpd is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon (&quot;LPD&quot;)
mini-server that supports legacy client systems that use the
LPD protocol. cups-lpd does not act as a standalone network
daemon <br>
but instead operates as a socket-activatable systemd(1)
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h hostname[:port] <br>
Sets the CUPS server (and port) to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Disables reverse address lookups; normally cups-lpd will try
to discover the hostname of the client via a reverse DNS
lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o name=value <br>
Inserts options for all print queues. Most often this is
used to disable the &quot;l&quot; filter so that remote
print jobs are filtered as needed for printing; the examples
in the <br>
previous section set the &quot;document-format&quot; option
to &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; which forces
autodetection of the print file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE <br>
cups-lpd performs well with small numbers of clients and
printers. However, since a new process is created for each
connection and since each process must query the printing
sys&acirc; <br>
tem before each job submission, it does not scale to larger
configurations. We highly recommend that large
configurations use the native IPP support provided by CUPS
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
cups-lpd currently does not perform any access control based
on the settings in cupsd.conf(5) or in the hosts.allow(5) or
hosts.deny(5) files used by TCP wrappers. Therefore, <br>
running cups-lpd on your server will allow any computer on
your network (and perhaps the entire Internet) to print to
your server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should use configure the
firewall to limit TCP port 515 access to only those
computers that should be able to print through your
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cups-lpd is not enabled by the
standard CUPS distribution. Please consult with your
operating system vendor to determine whether it is enabled
on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
cups-lpd does not enforce the restricted source port number
specified in RFC 1179, as using restricted ports does not
prevent users from submitting print jobs. While this
behav&acirc; <br>
ior is different than standard Berkeley LPD implementations,
it should not affect normal client operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the status
requests follows RFC 2569, Mapping between LPD and IPP
Protocols. Since many LPD implementations stray from this
definition, remote status reporting to <br>
LPD clients may be unreliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
CUPS includes configuration files for systemd(8). Simply
enable the cups-lpd socket using the corresponding control
program. <br>
systemctl enable cups-lpd.socket <br>
systemctl start cups-lpd.socket</p>
