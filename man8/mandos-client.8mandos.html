<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mandos-client is a client program that communicates with
mandos(8) to get a password. In slightly more detail, this
client program brings up network interfaces, uses the <br>
interfaces&acirc; IPv6 link-local addresses to get network
connectivity, uses Zeroconf to find servers on the local
network, and communicates with servers using TLS with an
OpenPGP key <br>
to ensure authenticity and confidentiality. This client
program keeps running, trying all servers on the network,
until it receives a satisfactory reply or a TERM signal.
After <br>
all servers have been tried, all servers are periodically
retried. If no servers are found it will wait indefinitely
for new servers to appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The network interfaces are
selected like this: If any interfaces are specified using
the --interface option, those interface are used. Otherwise,
mandos-client will use all <br>
interfaces that are not loopback interfaces, are not
point-to-point interfaces, are capable of broadcasting and
do not have the NOARP flag (see netdevice(7)). (If the
--connect <br>
option is used, point-to-point interfaces and non-broadcast
interfaces are accepted.) If any used interfaces are not up
and running, they are first taken up (and later taken down
<br>
again on program exit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before network interfaces are
selected, all &acirc;network hooks&acirc; are run; see the
section called &acirc;NETWORK HOOKS&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is not meant to be
run directly; it is really meant to run as a plugin of the
Mandos plugin-runner(8mandos), which runs in the initial RAM
disk environment because <br>
it is specified as a &acirc;keyscript&acirc; in the
crypttab(5) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PURPOSE <br>
The purpose of this is to enable remote and unattended
rebooting of client host computer with an encrypted root
file system. See the section called &acirc;OVERVIEW&acirc;
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program is commonly not invoked from the command line;
it is normally started by the Mandos plugin runner, see
plugin-runner(8mandos). Any command line options this
program <br>
accepts are therefore normally provided by the plugin
runner, and not directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--connect=ADDRESS:PORT, -c
ADDRESS:PORT <br>
Do not use Zeroconf to locate servers. Connect directly to
only one specified Mandos server. Note that an IPv6 address
has colon characters in it, so the last colon character <br>
is assumed to separate the address from the port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, Zeroconf would be used
to locate Mandos servers, in which case this option would
only be used when testing and debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interface=NAME[,NAME...], -i
NAME[,NAME...] <br>
Comma separated list of network interfaces that will be
brought up and scanned for Mandos servers to connect to. The
default is the empty string, which will automatically use
<br>
all appropriate interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --connect option is used,
and exactly one interface name is specified (except
&acirc;none&acirc;), this specifies the interface to use to
connect to the address given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since this program
will normally run in the initial RAM disk environment, the
interface must be an interface which exists at that stage.
Thus, the interface can <br>
normally not be a pseudo-interface such as &acirc;br0&acirc;
or &acirc;tun0&acirc;; such interfaces will not exist until
much later in the boot process, and can not be used by this
program, unless <br>
created by a &acirc;network hook&acirc; &acirc; see the
section called &acirc;NETWORK HOOKS&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME can be the string
&acirc;none&acirc;; this will make mandos-client only bring
up interfaces specified before this string. This is not
recommended, and only meant for advanced users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pubkey=FILE, -p FILE <br>
OpenPGP public key file name. The default name is
&acirc;/conf/conf.d/mandos/pubkey.txt&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--seckey=FILE, -s FILE <br>
OpenPGP secret key file name. The default name is
&acirc;/conf/conf.d/mandos/seckey.txt&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--priority=STRING <br>
GnuTLS priority string for the TLS handshake. The default is
&acirc;SECURE256:!CTYPE-X.509:+CTYPE-OPENPGP:!RSA
:+SIGN-DSA-SHA256&acirc;. See gnutls_priority_init(3) for
the syntax. <br>
Warning: changing this may make the TLS handshake fail,
making server-client communication impossible. Changing this
option may also make the network traffic decryptable by <br>
an attacker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dh-bits=BITS <br>
Sets the number of bits to use for the prime number in the
TLS Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The default value is
selected automatically based on the OpenPGP key. Note that
if <br>
the --dh-params option is used, the values from that file
will be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dh-params=FILE <br>
Specifies a PEM-encoded PKCS#3 file to read the parameters
needed by the TLS Diffie-Hellman key exchange from. If this
option is not given, or if the file for some reason <br>
could not be used, the parameters will be generated on
startup, which will take some time and processing power.
Those using servers running under time, power or processor
<br>
constraints may want to generate such a file in advance and
use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delay=SECONDS <br>
After bringing a network interface up, the program waits for
the interface to arrive in a &acirc;running&acirc; state
before proceeding. During this time, the kernel log level
will be <br>
lowered to reduce clutter on the system console, alleviating
any other plugins which might be using the system console.
This option sets the upper limit of seconds to wait. <br>
The default is 2.5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retry=SECONDS <br>
All Mandos servers are tried repeatedly until a password is
received. This value specifies, in seconds, how long between
each successive try for the same server. The default <br>
is 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--network-hook-dir=DIR <br>
Network hook directory. The default directory is
&acirc;/lib/mandos/network-hooks.d&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Enable debug mode. This will enable a lot of output to
standard error about what the program is doing. The program
will still perform all other functions normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will also enable debug mode
in the Avahi and GnuTLS libraries, making them print large
amounts of debugging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -? <br>
Gives a help message about options and their meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Gives a short usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version, -V <br>
Prints the program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
This is part of the Mandos system for allowing computers to
have encrypted root file systems and at the same time be
capable of remote and/or unattended reboots. The computers
<br>
run a small client program in the initial RAM disk
environment which will communicate with a server over a
network. All network communication is encrypted using TLS.
The clients <br>
are identified by the server using an OpenPGP key; each
client has one unique to it. The server sends the clients an
encrypted password. The encrypted password is decrypted by
<br>
the clients using the same OpenPGP key, and the password is
then used to unlock the root file system, whereupon the
computers can continue booting normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is the client part.
It is a plugin started by plugin-runner(8mandos) which will
run in an initial RAM disk environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program could,
theoretically, be used as a keyscript in /etc/crypttab, but
it would then be impossible to enter a password for the
encrypted root disk at the console, since <br>
this program does not read from the console at all. This is
why a separate plugin runner (plugin-runner(8mandos)) is
used to run both this program and others in in parallel, one
<br>
of which (password-prompt(8mandos)) will prompt for
passwords on the system console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
This program will exit with a successful (zero) exit status
if a server could be found and the password received from it
could be successfully decrypted and output on standard <br>
output. The program will exit with a non-zero exit status
only if a critical error occurs. Otherwise, it will forever
connect to any discovered Mandos servers, trying to get a
<br>
decryptable password and print it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
MANDOSPLUGINHELPERDIR <br>
This environment variable will be assumed to contain the
directory containing any helper executables. The use and
nature of these helper executables, if any, is purposefully
<br>
not documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program does not use any
other environment variables, not even the ones provided by
cryptsetup(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETWORK HOOKS <br>
If a network interface like a bridge or tunnel is required
to find a Mandos server, this requires the interface to be
up and running before mandos-client starts looking for <br>
Mandos servers. This can be accomplished by creating a
&acirc;network hook&acirc; program, and placing it in a
special directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before the network is used (and
again before program exit), any runnable programs found in
the network hook directory are run with the argument
&acirc;start&acirc; or &acirc;stop&acirc;. This should <br>
bring up or down, respectively, any network interface which
mandos-client should use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
A network hook must be an executable file, and its name must
consist entirely of upper and lower case letters, digits,
underscores, periods, and hyphens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A network hook will receive one
argument, which can be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start <br>
This should make the network hook create (if necessary) and
bring up a network interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop <br>
This should make the network hook take down a network
interface, and delete it if it did not exist previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files <br>
This should make the network hook print, one file per line,
all the files needed for it to run. (These files will be
copied into the initial RAM filesystem.) Typical use is <br>
for a network hook which is a shell script to print its
needed binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not necessary to print any
non-executable files already in the network hook directory,
these will be copied implicitly if they otherwise satisfy
the name requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modules <br>
This should make the network hook print, on separate lines,
all the kernel modules needed for it to run. (These modules
will be copied into the initial RAM filesystem.) For <br>
instance, a tunnel interface needs the &acirc;tun&acirc;
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The network hook will be
provided with a number of environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANDOSNETHOOKDIR <br>
The network hook directory, specified to mandos-client by
the --network-hook-dir option. Note: this should always be
used by the network hook to refer to itself or any files
<br>
in the hook directory it may require.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE <br>
The network interfaces, as specified to mandos-client by the
--interface option, combined to one string and separated by
commas. If this is set, and does not contain the <br>
interface a hook will bring up, there is no reason for a
hook to continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODE <br>
This will be the same as the first argument; i.e.
&acirc;start&acirc;, &acirc;stop&acirc;,
&acirc;files&acirc;, or &acirc;modules&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERBOSITY <br>
This will be the &acirc;1&acirc; if the --debug option is
passed to mandos-client, otherwise &acirc;0&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELAY <br>
This will be the same as the --delay option passed to
mandos-client. Is only set if MODE is &acirc;start&acirc; or
&acirc;stop&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECT <br>
This will be the same as the --connect option passed to
mandos-client. Is only set if --connect is passed and MODE
is &acirc;start&acirc; or &acirc;stop&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A hook may not read from
standard input, and should be restrictive in printing to
standard output or standard error unless VERBOSITY is
&acirc;1&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/conf/conf.d/mandos/pubkey.txt,
/conf/conf.d/mandos/seckey.txt <br>
OpenPGP public and private key files, in &acirc;ASCII
Armor&acirc; format. These are the default file names, they
can be changed with the --pubkey and --seckey options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib/mandos/network-hooks.d <br>
Directory where network hooks are located. Change this with
the --network-hook-dir option. See the section called
&acirc;NETWORK HOOKS&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report bugs to the Mandos development mailing list:
&lt;mandos-dev@recompile.se&gt; (subscription required).
Note that this list is public. The developers can be reached
<br>
privately at &lt;mandos@recompile.se&gt; (OpenPGP key
fingerprint 153A 37F1 0BBA 0435 987F 2C4A 7223 2973 CA34
C2C4 for encrypted mail).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Note that normally, command line options will not be given
directly, but via options for the Mandos
plugin-runner(8mandos).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal invocation needs no
options, if the network interfaces can be automatically
determined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mandos-client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search for Mandos servers (and
connect to them) using one specific interface:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mandos-client --interface
eth1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run in debug mode, and use a
custom key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mandos-client --debug --pubkey
keydir/pubkey.txt --seckey keydir/seckey.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run in debug mode, with a custom
key, and do not use Zeroconf to locate a server; connect
directly to the IPv6 link-local address
&acirc;fe80::aede:48ff:fe71:f6f2&acirc;, port 4711, using
<br>
interface eth2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mandos-client --debug --pubkey
keydir/pubkey.txt --seckey keydir/seckey.txt --connect
fe80::aede:48ff:fe71:f6f2:4711 --interface eth2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
This program is set-uid to root, but will switch back to the
original (and presumably non-privileged) user and group
after bringing up the network interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this program for its
intended purpose (see the section called
&acirc;PURPOSE&acirc;), the password for the root file
system will have to be given out to be stored in a server
<br>
computer, after having been encrypted using an OpenPGP key.
This encrypted data which will be stored in a server can
only be decrypted by the OpenPGP key, and the data will only
<br>
be given out to those clients who can prove they actually
have that key. This key, however, is stored unencrypted on
the client side in its initial RAM disk image file system.
<br>
This is normally readable by all, but this is normally fixed
during installation of this program; file permissions are
set so that no-one is able to read that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only remaining weak point is
that someone with physical access to the client hard drive
might turn off the client computer, read the OpenPGP keys
directly from the hard <br>
drive, and communicate with the server. To safeguard against
this, the server is supposed to notice the client
disappearing and stop giving out the encrypted data.
Therefore, it <br>
is important to set the timeout and checker interval values
tightly on the server. See mandos(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will also help if the checker
program on the server is configured to request something
from the client which can not be spoofed by someone else on
the network, like SSH server <br>
key fingerprints, and unlike unencrypted ICMP echo
(&acirc;ping&acirc;) replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This makes it completely
insecure to have Mandos clients which dual-boot to another
operating system which is not trusted to keep the initial
RAM disk image confidential.</p>
