<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
RAID devices are virtual devices created from two or more real block devices.
  This allows multiple devices (typically disk drives or partitions thereof) to
  be combined into a single device to hold (for example) a single filesystem.
  Some RAID levels include redundancy and so can survive some degree of device
  failure.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Linux Software RAID devices are implemented through the md (Multiple Devices)
  device driver.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Currently, Linux supports <b>LINEAR</b> md devices, <b>RAID0</b> (striping),
  <b>RAID1</b> (mirroring), <b>RAID4</b>, <b>RAID5</b>, <b>RAID6</b>,
  <b>RAID10</b>, <b>MULTIPATH</b>, <b>FAULTY</b>, and <b>CONTAINER</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>MULTIPATH</b> is not a Software RAID mechanism, but does involve multiple
  devices: each device is a path to one common physical storage device. New
  installations should not use md/multipath as it is not well supported and has
  no ongoing development. Use the Device Mapper based multipath-tools instead.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>FAULTY</b> is also not true RAID, and it only involves one device. It
  provides a layer over a true device that can be used to inject faults.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>CONTAINER</b> is different again. A <b>CONTAINER</b> is a collection of
  devices that are managed as a set. This is similar to the set of devices
  connected to a hardware RAID controller. The set of devices may contain a
  number of different RAID arrays each utilising some (or all) of the blocks
  from a number of the devices in the set. For example, two devices in a
  5-device set might form a RAID1 using the whole devices. The remaining three
  might have a RAID5 over the first half of each device, and a RAID0 over the
  second half.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With a <b>CONTAINER</b>, there is one set of metadata that describes all of the
  arrays in the container. So when <i>mdadm</i> creates a <b>CONTAINER</b>
  device, the device just represents the metadata. Other normal arrays (RAID1
  etc) can be created inside the container.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODES"><a class="selflink" href="#MODES">MODES</a></h1>
mdadm has several major modes of operation:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Assemble</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Assemble the components of a previously created array into
      an active array. Components can be explicitly given or can be searched
      for. <i>mdadm</i> checks that the components do form a bona fide array,
      and can, on request, fiddle superblock information so as to assemble a
      faulty array.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Build</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Build an array that doesn't have per-device metadata
      (superblocks). For these sorts of arrays, <i>mdadm</i> cannot
      differentiate between initial creation and subsequent assembly of an
      array. It also cannot perform any checks that appropriate components have
      been requested. Because of this, the <b>Build</b> mode should only be used
      together with a complete understanding of what you are doing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Create</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a new array with per-device metadata (superblocks).
      Appropriate metadata is written to each device, and then the array
      comprising those devices is activated. A 'resync' process is started to
      make sure that the array is consistent (e.g. both sides of a mirror
      contain the same data) but the content of the device is left otherwise
      untouched. The array can be used as soon as it has been created. There is
      no need to wait for the initial resync to finish.

  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Follow or Monitor</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Monitor one or more md devices and act on any state
      changes. This is only meaningful for RAID1, 4, 5, 6, 10 or multipath
      arrays, as only these have interesting state. RAID0 or Linear never have
      missing, spare, or failed drives, so there is nothing to monitor.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Grow</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Grow (or shrink) an array, or otherwise reshape it in some
      way. Currently supported growth options including changing the active size
      of component devices and changing the number of active devices in Linear
      and RAID levels 0/1/4/5/6, changing the RAID level between 0, 1, 5, and 6,
      and between 0 and 10, changing the chunk size and layout for RAID
      0,4,5,6,10 as well as adding or removing a write-intent bitmap.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Incremental Assembly</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Add a single device to an appropriate array. If the
      addition of the device makes the array runnable, the array will be
      started. This provides a convenient interface to a <i>hot-plug</i> system.
      As each device is detected, <i>mdadm</i> has a chance to include it in
      some array as appropriate. Optionally, when the <i>--fail</i> flag is
      passed in we will remove the device from any active array instead of
      adding it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a <b>CONTAINER</b> is passed to <i>mdadm</i> in this mode, then any

    The layout of the RAID5 parity block can be one of <b>left-asymmetric</b>,
      <b>left-symmetric</b>, <b>right-asymmetric</b>, <b>right-symmetric</b>,
      <b>la</b>, <b>ra</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>rs</b>. The default is

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    These same layouts are available for RAID6. There are also 4 layouts that
      will provide an intermediate stage for converting between RAID5 and RAID6.
      These provide a layout which is identical to the corresponding RAID5
      layout on the first N-1 devices, and has the 'Q' syndrome (the second
      'parity' block used by RAID6) on the last device. These layouts are:
      <b>left-symmetric-6</b>, <b>right-symmetric-6</b>,
      <b>left-asymmetric-6</b>, <b>right-asymmetric-6</b>, and
      <b>parity-first-6</b>.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each failure mode can be followed by a number, which is used as a period
      between fault generation. Without a number, the fault is generated once on
      the first relevant request. With a number, the fault will be generated
      after that many requests, and will continue to be generated every time the
      period elapses.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Finally, the layout options for RAID10 are one of 'n', 'o' or 'f' followed
      by a small number. The default is 'n2'. The supported options are:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>'n'</i> signals 'near' copies. Multiple copies of one data block are at
      similar offsets in different devices.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>'o'</i> signals 'offset' copies. Rather than the chunks being duplicated
      within a stripe, whole stripes are duplicated but are rotated by one
      device so duplicate blocks are on different devices. Thus subsequent
      copies of a block are in the next drive, and are one chunk further down.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>'f'</i> signals 'far' copies (multiple copies have very different
      offsets). See md(4) for more detail about 'near', 'offset', and 'far'.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The number is the number of copies of each datablock. 2 is normal, 3 can be
      useful. This number can be at most equal to the number of devices in the
      array. It does not need to divide evenly into that number (e.g. it is
      perfectly legal to have an 'n2' layout for an array with an odd number of
      devices).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When an array is converted between RAID5 and RAID6 an intermediate RAID6
      layout is used in which the second parity block (Q) is always on the last
      device. To convert a RAID5 to RAID6 and leave it in this new layout (which
      does not require re-striping) use <b>--layout=preserve</b>. This will try
      to avoid any restriping.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The converse of this is <b>--layout=normalise</b> which will change a
      non-standard RAID6 layout into a more standard arrangement.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>sparc2.2</b> option will adjust the superblock of an array what was
      created on a Sparc machine running a patched 2.2 Linux kernel. This kernel
      got the alignment of part of the superblock wrong. You can use the
      <b>--examine --sparc2.2</b> option to <i>mdadm</i> to see what effect this
      would have.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>super-minor</b> option will update the <b>preferred minor</b> field
      on each superblock to match the minor number of the array being assembled.
      This can be useful if <b>--examine</b> reports a different &quot;Preferred
      Minor&quot; to <b>--detail</b>. In some cases this update will be
      performed automatically by the kernel driver. In particular the update
      happens automatically at the first write to an array with redundancy (RAID
      level 1 or greater) on a 2.6 (or later) kernel.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>uuid</b> option will change the uuid of the array. If a UUID is given
      with the <b>--uuid</b> option that UUID will be used as a new UUID and
      will <b>NOT</b> be used to help identify the devices in the array. If no
      <b>--uuid</b> is given, a random UUID is chosen.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>name</b> option will change the <i>name</i> of the array as stored in
      the superblock. This is only supported for version-1 superblocks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>nodes</b> option will change the <i>nodes</i> of the array as stored
      in the bitmap superblock. This option only works for a clustered
      environment.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>homehost</b> option will change the <i>homehost</i> as recorded in
      the superblock. For version-0 superblocks, this is the same as updating
      the UUID. For version-1 superblocks, this involves updating the name.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>home-cluster</b> option will change the cluster name as recorded in
      the superblock and bitmap. This option only works for clustered
      environment.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>resync</b> option will cause the array to be marked <i>dirty</i>
      meaning that any redundancy in the array (e.g. parity for RAID5, copies
      for RAID1) may be incorrect. This will cause the RAID system to perform a
      &quot;resync&quot; pass to make sure that all redundant information is
      correct.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>byteorder</b> option allows arrays to be moved between machines with
      different byte-order. When assembling such an array for the first time
      after a move, giving <b>--update=byteorder</b> will cause <i>mdadm</i> to
      expect superblocks to have their byteorder reversed, and will correct that
      order before assembling the array. This is only valid with original
      (Version 0.90) superblocks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>summaries</b> option will correct the summaries in the superblock.
      That is the counts of total, working, active, failed, and spare devices.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>devicesize</b> option will rarely be of use. It applies to version
      1.1 and 1.2 metadata only (where the metadata is at the start of the
      device) and is only useful when the component device has changed size
      (typically become larger). The version 1 metadata records the amount of
      the device that can be used to store data, so if a device in a version 1.1
      or 1.2 array becomes larger, the metadata will still be visible, but the
      extra space will not. In this case it might be useful to assemble the
      array with <b>--update=devicesize</b>. This will cause <i>mdadm</i> to
      determine the maximum usable amount of space on each device and update the
      relevant field in the metadata.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>metadata</b> option only works on v0.90 metadata arrays and will
      convert them to v1.0 metadata. The array must not be dirty (i.e. it must
      not need a sync) and it must not have a write-intent bitmap.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The old metadata will remain on the devices, but will appear older than the
      new metadata and so will usually be ignored. The old metadata (or indeed
      the new metadata) can be removed by giving the appropriate
      <b>--metadata=</b> option to <b>--zero-superblock</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>no-bitmap</b> option can be used when an array has an internal bitmap
      which is corrupt in some way so that assembling the array normally fails.
      It will cause any internal bitmap to be ignored.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>bbl</b> option will reserve space in each device for a bad block
      list. This will be 4K in size and positioned near the end of any free
      space between the superblock and the data.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>no-bbl</b> option will cause any reservation of space for a bad block
      list to be removed. If the bad block list contains entries, this will
      fail, as removing the list could cause data corruption.

Each operation applies to all devices listed until the next operation.

If an array is using a write-intent bitmap, then devices which have been removed

</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This usage assembles one or more RAID arrays from pre-existing components. For
  each array, mdadm needs to know the md device, the identity of the array, and
  a number of component-devices. These can be found in a number of ways.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the first usage example (without the <b>--scan</b>) the first device given is
  the md device. In the second usage example, all devices listed are treated as
  md devices and assembly is attempted. In the third (where no devices are
  listed) all md devices that are listed in the configuration file are
  assembled. If no arrays are described by the configuration file, then any
  arrays that can be found on unused devices will be assembled.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If precisely one device is listed, but <b>--scan</b> is not given, then
  <i>mdadm</i> acts as though <b>--scan</b> was given and identity information
  is extracted from the configuration file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The identity can be given with the <b>--uuid</b> option, the <b>--name</b>
  option, or the <b>--super-minor</b> option, will be taken from the md-device
  record in the config file, or will be taken from the super block of the first
  component-device listed on the command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Devices can be given on the <b>--assemble</b> command line or in the config
  file. Only devices which have an md superblock which contains the right
  identity will be considered for any array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The config file is only used if explicitly named with <b>--config</b> or
  requested with (a possibly implicit) <b>--scan</b>. In the later case,
  <b>/etc/mdadm.conf</b> or <b>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</b> is used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <b>--scan</b> is not given, then the config file will only be used to find
  the identity of md arrays.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Normally the array will be started after it is assembled. However if
  <b>--scan</b> is not given and not all expected drives were listed, then the
  array is not started (to guard against usage errors). To insist that the array
  be started in this case (as may work for RAID1, 4, 5, 6, or 10), give the
  <b>--run</b> flag.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <i>udev</i> is active, <i>mdadm</i> does not create any entries in
  <b>/dev</b> but leaves that to <i>udev</i>. It does record information in
  <b>/run/mdadm/map</b> which will allow <i>udev</i> to choose the correct name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <i>mdadm</i> detects that udev is not configured, it will create the devices
  in <b>/dev</b> itself.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In Linux kernels prior to version 2.6.28 there were two distinctly different
  types of md devices that could be created: one that could be partitioned using
  standard partitioning tools and one that could not. Since 2.6.28 that
  distinction is no longer relevant as both type of devices can be partitioned.
  <i>mdadm</i> will normally create the type that originally could not be
  partitioned as it has a well defined major number (9).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Prior to 2.6.28, it is important that mdadm chooses the correct type of array
  device to use. This can be controlled with the <b>--auto</b> option. In
  particular, a value of &quot;mdp&quot; or &quot;part&quot; or &quot;p&quot;
  tells mdadm to use a partitionable device rather than the default.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the no-udev case, the value given to <b>--auto</b> can be suffixed by a
  number. This tells <i>mdadm</i> to create that number of partition devices
  rather than the default of 4.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The value given to <b>--auto</b> can also be given in the configuration file as
  a word starting <b>auto=</b> on the ARRAY line for the relevant array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Auto_Assembly"><a class="selflink" href="#Auto_Assembly">Auto
  Assembly</a></h2>
When <b>--assemble</b> is used with <b>--scan</b> and no devices are listed,
  <i>mdadm</i> will first attempt to assemble all the arrays listed in the
  config file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no arrays are listed in the config (other than those marked
  <b>&lt;ignore&gt;</b>) it will look through the available devices for possible
  arrays and will try to assemble anything that it finds. Arrays which are
  tagged as belonging to the given homehost will be assembled and started
  normally. Arrays which do not obviously belong to this host are given names
  that are expected not to conflict with anything local, and are started
  &quot;read-auto&quot; so that nothing is written to any device until the array
  is written to. i.e. automatic resync etc is delayed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <i>mdadm</i> finds a consistent set of devices that look like they should
  comprise an array, and if the superblock is tagged as belonging to the given
  home host, it will automatically choose a device name and try to assemble the
  array. If the array uses version-0.90 metadata, then the <b>minor</b> number
  as recorded in the superblock is used to create a name in <b>/dev/md/</b> so
  for example <b>/dev/md/3</b>. If the array uses version-1 metadata, then the
  <b>name</b> from the superblock is used to similarly create a name in
  <b>/dev/md/</b> (the name will have any 'host' prefix stripped first).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This behaviour can be modified by the <i>AUTO</i> line in the <i>mdadm.conf</i>
  configuration file. This line can indicate that specific metadata type should,
  or should not, be automatically assembled. If an array is found which is not
  listed in <i>mdadm.conf</i> and has a metadata format that is denied by the
  <i>AUTO</i> line, then it will not be assembled. The <i>AUTO</i> line can also
  request that all arrays identified as being for this homehost should be
  assembled regardless of their metadata type. See <i>mdadm.conf</i>(5) for
  further details.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note: Auto assembly cannot be used for assembling and activating some arrays
  which are undergoing reshape. In particular as the <b>backup-file</b> cannot
  be given, any reshape which requires a backup-file to continue cannot be
  started by auto assembly. An array which is growing to more devices and has
  passed the critical section can be assembled using auto-assembly.

This usage is similar to <b>--create</b>. The difference is that it creates an
  array without a superblock. With these arrays there is no difference between
  initially creating the array and subsequently assembling the array, except
  that hopefully there is useful data there in the second case.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The level may raid0, linear, raid1, raid10, multipath, or faulty, or one of
  their synonyms. All devices must be listed and the array will be started once
  complete. It will often be appropriate to use <b>--assume-clean</b> with
  levels raid1 or raid10.

  <b>--level=</b><i>Y</i>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--raid-devices=</b><i>Z</i> <i>devices</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This usage will initialise a new md array, associate some devices with it, and
  activate the array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The named device will normally not exist when <i>mdadm --create</i> is run, but
  will be created by <i>udev</i> once the array becomes active.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As devices are added, they are checked to see if they contain RAID superblocks
  or filesystems. They are also checked to see if the variance in device size
  exceeds 1%.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If any discrepancy is found, the array will not automatically be run, though the
  presence of a <b>--run</b> can override this caution.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To create a &quot;degraded&quot; array in which some devices are missing, simply
  give the word &quot; <b>missing</b>&quot; in place of a device name. This will
  cause <i>mdadm</i> to leave the corresponding slot in the array empty. For a
  RAID4 or RAID5 array at most one slot can be &quot; <b>missing</b>&quot;; for
  a RAID6 array at most two slots. For a RAID1 array, only one real device needs
  to be given. All of the others can be &quot; <b>missing</b>&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When creating a RAID5 array, <i>mdadm</i> will automatically create a degraded
  array with an extra spare drive. This is because building the spare into a
  degraded array is in general faster than resyncing the parity on a
  non-degraded, but not clean, array. This feature can be overridden with the
  <b>--force</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When creating an array with version-1 metadata a name for the array is required.
  If this is not given with the <b>--name</b> option, <i>mdadm</i> will choose a
  name based on the last component of the name of the device being created. So
  if <b>/dev/md3</b> is being created, then the name <b>3</b> will be chosen. If
  <b>/dev/md/home</b> is being created, then the name <b>home</b> will be used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When creating a partition based array, using <i>mdadm</i> with version-1.x
  metadata, the partition type should be set to <b>0xDA</b> (non fs-data). This
  type selection allows for greater precision since using any other [RAID
  auto-detect (0xFD) or a GNU/Linux partition (0x83)], might create problems in
  the event of array recovery through a live cdrom.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A new array will normally get a randomly assigned 128bit UUID which is very
  likely to be unique. If you have a specific need, you can choose a UUID for
  the array by giving the <b>--uuid=</b> option. Be warned that creating two
  arrays with the same UUID is a recipe for disaster. Also, using <b>--uuid=</b>
  when creating a v0.90 array will silently override any <b>--homehost=</b>
  setting.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the array type supports a write-intent bitmap, and if the devices in the
  array exceed 100G is size, an internal write-intent bitmap will automatically
  be added unless some other option is explicitly requested with the
  <b>--bitmap</b> option. In any case space for a bitmap will be reserved so
  that one can be added layer with <b>--grow --bitmap=internal</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the metadata type supports it (currently only 1.x metadata), space will be
  allocated to store a bad block list. This allows a modest number of bad blocks
  to be recorded, allowing the drive to remain in service while only partially
  functional.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When creating an array within a <b>CONTAINER</b> <i>mdadm</i> can be given
  either the list of devices to use, or simply the name of the container. The
  former case gives control over which devices in the container will be used for
  the array. The latter case allows <i>mdadm</i> to automatically choose which
  devices to use based on how much spare space is available.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The General Management options that are valid with <b>--create</b> are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--run</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">insist on running the array even if some devices look like
      they might be in use.

<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 12.00ex; text-indent: -12.00ex;">Usage:
  <b>mdadm</b> <i>device</i> <i>options... devices...</i></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This usage will allow individual devices in an array to be failed, removed or
  added. It is possible to perform multiple operations with on command. For
  example:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> mdadm /dev/md0 -f /dev/hda1 -r /dev/hda1 -a /dev/hda1</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
will firstly mark <b>/dev/hda1</b> as faulty in <b>/dev/md0</b> and will then
  remove it from the array and finally add it back in as a spare. However only
  one md array can be affected by a single command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When a device is added to an active array, mdadm checks to see if it has
  metadata on it which suggests that it was recently a member of the array. If
  it does, it tries to &quot;re-add&quot; the device. If there have been no
  changes since the device was removed, or if the array has a write-intent
  bitmap which has recorded whatever changes there were, then the device will
  immediately become a full member of the array and those differences recorded
  in the bitmap will be resolved.

  MODE</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 12.00ex; text-indent: -12.00ex;">Usage:
  <b>mdadm --monitor</b> <i>options... devices...</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This usage causes <i>mdadm</i> to periodically poll a number of md arrays and to
  report on any events noticed. <i>mdadm</i> will never exit once it decides
  that there are arrays to be checked, so it should normally be run in the
  background.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As well as reporting events, <i>mdadm</i> may move a spare drive from one array
  to another if they are in the same <b>spare-group</b> or <b>domain</b> and if
  the destination array has a failed drive but no spares.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If any devices are listed on the command line, <i>mdadm</i> will only monitor
  those devices. Otherwise all arrays listed in the configuration file will be
  monitored. Further, if <b>--scan</b> is given, then any other md devices that
  appear in <b>/proc/mdstat</b> will also be monitored.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The result of monitoring the arrays is the generation of events. These events
  are passed to a separate program (if specified) and may be mailed to a given
  E-mail address.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When passing events to a program, the program is run once for each event, and is
  given 2 or 3 command-line arguments: the first is the name of the event (see
  below), the second is the name of the md device which is affected, and the
  third is the name of a related device if relevant (such as a component device
  that has failed).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <b>--scan</b> is given, then a program or an E-mail address must be specified
  on the command line or in the config file. If neither are available, then
  <i>mdadm</i> will not monitor anything. Without <b>--scan,</b> <i>mdadm</i>
  will continue monitoring as long as something was found to monitor. If no
  program or email is given, then each event is reported to <b>stdout</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The different events are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      longer be configured. (syslog priority: Critical)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <i>mdadm</i> was told to monitor an array which is RAID0 or Linear, then
      it will report <b>DeviceDisappeared</b> with the extra information
      <b>Wrong-Level</b>. This is because RAID0 and Linear do not support the

Only <b>Fail,</b> <b>FailSpare,</b> <b>DegradedArray,</b> <b>SparesMissing</b>
  and <b>TestMessage</b> cause Email to be sent. All events cause the program to
  be run. The program is run with two or three arguments: the event name, the
  array device and possibly a second device.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each event has an associated array device (e.g. <b>/dev/md1</b>) and possibly a
  second device. For <b>Fail</b>, <b>FailSpare</b>, and <b>SpareActive</b> the
  second device is the relevant component device. For <b>MoveSpare</b> the
  second device is the array that the spare was moved from.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For <i>mdadm</i> to move spares from one array to another, the different arrays
  need to be labeled with the same <b>spare-group</b> or the spares must be
  allowed to migrate through matching POLICY domains in the configuration file.
  The <b>spare-group</b> name can be any string; it is only necessary that
  different spare groups use different names.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When <i>mdadm</i> detects that an array in a spare group has fewer active
  devices than necessary for the complete array, and has no spare devices, it
  will look for another array in the same spare group that has a full complement
  of working drive and a spare. It will then attempt to remove the spare from
  the second drive and add it to the first. If the removal succeeds but the
  adding fails, then it is added back to the original array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the spare group for a degraded array is not defined, <i>mdadm</i> will look
  at the rules of spare migration specified by POLICY lines in <b>mdadm.conf</b>
  and then follow similar steps as above if a matching spare is found.

Using GROW on containers is currently supported only for Intel's IMSM container
  format. The number of devices in a container can be increased - which affects
  all arrays in the container - or an array in a container can be converted
  between levels where those levels are supported by the container, and the
  conversion is on of those listed above. Resizing arrays in an IMSM container
  with <b>--grow --size</b> is not yet supported.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Grow functionality (e.g. expand a number of raid devices) for Intel's IMSM
  container format has an experimental status. It is guarded by the
  <b>MDADM_EXPERIMENTAL</b> environment variable which must be set to '1' for a
  GROW command to succeed. This is for the following reasons:

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SIZE_CHANGES"><a class="selflink" href="#SIZE_CHANGES">SIZE
  CHANGES</a></h2>
Normally when an array is built the &quot;size&quot; is taken from the smallest
  of the drives. If all the small drives in an arrays are, one at a time,
  removed and replaced with larger drives, then you could have an array of large
  drives with only a small amount used. In this situation, changing the
  &quot;size&quot; with &quot;GROW&quot; mode will allow the extra space to
  start being used. If the size is increased in this way, a &quot;resync&quot;
  process will start to make sure the new parts of the array are synchronised.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that when an array changes size, any filesystem that may be stored in the
  array will not automatically grow or shrink to use or vacate the space. The
  filesystem will need to be explicitly told to use the extra space after
  growing, or to reduce its size <b>prior</b> to shrinking the array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also the size of an array cannot be changed while it has an active bitmap. If an
  array has a bitmap, it must be removed before the size can be changed. Once
  the change is complete a new bitmap can be created.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="RAID-DEVICES_CHANGES"><a class="selflink" href="#RAID-DEVICES_CHANGES">RAID-DEVICES
  CHANGES</a></h2>
A RAID1 array can work with any number of devices from 1 upwards (though 1 is
  not very useful). There may be times which you want to increase or decrease
  the number of active devices. Note that this is different to hot-add or
  hot-remove which changes the number of inactive devices.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When reducing the number of devices in a RAID1 array, the slots which are to be
  removed from the array must already be vacant. That is, the devices which were
  in those slots must be failed and removed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the number of devices is increased, any hot spares that are present will be
  activated immediately.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Changing the number of active devices in a RAID5 or RAID6 is much more effort.
  Every block in the array will need to be read and written back to a new
  location. From 2.6.17, the Linux Kernel is able to increase the number of
  devices in a RAID5 safely, including restarting an interrupted
  &quot;reshape&quot;. From 2.6.31, the Linux Kernel is able to increase or
  decrease the number of devices in a RAID5 or RAID6.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
From 2.6.35, the Linux Kernel is able to convert a RAID0 in to a RAID4 or RAID5.
  <i>mdadm</i> uses this functionality and the ability to add devices to a RAID4
  to allow devices to be added to a RAID0. When requested to do this,
  <i>mdadm</i> will convert the RAID0 to a RAID4, add the necessary disks and
  make the reshape happen, and then convert the RAID4 back to RAID0.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When decreasing the number of devices, the size of the array will also decrease.
  If there was data in the array, it could get destroyed and this is not
  reversible, so you should firstly shrink the filesystem on the array to fit
  within the new size. To help prevent accidents, <i>mdadm</i> requires that the
  size of the array be decreased first with <b>mdadm --grow --array-size</b>.
  This is a reversible change which simply makes the end of the array
  inaccessible. The integrity of any data can then be checked before the
  non-reversible reduction in the number of devices is request.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When relocating the first few stripes on a RAID5 or RAID6, it is not possible to
  keep the data on disk completely consistent and crash-proof. To provide the
  required safety, mdadm disables writes to the array while this &quot;critical
  section&quot; is reshaped, and takes a backup of the data that is in that
  section. For grows, this backup may be stored in any spare devices that the
  array has, however it can also be stored in a separate file specified with the
  <b>--backup-file</b> option, and is required to be specified for shrinks, RAID
  level changes and layout changes. If this option is used, and the system does
  crash during the critical period, the same file must be passed to
  <b>--assemble</b> to restore the backup and reassemble the array. When
  shrinking rather than growing the array, the reshape is done from the end
  towards the beginning, so the &quot;critical section&quot; is at the end of
  the reshape.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="LEVEL_CHANGES"><a class="selflink" href="#LEVEL_CHANGES">LEVEL
  CHANGES</a></h2>
Changing the RAID level of any array happens instantaneously. However in the
  RAID5 to RAID6 case this requires a non-standard layout of the RAID6 data, and
  in the RAID6 to RAID5 case that non-standard layout is required before the
  change can be accomplished. So while the level change is instant, the
  accompanying layout change can take quite a long time. A <b>--backup-file</b>
  is required. If the array is not simultaneously being grown or shrunk, so that
  the array size will remain the same - for example, reshaping a 3-drive RAID5
  into a 4-drive RAID6 - the backup file will be used not just for a
  &quot;cricital section&quot; but throughout the reshape operation, as
  described below under LAYOUT CHANGES.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CHUNK-SIZE_AND_LAYOUT_CHANGES"><a class="selflink" href="#CHUNK-SIZE_AND_LAYOUT_CHANGES">CHUNK-SIZE
  AND LAYOUT CHANGES</a></h2>
Changing the chunk-size of layout without also changing the number of devices as
  the same time will involve re-writing all blocks in-place. To ensure against
  data loss in the case of a crash, a <b>--backup-file</b> must be provided for
  these changes. Small sections of the array will be copied to the backup file
  while they are being rearranged. This means that all the data is copied twice,
  once to the backup and once to the new layout on the array, so this type of
  reshape will go very slowly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the reshape is interrupted for any reason, this backup file must be made
  available to <b>mdadm --assemble</b> so the array can be reassembled.
  Consequently the file cannot be stored on the device being reshaped.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BITMAP_CHANGES"><a class="selflink" href="#BITMAP_CHANGES">BITMAP
  CHANGES</a></h2>
A write-intent bitmap can be added to, or removed from, an active array. Either
  internal bitmaps, or bitmaps stored in a separate file, can be added. Note
  that if you add a bitmap stored in a file which is in a filesystem that is on
  the RAID array being affected, the system will deadlock. The bitmap must be on
  a separate filesystem.

This mode is designed to be used in conjunction with a device discovery system.
  As devices are found in a system, they can be passed to <b>mdadm
  --incremental</b> to be conditionally added to an appropriate array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Conversely, it can also be used with the <b>--fail</b> flag to do just the
  opposite and find whatever array a particular device is part of and remove the
  device from that array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the device passed is a <b>CONTAINER</b> device created by a previous call to
  <i>mdadm</i>, then rather than trying to add that device to an array, all the
  arrays described by the metadata of the container will be started.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>mdadm</i> performs a number of tests to determine if the device is part of an
  array, and which array it should be part of. If an appropriate array is found,
  or can be created, <i>mdadm</i> adds the device to the array and conditionally
  starts the array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that <i>mdadm</i> will normally only add devices to an array which were
  previously working (active or spare) parts of that array. The support for
  automatic inclusion of a new drive as a spare in some array requires a
  configuration through POLICY in config file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The tests that <i>mdadm</i> makes are as follow:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">+</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Is the device permitted by <b>mdadm.conf</b>? That is, is
      it listed in a <b>DEVICES</b> line in that file. If <b>DEVICES</b> is
      absent then the default it to allow any device. Similarly if
      <b>DEVICES</b> contains the special word <b>partitions</b> then any device
      is allowed. Otherwise the device name given to <i>mdadm</i>, or one of the
      aliases given, or an alias found in the filesystem, must match one of the
      names or patterns in a <b>DEVICES</b> line.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is the only context where the aliases are used. They are usually
      provided by a <i>udev</i> rules mentioning <b>${DEVLINKS}</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">+</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Does the device have a valid md superblock? If a specific
      metadata version is requested with <b>--metadata</b> or <b>-e</b> then
      only that style of metadata is accepted, otherwise <i>mdadm</i> finds any
      known version of metadata. If no <i>md</i> metadata is found, the device
      may be still added to an array as a spare if POLICY allows.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>mdadm</i> keeps a list of arrays that it has partially assembled in
  <b>/run/mdadm/map</b>. If no array exists which matches the metadata on the
  new device, <i>mdadm</i> must choose a device name and unit number. It does
  this based on any name given in <b>mdadm.conf</b> or any name information
  stored in the metadata. If this name suggests a unit number, that number will
  be used, otherwise a free unit number will be chosen. Normally <i>mdadm</i>
  will prefer to create a partitionable array, however if the <b>CREATE</b> line
  in <b>mdadm.conf</b> suggests that a non-partitionable array is preferred,
  that will be honoured.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the array is not found in the config file and its metadata does not identify
  it as belonging to the &quot;homehost&quot;, then <i>mdadm</i> will choose a
  name for the array which is certain not to conflict with any array which does
  belong to this host. It does this be adding an underscore and a small number
  to the name preferred by the metadata.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Once an appropriate array is found or created and the device is added,
  <i>mdadm</i> must decide if the array is ready to be started. It will normally
  compare the number of available (non-spare) devices to the number of devices
  that the metadata suggests need to be active. If there are at least that many,
  the array will be started. This means that if any devices are missing the
  array will not be restarted.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As an alternative, <b>--run</b> may be passed to <i>mdadm</i> in which case the
  array will be run as soon as there are enough devices present for the data to
  be accessible. For a RAID1, that means one device will start the array. For a
  clean RAID5, the array will be started as soon as all but one drive is
  present.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that neither of these approaches is really ideal. If it can be known that
  all device discovery has completed, then
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> mdadm -IRs</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
can be run which will try to start all arrays that are being incrementally
  assembled. They are started in &quot;read-auto&quot; mode in which they are
  read-only until the first write request. This means that no metadata updates
  are made and no attempt at resync or recovery happens. Further devices that
  are found before the first write can still be added safely.

If you're using the <b>/proc</b> filesystem, <b>/proc/mdstat</b> lists all
  active md devices with information about them. <i>mdadm</i> uses this to find
  arrays when <b>--scan</b> is given in Misc mode, and to monitor array
  reconstruction on Monitor mode.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="/etc/mdadm.conf"><a class="selflink" href="#/etc/mdadm.conf">/etc/mdadm.conf</a></h2>
The config file lists which devices may be scanned to see if they contain MD
  super block, and gives identifying information (e.g. UUID) about known MD
  arrays. See <b>mdadm.conf</b>(5) for more details.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEVICE_NAMES"><a class="selflink" href="#DEVICE_NAMES">DEVICE
  NAMES</a></h1>
<i>mdadm</i> understand two sorts of names for array devices.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first is the so-called 'standard' format name, which matches the names used
  by the kernel and which appear in <i>/proc/mdstat</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The second sort can be freely chosen, but must reside in <i>/dev/md/</i>. When
  giving a device name to <i>mdadm</i> to create or assemble an array, either
  full path name such as <i>/dev/md0</i> or <i>/dev/md/home</i> can be given, or
  just the suffix of the second sort of name, such as <i>home</i> can be given.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When <i>mdadm</i> chooses device names during auto-assembly or incremental
  assembly, it will sometimes add a small sequence number to the end of the name
  to avoid conflicted between multiple arrays that have the same name. If
  <i>mdadm</i> can reasonably determine that the array really is meant for this
  host, either by a hostname in the metadata, or by the presence of the array in
  <b>mdadm.conf</b>, then it will leave off the suffix if possible. Also if the
  homehost is specified as <b>&lt;ignore&gt;</b> <i>mdadm</i> will only use a
  suffix if a different array of the same name already exists or is listed in
  the config file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The standard names for non-partitioned arrays (the only sort of md array
  available in 2.4 and earlier) are of the form
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">/dev/md<b>NN</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where NN is a number. The standard names for partitionable arrays (as available
  from 2.6 onwards) are of the form:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">/dev/md_d<b>NN</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Partition numbers should be indicated by adding &quot;pMM&quot; to these, thus
  &quot;/dev/md/d1p2&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
From kernel version 2.6.28 the &quot;non-partitioned array&quot; can actually be
  partitioned. So the &quot;md_d <b>NN</b>&quot; names are no longer needed, and
  partitions such as &quot;/dev/md <b>NN</b>p<b>XX</b>&quot; are possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
From kernel version 2.6.29 standard names can be non-numeric following the form:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">/dev/md_<b>XXX</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <b>XXX</b> is any string. These names are supported by <i>mdadm</i> since
  version 3.3 provided they are enabled in <i>mdadm.conf</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE">NOTE</a></h1>
<i>mdadm</i> was previously known as <i>mdctl</i>.
