<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fxotune - automatically tune DAHDI FXO channels</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fxotune -i [options] - detect mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fxotune -d [ options ] - dump
mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fxotune -s [ options ] - Startup
mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fxotune is a script that fine-tune parameters of the FXO
modules of the card. It has three modes of operation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detect mode (-i): it detects and
tunes all the available FXO channels. It writes settings to
a configuration file (/etc/fxotune.conf) from which it can
be loaded (e.g: at <br>
startup) using -s .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump mode (-d): Runs detection
on a single DAHDI channel, and just dumps waveforms to
fxotune_dump.vals is generated in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Startup mode (-s): fxotune just
reads the settings from fxotune.conf into the FXO
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are advised to run fxotune
on all FXO ports you have that support it and that are
connected. Note that the tunning is affected by e.g. the
physical parameters of the connec&acirc; <br>
tion, and thus if it has been radically changed, you may
need to re-run fxotune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program only works for the
Digium TDM400P/800P/2400P cards and compatible and the
Xorcom Astribank devices. Other cards (notably X100P cards
and clones) do not have the <br>
hardware to support such tuning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tuning process needs a clear
line to do the tuning. In order to do that, it runs in
cycles of the following: sets the line off-hook, dials a
dial string (which should set <br>
the PSTN provider waiting for the next digit), and then
starts tuning. It has a limited ammount of time for tuning
before the PSTN gives up and gives a busy tone. So after a
<br>
while it hangs up and starts a new cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fxotune has two operation modes:
tune (-i) and set (-s). In the tune mode it generates
/etc/fxotune.conf, and in the set mode it merely applies the
parameters from fxotune.conf <br>
to device&rsquo;s ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options below except -v (verbose) affect only
the detection process and hence apply only to the detect and
dump modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, to maintain
compatibility with older versions of fxotune, if in detect
or dump mode there is a parameter with option before it, it
is considered to be the dialstring <br>
parameter (-n).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b startdev <br>
Start tuning from dahdi channel num. startdev: skip all
previous channels. By default starting from channel 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In dump mode (-d) this is the
single channel that will be tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e stopdev <br>
Tune only up to dahdi channel num. stopdev: skip all
previous channels. By default stopping at channel 252.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In dump mode (-d) this parameter
is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l delay-to-silence <br>
Time in seconds to wait after dialing the dial-string to get
a clear line. The default is 0. before</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m silence-good-for <br>
Time in seconds which states how long the PSTN will wait
after we dialed the dial-string until it starts giving a
busy tone. You can test this by connecting an analog <br>
phone to the line and dialing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 18 (18
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n dial-string <br>
Digits to dial to the PSTN in order to get it stop its
dialtone and waiting for the next digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is &quot;4&quot;
(sending just the digit 4). It should work in most cases.
Again, this can be tested by connecting a phone to the PSTN
line and dialing the dial-string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t detect-type <br>
This option allows using the older detection method used by
fxotune of Zaptel 1.2. use -t 1 for that older method.
whereas -t 2 (the default) uses the current method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option only applies to
detect mode (-i).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[vvvv] <br>
Sets debugging on. The more v-s, the higher debug level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that: -vv -v will actually
set debug level to 1 instead of 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w wave-form <br>
The default: -1, for multitone waveform. Alternatively: a
frequency of a single tone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option only applies to dump
mode (-d).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
fxotune -i 9 <br>
if you need to dial 9 for an external line. If you always
get a line, you can simply use any digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Load settings from the last test. Used at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/fxotune.conf <br>
The configuration file generated by fxotune in detect mode
and from which configuration is loaded when -s is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Running fxotune takes approximately a minute per port. If
you wish to only run fxotune for several ports, you can use
the options -b and -e to set a specific range of ports. <br>
Another useful trick is to actually keep asterisk running,
and only &quot;destroy&quot; the dahdi channels you wish to
tune (dahdi destroy channel NNN): other channels will be
used by <br>
Asterisk, and hence skipped. This can be useful if you have
many FXO ports that are not connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fxotune writes immediately to
/etc/fxotune.conf so if you stop it half-way, you may get a
half-configured system. If you have already tuned your FXO
channels and wish to test-run <br>
fxotune again, you are advised to backup /etc/fxotune.conf
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default for -m is 18
seconds. This asusmes that you get a clear line for at least
18 seconds. It is advised that you test that timeout earlier
by connecting a phone to the <br>
FXO line, dialing 4 (or whatever dial string you put with
-n) and see how much time of silence you have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you connect your device to a
PSTN provider that is not in the US, there is a similar
operation you should apply before even getting to fxotune:
setting the opermode. The oper&acirc; <br>
mode sets a number of country-specific parameters. For the
Digium analog cards this is set through the kernel module
parameter &rsquo;opermode&rsquo; . For the Xorcom Astribank
this is set <br>
through the variable &rsquo;opermode&rsquo; in
/etc/dahdi/xpp.conf . For valid values of this parameter,
see /usr/share/asterisk/init_fxo_modes (FIXME: this has
changed and will change. <br>
