<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-keygen - DNSSEC key generation tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-keygen [-a algorithm] [-b keysize] [-n nametype] [-3]
[-A date/offset] [-C] [-c class] [-D date/offset] [-E

[-s strength] [-t type] [-v level] [-z] <br>
{name}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnssec-keygen generates keys for DNSSEC (Secure DNS), as
defined in RFC 2535 and RFC 4034. It can also generate keys
for use with TSIG (Transaction Signatures) as defined in RFC
<br>
2845, or TKEY (Transaction Key) as defined in RFC 2930.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the key is specified
on the command line. For DNSSEC keys, this must match the
name of the zone for which the key is being generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a algorithm <br>
Selects the cryptographic algorithm. For DNSSEC keys, the
value of algorithm must be one of RSAMD5, RSASHA1, DSA,
NSEC3RSASHA1, NSEC3DSA, RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECCGOST, <br>
ECDSAP256SHA256 or ECDSAP384SHA384. For TSIG/TKEY, the value
must be DH (Diffie Hellman), HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1,
HMAC-SHA224, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384, or HMAC-SHA512. These
<br>
values are case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no algorithm is specified,
then RSASHA1 will be used by default, unless the -3 option
is specified, in which case NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used
instead. (If -3 is used and an <br>
algorithm is specified, that algorithm will be checked for
compatibility with NSEC3.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1
is a mandatory to implement algorithm, and DSA is
recommended. For TSIG, HMAC-MD5 is mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 2: DH, HMAC-MD5, and
HMAC-SHA1 through HMAC-SHA512 automatically set the -T KEY
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b keysize <br>
Specifies the number of bits in the key. The choice of key
size depends on the algorithm used. RSA keys must be between
512 and 2048 bits. Diffie Hellman keys must be between <br>
128 and 4096 bits. DSA keys must be between 512 and 1024
bits and an exact multiple of 64. HMAC keys must be between
1 and 512 bits. Elliptic curve algorithms don&rsquo;t need
this <br>
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key size does not need to be
specified if using a default algorithm. The default key size
is 1024 bits for zone signing keys (ZSK&rsquo;s) and 2048
bits for key signing keys <br>
(KSK&rsquo;s, generated with -f KSK). However, if an
algorithm is explicitly specified with the -a, then there is
no default key size, and the -b must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nametype <br>
Specifies the owner type of the key. The value of nametype
must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)),
HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a host (KEY)),
<br>
USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or OTHER
(DNSKEY). These values are case insensitive. Defaults to
ZONE for DNSKEY generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 <br>
Use an NSEC3-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If
this option is used and no algorithm is explicitly set on
the command line, NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used by default. <br>
Note that RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECCGOST, ECDSAP256SHA256 and
ECDSAP384SHA384 algorithms are NSEC3-capable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
Compatibility mode: generates an old-style key, without any
metadata. By default, dnssec-keygen will include the
key&rsquo;s creation date in the metadata stored with the
private <br>
key, and other dates may be set there as well (publication
date, activation date, etc). Keys that include this data may
be incompatible with older versions of BIND; the -C <br>
option suppresses them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c class <br>
Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have
the specified class. If not specified, class IN is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E engine <br>
Uses a crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine) for random number
and, when supported, key generation. When compiled with
PKCS#11 support it defaults to pkcs11; the empty name resets
<br>
it to no engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f flag <br>
Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY
record. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key)
and REVOKE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G <br>
Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it. This
option is incompatible with -P and -A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g generator <br>
If generating a Diffie Hellman key, use this generator.
Allowed values are 2 and 5. If no generator is specified, a
known prime from RFC 2539 will be used if possible; <br>
otherwise the default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
dnssec-keygen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K directory <br>
Sets the directory in which the key files are to be
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
Deprecated in favor of -T KEY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L ttl <br>
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is
converted into a DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a
zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there
was <br>
already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing
TTL would take precedence. Setting the default TTL to 0 or
none removes it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p protocol <br>
Sets the protocol value for the generated key. The protocol
is a number between 0 and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC).
Other possible values for this argument are listed in <br>
RFC 2535 and its successors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Quiet mode: Suppresses unnecessary output, including
progress indication. Without this option, when dnssec-keygen
is run interactively to generate an RSA or DSA key pair, it
<br>
will print a string of symbols to stderr indicating the
progress of the key generation. A &rsquo;.&rsquo; indicates
that a random number has been found which passed an initial
sieve <br>
test; &rsquo;+&rsquo; means a number has passed a single
round of the Miller-Rabin primality test; a space means that
the number has passed all the tests and is a satisfactory
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r randomdev <br>
Specifies the source of randomness. If the operating system
does not provide a /dev/random or equivalent device, the
default source of randomness is keyboard input. <br>
randomdev specifies the name of a character device or file
containing random data to be used instead of the default.
The special value keyboard indicates that keyboard input
<br>
should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S key <br>
Create a new key which is an explicit successor to an
existing key. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the key
will be set to match the existing key. The activation date
<br>
of the new key will be set to the inactivation date of the
existing one. The publication date will be set to the
activation date minus the prepublication interval, which
<br>
defaults to 30 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s strength <br>
Specifies the strength value of the key. The strength is a
number between 0 and 15, and currently has no defined
purpose in DNSSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T rrtype <br>
Specifies the resource record type to use for the key.
rrtype must be either DNSKEY or KEY. The default is DNSKEY
when using a DNSSEC algorithm, but it can be overridden to
<br>
KEY for use with SIG(0). Using any TSIG algorithm (HMAC-* or
DH) forces this option to KEY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Indicates the use of the key. type must be one of AUTHCONF,
NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH
refers to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF <br>
the ability to encrypt data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v level <br>
Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMING OPTIONS <br>
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;, it is interpreted as an
offset from the present time. For convenience, <br>
if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes
&rsquo;y&rsquo;, &rsquo;mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;w&rsquo;,
&rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;mi&rsquo;, then
the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour
days, ignoring leap years), <br>
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is
computed in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone.
After that date, the key will be included in the zone but
will not be used to sign it. If not set, and if the -G <br>
option has not been used, the default is
&quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After
that date, the key will be included in the zone and used to
sign it. If not set, and if the -G option has not been <br>
used, the default is &quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that
date, the key will be flagged as revoked. It will be
included in the zone and will be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that
date, the key will still be included in the zone, but it
will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that
date, the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It
may remain in the key repository, however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
publication and activation dates must be separated by at
least this much time. If the activation date is <br>
specified but the publication date isn&rsquo;t, then the
publication date will default to this much time before the
activation date; conversely, if the publication date is <br>
specified but activation date isn&rsquo;t, then activation
will be set to this much time after publication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the key is being created as
an explicit successor to another key, then the default
prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with date offsets, if the
argument is followed by one of the suffixes &rsquo;y&rsquo;,
&rsquo;mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;w&rsquo;, &rsquo;d&rsquo;,
&rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;mi&rsquo;, then the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, <br>
hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the
interval is measured in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATED KEYS <br>
When dnssec-keygen completes successfully, it prints a
string of the form Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii to the standard output.
This is an identification string for the key it has
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; nnnn is the key
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; aaa is the
numeric representation of the algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; iiiii is the key
identifier (or footprint).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-keygen creates two files,
with names based on the printed string. Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key
contains the public key, and Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private
contains the private key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .key file contains a DNS KEY
record that can be inserted into a zone file (directly or
with a $INCLUDE statement).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .private file contains
algorithm-specific fields. For obvious security reasons,
this file does not have general read permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both .key and .private files are
generated for symmetric encryption algorithms such as
HMAC-MD5, even though the public and private key are
equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
To generate a 768-bit DSA key for the domain example.com,
the following command would be issued:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-keygen -a DSA -b 768 -n
ZONE example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command would print a string
of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kexample.com.+003+26160</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, dnssec-keygen
creates the files Kexample.com.+003+26160.key and
Kexample.com.+003+26160.private.</p>
