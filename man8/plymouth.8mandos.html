<p>PLYMOUTH(8mandos) Mandos Manual PLYMOUTH(8mandos)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
plymouth - Mandos plugin to use plymouth to get a
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
plymouth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program prompts for a password using plymouth(8) and
outputs any given password to standard output. If no
plymouth(8) process can be found, this program will
immediately <br>
exit with an exit code indicating failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is not very useful
on its own. This program is really meant to run as a plugin
in the Mandos client-side system, where it is used as a
fallback and alternative to <br>
retrieving passwords from a Mandos server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this program is killed
(presumably by plugin-runner(8mandos) because some other
plugin provided the password), it cannot tell plymouth(8) to
abort requesting a password, <br>
because plymouth(8) does not support this. Therefore, this
program will then kill the running plymouth(8) process and
start a new one using the same command line arguments as the
<br>
old one was using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program takes no options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If exit status is 0, the output from the program is the
password as it was read. Otherwise, if exit status is other
than 0, the program was interrupted or encountered an error,
<br>
and any output so far could be corrupt and/or truncated, and
should therefore be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
cryptsource, crypttarget <br>
If set, these environment variables will be assumed to
contain the source device name and the target device mapper
name, respectively, and will be shown as part of the <br>
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These variables will normally be
inherited from plugin-runner(8mandos), which will normally
have inherited them from /scripts/local-top/cryptroot in the
initial RAM disk <br>
environment, which will have set them from parsing kernel
arguments and /conf/conf.d/cryptroot (also in the initial
RAM disk environment), which in turn will have been <br>
created when the initial RAM disk image was created by
/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptroot, by extracting
the information of the root file system from
/etc/crypttab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior is meant to
exactly mirror the behavior of askpass, the default password
prompter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/bin/plymouth <br>
This is the command run to retrieve a password from
plymouth(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc <br>
To find the running plymouth(8), this directory will be
searched for numeric entries which will be assumed to be
directories. In all those directories, the exe and cmdline
<br>
entries will be used to determine the name of the running
binary, effective user and group ID, and the command line
arguments. See proc(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/sbin/plymouthd <br>
This is the name of the binary which will be searched for in
the process list. See plymouth(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Killing the plymouth(8) daemon and starting a new one is
ugly, but necessary as long as it does not support aborting
a password request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please report bugs to the Mandos
development mailing list: &lt;mandos-dev@recompile.se&gt;
(subscription required). Note that this list is public. The
developers can be reached <br>
privately at &lt;mandos@recompile.se&gt; (OpenPGP key
fingerprint 153A 37F1 0BBA 0435 987F 2C4A 7223 2973 CA34
C2C4 for encrypted mail).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Note that normally, this program will not be invoked
directly, but instead started by the Mandos
plugin-runner(8mandos).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program takes no
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plymouth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
If this program is killed by a signal, it will kill the
process ID which at the start of this program was determined
to run plymouth(8) as root (see also the section called <br>
&acirc;FILES&acirc;). There is a very slight risk that, in
the time between those events, that process ID was freed and
then taken up by another process; the wrong process would
then be <br>
killed. Now, this program can only be killed by the user who
started it; see plugin-runner(8mandos). This program should
therefore be started by a completely separate <br>
non-privileged user, and no other programs should be allowed
to run as that special user. This means that it is not
recommended to use the user &quot;nobody&quot; to start this
program, as <br>
other possibly less trusted programs could be running as
&quot;nobody&quot;, and they would then be able to kill this
program, triggering the killing of the process ID which may
or may not <br>
be plymouth(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only other thing that could
be considered worthy of note is this: This program is meant
to be run by plugin-runner(8mandos), and will, when run
standalone, outside, in a <br>
normal environment, immediately output on its standard
output any presumably secret password it just received.
Therefore, when running this program standalone (which
should never <br>
normally be done), take care not to type in any real secret
password by force of habit, since it would then immediately
be shown as output.</p>
