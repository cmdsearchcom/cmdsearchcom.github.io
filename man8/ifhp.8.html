<p>IFHP(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual IFHP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ifhp - Almost Universal LPRng Print Filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ifhp <br>
[-F format] [-s statusfile] [-?value (other LPRng filter
options)] <br>
[-Z[options[,options]*]* <br>
[-T[options[,options]*]* <br>
[accountingfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifhp.conf(configuration
file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ifhp is a general purpose filter for allmost all
PostScript, PJL, PCL, and text based line printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ifhp filter resets and
synchronizes the printer, gets accounting information, and
then checks the file to determine its format. Based on the
format, it will do PCL, <br>
PostScript, or other initializations, and then transfer the
file to the printer. Termination sequences are sent,
followed by getting accounting information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS AND CONFIGURATION <br>
Options controlling ifhp operations are specified by
-Toption or -Zoption values. These options have the form:
<br>
Form Same As <br>
flag flag=1 <br>
flag@ flag=0 <br>
flag=str <br>
flag#str</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complete set of options and
their effect on operation are detailed in the IFHP-HOWTO
document. The following is a brief list of the more
important ones that will have a <br>
dramatic effect on printer operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">model =modelid <br>
Specifies the printer modelid information. This is used to
select an appropriate configuration from the ifhp
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status (status@) <br>
The status option enables checking for status information
from the printer. See STATUS, SYNC, WAITEND, AND PAGECOUNT
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync (sync@, sync=ps,
sync=pjl)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">waitend (waitend@, waitend=ps,
waitend=pjl) <br>
If the status option is enabled, sync will check to see that
the printer is online and ready and the waitent will check
that the job has finished. The sync@ and waitend@ <br>
will suppress these checks. See STATUS, SYNC, WAITEND, AND
PAGECOUNT for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pagecount (pagecount@,
pagecount=ps, pagecount=pjl) <br>
If the status option is enabled, pagecount will try to get
the value of the printer pagecounter. See STATUS, SYNC,
WAITEND, AND PAGECOUNT for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config=path,path,... <br>
pathnames of configuration files to read to obtain printer
configuration information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug=debuglevel <br>
Set the debugging level. A larger number causes more verbose
error messages. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace <br>
Sends out debugging and tracing information on STDERR as
well as to the status log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stty=options <br>
Sets serial line configuration when a dev entry
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS, SYNC, WAITEND, AND
PAGECOUNT <br>
If the status option is true, then the ifhp filter will
assume that the printer is attached by a bidirectional
channel and will attempt to read status information from the
<br>
printer. This also enables the sync, sync and pagecount
handshaking and getting pagecount information from the
printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sync flag causes a special
PJL job or PostScript job to be sent to the printer at the
start of printing at periodic intervals. This job has the
property that it will attempt <br>
to put the printer into a sane state and cause it to return
status information. By default, if the printer supports PJL
then the PJL job is used, otherwise if it supports <br>
PostScript, the PostScript job is used. You can force the
sync method using sync=pjl or sync=ps if necessary, and
suppress it using sync@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The waitend flag causes a
special PJL job or PostScript job to be sent to the printer
at the end of the job at periodic intervals. This job has
the property that it will attempt <br>
to put the printer into a sane state and cause it to return
status information. By default, if the printer supports PJL
then the PJL job is used, otherwise if it supports <br>
PostScript, the PostScript job is used. You can force the
waitend method using waitend=pjl or waitend=ps if necessary,
and suppress it using waitend@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pagecount flag causes a
special PJL job or PostScript job to be sent to the printer
at the start and end of the job. This job has the property
that it causes the printer to <br>
return the value of a hardware page counter. By taking the
difference of the start and end values of the pagecounter,
an accurate measure of the number of pages (or impressions
<br>
for some duplex printers) can be done. By default, if the
printer supports PJL then the PJL job is used, otherwise if
it supports PostScript, the PostScript job is used. You <br>
can force the pagecount method using pagecount=pjl or
pagecount=ps if necessary, and suppress it using
pagecount@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IFHP filter will puts
tracing and status information in the file specified by the
-s command line flag. If the status file does not exist, it
will not be created. The <br>
diagnostic trace flag overrides this and directs the status
to STDERR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pagecount information is put
into the accounting file specified on the command line. If
the accounting file does not exist, it will not be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOB PROCESSING (LPR -Z) OPTIONS
<br>
The lpr program passes the command line -Z options or the lp
program -o options to the LPRng lpd server which then passes
them to the ifhp filter. The options are used to <br>
control various printing features. For example if duplex
printing and landscape is wanted, then <br>
lpr -P&lt;printer&gt; -Z&rsquo;duplex,landscape&rsquo;
&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since each printer has a
different set of capabilities there are no standard set of
-Z options. The following is a sample of the options
provided by ifhp. Check the ifhp.conf <br>
file for all of the options supported by the printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Tray Selection <br>
inupper, inlower, intray1, intray2, intray3, manual,
envelope <br>
source=name <br>
The input tray selection options should start with the in
prefix and corresponds to the various trays. The manual and
envelope options are included to select manual feed <br>
or envelope feed. There is a possible source of conflict
here as there may be an envelope feeder as well as an
envelope media. This is a printer specific dependency. <br>
The source=name option allows users to use options such as
-Zsource=inbin1, which may be useful for systems that have
an unusual or nonstandard input selection mechanism. <br>
se select media (paper) from the specified tray or
feeder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Bin Selection <br>
outupper, outlower, outbin1 <br>
outbin=name <br>
The output bin selection should start with the out prefix.
<br>
The outbin=name form allow users to use options such as
-Zoutbin=stapler, which may be useful for systems that have
an unusual or nonstandard output selection mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media Size Selection <br>
a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a10 b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 <br>
archA archB archC archD archE flsa flse halfletter <br>
note letter legal 11x17 ledger tabloid <br>
paper=name <br>
The paper size selection facilities usually are quite
printer dependent, and the input tray selection and paper
size selection mechanisms may interact in strange and <br>
mysterious ways. <br>
The paper=name form allow users to use options such as
-Zpaper=b3, which may be useful for systems that have an
unusual or nonstandard input media selection mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media Type Selection <br>
plain, preprinted, letterhead, transparency, glossy,
prepunched, labels <br>
bond, recycled, color, heavy, cardstock <br>
Media Type is not the same as paper size, and corresponds to
the name assigned to a particular media. Of course, the
issue is complicated by the fact that some media have <br>
standard sizes as well. Again, the input tray selection,
media size, and media type selection will interact in
confusing and mysterious ways, depending on the whim of the
<br>
printer firmware iplementors. <br>
You will notice that there is no generic mediatype=name
facility. This is due to the radically different way that
PostScript, PJL, PCL, etc., each handle media name and <br>
selection. While it is possible to determine the various
strings, numbers, escape codes, etc., that need to be sent
for each mediatype, a general mechanism is too <br>
fragile and fraught with peril for the unwary administrator
to provide. You have been warned. Been there and have the
scars to prove it. <br>
These are commonly used media type names gleaned from
various PostScript Printer Description Files, Microsoft
printer drivers, and arcane lore of the Printer Working <br>
Group. Note that these are not accepted terms in the paper
industry for any of these type of media. You are warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplex/Simplex <br>
duplex (lduplex) duplexshort (sduplex) <br>
simplex <br>
tumble (shortedge) <br>
The duplex (alias lduplex) and duplexshort (alias sduplex)
will print on both sides of the paper; duplexshort will
reverse the orientation; simplex will print only on one <br>
side of the paper. <br>
The tumble (shortedge) will reverse the orientation of the
paper. Used when printing facing pages of duplex and there
is a desperate need for this orientation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copies <br>
copies=N <br>
Be aware that this option is totally bogus is usually
ignored (except when you expect it to be ignored). You have
been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OF MODE <br>
The OF mode of operation is selected by the -Fo command line
option. When operationg in OF mode it will scan the input
for a two character stop sequence 31 11. When it finds <br>
the sequence it will suspend itself. The spooler will
restart the filter with a SIGCONT signal when it has more
output for it.</p>

The IFHP filter was inspired by the LPRng CTI-ifhp filter,
which was a descendent of the print filters developed by the
CTI-Print project at the Division of Computing Facilities
<br>
of the Computer Technology Institute (CTI), Patras, Greece.
