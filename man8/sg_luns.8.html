<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_luns - send SCSI REPORT LUNS command or decode given
LUN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_luns [--decode] [--help] [--hex] [--linux] [--maxlen=LEN]
[--quiet] [--raw] [--select=SR] [--verbose] [--version]
DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_luns --test=ALUN [--hex]
[--verbose]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In the first form shown in the SYNOPSIS this utility sends
the SCSI REPORT LUNS command to the DEVICE and outputs the
response. The response should be a list of LUNs (&quot;a LUN
<br>
inventory&quot;) for the I_T nexus associated with the
DEVICE. Roughly speaking that is all LUNs that share the
target device that the REPORT LUNS command is sent through.
In the <br>
SPC-3 and SPC-4 SCSI standards support for the REPORT LUNS
command is mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --test=ALUN option is
given (the second form in the SYNOPSIS), then the ALUN value
is decoded as outlined in SAM-3, SAM-4 and SAM-5 (revision
13, section 4.7) .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where required below the first
form shown in the SYNOPSIS is called &quot;device mode&quot;
and the second form is called &quot;test mode&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --decode <br>
decode LUNs into their component parts, as described in the
LUN section of SAM-3, SAM-4 and SAM-5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
[device mode] when given once this utility will output the
SCSI response (i.e. the data-out buffer) to the REPORT LUNS
command in ASCII hex then exit. When given twice it <br>
causes --decode to output component fields in hex rather
than decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
[test mode] when this option is given, then decoded
component fields of ALUN are output in hex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --linux <br>
this option is only available in Linux. After the T10
representation of each 64 bit LUN (in 16 hexadecimal
digits), if this option is given then to the right, in
square <br>
brackets, is the Linux LUN integer in decimal. If the --hex
option is given twice (e.g. -HH) as well then the Linux LUN
integer is output in hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --maxlen=LEN <br>
where LEN is the (maximum) response length in bytes. It is
placed in the cdb&rsquo;s &quot;allocation length&quot;
field. If not given (or LEN is zero) then 8192 is used. The
maximum <br>
allowed value of LEN is 1048576.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
output only the ASCII hex rendering of each report LUN, one
per line. Without the --quiet option, there is header
information printed before the LUN listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
output the SCSI response (i.e. the data-out buffer) in
binary (to stdout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --select=SR <br>
this option sets the SELECT REPORT field (SR) in the SCSI
REPORT LUNS command. The default value is 0. For detailed
information see the REPORT LUNS command in SPC (most <br>
recent is SPC-4 revision 36e in section 6.33). To simplify,
for the I_T nexus associated with the DEVICE, the meanings
of the SR values defined to date for SPC-4 are: <br>
0 : all LUNs excluding well known logical units <br>
1 : well known logical units <br>
2 : all LUNs <br>
Values between 0xf8 and 0xff (inclusive) are vendor specific
(SPC-4 rev 36e), other values greater than 2 are reserved.
This utility will accept any value between 0 and <br>
255 (0xff) for SR .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --test=ALUN <br>
ALUN is assumed to be a hexadecimal number in ASCII hex or
the letter &rsquo;L&rsquo; followed by a decimal number (see
below). The hexadecimal number can be up to 64 bits in size
<br>
(i.e. 16 hexadecimal digits) and is padded to the right if
less than 16 hexadecimal digits are given (e.g.
--test=0122003a represents T10 LUN 0122003a00000000). ALUN
may <br>
be prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or &rsquo;0X&rsquo; (e.g.
the previous example could have been --test=0x0122003a).
ALUN may also be given with spaces or tabs between each byte
(or other grouping) <br>
but then ALUN would need to be surrounded by single or
double quotes. In the decimal number case (i.e. following a
&rsquo;L&rsquo;) that number is assumed to be a Linux
&quot;word <br>
flipped&quot; LUN which is converted into a T10 LUN
representation and printed. In both cases the number is
interpreted as a LUN and decoded as if the --decode option
had been <br>
given. Also when ALUN is a hexadecimal number it can have a
trailing &rsquo;L&rsquo; in which case the corresponding
Linux &quot;word flipped&quot; LUN value is output. The LUN
is decoded in <br>
all cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The SCSI REPORT LUNS command is important for Logical Unit
(LU) discovery. After a target device is discovered (usually
via some transport specific mechanism), a REPORT LUNS <br>
command should either be sent to LUN 0 (which is Peripheral
device addressing method with bus_id=0 and target/lun=0) or
to the REPORT LUNS well known LUN (i.e. <br>
0xc101000000000000). SAM-5 requires that one of these
responds with an inventory of LUNS that are contained in
this target device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In test mode, if the --hex
option is given once then in the decoded output, some of the
component fields are printed in hex with leading zeros. The
leading zeros are to indicate <br>
the size of the component field. For example: in the
Peripheral device addressing method (16 bits overall), the
bus ID is 6 bits wide and the target/LUN field is 8 bits
wide; so <br>
both are shown with two hex digits (e.g. bus_id=0x02,
target=0x3a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Typically by the time user space programs get to run, SCSI
LUs have been discovered. In Linux the lsscsi utility lists
the LUs that are currently present. The LUN of a device <br>
(LU) is the fourth element in the tuple at the beginning of
each line. Below we see a target (or &quot;I_T Nexus&quot;:
&quot;6:0:0&quot;) has two LUNS: 1 and 49409. If 49409 is
converted into T10 <br>
LUN format it is 0xc101000000000000 which is the REPORT LUNS
well known LUN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># lsscsi -g <br>
[6:0:0:1] disk Linux scsi_debug 0004 /dev/sdb /dev/sg1 <br>
[6:0:0:49409]wlun Linux scsi_debug 0004 - /dev/sg2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We could send a REPORT LUNS
command to either /dev/sdb, /dev/sg1 or /dev/sg2 and get the
same result. Below we use /dev/sg1 :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns /dev/sg1 <br>
Lun list length = 8 which imples 1 lun entry <br>
Report luns [select_report=0x0]: <br>
0001000000000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is a bit noisy so cut down
the clutter with --quiet:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -q /dev/sg1 <br>
0001000000000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now decode that LUN into its
component parts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -d -q /dev/sg1 <br>
0001000000000000 <br>
Peripheral device addressing: lun=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Would like to see how wide that
component LUN field is: <br>
# sg_luns -d -q -HH /dev/sg1 <br>
0001000000000000 <br>
Peripheral device addressing: lun=0x01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So it is 8 bits wide (actually
between 5 and 8 bits wide, inclusive). Now use --select=1 to
find out if there are any well known LUNs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -q -s 1 /dev/sg1 <br>
c101000000000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So how many LUNs do we have all
together (associated with the current I_T Nexus):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -q -s 2 /dev/sg1 <br>
0001000000000000 <br>
c101000000000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -q -s 2 -d /dev/sg1
<br>
0001000000000000 <br>
Peripheral device addressing: lun=1 <br>
c101000000000000 <br>
REPORT LUNS well known logical unit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example uses the
--linux option and is not available in other operating
systems. The extra number in square brackets is the Linux
version of T10 LUN shown at the <br>
start of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -q -s 2 -l /dev/sg1
<br>
0001000000000000 [1] <br>
c101000000000000 [49409]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now we use the --test= option to
decode LUNS input on the command line (rather than send a
REPORT LUNS command and act on the response):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns
--test=0001000000000000 <br>
Decoded LUN: <br>
Peripheral device addressing: lun=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns --test=&quot;c1
01&quot; <br>
Decoded LUN: <br>
REPORT LUNS well known logical unit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -t 0x023a004b -H <br>
Decoded LUN: <br>
Peripheral device addressing: bus_id=0x02, target=0x3a <br>
&gt;&gt;Second level addressing: <br>
Peripheral device addressing: lun=0x4b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next example is Linux
specific as we try to find out what the Linux LUN 49409
translates to in the T10 world:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns --test=L49409 <br>
64 bit LUN in T10 preferred (hex) format: c1 01 00 00 00 00
00 00 <br>
Decoded LUN: <br>
REPORT LUNS well known logical unit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the mapping between T10 and
Linux LUN representations can be done the other way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_luns -t c101L <br>
Linux &rsquo;word flipped&rsquo; integer LUN representation:
49409 <br>
Decoded LUN: <br>
REPORT LUNS well known logical unit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_luns is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
