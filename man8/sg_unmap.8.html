<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_unmap - send SCSI UNMAP command (known as
&rsquo;trim&rsquo; in ATA specs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_unmap [--anchor] [--grpnum=GN] [--help] [--in=FILE]
[--lba=LBA,LBA...] [--num=NUM,NUM...] [--timeout=TO]
[--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Send a SCSI UNMAP command to DEVICE to unmap one or more
logical blocks. This command was introduced in SBC-3
revision 18 under the broad heading of &quot;logical block
provisioning&quot;. <br>
Logical blocks may also be unmapped by the SCSI WRITE SAME
command; see the sg_write_same utility. The unmap capability
is closely related to the ATA DATA SET MANAGEMENT command
<br>
with the &quot;Trim&quot; bit set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical blocks to be unmapped
can be specified in one of two ways to this utility. One way
is by supplying the start LBAs to the &rsquo;--lba=&rsquo;
option and the corresponding number(s) <br>
to unmap to the &rsquo;--num=&rsquo; option. The other way
is by putting start LBA and number to unmap pairs in a file
whose name is given to the &rsquo;--in=&rsquo; option. All
values are assumed to be <br>
decimal unless prefixed by &quot;0x&quot; (or
&quot;0X&quot;) or have a trailing &quot;h&quot; (or
&quot;H&quot;) in which case they are interpreted as
hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &rsquo;--lba=&rsquo;
option is given then the &rsquo;--num=&rsquo; option must
also be given. If one has a comma separated list as its
argument then the other must have the same number of
ele&acirc; <br>
ments in its list. The arguments can use a single space as a
separator but need to be in quotes or escaped to not be
misinterpreted by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the &rsquo;--in=FILE&rsquo;
option an even number of values must be found and are
interpreted as pairs: the first value in each pair is a
starting LBA and the second value is the number <br>
to unmap from that LBA. Everything from and including a
&quot;#&quot; on a line is ignored as are blank lines.
Values may be comma, space and tab separated or appear on
separate lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --anchor <br>
sets the &rsquo;Anchor&rsquo; bit in the command (introduced
in sbc3r22).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --grpnum=GN <br>
sets the &rsquo;Group number&rsquo; field to GN. Defaults to
a value of zero. GN should be a value between 0 and 31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --in=FILE <br>
where FILE is a file name containing pairs of values. The
first member of each pair is a starting LBA and the second
member of the pair is the number of logical blocks to <br>
unmap from and including that starting LBA. Values are
interpreted as decimal unless indicated otherwise. This
option cannot be present with the &rsquo;--lba=&rsquo;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lba=LBA,LBA... <br>
where LBA,LBA... is a string of comma (or space) separated
values that are interpreted as starting logical block
addresses. Each number is interpreted as decimal unless <br>
prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or &rsquo;0X&rsquo; (or it has
a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo; or &rsquo;H&rsquo;). An argument
that contains any space separators needs to be quoted (or
otherwise escaped). When this option is <br>
given then the &rsquo;--num=&rsquo; option must also be
given and they must contain the same number of elements in
their arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --num=NUM,NUM... <br>
where NUM,NUM... is a string of comma (or space) separated
values that are interpreted as a number of logical blocks to
unmap. Each number is interpreted as decimal unless <br>
prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or &rsquo;0X&rsquo; (or it has
a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo; or &rsquo;H&rsquo;). Note that 0
blocks is acceptable. An argument that contains any space
separators needs to be quoted (or other&acirc; <br>
wise escaped). When this option is given then the
&rsquo;--lba=&rsquo; option must also be given and they must
contain the same number of elements in their arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout=TO <br>
where TO is a timeout value (in seconds) for the UNMAP
command. The default value is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Some limits: an LBA can be up to 64 bits, a NUM up to 32
bits (imposed by structure of UNMAP SCSI command parameter
data). The NUM is further constrained by the MAXIMUM UNMAP
LBA <br>
COUNT field in the BLOCK LIMITS VPD page (0xb0). The maximum
number of LBA,NUM pairs is limited to 128 by this utility
and may be further constrained by the MAXIMUM UNMAP BLOCK
<br>
DESCRIPTOR COUNT field in the BLOCK LIMITS VPD page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since it is unclear how long the
UNMAP command will take to execute a &rsquo;--timeout=&quot;
option has been provided. The default timeout period is 60
seconds. If all the logical blocks <br>
on a logical unit (e.g. a disk drive) are to be unmapped
then the FORMAT UNIT SCSI command (see the sg_format
utility) may be considered as an alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for logical block
provisioning is indicated by the LBPME bit in the response
to the SCSI READ CAPACITY (16) command (see the sg_readcap
utility).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In SBC-3 revision 25 the LBPU
and ANC_SUP bits where added to the Logical Block
Provisioning VPD page. When LBPU is set it indicates that
the device supports the UNMAP command. <br>
When the ANC_SUP bit is set it indicates the device supports
anchored LBAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
In the examples directory of the sg3_utils package there is
a sg_unmap_example.txt file that shows the format that the
&rsquo;--in=&rsquo; option accepts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_unmap is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
