<p>UPDATE-ALTERNATIVES(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
UPDATE-ALTERNATIVES(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
alternatives - maintain symbolic links determining default
commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
alternatives [options] --install link name path priority
[--slave link name path]... [--initscript service] [--family
name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternatives [options] --remove

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
alternatives creates, removes, maintains and displays
information about the symbolic links comprising the
alternatives system. The alternatives system is a
reimplementation of <br>
the Debian alternatives system. It was rewritten primarily
to remove the dependence on perl; it is intended to be a
drop in replacement for Debian&rsquo;s update-dependencies
script. <br>
This man page is a slightly modified version of the man page
from the Debian project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible for several
programs fulfilling the same or similar functions to be
installed on a single system at the same time. For example,
many systems have several text <br>
editors installed at once. This gives choice to the users of
a system, allowing each to use a different editor, if
desired, but makes it difficult for a program to make a good
<br>
choice of editor to invoke if the user has not specified a
particular preference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternatives system aims to
solve this problem. A generic name in the filesystem is
shared by all files providing interchangeable functionality.
The alternatives system and <br>
the system administrator together determine which actual
file is referenced by this generic name. For example, if the
text editors ed(1) and nvi(1) are both installed on the <br>
system, the alternatives system will cause the generic name
/usr/bin/editor to refer to /usr/bin/nvi by default. The
system administrator can override this and cause it to refer
<br>
to /usr/bin/ed instead, and the alternatives system will not
alter this setting until explicitly requested to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generic name is not a direct
symbolic link to the selected alternative. Instead, it is a
symbolic link to a name in the alternatives directory, which
in turn is a symbolic <br>
link to the actual file referenced. This is done so that the
system administrator&rsquo;s changes can be confined within
the /etc directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives reasons why this is
a <br>
Good Thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When each package providing a
file with a particular functionality is installed, changed
or removed, alternatives is called to update information
about that file in the alterna&acirc; <br>
tives system. alternatives is usually called from the %post
or %pre scripts in RPM packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is often useful for a number
of alternatives to be synchronised, so that they are changed
as a group; for example, when several versions of the vi(1)
editor are installed, the <br>
man page referenced by /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1 should
correspond to the executable referenced by /usr/bin/vi.
alternatives handles this by means of master and slave
links; when <br>
the master is changed, any associated slaves are changed
too. A master link and its associated slaves make up a link
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each link group is, at any given
time, in one of two modes: automatic or manual. When a group
is in automatic mode, the alternatives system will
automatically decide, as pack&acirc; <br>
ages are installed and removed, whether and how to update
the links. In manual mode, the alternatives system will not
change the links; it will leave all the decisions to the
<br>
system administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link groups are in automatic
mode when they are first introduced to the system. If the
system administrator makes changes to the system&rsquo;s
automatic settings, this will be <br>
noticed the next time alternatives is run on the changed
link&rsquo;s group, and the group will automatically be
switched to manual mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each alternative has a priority
associated with it. When a link group is in automatic mode,
the alternatives pointed to by members of the group will be
those which have the <br>
highest priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the --config option,
alternatives will list all of the choices for the link group
of which given name is the master link. You will then be
prompted for which of the <br>
choices to use for the link group. Once you make a change,
the link group will no longer be in auto mode. You will need
to use the --auto option in order to return to the
auto&acirc; <br>
matic state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINOLOGY <br>
Since the activities of alternatives are quite involved,
some specific terms will help to explain its operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generic name <br>
A name, like /usr/bin/editor, which refers, via the
alternatives system, to one of a number of files of similar
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlink <br>
Without any further qualification, this means a symbolic
link in the alternatives directory: one which the system
administrator is expected to adjust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternative <br>
The name of a specific file in the filesystem, which may be
made accessible via a generic name using the alternatives
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternatives directory <br>
A directory, by default /etc/alternatives, containing the
symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">administrative directory <br>
A directory, by default /var/lib/alternatives, containing
alternatives&rsquo; state information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link group <br>
A set of related symlinks, intended to be updated as a
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">master link <br>
The link in a link group which determines how the other
links in the group are configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slave link <br>
A link in a link group which is controlled by the setting of
the master link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">automatic mode <br>
When a link group is in automatic mode, the alternatives
system ensures that the links in the group point to the
highest priority alternatives appropriate for the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manual mode <br>
When a link group is in manual mode, the alternatives system
will not make any changes to the system
administrator&rsquo;s settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Exactly one action must be specified if alternatives is to
perform any meaningful task. Any number of the common
options may be specified together with any action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
--verbose <br>
Generate more comments about what alternatives is doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate any comments unless errors occur. This
option is not yet implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test Don&rsquo;t actually do
anything, just say what would be done. This option is not
yet implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Give some usage
information (and say which version of alternatives this
is).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Tell which version of alternatives this is (and give some
usage information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--altdir directory <br>
Specifies the alternatives directory, when this is to be
different from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--admindir directory <br>
Specifies the administrative directory, when this is to be
different from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
--install link name path priority [--slave slink sname
spath] [--initscript service]... <br>
Add a group of alternatives to the system. name is the
generic name for the master link, link is the name of its
symlink, path is the alternative being introduced for the
<br>
master link, and priority is the priority of the
alternatives group. Higher priorities take precendence if no
alternative is manually selected. sname, slink and spath are
<br>
the generic name, symlink name and alternative for a slave
link, and service is the name of any associated initscript
for the alternative. NOTE: --initscript and --family <br>
are a Red Hat Linux specific options. Zero or more --slave
options, each followed by three arguments, may be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the master symlink specified
exists already in the alternatives system&rsquo;s records,
the information supplied will be added as a new set of
alternatives for the group. <br>
Otherwise, a new group, set to automatic mode, will be added
with this information. If the group is in automatic mode,
and the newly added alternatives&rsquo; priority is <br>
higher than any other installed alternatives for this group,
the symlinks will be updated to point to the newly added
alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --initscript is used, the
alternatives system will manage the initscript associated
with the alternative via chkconfig, registering and
unregistering the init script <br>
depending on which alternative is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: --initscript is a Red Hat
Linux specific option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--family can be used to group
similar alternatives. If the group is in manual mode and the
alternative currently used is removed, alternatives will try
to change links to <br>
different one with same family and highest priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: --family is a Red Hat
Linux specific option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove name path <br>
Remove an alternative and all of its associated slave links.
name is a name in the alternatives directory, and path is an
absolute filename to which name could be linked. <br>
If name is indeed linked to path, name will be updated to
point to another appropriate alternative, or removed if
there is no such alternative left. Associated slave <br>
links will be updated or removed, correspondingly. If the
link is not currently pointing to path, no links are
changed; only the information about the alternative is <br>
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set name path <br>
The symbolic link and slaves for link group name set to
those configured for path, and the link group is set to
manual mode. This option is not in the original Debian <br>
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config name <br>
Present the user with a configuration menu for choosing the
master link and slaves for link group name. Once chosen, the
link group is set to manual mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto name <br>
Switch the master symlink name to automatic mode. In the
process, this symlink and its slaves are updated to point to
the highest priority installed alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display name <br>
Display information about the link group of which name is
the master link. Information displayed includes the
group&rsquo;s mode (auto or manual), which alternative the
symlink <br>
currently points to, what other alternatives are available
(and their corresponding slave alternatives), and the
highest priority alternative currently installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list Display information about
all link groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/alternatives/ <br>
The default alternatives directory. Can be overridden by the
--altdir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/alternatives/ <br>
The default administration directory. Can be overridden by
the --admindir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The requested action was successfully performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Problems were encountered
whilst parsing the command line or performing the
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
alternatives chatters incessantly about its activities on
its standard output channel. If problems occur, alternatives
outputs error messages on its standard error channel and
<br>
returns an exit status of 2. These diagnostics should be
self-explanatory; if you do not find them so, please report
this as a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you find a bug, please report it using the Red Hat bug
tracking system at http://bugzilla.redhat.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find any discrepancy
between the operation of alternatives and this manual page,
it is a bug, either in the implementation or the
documentation; please report it. Any <br>
significant differences between this implementation and
Debian&rsquo;s is also a bug and should be reported, unless
otherwise noted in this man page.</p>
