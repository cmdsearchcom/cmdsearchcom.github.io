<p>FAKE-HWCLOCK(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FAKE-HWCLOCK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fake-hwclock - Control fake hardware clock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fake-hwclock [ command ] [ force ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND <br>
Many embedded Linux systems do not have a functional
hardware clock. Either they simply don&rsquo;t have a
hardware clock at all or they have a hardware clock but it
is not usable <br>
(e.g. because Linux doesn&rsquo;t know how to use it or
because no battery is present).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can lead to time moving
backwards to some default value (often 1970) when the system
is rebooted. Since lots of software assumes that time only
moves forward this is a bad <br>
thing. NTP can (and should where practical) be used to sync
with an external timeserver but it is not available early in
the boot process and may be unavailable for other rea&acirc;
<br>
sons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The design expectation of
fake-hwclock is that it will be run very late at shutdown
and very early at boot. This will ensure that fsck has a
vaguely sensible idea of system time <br>
at boot and won&rsquo;t complain that the last-modified time
in the filesystem is not hugely in the past or future. Some
users may not worry about this too use case, in which case
it <br>
is possible to modify the init system configuration to move
things earlier/later as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fake-hwclock sets and queries a fake &quot;hardware
clock&quot; which stores the time in a file. This program
may be run by the system administrator directly but is
typically run by init <br>
(to load the time on startup and save it on shutdown) and
cron (to save the time hourly).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no command is given then
fake-hwclock acts as if the save command was used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
save Save the time to the file. As a sanity check,
fake-hwclock will not move the saved clock backwards to a
time/date earlier than its own release date. Use
&quot;force&quot; to over- <br>
ride this check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load Load the time from the
file. If force is specified fake-hwclock will move the clock
either backwards or forwards. Otherwise it will only move it
forwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/fake-hwclock.data <br>
The file used to store the time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/init.d/fake-hwclock <br>
The init script used to run fake-hwclock on startup and
shutdown</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib/systemd/system/fake-hwclock.service
<br>
systemd service used to run fake-hwclock on startup and
shutdown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/default/fake-hwclock <br>
Settings file for the init script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/cron.hourly/fake-hwclock
<br>
Cron job used to save the time hourly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
FILE set the file used by fake-hwclock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
1 is returned for invalid commands. 0 is returned in all
other cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This approach can only provide a crude approximation of what
a real hardware clock provides. Use of NTP or another method
to keep the time in sync is strongly advised.</p>
