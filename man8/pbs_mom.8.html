<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbs_mom - start a pbs batch execution mini-server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pbs_mom [-a alarm] [-C chkdirectory] [-c config] [-d
directory] [-h help] [-H hostname] [-L logfile] [-M MOMport]
[-R RPPport] [-p|-q|-r] [-x]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pbs_mom command starts the operation of a batch Machine
Oriented Mini-server, MOM, on the local host. Typically,
this command will be in a local boot file such as <br>
/etc/rc.local . To insure that the pbs_mom command is not
runnable by the general user community, the server will only
execute if its real and effective uid is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One function of pbs_mom is to
place jobs into execution as directed by the server,
establish resource usage limits, monitor the job&rsquo;s
usage, and notify the server when the job <br>
completes. If they exist, pbs_mom will execute a prologue
script before executing a job and an epilogue script after
executing the job. The next function of pbs_mom is to <br>
respond to resource monitor requests. This was done by a
separate process in previous versions of PBS but has now
been combined into one process. The resource monitor
function <br>
is provided mainly for the PBS scheduler. It provides
information about the status of running jobs, memory
available etc. The next function of pbs_mom is to respond to
task <br>
manager requests. This involves communicating with running
tasks over a tcp socket as well as communicating with other
MOMs within a job (aka a &quot;sisterhood&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pbs_mom will record a diagnostic
message in a log file for any error occurrence. The log
files are maintained in the mom_logs directory below the
home directory of the server. <br>
If the log file cannot be opened, the diagnostic message is
written to the system console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A alias Used with -m (multi-mom option) to give the alias
name of this instance of pbs_mom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a alarm Specifies the alarm
timeout in seconds for computing a resource. Every time a
resource request is processed, an alarm is set for the given
amount of time. If <br>
the request has not completed before the given time, an
alarm signal is generated. The default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C chkdirectory Specifies the
path of the directory used to hold checkpoint files.
[Currently this is only valid on Cray systems.] The default
directory is <br>
PBS_HOME/spool/checkpoint, see the -d option. The directory
specified with the -C option must be owned by root and
accessible (rwx) only by root to protect the <br>
security of the checkpoint files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config Specifies an
alternative configuration file, see description below. If
this is a relative file name it will be relative to
PBS_HOME/mom_priv, see the -d option. <br>
If the specified file cannot be opened, pbs_mom will abort.
If the -c option is not supplied, pbs_mom will attempt to
open the default <br>
configuration file &quot;config&quot; in PBS_HOME/mom_priv.
If this file is not present, pbs_mom will log the fact and
continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h help Displays the help/usage
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H hostname Sets the MOM&rsquo;s
hostname. This can be useful on multi-homed networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory Specifies the path
of the directory which is the home of the servers working
files, PBS_HOME. This option is typically used along with -M
when debugging MOM. <br>
The default directory is given by $PBS_SERVER_HOME which is
typically /usr/spool/PBS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L logfile Specifies an absolute
path name for use as the log file. If not specified, MOM
will open a file named for the current date in the
PBS_HOME/mom_logs directory, <br>
see the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Directs the MOM to start in
multi-mom mode. In addition to using -m the -M, -R and -A
options need to be used to properly start a MOM in multi-mom
mode. For <br>
example pbs_mom -m -M 30002 -R 30003 -A alias-host will
start pbs_mom with the service port on port 30002, the
manager port at 30003 and with the name alias-host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M port Specifies the port
number on which the mini-server (MOM) will listen for batch
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R port Specifies the port
number on which the mini-server (MOM) will listen for
resource monitor requests, task manager requests and
inter-MOM messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p (Default after version 2.4.0)
(Preserve running jobs) -- Specifies the impact on jobs
which were in execution when the mini-server shut-down. The
-p option <br>
tries to preserve any running jobs when the MOM restarts.
The new mini-server will not be the parent of any running
jobs, MOM has lost control of her offspring <br>
(not a new situation for a mother). The MOM will allow the
jobs to continue to run and monitor them indirectly via
polling. All recovered jobs will report an <br>
exit code of 0 when they are complete. The -p option is
mutually exclusive with the -r, -P and -q options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P (Terminate all jobs and
remove them from the queue) -- Specifies the impact on jobs
which were in execution when the mini-server shut-down. With
the -P option, <br>
it is assumed that either the entire system has been
restarted or the MOM has been down so long that it can no
longer guarantee that the pid of any running <br>
process is the same as the recorded job process pid of a
recovering job. Unlike the -p option no attempt is made to
try and preserve or recover running jobs. All <br>
jobs are terminated and removed from the queue. The -q
option is mutually exclusive with the -p, -q and -r
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q (Requeue all jobs - This is
the default behavior in versions prior to 2.4.0) --
Specifies the impact on jobs which were in execution when
the mini-servershut- <br>
down. Do not terminate running processes. With the -q
option, it is assumed that either the entire system has been
restarted or the MOM has been down so long <br>
that it can no longer guarantee that the pid of any running
process is the same as the recorded job process pid of a
recovering job. No attempt is made to kill <br>
job processes. The MOM will mark the jobs as terminated and
notify the batch server which owns the job. Re-runnable jobs
will be requeued. The -q option is <br>
mutually exclusive with the -p, -P and -r options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r (Terminate running processes
and requeue all jobs) -- Specifies the impact on jobs which
were in execution when the mini-server shut-down. With the
-r option, MOM <br>
will kill any processes belonging to running jobs, mark the
jobs as terminated and notify the batch server that owns the
job. Re-runnable jobs are reset to a <br>
queued state so they can be run again. The -r option is
mutually exclusive with the -p, -P and -q options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -r option is used
following a reboot, process IDs (pids) may be reused and MOM
may kill a process that is not a batch session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S port Specifies the port
number on which the pbs_server is listening for requests. If
pbs_server is started with a -p option, pbs_mom will need to
use the -S option <br>
and match the port value which was used to start
pbs_server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Disables the check for
privileged port resource monitor connections. This is used
mainly for testing since the privileged port is the only
mechanism used to pre&acirc; <br>
vent any ordinary user from connecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file may be specified on the command line
at program start with the -c flag. The use of this file is
to provide several types of run time information to <br>
pbs_mom: static resource names and values, external
resources provided by a program to be run on request via a
shell escape, and values to pass to internal set up
functions at <br>
initialization (and re-initialization).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each item type is on a single
line with the component parts separated by white space. If
the line starts with a hash mark (pound sign, #), the line
is considered to be a comment <br>
and is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Static Resources <br>
For static resource names and values, the configuration file
contains a list of resource names/values pairs, one pair per
line and separated by white space. An Example <br>
of static resource names and values could be the number of
tape drives of different types and could be specified by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tape3480 4 <br>
tape3420 2 <br>
tapedat 1 <br>
tape8mm 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell Commands <br>
If the first character of the value is an exclamation mark
(!), the entire rest of the line is saved to be executed
through the services of the system(3) standard library <br>
routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell escape provides a
means for the resource monitor to yield arbitrary
information to the scheduler. Parameter substitution is done
such that the value of any <br>
qualifier sent with the query, as explained below, replaces
a token with a percent sign (%) followed by the name of the
qualifier. For example, here is a configuration <br>
file line which gives a resource name of
&quot;escape&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape !echo %xxx %yyy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a query for
&quot;escape&quot; is sent with no qualifiers, the command
executed would be &quot;echo %xxx %yyy&quot;. If one
qualifier is sent, &quot;escape[xxx=hi there]&quot;, the
command executed <br>
would be &quot;echo hi there %yyy&quot;. If two qualifiers
are sent, &quot;escape[xxx=hi][yyy=there]&quot;, the command
executed would be &quot;echo hi there&quot;. If a qualifier
is sent with no <br>
matching token in the command line,
&quot;escape[zzz=snafu]&quot;, an error is reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size[fs=&lt;FS&gt;] <br>
Specifies that the available and configured disk space in
the &lt;FS&gt; filesystem is to be reported to the
pbs_server and scheduler. NOTE: To request disk space on a
per job <br>
basis, specify the file resource as in &rsquo;qsub -l
nodes=1,file=1000kb&rsquo; For example, the available and
configured disk space in the /localscratch filesystem will
be <br>
reported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size[fs=/localscratch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialization Value <br>
An initialization value directive has a name which starts
with a dollar sign ($) and must be known to MOM via an
internal table. The entries in this table now are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_ideal_load <br>
if jobs are running, sets idea_load based on a simple
expression. The expressions start with the variable
&rsquo;t&rsquo; (total assigned CPUs) or &rsquo;c&rsquo;
(existing CPUs), an <br>
operator (+ - / *), and followed by a float constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$auto_ideal_load t-0.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_max_load <br>
if jobs are running, sets max_load based on a simple
expression. The expressions start with the variable
&rsquo;t&rsquo; (total assigned CPUs) or &rsquo;c&rsquo;
(existing CPUs), an oper&acirc; <br>
ator (+ - / *), and followed by a float constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cputmult <br>
which sets a factor used to adjust cpu time used by a job.
This is provided to allow adjustment of time charged and
limits enforced where the job might run on sys&acirc; <br>
tems with different cpu performance. If Mom&rsquo;s system
is faster than the reference system, set cputmult to a
decimal value greater than 1.0. If Mom&rsquo;s system is
<br>
slower, set cputmult to a value between 1.0 and 0.0. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$cputmult 1.5 <br>
$cputmult 0.75</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configversion <br>
specifies the version of the config file data, a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check_poll_time <br>
specifies the MOM interval in seconds. MOM checks each job
for updated resource usages, exited processes, over-limit
conditions, etc. once per interval. This <br>
value should be equal or lower to pbs_server&rsquo;s
job_stat_rate. High values result in stale information
reported to pbs_server. Low values result in increased
sys&acirc; <br>
tem usage by MOM. Default is 45 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down_on_error <br>
causes MOM to report itself as state &quot;down&quot; to
pbs_server in the event of a failed health check. This
feature is EXPERIMENTAL and likely to be removed in the <br>
future. See HEALTH CHECK below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enablemomrestart <br>
enable automatic restarts of MOM. If enabled, MOM will check
if its binary has been updated and restart itself at a safe
point when no jobs are running; thus mak&acirc; <br>
ing upgrades easier. The check is made by comparing the
mtime of the pbs_mom executable. Command-line args, the
process name, and the PATH env variable are pre&acirc; <br>
served across restarts. It is recommended that this not be
enabled in the config file, but enabled when desired with
momctl (see RESOURCES for more information.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ideal_load <br>
ideal processor load. Represents a low water mark for the
load average. Nodes that are currently busy will consider
itself free after falling below ideal_load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">igncput <br>
Ignore cpu time violations on this mom, meaning jobs will
not be cancelled due to exceeding their limits for cpu
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignmem Ignore memory violations
on this mom, meaning jobs will not be cancelled due to
exceeding their memory limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignvmem <br>
If set to true, then pbs_mom will ignore vmem/pvmem limit
enforcement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignwalltime <br>
If set to true, then pbs_mom will ignore walltime limit
enforcement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">job_output_file_mask <br>
Specifies a mask for creating job output and error files.
Values can be specified in base 8, 10, or 16; leading 0
implies octal and leading 0x or 0X hexadecimal. A <br>
value of &quot;userdefault&quot; will use the user&rsquo;s
default umask. $job_output_file_mask 027</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_directory <br>
Changes the log directory. Default is $TORQUEHOME/mom_logs/.
$TORQUEHOME default is /var/spool/torque/ but can be changed
in the ./configure script. The value is a <br>
string and should be the full path to the desired mom log
directory. $log_directory /opt/torque/mom_logs/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logevent <br>
which sets the mask that determines which event types are
logged by pbs_mom. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$logevent 0x1fff <br>
$logevent 255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first example would set the
log event mask to 0x1ff (511) which enables logging of all
events including debug events. The second example would set
the mask to <br>
0x0ff (255) which enables all events except debug
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_file_suffix <br>
Optional suffix to append to log file names. If %h is the
suffix, pbs_mom appends the hostname for where the log files
are stored if it knows it, otherwise it will <br>
append the hostname where the mom is running.
$log_file_suffix tom = 20100223.tom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_keep_days <br>
Specifies how many days to keep log files. pbs_mom deletes
log files older than the specified number of days. If not
specified, pbs_mom won&rsquo;t delete log files based <br>
on their age.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loglevel <br>
specifies the verbosity of logging with higher numbers
specifying more verbose logging. Values may range between 0
and 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_file_max_size <br>
If this is set to a value &gt; 0 then pbs_mom will roll the
current log file to log-file-name.1 when its size is greater
than or equal to the value of <br>
log_file_max_size. This value is interpreted as
kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_file_roll_depth <br>
If this is set to a value &gt;=1 and log_file_max_size is
set then pbs_mom will continue rolling the log files to
log-file-name.log_file_roll_depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_load <br>
maximum processor load. Nodes over this load average are
considered busy (see ideal_load above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory_pressure_threshold <br>
The option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use
cpusets. If set to a value &gt; 0, a job gets killed if its
memory pressure exceeds this value, and if <br>
$memory_pressure_duration is set. The default is 0 (memory
pressure recording is off). <br>
See cpuset(7) for more information about memory
pressure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory_pressure_duration <br>
The option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use
cpusets. Specifies the number of subsequent MOM intervals a
job&rsquo;s memory pressure must be above $mem&acirc; <br>
ory_pressure_threshold to get killed. The default is 0 (jobs
are never killed due to memory pressure). set <br>
See cpuset(7) for more information about memory
pressure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">node_check_script <br>
specifies the fully qualified pathname of the health check
script to run (see HEALTH CHECK for more information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">node_check_interval <br>
specifies when to run the MOM health check. The check can be
either periodic, event-driver, or both. The value starts
with an integer specifying the number of MOM <br>
intervals between subsequent executions of the specified
health check. After the integer is an optional
comma-separated list of event names. Currently supported
<br>
are &quot;jobstart&quot; and &quot;jobend&quot;. This value
defaults to 1 with no events indicating the check is run
every MOM interval. (see HEALTH CHECK for more
information)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$node_check_interval 0
#Disabled. <br>
$node_check_interval 0,jobstart #Only runs at job starts
<br>
$node_check_interval 10,jobstart,jobend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodefile_suffix <br>
Specifies the suffix to append to a host names to denote the
data channel network adapter in a multihomed compute node.
$nodefile_suffix i With the suffix of &rsquo;i&rsquo; <br>
and the control channel adapter with the name node01, the
data channel would have a hostname of node01i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nospool_dir_list <br>
If the job&rsquo;s output file should be in one of the paths
specified here, then it will be spooled directly in that
directory instead of the normal spool directory. <br>
Specified in the format path1, path2, etc.
$nospool_dir_list/home/mike/*,/var/tmp/spool/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsclient <br>
which causes a host name to be added to the list of hosts
which will be allowed to connect to MOM as long as they are
using a privilaged port for the purposes of <br>
resource monitor requests. For example, here are two
configuration file lines which will allow the hosts
&quot;fred&quot; and &quot;wilma&quot; to connect:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$pbsclient fred <br>
$pbsclient wilma</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two host name are always allowed
to connection to pbs_mom, &quot;localhost&quot; and the name
returned to pbs_mom by the system call gethostname(). These
names need not be <br>
specified in the configuration file. The hosts listed as
&quot;clients&quot; can issue Resource Monitor (RM)
requests. Other MOM nodes and servers do not need to be
listed <br>
as clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsserver <br>
which defines hostnames running pbs_server that will be
allowed to submit jobs, issue Resource Monitor (RM)
requests, and get status updates. MOM will continually <br>
attempt to contact all server hosts for node status and
state updates. Like $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name, the
hostname may be followed by a colon and a port num&acirc;
<br>
ber. This parameter replaces the oft-confused $clienthost
parameter from TORQUE 2.0.0p0 and earlier. Note that the
hostname in $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name is <br>
used if no $pbsserver parameters are found</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prologalarm <br>
Specifies maximum duration (in seconds) which the MOM will
wait for the job prolog or job job epilog to complete. This
parameter default to 300 seconds (5 minutes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcpcmd Specify the the full path
and argument to be used for remote file copies. This
overrides the compile-time default found in configure. This
must contain 2 words: <br>
the full path to the command and the switches. The copy
command must be able to recursively copy files to the remote
host and accept arguments of the form <br>
&quot;user@host:files&quot; For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$rcpcmd /usr/bin/rcp -rp <br>
$rcpcmd /usr/bin/scp -rpB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restricted <br>
which causes a host name to be added to the list of hosts
which will be allowed to connect to MOM without needing to
use a privilaged port. These names allow for <br>
wildcard matching. For example, here is a configuration file
line which will allow queries from any host from the domain
&quot;ibm.com&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$restricted *.ibm.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restriction which applies to
these connections is that only internal queries may be made.
No resources from a config file will be found. This is to
prevent <br>
any shell commands from being run by a non-root process.
<br>
This parameter is generally not required except for some
versions of OSX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote_checkpoint_dirs <br>
Specifies what server checkpoint directories are remotely
mounted. This directive is used to tell the MOM which
directories are shared with the server. Using <br>
remote checkpoint directories eliminates the need to copy
the checkpoint files back and forth between the MOM and the
server. This parameter is available in 2.4.1 <br>
and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$remote_checkpoint_dirs
/var/spool/torque/checkpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote_reconfig <br>
Enables the ability to remotely reconfigure pbs_mom with a
new config file. Default is disabled. This parameter accepts
various forms of true, yes, and 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_login_batch <br>
Specifies whether or not mom will source the /etc/profile,
etc. type files for batch jobs. Parameter accepts various
forms of true, false, yes, no, 1 and 0. Default <br>
is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_login_interactive <br>
Specifies whether or not mom will source the /etc/profile,
etc. type files for interactive jobs. Parameter accepts
various forms of true, false, yes, no, 1 and 0. <br>
Default is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spool_as_final_name <br>
If set to true, jobs will spool directly as their output
files, with no intermediate locations or steps. This is
mostly useful for shared filesystems with fast <br>
writing capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status_update_time <br>
Specifies (in seconds) how often MOM updates its status
information to pbs_server. This value should correlate with
the server&rsquo;s scheduling interval. High values <br>
increase the load of pbs_server and the network. Low values
cause pbs_server to report stale information. Default is 45
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmpdir Sets the directory
basename for a per-job temporary directory. Before job
launch, MOM will append the jobid to the tmpdir basename and
create the directory. After <br>
the job exit, MOM will recursively delete it. The env
variable TMPDIR will be set for all pro/epilog scripts, the
job script, and TM tasks. <br>
Directory creation and removal is done as the job owner and
group, so the owner must have write permission to create the
directory. If the directory already exists <br>
and is owned by the job owner, it will not be deleted after
the job. If the directory already exists and is NOT owned by
the job owner, the job start will be <br>
rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout <br>
Specifies the number of seconds before TCP messages will
time out. TCP messages include job obituaries, and TM
requests if RPP is disabled. Default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usecp specifies which
directories should be staged with cp instead of rcp/scp. If
a shared filesystem is available on all hosts in a cluster,
this directive is used to <br>
make these filesystems known to MOM. For example, if /home
is NFS mounted on all nodes in a cluster:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$usecp *:/home /home</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">varattr <br>
This is similar to a shell escape above, but includes a TTL.
The command will only be run every TTL seconds. A TTL of -1
will cause the command to be executed <br>
only once. A TTL of 0 will cause the command to be run
everytime varattr is requested. This parameter may be used
multiple times, but all output will be grouped <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_smt <br>
This option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use
cpusets. It has only effect, if there are more that one
logical processor per physical core in the sys&acirc; <br>
tem (simultaneous multithreading or hyperthreading is
enabled via BIOS settings). If set to true, all logical
processors of allocated cores are added to the cpuset <br>
of a job. If set to false, only the first logical processor
per allocated core is contained in the cpuset of a job. The
default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wallmult <br>
which sets a factor used to adjust wall time usage by to job
to a common reference system. The factor is used for
walltime calculations and limits the same as <br>
cputmult is used for cpu time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file must be
executable and &quot;secure&quot;. It must be owned by a
user id and group id less than 10 and not be world writable.
Output from this file must be in the <br>
format $VAR=$VAL, i.e.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dataset13=20070104 <br>
dataset22=20070202 <br>
viraltest=abdd3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xauthpath <br>
Specifies the path to the xauth binary to enable X11
fowarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mom_host <br>
Sets the local hostname as used by pbs_mom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAYOUT FILE <br>
There is also an optional layout file for creating multiple
moms on one box in a specified layout. In the file, each mom
on the single box is given its own hostname, cpu indexes,
<br>
memory nodes (a linux construct), and memory size. This is
useful for NUMA systems. Each line in the file specifies one
mom. The file follows the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;hostname&gt; cpus=&lt;X&gt;
mem=&lt;Y&gt; memsize=&lt;Z&gt; <br>
cpus and mem can be comma separated lists, while memsize
should be a memory size in the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;number&gt;&lt;units&gt; <br>
For example, a file could contain the following line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foohost-1 cpus=1,2 mem=1,2,3,4
memsize=8GB <br>
This would specify that foohost-1 has cpus 1 and 2, memory
nodes 1-4, and a total of 8 GB of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCES <br>
Resource Monitor queries can be made with momctl&rsquo;s -q
option to retrieve and set pbs_mom options. Any configured
static resource may be retrieved with a request of the same
<br>
name. These are resource requests not otherwise documented
in the PBS ERS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cycle forces an immediate MOM
cycle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status_update_time <br>
retrieve or set the $status_update_time parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check_poll_time <br>
retrieve or set the $check_poll_time parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configversion <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobstartblocktime <br>
retrieve or set the $jobstartblocktime parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enablemomrestart <br>
retrieve or set the $enablemomrestart parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loglevel <br>
retrieve or set the $loglevel parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down_on_error <br>
retrieve or set the EXPERIMENTAL $down_on_error
parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diag0 - diag4 <br>
retrieves various diagnostic information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcpcmd retrieve or set the
$rcpcmd parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
retrieves the pbs_mom version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEALTH CHECK <br>
The health check script is executed directly by the pbs_mom
daemon under the root user id. It must be accessible from
the compute node and may be a script or compiled executable
<br>
program. It may make any needed system calls and execute any
combination of system utilities but should not execute
resource manager client commands. Also, as of TORQUE 1.0.1,
<br>
the pbs_mom daemon blocks until the health check is
completed and does not possess a built-in timeout.
Consequently, it is advisable to keep the launch script
execution time <br>
short and verify that the script will not block even under
failure conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the script detects a failure,
it should return the keyword &rsquo;ERROR&rsquo; to stdout
followed by an error message. The message (up to 256
characters) immediately following the ERROR <br>
string will be assigned to the node attribute
&rsquo;message&rsquo; of the associated node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the script detects a failure
when run from &quot;jobstart&quot;, then the job will be
rejected. This should probably only be used with advanced
schedulers like Moab so that the job can <br>
be routed to another node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TORQUE currently ignores ERROR
messages by default, but advanced schedulers like moab can
be configured to react appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the experimental
$down_on_error MOM setting is enabled, MOM will set itself
to state down and report to pbs_server; and pbs_server will
report the node as &quot;down&quot;. Addition&acirc; <br>
ally, the experimental &quot;down_on_error&quot; server
attribute can be enabled which has the same effect but moves
the decision to pbs_server. It is redundant to have
MOM&rsquo;s <br>
$down_on_error and pbs_server&rsquo;s down_on_error features
enabled. See &quot;down_on_error&quot; in
pbs_server_attributes(7B).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name <br>
contains the hostname running pbs_server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv <br>
the default directory for configuration files, typically
(/usr/spool/pbs)/mom_priv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_logs <br>
directory for log files recorded by the server.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv/prologue
<br>
the administrative script to be run before job
execution.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv/epilogue
<br>
the administrative script to be run after job execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNAL HANDLING <br>
pbs_mom handles the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP causes pbs_mom to re-read
its configuration file, close and reopen the log file, and
reinitialize resource structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGALRM <br>
results in a log file entry. The signal is used to limit the
time taken by certain children processes, such as the
prologue and epilogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT and SIGTERM <br>
results in pbs_mom exiting without terminating any running
jobs. This is the action for the following signals as well:
SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ, SIGCPULIM, and SIGSHUTDN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 <br>
causes MOM to increase and decrease logging levels,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGPIPE, SIGINFO <br>
are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGTRAP,
and SIGSYS <br>
cause a core dump if the PBSCOREDUMP environmental variable
is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other signals have their
default behavior installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If the mini-server command fails to begin operation, the
server exits with a value greater than zero.</p>
