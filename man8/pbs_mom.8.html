<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>pbs_mom</b> command starts the operation of a batch <b>M</b>achine
  <b>O</b>riented <b>M</b>ini-server, MOM, on the local host. Typically, this
  command will be in a local boot file such as <i>/etc/rc.local .</i> To insure
  that the pbs_mom command is not runnable by the general user community, the
  server will only execute if its real and effective uid is zero.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One function of pbs_mom is to place jobs into execution as directed by the
  server, establish resource usage limits, monitor the job's usage, and notify
  the server when the job completes. If they exist, pbs_mom will execute a
  prologue script before executing a job and an epilogue script after executing
  the job. The next function of pbs_mom is to respond to resource monitor
  requests. This was done by a separate process in previous versions of PBS but
  has now been combined into one process. The resource monitor function is
  provided mainly for the PBS scheduler. It provides information about the
  status of running jobs, memory available etc. The next function of pbs_mom is
  to respond to task manager requests. This involves communicating with running
  tasks over a tcp socket as well as communicating with other MOMs within a job
  (aka a &quot;sisterhood&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pbs_mom will record a diagnostic message in a log file for any error occurrence.
  The log files are maintained in the <i>mom_logs</i> directory below the home
  directory of the server. If the log file cannot be opened, the diagnostic
  message is written to the system console.

There is also an optional layout file for creating multiple moms on one box in a
  specified layout. In the file, each mom on the single box is given its own
  hostname, cpu indexes, memory nodes (a linux construct), and memory size. This
  is useful for NUMA systems. Each line in the file specifies one mom. The file
  follows the following format:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&lt;hostname&gt; cpus=&lt;X&gt; mem=&lt;Y&gt;
    memsize=&lt;Z&gt;</dt>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HEALTH_CHECK"><a class="selflink" href="#HEALTH_CHECK">HEALTH
  CHECK</a></h1>
The health check script is executed directly by the pbs_mom daemon under the
  root user id. It must be accessible from the compute node and may be a script
  or compiled executable program. It may make any needed system calls and
  execute any combination of system utilities but should not execute resource
  manager client commands. Also, as of TORQUE 1.0.1, the pbs_mom daemon blocks
  until the health check is completed and does not possess a built-in timeout.
  Consequently, it is advisable to keep the launch script execution time short
  and verify that the script will not block even under failure conditions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the script detects a failure, it should return the keyword 'ERROR' to stdout
  followed by an error message. The message (up to 256 characters) immediately
  following the ERROR string will be assigned to the node attribute 'message' of
  the associated node.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the script detects a failure when run from &quot;jobstart&quot;, then the job
  will be rejected. This should probably only be used with advanced schedulers
  like Moab so that the job can be routed to another node.
<div class="Pp"></div>
TORQUE currently ignores ERROR messages by default, but advanced schedulers like
  moab can be configured to react appropriately.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the experimental $down_on_error MOM setting is enabled, MOM will set itself
  to state down and report to pbs_server; and pbs_server will report the node as
  &quot;down&quot;. Additionally, the experimental &quot;down_on_error&quot;
  server attribute can be enabled which has the same effect but moves the
  decision to pbs_server. It is redundant to have MOM's $down_on_error and
  pbs_server's down_on_error features enabled. See &quot;down_on_error&quot; in
  pbs_server_attributes(7B).
