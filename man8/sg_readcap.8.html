<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_readcap - send SCSI READ CAPACITY command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_readcap [--16] [--brief] [--help] [--hex] [--lba=LBA]
[--long] [--pmi] [--raw] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_readcap [-16] [-b] [-h] [-H]
[-lba=LBA] [-pmi] [-r] [-v] [-V] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The normal action of the SCSI READ CAPACITY command is to
fetch the number of blocks (and block size) from the
DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SCSI READ CAPACITY command
(both 10 and 16 byte cdbs) actually yield the block address
of the last block and the block size. The number of blocks
is thus one plus the block <br>
address of the last block (as blocks are counted origin zero
(i.e. starting at block zero)). This is the source of many
&quot;off by one&quot; errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The READ CAPACITY(16) response
provides additional information not found in the READ
CAPACITY(10) response. This includes protection and logical
block provisioning information, <br>
plus the number of logical blocks per physical block. So
even though the media size may not exceed what READ
CAPACITY(10) can show, it may still be useful to examine the
response <br>
to READ CAPACITY(16). Sadly there are horrible SCSI command
set implementations in the wild that crash when the READ
CAPACITY(16) command is sent to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device capacity is the product
of the number of blocks by the block size. This utility
outputs this figure in bytes, MiB (1048576 bytes per MiB)
and GB (1000000000 bytes per <br>
GB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sg_readcap is called without
the --long option then the 10 byte cdb version (i.e. READ
CAPACITY (10)) is sent to the DEVICE. If the number of
blocks in the response is <br>
reported as 0xffffffff (i.e. (2**32 - 1) ) and the --hex
option has not been given, then READ CAPACITY (16) is called
and its response is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility supports two
command line syntaxes, the preferred one is shown first in
the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section
on the old command line syntax <br>
outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--16 Use the 16 byte cdb variant
of the READ CAPACITY command. See the &rsquo;--long&rsquo;
option. -b, --brief outputs two hex numbers (prefixed with
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; and space separated) to stdout. <br>
The first number is the maximum number of blocks on the
device (which is one plus the lba of the last accessible
block). The second number is the size in bytes of each <br>
block. If the operation fails then &quot;0x0 0x0&quot; is
written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print out the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
output the response to the READ CAPACITY command (either the
10 or 16 byte cdb variant) in ASCII hexadecimal on
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --lba=LBA <br>
used in conjunction with --pmi option. This variant of READ
CAPACITY will yield the last block address after LBA prior
to a delay. For a disk, given a LBA it yields the <br>
highest numbered block on the same cylinder (i.e. before the
heads need to move). LBA is assumed to be decimal unless
prefixed by &quot;0x&quot; or it has a trailing
&quot;h&quot;. Defaults <br>
to 0. This option was made obsolete in SBC-3 revision
26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --long <br>
Use the 16 byte cdb variant of the READ CAPACITY command.
The default action is to use the 10 byte cdb variant which
limits the maximum block address to (2**32 - 2). When <br>
a 10 byte cdb READ CAPACITY command is used on a device
whose size is too large then a last block address of
0xffffffff is returned (if the device complies with SBC-2 or
<br>
later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --old <br>
switch to older style options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pmi <br>
partial medium indicator: for finding the next block address
prior to some delay (e.g. head movement). In the absence of
this option, the total number of blocks and the <br>
block size of the device are output. Used in conjunction
with the --lba=LBA option. This option was made obsolete in
SBC-3 revision 26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
output response in binary to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
outputs version string then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a SCSI
generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices (e.g.
SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified. For <br>
example &quot;sg_readcap /dev/sda&quot; and &quot;sg_readcap
/dev/hdd&quot; (if /dev/hdd is a ATAPI CD/DVD device) will
work in the 2.6 series kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_readcap is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The options in this section were the only ones available
prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23
and later these older options can be selected by either
set&acirc; <br>
ting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
&rsquo;--old&rsquo; (or &rsquo;-O) as the first option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-16 Use the 16 byte cdb variant
of the READ CAPACITY command. Equivalent to --long in the
main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b utility outputs two hex
numbers (prefixed with &rsquo;0x&rsquo; and space separated)
to stdout. The first number is the maximum number of blocks
on the device (which is one plus the <br>
lba of the last accessible block). The second number is the
size of each block. If the operation fails then &quot;0x0
0x0&quot; is written to stdout. Equivalent to --brief in the
<br>
main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h output the usage message then
exit. Giving the -? option also outputs the usage message
then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H output the response to the
READ CAPACITY command (either the 10 or 16 byte cdb variant)
in ASCII hexadecimal on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lba=LBA <br>
used in conjunction with -pmi option. This variant of READ
CAPACITY will yield the last block address after LBA prior
to a delay. Equivalent to --lba=LBA in the main <br>
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N switch to the newer style
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pmi partial medium indicator:
for finding the next block address prior to some delay (e.g.
head movement). In the absence of this switch, the total
number of blocks and the <br>
block size of the device are output. Equivalent to --pmi in
the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r output response in binary (to
stdout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose: print out cdb of
issued commands prior to execution. &rsquo;-vv&rsquo; and
&rsquo;-vvv&rsquo; are also accepted yielding greater
verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V outputs version string then
exits.</p>
