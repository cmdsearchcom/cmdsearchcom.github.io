<p>RPCINFO(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
RPCINFO(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rpcinfo &acirc; report RPC information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rpcinfo [-m | -s] [host] <br>
rpcinfo -p [host] <br>
rpcinfo -T transport host prognum [versnum] <br>
rpcinfo -l [-T transport] host prognum versnum <br>
rpcinfo [-n portnum] -u host prognum [versnum] <br>
rpcinfo [-n portnum] [-t] host prognum [versnum] <br>
rpcinfo -a serv_address -T transport prognum [versnum] <br>
rpcinfo -b [-T transport] prognum versnum <br>
rpcinfo -d [-T transport] prognum versnum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what
it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first synopsis, rpcinfo
lists all the registered RPC services with rpcbind on host.
If host is not specified, the local host is the default. If
-s is used, the information <br>
is displayed in a concise format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second synopsis, rpcinfo
lists all the RPC services registered with rpcbind, version
2. Also note that the format of the information is different
in the first and the sec&acirc; <br>
ond synopsis. This is because the second synopsis is an
older protocol used to collect the information displayed
(version 2 of the rpcbind protocol).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third synopsis makes an RPC
call to procedure 0 of prognum and versnum on the specified
host and reports whether a response was received. transport
is the transport which has <br>
to be used for contacting the given service. The remote
address of the service is obtained by making a call to the
remote rpcbind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prognum argument is a number
that represents an RPC program number. If a versnum is
specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the
specified prognum. Otherwise, <br>
rpcinfo attempts to find all the registered version numbers
for the specified prognum by calling version 0, which is
presumed not to exist; if it does exist, rpcinfo attempts to
<br>
obtain this information by calling an extremely high version
number instead, and attempts to call each registered
version. Note: the version number is required for -b and -d
<br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-T transport <br>
Specify the transport on which the service is required. If
this option is not specified, rpcinfo uses the transport
specified in the NETPATH environment variable, or if <br>
that is unset or null, the transport in the netconfig(5)
database is used. This is a generic option, and can be used
in conjunction with other options as shown in the SYN&acirc;
<br>
OPSIS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a serv_address <br>
Use serv_address as the (universal) address for the service
on transport to ping procedure 0 of the specified prognum
and report whether a response was received. The -T <br>
option is required with the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If versnum is not specified,
rpcinfo tries to ping all available version numbers for that
program number. This option avoids calls to remote rpcbind
to find the address of <br>
the service. The serv_address is specified in universal
address format of the given transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Make an RPC broadcast to
procedure 0 of the specified prognum and versnum and report
all hosts that respond. If transport is specified, it
broadcasts its request only on <br>
the specified transport. If broadcasting is not supported by
any transport, an error message is printed. Use of
broadcasting should be limited because of the potential <br>
for adverse effect on other systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Delete registration for the
RPC service of the specified prognum and versnum. If
transport is specified, unregister the service on only that
transport, otherwise unregis&acirc; <br>
ter the service on all the transports on which it was
registered. Only the owner of a service can delete a
registration, except the super-user who can delete any
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Display a list of entries
with a given prognum and versnum on the specified host.
Entries are returned for all transports in the same protocol
family as that used to con&acirc; <br>
tact the remote rpcbind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Display a table of statistics
of rpcbind operations on the given host. The table shows
statistics for each version of rpcbind (versions 2, 3 and
4), giving the number of <br>
times each procedure was requested and successfully
serviced, the number and type of remote call requests that
were made, and information about RPC address lookups that
<br>
were handled. This is useful for monitoring RPC activities
on host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n portnum <br>
Use portnum as the port number for the -t and -u options
instead of the port number given by rpcbind. Use of this
option avoids a call to the remote rpcbind to find out <br>
the address of the service. This option is made obsolete by
the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Probe rpcbind on host using
version 2 of the rpcbind protocol, and display a list of all
registered RPC programs. If host is not specified, it
defaults to the local host. <br>
Note: Version 2 of the rpcbind protocol was previously known
as the portmapper protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Display a concise list of all
registered RPC programs on host. If host is not specified,
it defaults to the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Make an RPC call to procedure
0 of prognum on the specified host using TCP, and report
whether a response was received. This option is made
obsolete by the -T option as <br>
shown in the third synopsis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Make an RPC call to procedure
0 of prognum on the specified host using UDP, and report
whether a response was received. This option is made
obsolete by the -T option as <br>
shown in the third synopsis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To show all of the RPC services registered on the local
machine use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% rpcinfo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To show all of the RPC services
registered with rpcbind on the machine named klaxon use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% rpcinfo klaxon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information displayed by the
above commands can be quite lengthy. Use the -s option to
display a more concise list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example$ rpcinfo -s klaxon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">program version(s) netid(s)
service owner <br>
100000 2,3,4 local,tcp,udp,tcp6,udp6 rpcbind super-user <br>
100008 1 udp,tcp,udp6,tcp6 walld super-user <br>
100002 2,1 udp,udp6 rusersd super-user <br>
100001 2,3,4 udp,udp6 rstatd super-user <br>
100012 1 udp,tcp sprayd super-user <br>
100007 3 udp,tcp ypbind super-user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To show whether the RPC service
with program number prognum and version versnum is
registered on the machine named klaxon for the transport TCP
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% rpcinfo -T tcp klaxon
prognum versnum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To show all RPC services
registered with version 2 of the rpcbind protocol on the
local machine use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% rpcinfo -p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To delete the registration for
version 1 of the walld (program number 100008 ) service for
all transports use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# rpcinfo -d 100008 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# rpcinfo -d walld 1</p>
