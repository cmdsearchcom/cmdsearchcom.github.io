<p>unbound-anchor(8) unbound 1.4.20 unbound-anchor(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
unbound-anchor - Unbound anchor utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
unbound-anchor [opts]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Unbound-anchor performs setup or update of the root trust
anchor for DNSSEC validation. It can be run (as root) from
the commandline, or run as part of startup scripts. Before
<br>
you start the unbound(8) DNS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suggested usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># in the init scripts. <br>
# provide or update the root anchor (if necessary) <br>
unbound-anchor -a &quot;/var/lib/unbound/root.key&quot; <br>
# Please note usage of this root anchor is at your own risk
<br>
# and under the terms of our LICENSE (see source). <br>
# <br>
# start validating resolver <br>
# the unbound.conf contains: <br>
# auto-trust-anchor-file:
&quot;/var/lib/unbound/root.key&quot; <br>
unbound -c unbound.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool provides builtin
default contents for the root anchor and root update
certificate files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It tests if the root anchor file
works, and if not, and an update is possible, attempts to
update the root anchor using the root update certificate. It
performs a https fetch of <br>
root-anchors.xml and checks the results, if all checks are
successful, it updates the root anchor file. Otherwise the
root anchor file is unchanged. It performs RFC5011
track&acirc; <br>
ing if the DNSSEC information available via the DNS makes
that possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It does not perform an update if
the certificate is expired, if the network is down or other
errors occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a file <br>
The root anchor key file, that is read in and written out.
Default is /var/lib/unbound/root.key. If the file does not
exist, or is empty, a builtin root key is written <br>
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file <br>
The root update certificate file, that is read in. Default
is /etc/unbound/icannbundle.pem. If the file does not exist,
or is empty, a builtin certificate is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the builtin root key and
builtin root update certificate on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u name <br>
The server name, it connects to https://name. Specify
without https:// prefix. The default is
&quot;data.iana.org&quot;. It connects to the port specified
with -P. You can pass <br>
an IPv4 addres or IPv6 address (no brackets) if you
want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x path <br>
The pathname to the root-anchors.xml file on the server.
(forms URL with -u). The default is
/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s path <br>
The pathname to the root-anchors.p7s file on the server.
(forms URL with -u). The default is
/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s. This file has to be a PKCS7
signature over <br>
the xml file, using the pem file (-c) as trust anchor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name <br>
The emailAddress for the Subject of the signer&rsquo;s
certificate from the p7s signature file. Only signatures
from this name are allowed. default is dnssec@iana.org. If
you <br>
pass &quot;&quot; then the emailAddress is not checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Use IPv4 for domain
resolution and contacting the server on https. Default is to
use IPv4 and IPv6 where appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Use IPv6 for domain
resolution and contacting the server on https. Default is to
use IPv4 and IPv6 where appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f resolv.conf <br>
Use the given resolv.conf file. Not enabled by default, but
you could try to pass /etc/resolv.conf on some systems. It
contains the IP addresses of the recursive name&acirc; <br>
servers to use. However, since this tool could be used to
bootstrap that very recursive nameserver, it would not be
useful (since that server is not up yet, since we are <br>
bootstrapping it). It could be useful in a situation where
you know an upstream cache is deployed (and running) and in
captive portal situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r root.hints <br>
Use the given root.hints file (same syntax as the BIND and
Unbound root hints file) to bootstrap domain resolution. By
default a list of builtin root hints is used. <br>
Unbound-anchor goes to the network itself for these roots,
to resolve the server (-u option) and to check the root
DNSKEY records. It does so, because the tool when used <br>
for bootstrapping the recursive resolver, cannot use that
recursive resolver itself because it is bootstrapping that
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v More verbose. Once prints
informational messages, multiple times may enable large
debug amounts (such as full certificates or byte-dumps of
downloaded files). By default <br>
it prints almost nothing. It also prints nothing on errors
by default; in that case the original root anchor file is
simply left undisturbed, so that a recursive server <br>
can start right after it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C unbound.conf <br>
Debug option to read unbound.conf into the resolver process
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P port <br>
Set the port number to use for the https connection. The
default is 443.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Debug option to force update
of the root anchor through downloading the xml file and
verifying it with the certificate. By default it first tries
to update by contacting <br>
the DNS, which uses much less bandwidth, is much faster (200
msec not 2 sec), and is nicer to the deployed
infrastructure. With this option, it still attempts to do so
<br>
(and may verbosely tell you), but then ignores the result
and goes on to use the xml fallback method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show the version and
commandline option help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
This tool exits with value 1 if the root anchor was updated
using the certificate or if the builtin root-anchor was
used. It exits with code 0 if no update was necessary, if
the <br>
update was possible with RFC5011 tracking, or if an error
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can check the exit value in
this manner: <br>
unbound-anchor -a &quot;root.key&quot; || logger
&quot;Please check root.key&quot; <br>
Or something more suitable for your operational
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRUST <br>
The root keys and update certificate included in this tool
are provided for convenience and under the terms of our
license (see the LICENSE file in the source distribution or
<br>
http://unbound.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/trunk/LICENSE) and might be
stale or not suitable to your purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By running &quot;unbound-anchor
-l&quot; the keys and certificate that are configured in the
code are printed for your convenience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The build-in configuration can
be overridden by providing a root-cert file and a rootkey
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/unbound/root.key <br>
The root anchor file, updated with 5011 tracking, and read
and written to. The file is created if it does not
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/unbound/icannbundle.pem
<br>
The trusted self-signed certificate that is used to verify
the downloaded DNSSEC root trust anchor. You can update it
by fetching it from <br>
https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/icannbundle.pem (and
validate it). If the file does not exist or is empty, a
builtin version is used.</p>
