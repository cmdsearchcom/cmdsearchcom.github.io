<b>Unbound-anchor</b> performs setup or update of the root trust anchor for
  DNSSEC validation. It can be run (as root) from the commandline, or run as
  part of startup scripts. Before you start the <i>unbound</i>(8) DNS server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suggested usage:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	# in the init scripts.
	# provide or update the root anchor (if necessary)
	unbound-anchor -a &quot;/var/lib/unbound/root.key&quot;
	# Please note usage of this root anchor is at your own risk
	# and under the terms of our LICENSE (see source).
	#
	# start validating resolver
	# the unbound.conf contains:
	#   auto-trust-anchor-file: &quot;/var/lib/unbound/root.key&quot;
	unbound -c unbound.conf
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This tool provides builtin default contents for the root anchor and root update
  certificate files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It tests if the root anchor file works, and if not, and an update is possible,
  attempts to update the root anchor using the root update certificate. It
  performs a https fetch of root-anchors.xml and checks the results, if all
  checks are successful, it updates the root anchor file. Otherwise the root
  anchor file is unchanged. It performs RFC5011 tracking if the DNSSEC
  information available via the DNS makes that possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It does not perform an update if the certificate is expired, if the network is
  down or other errors occur.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The available options are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a <i>file</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The root anchor key file, that is read in and written out.
      Default is /var/lib/unbound/root.key. If the file does not exist, or is
      empty, a builtin root key is written to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c <i>file</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The root update certificate file, that is read in. Default
      is /etc/unbound/icannbundle.pem. If the file does not exist, or is empty,
      a builtin certificate is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">List the builtin root key and builtin root update
      certificate on stdout.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-u <i>name</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The server name, it connects to https://name. Specify
      without https:// prefix. The default is &quot;data.iana.org&quot;. It
      connects to the port specified with -P. You can pass an IPv4 addres or
      IPv6 address (no brackets) if you want.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-x <i>path</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The pathname to the root-anchors.xml file on the server.
      (forms URL with -u). The default is /root-anchors/root-anchors.xml.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s <i>path</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The pathname to the root-anchors.p7s file on the server.
      (forms URL with -u). The default is /root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s. This
      file has to be a PKCS7 signature over the xml file, using the pem file
      (-c) as trust anchor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n <i>name</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The emailAddress for the Subject of the signer's
      certificate from the p7s signature file. Only signatures from this name
      are allowed. default is dnssec@iana.org. If you pass &quot;&quot; then the
      emailAddress is not checked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-4</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use IPv4 for domain resolution and contacting the server on
      https. Default is to use IPv4 and IPv6 where appropriate.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Use IPv6 for domain resolution and contacting the server on

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f <i>resolv.conf</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the given resolv.conf file. Not enabled by default, but
      you could try to pass /etc/resolv.conf on some systems. It contains the IP
      addresses of the recursive nameservers to use. However, since this tool
      could be used to bootstrap that very recursive nameserver, it would not be
      useful (since that server is not up yet, since we are bootstrapping it).
      It could be useful in a situation where you know an upstream cache is
      deployed (and running) and in captive portal situations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r <i>root.hints</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the given root.hints file (same syntax as the BIND and
      Unbound root hints file) to bootstrap domain resolution. By default a list
      of builtin root hints is used. Unbound-anchor goes to the network itself
      for these roots, to resolve the server (-u option) and to check the root
      DNSKEY records. It does so, because the tool when used for bootstrapping
      the recursive resolver, cannot use that recursive resolver itself because
      it is bootstrapping that server.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">More verbose. Once prints informational messages, multiple
      times may enable large debug amounts (such as full certificates or
      byte-dumps of downloaded files). By default it prints almost nothing. It
      also prints nothing on errors by default; in that case the original root
      anchor file is simply left undisturbed, so that a recursive server can
      start right after it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-C <i>unbound.conf</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Debug option to read unbound.conf into the resolver process
      used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-P <i>port</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the port number to use for the https connection. The
      default is 443.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-F</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Debug option to force update of the root anchor through
      downloading the xml file and verifying it with the certificate. By default
      it first tries to update by contacting the DNS, which uses much less
      bandwidth, is much faster (200 msec not 2 sec), and is nicer to the
      deployed infrastructure. With this option, it still attempts to do so (and
      may verbosely tell you), but then ignores the result and goes on to use
      the xml fallback method.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_CODE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_CODE">EXIT
  CODE</a></h1>
This tool exits with value 1 if the root anchor was updated using the
  certificate or if the builtin root-anchor was used. It exits with code 0 if no
  update was necessary, if the update was possible with RFC5011 tracking, or if
  an error occurred.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can check the exit value in this manner:
<pre>
	unbound-anchor -a &quot;root.key&quot; || logger &quot;Please check root.key&quot;
</pre>
Or something more suitable for your operational environment.

By running &quot;unbound-anchor -l&quot; the keys and certificate that are

The build-in configuration can be overridden by providing a root-cert file and a
