<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntfsclone - Efficiently clone, image, restore or rescue an
NTFS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntfsclone [OPTIONS] SOURCE <br>
ntfsclone --save-image [OPTIONS] SOURCE <br>
ntfsclone --restore-image [OPTIONS] SOURCE <br>
ntfsclone --metadata [OPTIONS] SOURCE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntfsclone will efficiently clone (copy, save, backup,
restore) or rescue an NTFS filesystem to a sparse file,
image, device (partition) or standard output. It works at
disk sec&acirc; <br>
tor level and copies only the used data. Unused disk space
becomes zero (cloning to sparse file), encoded with control
codes (saving in special image format), left unchanged <br>
(cloning to a disk/partition) or filled with zeros (cloning
to standard output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfsclone can be useful to make
backups, an exact snapshot of an NTFS filesystem and restore
it later on, or for developers to test NTFS read/write
functionality, trou&acirc; <br>
bleshoot/investigate users&rsquo; issues using the clone
without the risk of destroying the original filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The clone, if not using the
special image format, is an exact copy of the original NTFS
filesystem from sector to sector thus it can be also mounted
just like the original NTFS <br>
filesystem. For example if you clone to a file and the
kernel has loopback device and NTFS support then the file
can be mounted as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -t ntfs -o loop
ntfsclone.img /mnt/ntfsclone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows Cloning <br>
If you want to copy, move or restore a system or boot
partition to another computer, or to a different disk or
partition (e.g. hda1-&gt;hda2, hda1-&gt;hdb1 or to a
different disk sec&acirc; <br>
tor offset) then you will need to take extra care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually, Windows will not be
able to boot, unless you copy, move or restore NTFS to the
same partition which starts at the same sector on the same
type of disk having the same <br>
BIOS legacy cylinder setting as the original partition and
disk had.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ntfsclone utility guarantees
to make an exact copy of NTFS but it won&rsquo;t deal with
booting issues. This is by design: ntfsclone is a
filesystem, not system utility. Its aim is <br>
only NTFS cloning, not Windows cloning. Hereby ntfsclone can
be used as a very fast and reliable build block for Windows
cloning but itself it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse Files <br>
A file is sparse if it has unallocated blocks (holes). The
reported size of such files are always higher than the disk
space consumed by them. The du command can tell the real
<br>
disk space used by a sparse file. The holes are always read
as zeros. All major Linux filesystem like, ext2, ext3,
reiserfs, Reiser4, JFS and XFS, supports sparse files but
for <br>
example the ISO 9600 CD-ROM filesystem doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling Large Sparse Files <br>
As of today Linux provides inadequate support for managing
(tar, cp, gzip, gunzip, bzip2, bunzip2, cat, etc) large
sparse files. The only main Linux filesystem having support
<br>
for efficient sparse file handling is XFS by the
XFS_IOC_GETBMAPX ioctl(2). However none of the common
utilities supports it. This means when you tar, cp, gzip,
bzip2, etc a <br>
large sparse file they will always read the entire file,
even if you use the &quot;sparse support&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2(1) compresses large sparse
files much better than gzip(1) but it does so also much
slower. Moreover neither of them handles large sparse files
efficiently during uncompres&acirc; <br>
sion from disk space usage point of view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At present the most efficient
way, both speed and space-wise, to compress and uncompress
large sparse files by common tools would be using tar(1)
with the options -S (handle <br>
sparse files &quot;efficiently&quot;) and -j (filter the
archive through bzip2). Although tar still reads and
analyses the entire file, it doesn&rsquo;t pass on the large
data blocks having only <br>
zeros to filters and it also avoids writing large amount of
zeros to the disk needlessly. But since tar can&rsquo;t
create an archive from the standard input, you can&rsquo;t
do this <br>
in-place by just reading ntfsclone standard output. Even
more sadly, using the -S option results serious data loss
since the end of 2004 and the GNU tar maintainers
didn&rsquo;t <br>
release fixed versions until the present day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Special Image Format <br>
It&rsquo;s also possible, actually it&rsquo;s recommended,
to save an NTFS filesystem to a special image format.
Instead of representing unallocated blocks as holes, they
are encoded using <br>
control codes. Thus, the image saves space without requiring
sparse file support. The image format is ideal for streaming
filesystem images over the network and similar, and can <br>
be used as a replacement for Ghost or Partition Image if it
is combined with other tools. The downside is that you
can&rsquo;t mount the image directly, you need to restore it
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To save an image using the
special image format, use the -s or the --save-image option.
To restore an image, use the -r or the --restore-image
option. Note that you can restore <br>
images from standard input by using &rsquo;-&rsquo; as the
SOURCE file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata-only Cloning <br>
One of the features of ntfsclone is that, it can also save
only the NTFS metadata using the option -m or --metadata and
the clone still will be mountable. In this case all <br>
non-metadata file content will be lost and reading them back
will result always zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metadata-only image can be
compressed very well, usually to not more than 1-8 MB thus
it&rsquo;s easy to transfer for investigation,
troubleshooting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode of ntfsclone, NONE
of the user&rsquo;s data is saved, including the resident
user&rsquo;s data embedded into metadata. All is filled with
zeros. Moreover all the file time&acirc; <br>
stamps, deleted and unused spaces inside the metadata are
filled with zeros. Thus this mode is inappropriate for
example for forensic analyses. This mode may be combined
with <br>
--save-image to create a special image format file instead
of a sparse file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note, filenames are not
wiped out. They might contain sensitive information, so
think twice before sending such an image to anybody.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsclone
accepts. Nearly all options have two equivalent names. The
short name is preceded by - and the long name is preceded by
-- <br>
. Any single letter options, that don&rsquo;t take an
argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g. -fv is
equivalent to -f -v . Long named options can be abbreviated
to any <br>
unique prefix of their name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output FILE <br>
Clone NTFS to the non-existent FILE. If FILE is
&rsquo;-&rsquo; then clone to the standard output. This
option cannot be used for creating a partition, use
--overwrite for an exist&acirc; <br>
ing partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --overwrite FILE <br>
Clone NTFS to FILE, which can be an existing partition or a
regular file which will be overwritten if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --save-image <br>
Save to the special image format. This is the most efficient
way space and speed-wise if imaging is done to the standard
output, e.g. for image compression, encryption or <br>
streaming through a network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --restore-image <br>
Restore from the special image format specified by SOURCE
argument. If the SOURCE is &rsquo;-&rsquo; then the image is
read from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-action <br>
Test the consistency of a saved image by simulating its
restoring without writing anything. The NTFS data contained
in the image is not tested. The option --restore-image <br>
must also be present, and the options --output and
--overwrite must be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rescue <br>
Ignore disk read errors so disks having bad sectors, e.g.
dying disks, can be rescued the most efficiently way, with
minimal stress on them. Ntfsclone works at the lowest, <br>
sector level in this mode too thus more data can be rescued.
The contents of the unreadable sectors are filled by
character &rsquo;?&rsquo; and the beginning of such sectors
are <br>
marked by &quot;BadSectoR &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --metadata <br>
Clone ONLY METADATA (for NTFS experts). Only cloning to a
(sparse) file is allowed, unless used the option
--save-image is also used. You can&rsquo;t metadata-only
clone to a <br>
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-fs-check <br>
Ignore the result of the filesystem consistency check. This
option is allowed to be used only with the --metadata
option, for the safety of user&rsquo;s data. The clusters
which <br>
cause the inconsistency are saved too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --preserve-timestamps <br>
Do not wipe the timestamps, to be used only with the
--metadata option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-logfile <br>
Include the Windows log file in the copy. This is only
useful for extracting metadata, saving or cloning a file
system which was not properly unmounted from Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--new-serial, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--new-half-serial <br>
Set a new random serial number to the clone. The serial
number is a 64 bit number used to identify the device during
the mounting process, so it has to be changed to <br>
enable the original file system and the clone to be mounted
at the same time on the same computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option --new-half-serial
only changes the upper part of the serial number, keeping
the lower part which is used by Windows unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options --new-serial and
--new-half-serial can only be used when cloning a file
system of restoring from an image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The serial number is not the
volume UUID used by Windows to locate files which have been
moved to another volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Forces ntfsclone to proceed if the filesystem is marked
&quot;dirty&quot; for consistency check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Do not display any progress-bars during operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show a list of options with a brief description of each
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
The exit code is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
There are no known problems with ntfsclone. If you think you
have found a problem then please send an email describing it
to the development team: ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it might appear
ntfsclone froze if the clone is on ReiserFS and even CTRL-C
won&rsquo;t stop it. This is not a bug in ntfsclone, however
it&rsquo;s due to ReiserFS being extremely <br>
inefficient creating large sparse files and not handling
signals during this operation. This ReiserFS problem was
improved in kernel 2.4.22. XFS, JFS and ext3 don&rsquo;t
have this <br>
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
ntfsclone was written by Szabolcs Szakacsits with
contributions from Per Olofsson (special image format
support) and Anton Altaparmakov. It was ported to ntfs-3g by
Erik Larsson <br>
and Jean-Pierre Andre.</p>
