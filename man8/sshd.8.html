<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sshd &acirc; OpenSSH SSH daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sshd [-46DdeiqTt] [-b bits] [-C connection_spec] [-c
host_certificate_file] [-E log_file] [-f config_file] [-g
login_grace_time] [-h host_key_file] [-k key_gen_time] [-o
option] <br>
[-p port] [-u len]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sshd (OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for ssh(1).
Together these programs replace rlogin(1) and rsh(1), and
provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted <br>
hosts over an insecure network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sshd listens for connections
from clients. It is normally started at boot from /etc/rc.
It forks a new daemon for each incoming connection. The
forked daemons handle key <br>
exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution, and
data exchange.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sshd can be configured using
command-line options or a configuration file (by default
sshd_config(5)); command-line options override values
specified in the configuration file. <br>
sshd rereads its configuration file when it receives a
hangup signal, SIGHUP, by executing itself with the name and
options it was started with, e.g. /usr/sbin/sshd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Forces sshd to use IPv4
addresses only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Forces sshd to use IPv6
addresses only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bits <br>
Specifies the number of bits in the ephemeral protocol
version 1 server key (default 1024).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C connection_spec <br>
Specify the connection parameters to use for the -T extended
test mode. If provided, any Match directives in the
configuration file that would apply to the specified user,
<br>
host, and address will be set before the configuration is
written to standard output. The connection parameters are
supplied as keyword=value pairs. The keywords are <br>
&acirc;user&acirc;, &acirc;host&acirc;, &acirc;laddr&acirc;,
&acirc;lport&acirc;, and &acirc;addr&acirc;. All are
required and may be supplied in any order, either with
multiple -C options or as a comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c host_certificate_file <br>
Specifies a path to a certificate file to identify sshd
during key exchange. The certificate file must match a host
key file specified using the -h option or the HostKey <br>
configuration directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D When this option is
specified, sshd will not detach and does not become a
daemon. This allows easy monitoring of sshd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debug mode. The server sends
verbose debug output to standard error, and does not put
itself in the background. The server also will not fork and
will only process one <br>
connection. This option is only intended for debugging for
the server. Multiple -d options increase the debugging
level. Maximum is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E log_file <br>
Append debug logs to log_file instead of the system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Write debug logs to standard
error instead of the system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config_file <br>
Specifies the name of the configuration file. The default is
/etc/ssh/sshd_config. sshd refuses to start if there is no
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g login_grace_time <br>
Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves
(default 120 seconds). If the client fails to authenticate
the user within this many seconds, the server dis&acirc;
<br>
connects and exits. A value of zero indicates no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host_key_file <br>
Specifies a file from which a host key is read. This option
must be given if sshd is not run as root (as the normal host
key files are normally not readable by anyone but <br>
root). The default is /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key for protocol
version 1, and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key,
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key. /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
and <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key for protocol version 2. It is
possible to have multiple host key files for the different
protocol versions and host key algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Specifies that sshd is being
run from inetd(8). sshd is normally not run from inetd
because it needs to generate the server key before it can
respond to the client, and <br>
this may take tens of seconds. Clients would have to wait
too long if the key was regenerated every time. However,
with small key sizes (e.g. 512) using sshd from inetd <br>
may be feasible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k key_gen_time <br>
Specifies how often the ephemeral protocol version 1 server
key is regenerated (default 3600 seconds, or one hour). The
motivation for regenerating the key fairly often is <br>
that the key is not stored anywhere, and after about an hour
it becomes impossible to recover the key for decrypting
intercepted communications even if the machine is <br>
cracked into or physically seized. A value of zero indicates
that the key will never be regenerated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o option <br>
Can be used to give options in the format used in the
configuration file. This is useful for specifying options
for which there is no separate command-line flag. For full
<br>
details of the options, and their values, see
sshd_config(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Specifies the port on which the server listens for
connections (default 22). Multiple port options are
permitted. Ports specified in the configuration file with
the Port <br>
option are ignored when a command-line port is specified.
Ports specified using the ListenAddress option override
command-line ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode. Nothing is sent
to the system log. Normally the beginning, authentication,
and termination of each connection is logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Extended test mode. Check the
validity of the configuration file, output the effective
configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match
rules may be applied by <br>
specifying the connection parameters using one or more -C
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Test mode. Only check the
validity of the configuration file and sanity of the keys.
This is useful for updating sshd reliably as configuration
options may change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u len This option is used to
specify the size of the field in the utmp structure that
holds the remote host name. If the resolved host name is
longer than len, the dotted deci&acirc; <br>
mal value will be used instead. This allows hosts with very
long host names that overflow this field to still be
uniquely identified. Specifying -u0 indicates that only <br>
dotted decimal addresses should be put into the utmp file.
-u0 may also be used to prevent sshd from making DNS
requests unless the authentication mechanism or
configura&acirc; <br>
tion requires it. Authentication mechanisms that may require
DNS include RhostsRSAAuthentication,
HostbasedAuthentication, and using a
from=&quot;pattern-list&quot; option in a key <br>
file. Configuration options that require DNS include using a
USER@HOST pattern in AllowUsers or DenyUsers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
The OpenSSH SSH daemon supports SSH protocols 1 and 2. The
default is to use protocol 2 only, though this can be
changed via the Protocol option in sshd_config(5). Protocol
2 <br>
supports DSA, ECDSA, ED25519 and RSA keys; protocol 1 only
supports RSA keys. For both protocols, each host has a
host-specific key, normally 2048 bits, used to identify the
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forward security for protocol 1
is provided through an additional server key, normally 768
bits, generated when the server starts. This key is normally
regenerated every hour if <br>
it has been used, and is never stored on disk. Whenever a
client connects, the daemon responds with its public host
and server keys. The client compares the RSA host key
against <br>
its own database to verify that it has not changed. The
client then generates a 256-bit random number. It encrypts
this random number using both the host key and the server
key, <br>
and sends the encrypted number to the server. Both sides
then use this random number as a session key which is used
to encrypt all further communications in the session. The
rest <br>
of the session is encrypted using a conventional cipher,
currently Blowfish or 3DES, with 3DES being used by default.
The client selects the encryption algorithm to use from
those <br>
offered by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For protocol 2, forward security
is provided through a Diffie-Hellman key agreement. This key
agreement results in a shared session key. The rest of the
session is encrypted <br>
using a symmetric cipher, currently 128-bit AES, Blowfish,
3DES, CAST128, Arcfour, 192-bit AES, or 256-bit AES. The
client selects the encryption algorithm to use from those
<br>
offered by the server. Additionally, session integrity is
provided through a cryptographic message authentication code
(hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, umac-64, umac-128, hmac-ripemd160,
<br>
hmac-sha2-256 or hmac-sha2-512).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the server and the
client enter an authentication dialog. The client tries to
authenticate itself using host-based authentication, public
key authentication, GSSAPI <br>
authentication, challenge-response authentication, or
password authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the authentication
type, the account is checked to ensure that it is
accessible. An account is not accessible if it is locked,
listed in DenyUsers or its group is <br>
listed in DenyGroups . The definition of a locked account is
system dependant. Some platforms have their own account
database (eg AIX) and some modify the passwd field (
&acirc;*LK*&acirc; on <br>
Solaris and UnixWare, &acirc;*&acirc; on HP-UX, containing
&acirc;Nologin&acirc; on Tru64, a leading
&acirc;*LOCKED*&acirc; on FreeBSD and a leading
&acirc;!&acirc; on most Linuxes). If there is a requirement
to disable pass&acirc; <br>
word authentication for the account while allowing still
public-key, then the passwd field should be set to something
other than these values (eg &acirc;NP&acirc; or
&acirc;*NP*&acirc; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the client successfully
authenticates itself, a dialog for preparing the session is
entered. At this time the client may request things like
allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding <br>
X11 connections, forwarding TCP connections, or forwarding
the authentication agent connection over the secure
channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this, the client either
requests a shell or execution of a command. The sides then
enter session mode. In this mode, either side may send data
at any time, and such data is <br>
forwarded to/from the shell or command on the server side,
and the user terminal in the client side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the user program terminates
and all forwarded X11 and other connections have been
closed, the server sends command exit status to the client,
and both sides exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGIN PROCESS <br>
When a user successfully logs in, sshd does the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the login is on a tty, and
no command has been specified, prints last login time and
/etc/motd (unless prevented in the configuration file or by
~/.hushlogin; see the <br>
FILES section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the login is on a tty,
records login time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Checks /etc/nologin; if it
exists, prints contents and quits (unless root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Changes to run with normal
user privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Sets up basic
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Reads the file
~/.ssh/environment, if it exists, and users are allowed to
change their environment. See the PermitUserEnvironment
option in sshd_config(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Changes to user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. If ~/.ssh/rc exists, runs it;
else if /etc/ssh/sshrc exists, runs it; otherwise runs
xauth. The &acirc;rc&acirc; files are given the X11
authentication protocol and cookie in stan&acirc; <br>
dard input. See SSHRC, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Runs user&rsquo;s shell or
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSHRC <br>
If the file ~/.ssh/rc exists, sh(1) runs it after reading
the environment files but before starting the user&rsquo;s
shell or command. It must not produce any output on stdout;
stderr <br>
must be used instead. If X11 forwarding is in use, it will
receive the &quot;proto cookie&quot; pair in its standard
input (and DISPLAY in its environment). The script must call
xauth(1) <br>
because sshd will not run xauth automatically to add X11
cookies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary purpose of this file
is to run any initialization routines which may be needed
before the user&rsquo;s home directory becomes accessible;
AFS is a particular example of such <br>
an environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file will probably contain
some initialization code followed by something similar
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if read proto cookie &amp;&amp;
[ -n &quot;$DISPLAY&quot; ]; then <br>
if [ &lsquo;echo $DISPLAY | cut -c1-10&lsquo; =
&rsquo;localhost:&rsquo; ]; then <br>
# X11UseLocalhost=yes <br>
echo add unix:&lsquo;echo $DISPLAY | <br>
cut -c11-&lsquo; $proto $cookie <br>
else <br>
# X11UseLocalhost=no <br>
echo add $DISPLAY $proto $cookie <br>
fi | xauth -q - <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this file does not exist,
/etc/ssh/sshrc is run, and if that does not exist either,
xauth is used to add the cookie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT <br>
AuthorizedKeysFile specifies the files containing public
keys for public key authentication; if none is specified,
the default is ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and <br>
~/.ssh/authorized_keys2. Each line of the file contains one
key (empty lines and lines starting with a &acirc;#&acirc;
are ignored as comments). Protocol 1 public keys consist of
the follow&acirc; <br>
ing space-separated fields: options, bits, exponent,
modulus, comment. Protocol 2 public key consist of: options,
keytype, base64-encoded key, comment. The options field is
<br>
optional; its presence is determined by whether the line
starts with a number or not (the options field never starts
with a number). The bits, exponent, modulus, and comment
<br>
fields give the RSA key for protocol version 1; the comment
field is not used for anything (but may be convenient for
the user to identify the key). For protocol version 2 the
<br>
keytype is &acirc;ecdsa-sha2-nistp256&acirc;,
&acirc;ecdsa-sha2-nistp384&acirc;,
&acirc;ecdsa-sha2-nistp521&acirc;,
&acirc;ssh-ed25519&acirc;, &acirc;ssh-dss&acirc; or
&acirc;ssh-rsa&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that lines in this file are
usually several hundred bytes long (because of the size of
the public key encoding) up to a limit of 8 kilobytes, which
permits DSA keys up to 8 <br>
kilobits and RSA keys up to 16 kilobits. You don&rsquo;t
want to type them in; instead, copy the identity.pub,
id_dsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, id_ed25519.pub, or the id_rsa.pub
file and edit <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sshd enforces a minimum RSA key
modulus size for protocol 1 and protocol 2 keys of 768
bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options (if present) consist
of comma-separated option specifications. No spaces are
permitted, except within double quotes. The following option
specifications are supported <br>
(note that option keywords are case-insensitive):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cert-authority <br>
Specifies that the listed key is a certification authority
(CA) that is trusted to validate signed certificates for
user authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certificates may encode access
restrictions similar to these key options. If both
certificate restrictions and key options are present, the
most restrictive union of the <br>
two is applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command=&quot;command&quot; <br>
Specifies that the command is executed whenever this key is
used for authentication. The command supplied by the user
(if any) is ignored. The command is run on a pty if <br>
the client requests a pty; otherwise it is run without a
tty. If an 8-bit clean channel is required, one must not
request a pty or should specify no-pty. A quote may be <br>
included in the command by quoting it with a backslash. This
option might be useful to restrict certain public keys to
perform just a specific operation. An example might <br>
be a key that permits remote backups but nothing else. Note
that the client may specify TCP and/or X11 forwarding unless
they are explicitly prohibited. The command orig&acirc; <br>
inally supplied by the client is available in the
SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND environment variable. Note that this
option applies to shell, command or subsystem execution.
Also <br>
note that this command may be superseded by either a
sshd_config(5) ForceCommand directive or a command embedded
in a certificate.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">environment=&quot;NAME=value&quot;
<br>
Specifies that the string is to be added to the environment
when logging in using this key. Environment variables set
this way override other default environment values. <br>
Multiple options of this type are permitted. Environment
processing is disabled by default and is controlled via the
PermitUserEnvironment option. This option is automat&acirc;
<br>
ically disabled if UseLogin is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from=&quot;pattern-list&quot;
<br>
Specifies that in addition to public key authentication,
either the canonical name of the remote host or its IP
address must be present in the comma-separated list of
pat&acirc; <br>
terns. See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on
patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the wildcard
matching that may be applied to hostnames or addresses, a
from stanza may match IP addresses using CIDR
address/masklen notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of this option is to
optionally increase security: public key authentication by
itself does not trust the network or name servers or
anything (but the key); <br>
however, if somebody somehow steals the key, the key permits
an intruder to log in from anywhere in the world. This
additional option makes using a stolen key more diffi&acirc;
<br>
cult (name servers and/or routers would have to be
compromised in addition to just the key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-agent-forwarding <br>
Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is
used for authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-port-forwarding <br>
Forbids TCP forwarding when this key is used for
authentication. Any port forward requests by the client will
return an error. This might be used, e.g. in connection with
<br>
the command option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-pty Prevents tty allocation
(a request to allocate a pty will fail).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-user-rc <br>
Disables execution of ~/.ssh/rc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-X11-forwarding <br>
Forbids X11 forwarding when this key is used for
authentication. Any X11 forward requests by the client will
return an error.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">permitopen=&quot;host:port&quot;
<br>
Limit local &lsquo;&lsquo;ssh -L&rsquo;&rsquo; port
forwarding such that it may only connect to the specified
host and port. IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing
the address in square <br>
brackets. Multiple permitopen options may be applied
separated by commas. No pattern matching is performed on the
specified hostnames, they must be literal domains or <br>
addresses. A port specification of * matches any port.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">principals=&quot;principals&quot;
<br>
On a cert-authority line, specifies allowed principals for
certificate authentication as a comma-separated list. At
least one name from the list must appear in the cer&acirc;
<br>
tificate&rsquo;s list of principals for the certificate to
be accepted. This option is ignored for keys that are not
marked as trusted certificate signers using the <br>
cert-authority option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tunnel=&quot;n&quot; <br>
Force a tun(4) device on the server. Without this option,
the next available device will be used if the client
requests a tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example authorized_keys

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS FILE FORMAT <br>
The /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts and ~/.ssh/known_hosts files
contain host public keys for all known hosts. The global
file should be prepared by the administrator (optional), and
the <br>
per-user file is maintained automatically: whenever the user
connects from an unknown host, its key is added to the
per-user file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in these files
contains the following fields: markers (optional),
hostnames, bits, exponent, modulus, comment. The fields are
separated by spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The marker is optional, but if
it is present then it must be one of
&acirc;@cert-authority&acirc;, to indicate that the line
contains a certification authority (CA) key, or
&acirc;@revoked&acirc;, to <br>
indicate that the key contained on the line is revoked and
must not ever be accepted. Only one marker should be used on
a key line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hostnames is a comma-separated
list of patterns (&acirc;*&acirc; and &acirc;?&acirc; act as
wildcards); each pattern in turn is matched against the
canonical host name (when authenticating a client) or <br>
against the user-supplied name (when authenticating a
server). A pattern may also be preceded by &acirc;!&acirc;
to indicate negation: if the host name matches a negated
pattern, it is not <br>
accepted (by that line) even if it matched another pattern
on the line. A hostname or address may optionally be
enclosed within &acirc;[&acirc; and &acirc;]&acirc; brackets
then followed by &acirc;:&acirc; and a <br>
non-standard port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternately, hostnames may be
stored in a hashed form which hides host names and addresses
should the file&rsquo;s contents be disclosed. Hashed
hostnames start with a &acirc;|&acirc; character. <br>
Only one hashed hostname may appear on a single line and
none of the above negation or wildcard operators may be
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bits, exponent, and modulus are
taken directly from the RSA host key; they can be obtained,
for example, from /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub. The optional
comment field continues to <br>
the end of the line, and is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines starting with
&acirc;#&acirc; and empty lines are ignored as comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing host
authentication, authentication is accepted if any matching
line has the proper key; either one that matches exactly or,
if the server has presented a certifi&acirc; <br>
cate for authentication, the key of the certification
authority that signed the certificate. For a key to be
trusted as a certification authority, it must use the <br>
&acirc;@cert-authority&acirc; marker described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The known hosts file also
provides a facility to mark keys as revoked, for example
when it is known that the associated private key has been
stolen. Revoked keys are specified by <br>
including the &acirc;@revoked&acirc; marker at the beginning
of the key line, and are never accepted for authentication
or as certification authorities, but instead will produce a
warning from <br>
ssh(1) when they are encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is permissible (but not
recommended) to have several lines or different host keys
for the same names. This will inevitably happen when short
forms of host names from different <br>
domains are put in the file. It is possible that the files
contain conflicting information; authentication is accepted
if valid information can be found from either file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the lines in these
files are typically hundreds of characters long, and you
definitely don&rsquo;t want to type in the host keys by
hand. Rather, generate them by a script, <br>
ssh-keyscan(1) or by taking /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub and
adding the host names at the front. ssh-keygen(1) also
offers some basic automated editing for ~/.ssh/known_hosts
includ&acirc; <br>
ing removing hosts matching a host name and converting all
host names to their hashed representations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.hushlogin <br>
This file is used to suppress printing the last login time
and /etc/motd, if PrintLastLog and PrintMotd, respectively,
are enabled. It does not suppress printing of the <br>
banner specified by Banner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.rhosts <br>
This file is used for host-based authentication (see ssh(1)
for more information). On some machines this file may need
to be world-readable if the user&rsquo;s home directory is
<br>
on an NFS partition, because sshd reads it as root.
Additionally, this file must be owned by the user, and must
not have write permissions for anyone else. The recom&acirc;
<br>
mended permission for most machines is read/write for the
user, and not accessible by others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.shosts <br>
This file is used in exactly the same way as .rhosts, but
allows host-based authentication without permitting login
with rlogin/rsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.k5login <br>
~/.k5users <br>
These files enforce GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication access
control. Further details are described in ksu(1). The
location of the k5login file depends on the configuration
<br>
option k5login_directory in the krb5.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/ <br>
This directory is the default location for all user-specific
configuration and authentication information. There is no
general requirement to keep the entire contents of <br>
this directory secret, but the recommended permissions are
read/write/execute for the user, and not accessible by
others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/authorized_keys <br>
Lists the public keys (DSA, ECDSA, ED25519, RSA) that can be
used for logging in as this user. The format of this file is
described above. The content of the file is not <br>
highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are
read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this file, the ~/.ssh
directory, or the user&rsquo;s home directory are writable
by other users, then the file could be modified or replaced
by unauthorized users. In this <br>
case, sshd will not allow it to be used unless the
StrictModes option has been set to &acirc;no&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/environment <br>
This file is read into the environment at login (if it
exists). It can only contain empty lines, comment lines
(that start with &acirc;#&acirc;), and assignment lines of
the form <br>
name=value. The file should be writable only by the user; it
need not be readable by anyone else. Environment processing
is disabled by default and is controlled via the <br>
PermitUserEnvironment option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/known_hosts <br>
Contains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has
logged into that are not already in the systemwide list of
known host keys. The format of this file is described <br>
above. This file should be writable only by root/the owner
and can, but need not be, world-readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/rc <br>
Contains initialization routines to be run before the
user&rsquo;s home directory becomes accessible. This file
should be writable only by the user, and need not be
readable by <br>
anyone else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/hosts.allow <br>
/etc/hosts.deny <br>
Access controls that should be enforced by tcp-wrappers are
defined here. Further details are described in
hosts_access(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/hosts.equiv <br>
This file is for host-based authentication (see ssh(1)). It
should only be writable by root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/moduli <br>
Contains Diffie-Hellman groups used for the
&quot;Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange&quot;. The file format
is described in moduli(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/motd <br>
See motd(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/nologin <br>
If this file exists, sshd refuses to let anyone except root
log in. The contents of the file are displayed to anyone
trying to log in, and non-root connections are <br>
refused. The file should be world-readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv <br>
This file is used in exactly the same way as hosts.equiv,
but allows host-based authentication without permitting
login with rlogin/rsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key <br>
These files contain the private parts of the host keys.
These files should only be owned by root, readable only by
root, and not accessible to others. Note that sshd does <br>
not start if these files are group/world-accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub <br>
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub <br>
These files contain the public parts of the host keys. These
files should be world-readable but writable only by root.
Their contents should match the respective private <br>
parts. These files are not really used for anything; they
are provided for the convenience of the user so their
contents can be copied to known hosts files. These files
<br>
are created using ssh-keygen(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts <br>
Systemwide list of known host keys. This file should be
prepared by the system administrator to contain the public
host keys of all machines in the organization. The
for&acirc; <br>
mat of this file is described above. This file should be
writable only by root/the owner and should be
world-readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/sshd_config <br>
Contains configuration data for sshd. The file format and
configuration options are described in sshd_config(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/sshrc <br>
Similar to ~/.ssh/rc, it can be used to specify
machine-specific login-time initializations globally. This
file should be writable only by root, and should be
world-read&acirc; <br>
able.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/empty/sshd <br>
chroot(2) directory used by sshd during privilege separation
in the pre-authentication phase. The directory should not
contain any files and must be owned by root and not <br>
group or world-writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/sshd.pid <br>
Contains the process ID of the sshd listening for
connections (if there are several daemons running
concurrently for different ports, this contains the process
ID of the <br>
one started last). The content of this file is not
sensitive; it can be world-readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG <br>
The reseeding of the OpenSSL random generator is usually
done from /dev/urandom. If the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG
environment variable is set to value other than 0 the
OpenSSL <br>
random generator is reseeded from /dev/random. The number of
bytes read is defined by the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG value.
Minimum is 14 bytes. This setting is not recommended <br>
on the computers without the hardware random generator
because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be
blocked until enough entropy is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPV6 <br>
IPv6 address can be used everywhere where IPv4 address. In
all entries must be the IPv6 address enclosed in square
brackets. Note: The square brackets are metacharacters for
the <br>
shell and must be escaped in shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12
release by Tatu Ylonen. Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus
Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed
many <br>
bugs, re-added newer features and created OpenSSH. Markus
Friedl contributed the support for SSH protocol versions 1.5
and 2.0. Niels Provos and Markus Friedl contributed support
<br>
for privilege separation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
System security is not improved unless rshd, rlogind, and
rexecd are disabled (thus completely disabling rlogin and
rsh into the machine).</p>
