<p>FOREMOST(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FOREMOST(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
foremost - Recover files using their headers, footers, and
data structures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
foremost [-h] [-V] [-d] [-vqwQT] [-b &lt;blocksize&gt;] [-o
&lt;dir&gt;] [-t &lt;type&gt;] [-s &lt;num&gt;] [-i
&lt;file&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILTIN FORMATS <br>
Recover files from a disk image based on file types
specified by the user using the -t switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpg Support for the JFIF and
Exif formats including implementations used in modern
digital cameras.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bmp Support for windows bmp
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exe Support for Windows PE
binaries, will extract DLL and EXE files along with their
compile times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpg Support for most MPEG files
(must begin with 0x000001BA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wav</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">riff This will extract AVI and
RIFF since they use the same file format (RIFF). note faster
than running each separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wmv Note may also extract wma
files as they have similar format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mov</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ole This will grab any file
using the OLE file structure. This includes PowerPoint,
Word, Excel, Access, and StarWriter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doc Note it is more efficient to
run OLE as you get more bang for your buck. If you wish to
ignore all other ole files then use this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zip Note is will extract .jar
files as well because they use a similar format. Open Office
docs are just zip&rsquo;d XML files so they are extracted as
well. These include SXW, <br>
SXC, SXI, and SX? for undetermined OpenOffice files. Office
2007 files are also XML based (PPTX,DOCX,XLSX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpp C source code detection,
note this is primitive and may generate documents other than
C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mp4 Support for MP4 files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Run all pre-defined
extraction methods. [Default if no -t is specified]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Recover files from a disk image based on headers and footers
specified by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show a help screen and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show copyright information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Turn on indirect block
detection, this works well for Unix file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Time stamp the output
directory so you don&rsquo;t have to delete the output dir
when running multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enables verbose mode. This
causes more information regarding the current state of the
program to be displayed on the screen, and is highly
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Enables quick mode. In quick
mode, only the start of each sector is searched for matching
headers. That is, the header is searched only up to the
length of the longest <br>
header. The rest of the sector, usually about 500 bytes, is
ignored. This mode makes foremost run considerably faster,
but it may cause you to miss files that are embedded <br>
in other files. For example, using quick mode you will not
be able to find JPEG images embedded in Microsoft Word
documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick mode should not be used
when examining NTFS file systems. Because NTFS will store
small files inside the Master File Table, these files will
be missed during quick <br>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Enables Quiet mode. Most
error messages will be suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Enables write audit only
mode. No files will be extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Enables write all headers,
perform no error detection in terms of corrupted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b number <br>
Allows you to specify the block size used in foremost. This
is relevant for file naming and quick searches. The default
is 512. ie. foremost -b 1024 image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k number <br>
Allows you to specify the chunk size used in foremost. This
can improve speed if you have enough RAM to fit the image
in. It reduces the checking that occurs between <br>
chunks of the buffer. For example if you had &gt; 500MB of
RAM. ie. foremost -k 500 image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file <br>
The file is used as the input file. If no input file is
specified or the input file cannot be read then stdin is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o directory <br>
Recovered files are written to the directory directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file <br>
Sets the configuration file to use. If none is specified,
the file &quot;foremost.conf&quot; from the current
directory is used, if that doesn&rsquo;t exist then
&quot;/etc/foremost.conf&quot; is <br>
used. The format for the configuration file is described in
the default configuration file included with this program.
See the CONFIGURATION FILE section below for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s number <br>
Skips number blocks in the input file before beginning the
search for headers. ie. foremost -s 512 -t jpeg -i
/dev/hda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file is used to control what types of
files foremost searches for. A sample configuration file,
foremost.conf, is included with this distribution. For <br>
each file type, the configuration file describes the
file&rsquo;s extension, whether the header and footer are
case sensitive, the maximum file size, and the header and
footer <br>
for the file. The footer field is optional, but header,
size, case sensitivity, and extension are not!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any line that begins with a
pound sign is considered a comment and ignored. Thus, to
skip a file type just put a pound sign at the beginning of
that line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Headers and footers are decoded
before use. To specify a value in hexadecimal use ][0-f],
and for octal use [1-9][1-9]. Spaces can be represented by
Exam&acirc; <br>
ple: &quot;F123II&quot; decodes to &quot;OSI CCI&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To match any single character
(aka a wildcard) use a ?. If you need to search for the ?
character, you will need to change the wildcard line *and*
every occurrence of the <br>
old wildcard character in the configuration file. Do not
forget those hex and octal values! ? is equal to f and
63.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a sample set of headers
in the README file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Search for jpeg format skipping the first 100 blocks <br>
foremost -s 100 -t jpg -i image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only generate an audit file, and
print to the screen (verbose mode) <br>
foremost -av image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search all defined types <br>
foremost -t all -i image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search for gif and pdf&rsquo;s
<br>
foremost -t gif,pdf -i image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search for office documents and
jpeg files in a Unix file system in verbose mode. <br>
foremost -vd -t ole,jpeg -i image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the default case <br>
foremost image.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Original Code written by Special Agent Kris Kendall and
Special Agent Jesse Kornblum of the United States Air Force
Office of Special Investigations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modification by Nick Mikus a
Research Associate at the Naval Postgraduate School Center
for Information Systems Security Studies and Research. The
modification of Foremost was <br>
part of a masters thesis at NPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When compiling foremost on systems with versions of glibc
2.1.x or older, you will get some (harmless) compiler
warnings regarding the implicit declaration of fseeko and
ftello. <br>
You can safely ignore these warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Because Foremost could be used to obtain evidence for
criminal prosecutions, we take all bug reports very
seriously. Any bug that jeopardizes the forensic integrity
of this pro&acirc; <br>
gram could have serious consequenses. When submitting a bug
report, please include a description of the problem, how you
