<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Auto manipulates automatically-keyed Libreswan IPsec
connections, setting them up and shutting them down based on
the information in the IPsec configuration file. In the
normal <br>
usage, connection is the name of a connection specification
in the configuration file; operation is --add, --delete,
--replace, --up, --down, --route, or --unroute. The --ready,
<br>
--rereadsecrets, --rereadgroups, and --statusoperations do
not take a connection name. Auto generates suitable commands
and feeds them to a shell for execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --add operation adds a
connection specification to the internal database within
pluto; it will fail if pluto already has a specification by
that name. The --delete operation <br>
deletes a connection specification from pluto&rsquo;s
internal database (also tearing down any connections based
on it); The --replace operation is equivalent to --delete
(if there is <br>
already a loaded connection by the given name) followed by
--add, and is a convenience for updating pluto&rsquo;s
internal specification to match an external one. (Note that
a <br>
--rereadsecrets may also be needed.) The --rereadgroups
operation causes any changes to the policy group files to
take effect (this is currently a synonym for --ready, but
that <br>
may change). None of the other operations alters the
internal database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --up operation asks pluto to
establish a connection based on an entry in its internal
database. The --down operation tells pluto to tear down such
a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, pluto establishes a
route to the destination specified for a connection as part
of the --up operation. However, the route (for KLIPS) and
packet capture (KLIPS and <br>
NETKEY) can be established with the --route operation. Until
and unless an actual connection is established, this
discards any packets sent there, which may be preferable to
<br>
having them sent elsewhere based on a more general route
(e.g., a default route).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, pluto&rsquo;s route
(KLIPS) or packet capture (NETKEY) to a destination remains
in place when a --down operation is used to take the
connection down (or if connection setup, <br>
or later automatic rekeying, fails). This permits
establishing a new connection (perhaps using a different
specification; the route is altered as necessary) without
having a <br>
&acirc;window&acirc; in which packets might go elsewhere
based on a more general route. Such a route can be removed
using the --unroute operation (and is implicitly removed by
--delete).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --ready operation tells
pluto to listen for connection-setup requests from other
hosts. Doing an --up operation before doing --ready on both
ends is futile and will not work, <br>
although this is now automated as part of IPsec startup and
should not normally be an issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --status operation asks
pluto for current connection status. The output format is
ad-hoc and likely to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --rereadsecrets operation
tells pluto to re-read the /etc/ipsec.secrets secret-keys
file, which it normally reads only at startup time. (This is
currently a synonym for <br>
--ready, but that may change.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --rereadsecrets operation
tells pluto to re-read the /etc/ipsec.secrets secret-keys
file, which it normally reads only at startup time. (This is
currently a synonym for <br>
--ready, but that may change.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --rereadcacerts operation
reads all certificate files contained in the
/etc/ipsec.d/cacerts directory and adds them to
pluto&rsquo;s list of Certification Authority (CA) <br>
certificates. Note CA certificates can and should be stored
inside NSS instead of in the /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts directory
which will result in automatic updates. This option will
<br>
be obsoleted in the near future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --rereadcrls operation reads
all certificate revocation list (CRL) files contained in the
/etc/ipsec.d/crls directory and adds them to pluto&rsquo;s
list of CRLs. Note CRLs can and <br>
should be stored inside NSS instead of in the
/etc/ipsec.d/crls directory which will result in automatic
updates. This option will be obsoleted in the near
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --rereadall operation is
equivalent to the execution of --rereadsecrets,
--rereadcacerts and --rereadcrls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --listpubkeys operation
lists all RSA public keys either received from peers via the
IKE protocol embedded in authenticated certificate payloads
or loaded locally using the <br>
rightcert / leftcert or rightr- sasigkey / leftrsasigkey
parameters in ipsec.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --listcerts operation lists
all X.509 certificates loaded locally using the rightcert
and leftcert parameters in ipsec.conf(5). To see all
certificates in the NSS database, <br>
use certutil -d /etc/ipsec.d -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --checkpubkeys operation
lists all loaded X.509 certificates which are about to
expire or have been expired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --listcacerts operation
lists all X.509 CA certificates contained in the NSS
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --listgroups operation lists
all groups that are either used in connection definitions in
ipsec.conf(5) or are embedded in loaded X.509 attributes
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --listcrls operation lists
all Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) either loaded
locally from the /etc/ipsec.d/crls directory or fetched
dynamically from an HTTP or LDAP <br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --listall operation is
equivalent to the execution of --listpubkeys, --listcerts,
--listcacerts, --listgroups, --listcrls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --purgeocsp operation
displays --listall and purges the NSS OCSP cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --showonly option causes
auto to show the commands it would run, on standard output,
and not run them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --asynchronous option,
applicable only to the up operation, tells pluto to attempt
to establish the connection, but does not delay to report
results. This is especially <br>
useful to start multiple connections in parallel when
network links are slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --verbose option instructs
auto to pass through all output from ipsec_whack(8),
including log output that is normally filtered out as
uninteresting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --config option specifies a
non-standard location for the IPsec configuration file
(default /etc/ipsec.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See ipsec.conf(5) for details of
the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/ipsec.conf default IPSEC configuration file <br>
/etc/ipsec.d/ X.509 and Opportunistic Encryption files <br>
/var/run/pluto/pluto.ctl Pluto command socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Originally written for the FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Although an --up operation does connection setup on both
ends, --down tears only one end of the connection down
(although the orphaned end will eventually time out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no support for
passthrough connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A connection description which
uses %defaultroute for one of its nexthop parameters but not
the other may be falsely rejected as erroneous in some
circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status of --showonly
does not always reflect errors discovered during processing
of the request. (This is fine for human inspection, but not
so good for use in scripts.)</p>
