sg_senddiag - performs a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

[-v] [-V] [-?] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility sends a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command to the
DEVICE. It can issue self-tests, find supported diagnostic
pages or send arbitrary diagnostic pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --list option and a
DEVICE are given then the utility sends a SCSI RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command to fetch the response (i.e. the
page numbers of supported diagnos&acirc; <br>
tic pages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --list option is given
without a DEVICE then a list of diagnostic page names and
their numbers, known by this utility, are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility supports two
command line syntax-es, the preferred one is shown first in
the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section
on the old command line syntax <br>
outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --doff <br>
set the Device Offline (DevOffL) bit (default is clear).
Only significant when --test option is set for the default
self-test. When set other operations on any logical <br>
units controlled by the this device server (target) may be
affected (delayed) while a default self-test is
underway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --extdur <br>
outputs the expected extended self-test duration. The
duration is given in seconds (and minutes in parentheses).
This figure is obtained from mode page 0xa (i.e. the
con&acirc; <br>
trol mode page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in hex
rather than decode it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
when a DEVICE is also given lists the names of all
diagnostic pages supported by this device. The request is
sent via a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command (with the &quot;pF&quot;
bit set) and <br>
the response is fetched by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
command. When used in the absence of a --list argument then
a list of diagnostic page names and their numbers, <br>
known by this utility, are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --old <br>
switch to older style options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pf <br>
set Page Format (PF) bit. By default it is clear (i.e. 0)
unless the list --list option is given in which case the
Page Format bit is set (as required by SPC-3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw=H,H... <br>
string of comma separated hex numbers each of which should
resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). A (single)
space separated string of hex bytes is also allowed <br>
but the list needs to be in quotes. This sequence forms a
diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC
command. Mostly likely the --pf option should also be <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw=- <br>
reads sequence of bytes from stdin. The sequence may be
comma, space, tab or linefeed (newline) separated. If a line
contains &quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters on that
<br>
line are ignored. Otherwise each non separator character
should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive).
This sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent with the
<br>
SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the --pf option
should also be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --selftest=ST <br>
where ST is the self-test code. The default value is 0 which
is inactive. Some other values: <br>
1 : background short self-test <br>
2 : background extended self-test <br>
4 : aborts a (background) self-test that is in progress <br>
5 : foreground short self-test <br>
6 : foreground extended self-test <br>
This option is mutually exclusive with default self-test
(i.e. can&rsquo;t have (ST &gt; 0) and --test).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --test <br>
sets the _default_ Self Test (SelfTest) bit. By default this
is clear (0). The --selftest=ST option should not be active
together with this option. Both the --doff and/or <br>
--uoff options can be used with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --uoff <br>
set the Unit Offline (UnitOffL) bit (default is clear). Only
significant when --test option is set for the default
self-test. When set other operations on this logical <br>
unit may be affected (delayed) while a default self-test is
underway. Some devices (e.g. Fujitsu disks) do more tests
when this bit is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print out version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
All devices should support the default self-test. The
&rsquo;short&rsquo; self-test codes should complete in 2
minutes or less. The &rsquo;extended&rsquo; self-test
codes&rsquo; maximum duration is vendor <br>
specific (e.g. a little over 10 minutes with the
author&rsquo;s disks). The foreground self-test codes wait
until they are completed while the background self-test
codes return immedi&acirc; <br>
ately. The results of both foreground and background
self-test codes are placed in the &rsquo;self-test
results&rsquo; log page (see sg_logs(8)). The SCSI command
timeout for this utility is <br>
set to 60 minutes to allow for slow foreground extended
self-tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the DEVICE is a disk then no
file systems residing on that disk should be mounted during
a foreground self-test. The reason is that other SCSI
commands may become queued <br>
behind the foreground self-test and timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --raw=H,H... option is
given then self-tests should not be selected. However the
--pf (i.e. &quot;page format&quot;) option should be given.
The length of the diagnostic page to <br>
be sent is derived from the number of bytes given to the
--raw=H,H... option. The diagnostic page code (number)
should be the first byte of the sequence (i.e. as dictated
by <br>
SPC-3 diagnostic page format). See the EXAMPLES section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arbitrary diagnostic pages can
be read (in hex) with the sg_ses(8) utility (not only those
defined in SES-2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the utility is used with no
options (e.g. &quot;sg_senddiag /dev/sg1&quot;) Then a
degenerate SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command is sent with zero in
all its fields apart from the opcode. <br>
Some devices report this as an error while others ignore it.
It is not entirely clear from SPC-3 if it is invalid to send
such a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 2.4 series of Linux
kernels the DEVICE must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In
the 2.6 series block devices (e.g. SCSI disks and DVD
drives) can also be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To access SCSI enclosures see
the sg_ses(8) utility. sg_ses uses the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC
and RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS commands as outlined in the
SES-2 (draft) standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_senddiag is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The options in this section were the only ones available
prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23
and later these older options can be selected by either
set&acirc; <br>
ting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
&rsquo;--old&rsquo; (or &rsquo;-O) as the first option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-doff set the Device Offline
(DevOffL) bit (default is clear). Only significant when -t
option is set for the default self-test. Equivalent to
--doff in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e outputs the expected extended
self-test duration. Equivalent to --extdur in the main
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h outputs response from RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in hex rather than decode it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H outputs response from RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in hex rather than decode it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l when a DEVICE is also given
lists the names of all diagnostic pages supported by this
device. The request is sent via a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command
(with the &quot;pf&quot; bit set) and <br>
the response is fetched by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
command. When used in the absence of a DEVICE argument then
a list of diagnostic page names and their numbers, <br>
known by this utility, are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N switch to the newer style
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pf set Page Format (PF) bit. By
default it is clear (i.e. 0) unless the -l option is given
in which case the Page Format bit is set (as required by
SPC-3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-raw=H,H... <br>
string of comma separated hex numbers each of which should
resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). This
sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI
<br>
SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the -pf option should
also be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-raw=- reads sequence of bytes
from stdin. The sequence may be comma, space, tab or
linefeed (newline) separated. If a line contains
&quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters on that <br>
line are ignored. Otherwise each non separator character
should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive).
This sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent with the
<br>
SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the -pf option
should also be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s=ST where ST is the self-test
code. The default value is 0 which is inactive. A value of 1
selects a background short self-test; 2 selects a background
extended self-test; 5 <br>
selects a foreground short self-test; 6 selects a foreground
extended test. A value of 4 will abort a (background)
self-test that is in progress. This option is mutually <br>
exclusive with default self-test (i.e. -t).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t sets the _default_ Self Test
(SelfTest) bit. By default this is clear (0). The -s=ST
option should not be active together with this option. Both
the -doff and/or -uoff <br>
options can be used with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-uoff set the Unit Offline
(UnitOffL) bit (default is clear). Equivalent to --uoff in
the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v increase level of verbosity.
Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print out version string then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? output usage message. Ignore
all other parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The examples sub-directory in the sg3_utils packages
contains two example scripts that turn on the CJTPAT (jitter
pattern) on some SAS disks (one script for each phy). One
possi&acirc; <br>
ble invocation for phy 1 is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_senddiag --pf --raw=-
/dev/sg2 &lt; sdiag_sas_p1_cjtpat.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also an example script
that turns on the IDLE pattern. Once a test pattern has been
started it can be turned off by resetting the phy or with
the STOP phy pattern func&acirc; <br>
tion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_senddiag --pf --raw=-
/dev/sg2 &lt; sdiag_sas_p1_stop.txt</p>
