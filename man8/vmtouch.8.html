<p>VMTOUCH(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual VMTOUCH(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vmtouch - the Virtual Memory Toucher</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vmtouch [OPTIONS] ... FILES OR DIRECTORIES ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Portable file system cache diagnostics and control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vmtouch opens every file
provided on the command line and maps it into virtual memory
with mmap(2). The mappings are opened read-only. It
recursively crawls any directories and <br>
does the same to all files it finds within them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no options, vmtouch will
not read from (touch) any memory pages. It will only use
mincore(2) to determine how many pages of each file are
actually resident in memory. <br>
Before exiting, it will print a summary of the total pages
encountered and how many were resident.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Touch virtual memory pages.
Reads a byte from each page of the file. If the page is not
resident in memory, a page fault will be generated and the
page will be read from disk <br>
into the file system&rsquo;s memory cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Although each page is
guaranteed to have been brought into memory, the page might
be evicted from memory by the time the vmtouch command
completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Evict the mapped pages from
the file system cache. They will need to be read in from
disk the next time they are accessed. This is the inverse of
&quot;-t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Even if the eviction is
successful, pages may be paged back into memory by the time
the vmtouch command completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This option is not
portable to all systems. See PORTABILITY below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Lock pages into physical
memory. This option works the same as &quot;-t&quot; except
it calls mlock(2) on all the memory mappings and
doesn&rsquo;t close the descriptors when finished. At <br>
the end of the crawl, if successful, vmtouch will block
indefinitely. The files will be locked in physical memory
until the vmtouch process is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: While the vmtouch process
is holding memory locks, any processes that access the
locked pages will not cause non-resident page faults or
address-translation faults <br>
although they may still cause TLB misses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Because vmtouch holds file
descriptors open it may reach the &quot;RLIMIT_NOFILE&quot;
process file descriptor limit. In this case it will try to
increase the descriptor limit <br>
which will only work if the process is run with root
privileges. Similarly, root privileges are required to
exceed the &quot;RLIMIT_MEMLOCK&quot; limit. Even with root
privileges, &quot;-l&quot; <br>
is limited by both the system file descriptor limit and the
system limit on &quot;wired memory&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L This option is the same as
&quot;-l&quot; except that it uses mlockall(2) at the end of
the crawl rather than individually mlock(2)ing each file.
Because of this, other unrelated pages <br>
belonging to the vmtouch process will also be locked in
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Daemon mode. After performing
the crawl, disassociate from the terminal and run in the
background as a daemon. This option can only be used with
the &quot;-l&quot; or &quot;-L&quot; locking <br>
modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;max file size&gt; <br>
Maximum file size to map into virtual memory. Files that are
larger than this will be skipped. Examples: 4096, 4k, 100M,
1.5G. The default is 500M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;size range&gt; or
&lt;size&gt; <br>
Page mode. Maps the portion of the file specified by a range
instead of the entire file. Size format same as for
&quot;-m&quot;. Omitted range start (end) value means start
(end) of <br>
file. Single &lt;size&gt; value is equivalent to
-&lt;size&gt;, i.e. map the first &lt;size&gt; bytes.
Examples: 4k-50k, 100M-2G, -5M, -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Follow symbolic links. With
this option, vmtouch will descend into symbolic links that
point to directories and will touch regular files pointed to
by symbolic links. <br>
Symbolic link loops are detected and issue warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. While crawling,
print out every file being processed along with its total
number of pages and the number of its pages that are
currently resident in memory to <br>
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode. Suppress the end
of crawl summary and all warnings that are normally printed
to standard error. On success print nothing. Fatal errors
print a single error <br>
message line to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Normally, if multiple files
both point to the same inode then vmtouch will ignore all
but the first it finds so as to avoid double-counting their
pages. This option overrides <br>
this behaviour and double-counts anyways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTABILITY <br>
The page residency summaries depend on mincore(2) which
first appeared in 4.4BSD but is not present on all unix
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-l&quot; and
&quot;-L&quot; locking options depends on mlock(2) or
mlockall(2), both of which are specified by POSIX.1b-1993,
Real-Time Extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-e&quot; page eviction
option is the least portable. On Linux it uses
posix_fadvise(2) with &quot;POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED&quot; advice
to inform the kernel that the file should be evicted from
<br>
the file system cache. posix_fadvise(2) is specified by
POSIX.1-2003 TC1. On FreeBSD, the pages are invalidated with
msync(2)&rsquo;s &quot;MS_INVALIDATE&quot; flag. msync(2) is
specified by <br>
POSIX.1b-1993, Real-Time Extensions, although this call is
not required to remove pages from the file system cache.
Some systems like OpenBSD 4.3 don&rsquo;t have
posix_fadvise(2), <br>
don&rsquo;t evict the pages on an
msync(2)/&quot;MS_INVALIDATE&quot;, and don&rsquo;t evict
the pages with madvise(2)/&quot;MADV_DONTNEED&quot; so
&quot;-e&quot; isn&rsquo;t supported on those systems yet.
Using &quot;-e&quot; on <br>
systems that don&rsquo;t yet support it is a fatal
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED SYSTEMS <br>
All vmtouch features have been confirmed to work on the
following systems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux 2.6+ <br>
FreeBSD 4.X <br>
FreeBSD 7.X <br>
Solaris 10 <br>
OS X 10.x <br>
HP-UX 11.31+patches (see below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systems that support everything
except eviction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenBSD 4.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPUs that have been tested:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x86 <br>
amd64 (x86-64) <br>
SPARC <br>
ARMv7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We would like to support as many
systems as possible so please send us any success reports,
failure reports or patches. Thanks!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM NOTES <br>
Shane Seymour did the HP-UX port and says that either 32-bit
or 64-bit binaries can be compiled (just use
&quot;+DD64&quot; for 64-bit). However, mincore(2) was added
to HP-UX 11.31 via <br>
patches and at least the following patches need to be
installed: PHKL_38651, PHKL_38708, PHKL_38686, PHKL_38688,
and PHCO_38658 (or patches that supersede those ones).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
Not all the following manual pages may exist in every unix
dialect to which vmtouch has been ported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vmstat(8), touch(1), mmap(2),
mincore(2), mlock(2), mlockall(2), msync(2), madvise(2),
posix_fadvise(2)</p>
