    vmtouch [OPTIONS] ... FILES OR DIRECTORIES ...
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Portable file system cache diagnostics and control.
<div class="Pp"></div>
vmtouch opens every file provided on the command line and maps it into virtual
  memory with mmap(2). The mappings are opened read-only. It recursively crawls
  any directories and does the same to all files it finds within them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With no options, vmtouch will not read from (touch) any memory pages. It will
  only use mincore(2) to determine how many pages of each file are actually
  resident in memory. Before exiting, it will print a summary of the total pages
  encountered and how many were resident.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-t</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Touch virtual memory pages. Reads a byte from each page of
      the file. If the page is not resident in memory, a page fault will be
      generated and the page will be read from disk into the file system's
      memory cache.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: Although each page is guaranteed to have been brought into memory, the
      page might be evicted from memory by the time the vmtouch command
      completes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-e</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Evict the mapped pages from the file system cache. They
      will need to be read in from disk the next time they are accessed. This is
      the inverse of &quot;-t&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: Even if the eviction is successful, pages may be paged back into
      memory by the time the vmtouch command completes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: This option is not portable to all systems. See PORTABILITY
    below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-l</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Lock pages into physical memory. This option works the same
      as &quot;-t&quot; except it calls mlock(2) on all the memory mappings and
      doesn't close the descriptors when finished. At the end of the crawl, if
      successful, vmtouch will block indefinitely. The files will be locked in
      physical memory until the vmtouch process is killed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: While the vmtouch process is holding memory locks, any processes that
      access the locked pages will not cause non-resident page faults or
      address-translation faults although they may still cause TLB misses.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: Because vmtouch holds file descriptors open it may reach the
      &quot;RLIMIT_NOFILE&quot; process file descriptor limit. In this case it
      will try to increase the descriptor limit which will only work if the
      process is run with root privileges. Similarly, root privileges are
      required to exceed the &quot;RLIMIT_MEMLOCK&quot; limit. Even with root
      privileges, &quot;-l&quot; is limited by both the system file descriptor
      limit and the system limit on &quot;wired memory&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-L</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is the same as &quot;-l&quot; except that it
      uses mlockall(2) at the end of the crawl rather than individually
      mlock(2)ing each file. Because of this, other unrelated pages belonging to
      the vmtouch process will also be locked in memory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-d</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Daemon mode. After performing the crawl, disassociate from
      the terminal and run in the background as a daemon. This option can only
      be used with the &quot;-l&quot; or &quot;-L&quot; locking modes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-m &lt;max file size&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Maximum file size to map into virtual memory. Files that
      are larger than this will be skipped. Examples: 4096, 4k, 100M, 1.5G. The
      default is 500M.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-p &lt;size range&gt; or &lt;size&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Page mode. Maps the portion of the file specified by a
      range instead of the entire file. Size format same as for &quot;-m&quot;.
      Omitted range start (end) value means start (end) of file. Single
      &lt;size&gt; value is equivalent to -&lt;size&gt;, i.e. map the first
      &lt;size&gt; bytes. Examples: 4k-50k, 100M-2G, -5M, -.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-f</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Follow symbolic links. With this option, vmtouch will
      descend into symbolic links that point to directories and will touch
      regular files pointed to by symbolic links. Symbolic link loops are
      detected and issue warnings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-v</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Verbose mode. While crawling, print out every file being
      processed along with its total number of pages and the number of its pages
      that are currently resident in memory to standard output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-q</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Quiet mode. Suppress the end of crawl summary and all
      warnings that are normally printed to standard error. On success print
      nothing. Fatal errors print a single error message line to standard
    error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-h</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally, if multiple files both point to the same inode
      then vmtouch will ignore all but the first it finds so as to avoid
      double-counting their pages. This option overrides this behaviour and
      double-counts anyways.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="selflink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
The page residency summaries depend on mincore(2) which first appeared in 4.4BSD
  but is not present on all unix systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-l&quot; and &quot;-L&quot; locking options depends on mlock(2) or
  mlockall(2), both of which are specified by POSIX.1b-1993, Real-Time
  Extensions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-e&quot; page eviction option is the least portable. On Linux it uses
  posix_fadvise(2) with &quot;POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED&quot; advice to inform the
  kernel that the file should be evicted from the file system cache.
  posix_fadvise(2) is specified by POSIX.1-2003 TC1. On FreeBSD, the pages are
  invalidated with msync(2)'s &quot;MS_INVALIDATE&quot; flag. msync(2) is
  specified by POSIX.1b-1993, Real-Time Extensions, although this call is not
  required to remove pages from the file system cache. Some systems like OpenBSD
  4.3 don't have posix_fadvise(2), don't evict the pages on an
  msync(2)/&quot;MS_INVALIDATE&quot;, and don't evict the pages with
  madvise(2)/&quot;MADV_DONTNEED&quot; so &quot;-e&quot; isn't supported on
  those systems yet. Using &quot;-e&quot; on systems that don't yet support it
  is a fatal error.

Shane Seymour did the HP-UX port and says that either 32-bit or 64-bit binaries
  can be compiled (just use &quot;+DD64&quot; for 64-bit). However, mincore(2)
  was added to HP-UX 11.31 via patches and at least the following patches need
  to be installed: PHKL_38651, PHKL_38708, PHKL_38686, PHKL_38688, and
  PHCO_38658 (or patches that supersede those ones).
