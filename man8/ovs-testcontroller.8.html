<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ovs-testcontroller - simple OpenFlow controller for
testing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ovs-testcontroller [options] method [method]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ovs-testcontroller is a simple OpenFlow controller that
manages any number of switches over the OpenFlow protocol,
causing them to function as L2 MAC-learning switches or
hubs. <br>
It is suitable for initial testing of OpenFlow networks. It
is not a necessary or desirable part of a production
OpenFlow deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-testcontroller controls one
or more OpenFlow switches, specified as one or more of the
following OpenFlow connection methods:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssl:[port][:ip] <br>
ptcp:[port][:ip] <br>
Listens for OpenFlow connections on port. The default port
is 6653. By default, connections are allowed from any IPv4
address. Specify ip as an IPv4 address or a <br>
bracketed IPv6 address (e.g. ptcp:6653:[::1]). DNS names may
not be used. For pssl, the --private-key,--certificate, and
--ca-cert options are mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punix:file <br>
Listens for OpenFlow connections on the Unix domain server
socket named file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl:ip[:port] <br>
tcp:ip[:port] <br>
The specified port on the host at the given ip, which must
be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4 or
IPv6 address format. Wrap IPv6 addresses in <br>
square brackets, e.g. tcp:[::1]:6653. For ssl, the
--private-key, --certificate, and --ca-cert options are
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If port is not specified, it
defaults to 6653.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:file <br>
On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a local
named pipe that is represented by a file created in the path
file to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n <br>
--noflow <br>
By default, ovs-testcontroller sets up a flow in each
OpenFlow switch whenever it receives a packet whose
destination is known due through MAC learning. This option
dis&acirc; <br>
ables flow setup, so that every packet in the network passes
through the controller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is most useful for
debugging. It reduces switching performance, so it should
not be used in production.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-idle=secs|permanent <br>
Sets secs as the number of seconds that a flow set up by the
controller will remain in the switch&rsquo;s flow table
without any matching packets being seen. If permanent is
<br>
specified, which is not recommended, flows will never
expire. The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect when
-n (or --noflow) is in use (because the controller does not
set up flows in that case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H <br>
--hub By default, the controller acts as an L2 MAC-learning
switch. This option changes its behavior to that of a hub
that floods packets on all but the incoming port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -H (or --hub) and -n (or
--noflow) are used together, then the cumulative effect is
that every packet passes through the controller and every
packet is flooded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is most useful for
debugging. It reduces switching performance, so it should
not be used in production.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w[wildcard_mask] <br>
--wildcards[=wildcard_mask] <br>
By default, ovs-testcontroller sets up exact-match flows.
This option allows it to set up wildcarded flows, which may
reduce flow setup latency by causing less traffic to <br>
be sent up to the controller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional wildcard_mask is an
OpenFlow wildcard bitmask in hexadecimal that specifies the
fields to wildcard. If no wildcard_mask is specified, the
default value <br>
0x2820F0 is used which specifies L2-only switching and
wildcards L3 and L4 fields. Another interesting value is
0x2000EC, which specifies L3-only switching and wildcards
<br>
L2 and L4 fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect when
-n (or --noflow) is in use (because the controller does not
set up flows in that case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N <br>
--normal <br>
By default, ovs-testcontroller directs packets to a
particular port or floods them. This option causes it to
direct non-flooded packets to the OpenFlow OFPP_NORMAL port.
<br>
This allows the switch itself to make decisions about packet
destinations. Support for OFPP_NORMAL is optional in
OpenFlow, so this option may not well with some non-Open
<br>
vSwitch switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mute Prevents
ovs-testcontroller from replying to any OpenFlow messages
sent to it by switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only for
debugging the Open vSwitch implementation of
&lsquo;&lsquo;fail open&rsquo;&rsquo; mode. It must not be
used in production.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q id <br>
--queue=id <br>
By default, ovs-testcontroller uses the default OpenFlow
queue for sending packets and setting up flows. Use one of
these options, supplying id as an OpenFlow queue ID as <br>
a decimal number, to instead use that specific queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is incompatible with
-N or --normal and with -H or --hub. If more than one is
specified then this option takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be useful for
testing or debugging quality of service setups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q port-name:queue-id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--port-queue port-name:queue-id
<br>
Configures packets received on the port named port-name
(e.g. eth0) to be output on OpenFlow queue ID queue-id
(specified as a decimal number). For the specified port,
<br>
this option overrides the default specified on -q or
--queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be specified any
number of times with different port-name arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is incompatible with
-N or --normal and with -H or --hub. If more than one is
specified then this option takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be useful for
testing or debugging quality of service setups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-flows file <br>
When a switch connects, push the flow entries as described
in file. Each line in file is a flow entry in the format
described for the add-flows command in the Flow Syntax <br>
section of the ovs-ofctl(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option more than once
to add flows from multiple files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public Key Infrastructure
Options <br>
-p privkey.pem <br>
--private-key=privkey.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
ovs-testcontroller&rsquo;s identity for outgoing SSL
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cert.pem <br>
--certificate=cert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies
the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the <br>
certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections
will use to verify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cacert.pem <br>
--ca-cert=cacert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
ovs-testcontroller should use to verify certificates
presented to it by SSL peers. (This may be the same
certifi&acirc; <br>
cate that SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified
on -c or --certificate, or it may be a different one,
depending on the PKI design in use.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C none <br>
--ca-cert=none <br>
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
peers. This introduces a security risk, because it means
that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
<br>
trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--peer-ca-cert=peer-cacert.pem
<br>
Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional
certificates to send to SSL peers. peer-cacert.pem should be
the CA certificate used to sign ovs-testcon&acirc; <br>
troller&rsquo;s own certificate, that is, the certificate
specified on -c or --certificate. If
ovs-testcontroller&rsquo;s certificate is self-signed, then
--certificate and <br>
--peer-ca-cert should specify the same file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not useful in
normal operation, because the SSL peer must already have the
CA certificate for the peer to have any confidence in
ovs-testcontroller&rsquo;s iden&acirc; <br>
tity. However, this offers a way for a new installation to
bootstrap the CA certificate on its first SSL connection.
The following options are valid on POSIX based plat&acirc;
<br>
forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile[=pidfile] <br>
Causes a file (by default, ovs-testcontroller.pid) to be
created indicating the PID of the running process. If the
pidfile argument is not specified, or if it does not <br>
begin with /, then it is created in
/var/run/openvswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --pidfile is not specified,
no pidfile is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overwrite-pidfile <br>
By default, when --pidfile is specified and the specified
pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process,
ovs-testcontroller refuses to start. Specify --over&acirc;
<br>
write-pidfile to cause it to instead overwrite the
pidfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --pidfile is not specified,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach <br>
Runs ovs-testcontroller as a background process. The process
forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes the
standard file descriptors (which has the side <br>
effect of disabling logging to the console), and changes its
current directory to the root (unless --no-chdir is
specified). After the child completes its initialization,
<br>
the parent exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--monitor <br>
Creates an additional process to monitor the
ovs-testcontroller daemon. If the daemon dies due to a
signal that indicates a programming error (SIGABRT, SIGALRM,
SIGBUS, <br>
SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGPIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ) then
the monitor process starts a new copy of it. If the daemon
dies or exits for another reason, the monitor <br>
process exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is normally used
with --detach, but it also functions without it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-chdir <br>
By default, when --detach is specified, ovs-testcontroller
changes its current working directory to the root directory
after it detaches. Otherwise, invoking ovs-testcon&acirc;
<br>
troller from a carelessly chosen directory would prevent the
administrator from unmounting the file system that holds
that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying --no-chdir suppresses
this behavior, preventing ovs-testcontroller from changing
its current working directory. This may be useful for
collecting core files, <br>
since it is common behavior to write core dumps into the
current working directory and the root directory is not a
good directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect when
--detach is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-self-confinement <br>
By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to work
with files under well-know, at build-time whitelisted
directories. It is better to stick with this default <br>
behavior and not to use this flag unless some other Access
Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
other access control implementations that are typi&acirc;
<br>
cally enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC),
self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
itself and hence should not be considered as a full
confinement <br>
strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional
layer of security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user Causes ovs-testcontroller
to run as a different user specified in
&quot;user:group&quot;, thus dropping most of the root
privileges. Short forms &quot;user&quot; and
&quot;:group&quot; are also <br>
allowed, with current user or group are assumed
respectively. Only daemons started by the root user accepts
this argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, daemons will be
granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before
dropping root privileges. Daemons that interact with a
datapath, such as ovs-vswitchd, will <br>
be granted two additional capabilities, namely CAP_NET_ADMIN
and CAP_NET_RAW. The capability change will apply even if
new user is &quot;root&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, this option is not
currently supported. For security reasons, specifying this
option will cause the daemon process not to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[spec] <br>
--verbose=[spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively. (If
--detach is specified, ovs-test&acirc; <br>
controller closes its standard file descriptors, so logging
to the console will have no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be fil&acirc; <br>
tered out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8)
for a definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
--log-file is also specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
--verbose=dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vPATTERN:destination:pattern
<br>
--verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vFACILITY:facility <br>
--verbose=FACILITY:facility <br>
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can
be one of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, <br>
local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
local7. If this option is not specified, daemon is used as
the default for the local system syslog and local0 is <br>
used while sending a message to the target provided via the
--syslog-target option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file[=file] <br>
Enables logging to a file. If file is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
file name used if file is omitted is /var/log/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/ovs-testcontroller.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-target=host:port <br>
Send syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the
system syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-method=method <br>
Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog
daemon. Following forms are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libc, use libc
syslog() function. This is the default behavior. Downside of
using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actu&acirc; <br>
ally sent to the syslog daemon over /dev/log UNIX domain
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file, use
UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify
arbitrary message format with this option. However, rsyslogd
8.9 and older versions use hard <br>
coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket
use. If you want to use arbitrary message format with older
rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to <br>
localhost IP address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; udp:ip:port, use
UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary
message format also with older rsyslogd. When sending syslog
messages over UDP <br>
socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for
example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
the specified UDP port, accidental iptables <br>
rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and
there are some security considerations that apply to UDP
sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unixctl=socket <br>
Sets the name of the control socket on which
ovs-testcontroller listens for runtime management commands
(see RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS, below). If socket does not
begin <br>
with /, it is interpreted as relative to
/var/run/openvswitch. If --unixctl is not used at all, the
default socket is
/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-testcontroller.pid.ctl, <br>
where pid is ovs-testcontroller&rsquo;s process ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows a local named pipe is
used to listen for runtime management commands. A file is
created in the absolute path as pointed by socket or if
--unixctl is not used <br>
at all, a file is created as ovs-testcontroller.ctl in the
configured OVS_RUNDIR directory. The file exists just to
mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying none for socket
disables the control socket feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints version information to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O [version[,version]...] <br>
--protocols=[version[,version]...] <br>
Sets the OpenFlow protocol versions that are allowed when
establishing an OpenFlow session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following versions are
considered to be ready for general use. These protocol
versions are enabled by default:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; OpenFlow10, for
OpenFlow 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for the following
protocol versions is provided for testing and development
purposes. They are not enabled by default:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; OpenFlow11, for
OpenFlow 1.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; OpenFlow12, for
OpenFlow 1.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; OpenFlow13, for
OpenFlow 1.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To bind locally to port 6653 (the default) and wait for
incoming connections from OpenFlow switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ovs-testcontroller ptcp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Configuring a Citrix XenServer to connect to a particular
controller only points the remote OVSDB management
connection to that controller. It does not also configure
OpenFlow <br>
connections, because the manager is expected to do that over
the management protocol. ovs-testcontroller is not an Open
vSwitch manager and does not know how to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a stopgap workaround,
ovs-vsctl can wait for an OVSDB connection and set the
controller, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ovs-vsctl -t0 --db=pssl:
--certificate=cert.pem --ca-cert=none
--private-key=privkey.pem --peer-ca-cert=cacert.pem
set-controller ssl:ip</p>
