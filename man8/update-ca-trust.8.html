<p>UPDATE-CA-TRUST(8) UPDATE-CA-TRUST(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
update-ca-trust - manage consolidated and dynamic
configuration of CA certificates and associated trust</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
update-ca-trust [COMMAND]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
update-ca-trust(8) is used to manage a consolidated and
dynamic configuration feature of Certificate Authority (CA)
certificates and associated trust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The feature is available for new
applications that read the consolidated configuration files
found in the /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted directory or that
load the PKCS#11 module <br>
p11-kit-trust.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parts of the new feature are
also provided in a way to make it useful for legacy
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many legacy applications expect
CA certificates and trust configuration in a fixed location,
contained in files with particular path and name, or by
referring to a classic <br>
PKCS#11 trust module provided by the NSS cryptographic
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dynamic configuration
feature provides functionally compatible replacements for
classic configuration files and for the classic NSS trust
module named libnssckbi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to enable legacy
applications, that read the classic files or access the
classic module, to make use of the new consolidated and
dynamic configuration feature, the <br>
classic filenames have been changed to symbolic links. The
symbolic links refer to dynamically created and consolidated
output stored below the /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted <br>
directory hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output is produced using the
update-ca-trust command (without parameters), or using the
update-ca-trust extract command. In order to produce the
output, a flexible set of <br>
source configuration is read, as described in section SOURCE
CONFIGURATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the classic PKCS#11
module is replaced with a new PKCS#11 module
(p11-kit-trust.so) that dynamically reads the same source
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE CONFIGURATION <br>
The dynamic configuration feature uses several source
directories that will be scanned for any number of source
files. It is important to select the correct subdirectory
for <br>
adding files, as the subdirectory defines how contained
certificates will be trusted or distrusted, and which file
formats are read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files in subdirectories below
the directory hierarchy /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/
contain CA certificates and trust settings in the PEM file
format. The trust settings found <br>
here will be interpreted with a low priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files in subdirectories below
the directory hierarchy /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/ contain CA
certificates and trust settings in the PEM file format. The
trust settings found here <br>
will be interpreted with a high priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may use the following rules
of thumb to decide, whether your configuration files should
be added to the /etc or rather to the /usr directory
hierarchy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you are
manually adding a configuration file to a system, you
probably want it to override any other default
configuration, and you most likely should add it to the <br>
respective subdirectory in the /etc hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you are
creating a package that provides additional root CA
certificates, that is intended for distribution to several
computer systems, but you still want to allow the <br>
administrator to override your list, then your package
should add your files to the respective subdirectory in the
/usr hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you are
creating a package that is supposed to override the default
system trust settings, that is intended for distribution to
several computer systems, then your package <br>
should install the files to the respective subdirectory in
the /etc hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK HELP 1: To add a
certificate in the simple PEM or DER file formats to the
list of CAs trusted on the system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; add it as a new
file to directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; run
update-ca-trust extract</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK HELP 2: If your
certificate is in the extended BEGIN TRUSTED file format
(which may contain distrust/blacklist trust flags, or trust
flags for usages other than TLS) then:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; add it as a new
file to directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; run
update-ca-trust extract</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to offer simplicity and
flexibility, the way certificate files are treated depends
on the subdirectory they are installed to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; simple trust
anchors subdirectory:
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/ or
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; simple blacklist
(distrust) subdirectory:
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/blacklist/ or
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/blacklist/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; extended format
directory: /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the main directories
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/
you may install one or multiple files in the following file
formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; certificate
files that include trust flags, in the BEGIN/END TRUSTED
CERTIFICATE file format (any file name), which have been
created using the openssl x509 tool and the <br>
-addreject -addtrust options. Bundle files with multiple
certificates are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; files in the
p11-kit file format using the .p11-kit file name extension,
which can (e.g.) be used to distrust certificates based on
serial number and issuer name, without <br>
having the full certificate available. (This is currently an
undocumented format, to be extended later. For examples of
the supported formats, see the files shipped with the <br>
ca-certificates package.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; certificate
files without trust flags in either the DER file format or
in the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file format (any file
name). Such files will be added with neutral <br>
trust, neither trusted nor distrusted. They will simply be
known to the system, which might be helpful to assist
cryptographic software in constructing chains of <br>
certificates. (If you want a CA certificate in these file
formats to be trusted, you should remove it from this
directory and move it to the ./anchors subdirectory
instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the anchors subdirectories
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/ or
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ you may install one or
multiple certificates in either the DER file <br>
format or in the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file format.
Each certificate will be treated as trusted for all
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the blacklist subdirectories
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/blacklist/ or
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/blacklist/ you may install one or
multiple certificates in either the DER <br>
file format or in the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file
format. Each certificate will be treated as distrusted for
all purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to the x509(1)
manual page for the documentation of the BEGIN/END
CERTIFICATE and BEGIN/END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE file
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applications that rely on a
static file for a list of trusted CAs may load one of the
files found in the /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted directory.
After modifying any file in the <br>
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/
directories or in any of their subdirectories, or after
adding a file, it is necessary to run the update-ca-trust
<br>
extract command, in order to update the consolidated files
in /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/ .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applications that load the
classic PKCS#11 module using filename libnssckbi.so (which
has been converted into a symbolic link pointing to the new
module) and any application <br>
capable of loading PKCS#11 modules and loading
p11-kit-trust.so, will benefit from the dynamically merged
set of certificates and trust information stored in the <br>
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ and
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/ directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRACTED CONFIGURATION <br>
The directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/ contains
generated CA certificate bundle files which are created and
updated, based on the SOURCE CONFIGURATION by running the
<br>
update-ca-trust extract command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your application isn&acirc;t
able to load the PKCS#11 module p11-kit-trust.so, then you
can use these files in your application to load a list of
global root CA certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please never manually edit the
files stored in this directory, because your changes will be
lost and the files automatically overwritten, each time the
update-ca-trust extract <br>
command gets executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to install new trusted
or distrusted certificates, please rather install them in
the respective subdirectory below the
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or <br>
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/ directories, as described in the
SOURCE CONFIGURATION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/ contains a CA certificate
bundle in the java keystore file format. Distrust
information cannot be represented in this file format, <br>
and distrusted certificates are missing from these files.
File cacerts contains CA certificates trusted for TLS server
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ contains CA certificate
bundle files in the extended BEGIN/END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE
file format, as described in the x509(1) <br>
manual page. File ca-bundle.trust.crt contains the full set
of all trusted or distrusted certificates, including the
associated trust flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/ contains CA certificate
bundle files in the simple BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE file
format, as described in the x509(1) manual page. <br>
Distrust information cannot be represented in this file
format, and distrusted certificates are missing from these
files. File tls-ca-bundle.pem contains CA certificates
trusted <br>
for TLS server authentication. File email-ca-bundle.pem
contains CA certificates trusted for E-Mail protection. File
objsign-ca-bundle.pem contains CA certificates trusted for
<br>
code signing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
(absent/empty command) <br>
Same as the extract command described below. (However, the
command may print fewer warnings, as this command is being
run during rpm package installation, where non-fatal <br>
status output is undesired.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extract <br>
Instruct update-ca-trust to scan the SOURCE CONFIGURATION
and produce updated versions of the consolidated
configuration files stored below the
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted <br>
directory hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt <br>
Classic filename, file contains a list of CA certificates
trusted for TLS server authentication usage, in the simple
BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE file format, without distrust <br>
information. This file is a symbolic link that refers to the
consolidated output created by the update-ca-trust
command.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt
<br>

<br>
Contains multiple, low priority source configuration files
as explained in section SOURCE CONFIGURATION. Please pay
attention to the specific meanings of the respective <br>
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/pki/ca-trust/source <br>
Contains multiple, high priority source configuration files
as explained in section SOURCE CONFIGURATION. Please pay
attention to the specific meanings of the respective <br>
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted <br>
Contains consolidated and automatically generated
configuration files for consumption by applications, which
are created using the update-ca-trust extract command.
