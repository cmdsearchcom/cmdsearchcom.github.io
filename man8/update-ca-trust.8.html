update-ca-trust - manage consolidated and dynamic configuration of CA
  certificates and associated trust
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>update-ca-trust</b> [<i>COMMAND</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
update-ca-trust(8) is used to manage a consolidated and dynamic configuration
  feature of Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and associated trust.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The feature is available for new applications that read the consolidated
  configuration files found in the /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted directory or that
  load the PKCS#11 module p11-kit-trust.so
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Parts of the new feature are also provided in a way to make it useful for legacy
  applications.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Many legacy applications expect CA certificates and trust configuration in a
  fixed location, contained in files with particular path and name, or by
  referring to a classic PKCS#11 trust module provided by the NSS cryptographic
  library.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The dynamic configuration feature provides functionally compatible replacements
  for classic configuration files and for the classic NSS trust module named
  libnssckbi.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order to enable legacy applications, that read the classic files or access
  the classic module, to make use of the new consolidated and dynamic
  configuration feature, the classic filenames have been changed to symbolic
  links. The symbolic links refer to dynamically created and consolidated output
  stored below the /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted directory hierarchy.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The output is produced using the <i>update-ca-trust</i> command (without
  parameters), or using the <i>update-ca-trust extract</i> command. In order to
  produce the output, a flexible set of source configuration is read, as
  described in section SOURCE CONFIGURATION.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In addition, the classic PKCS#11 module is replaced with a new PKCS#11 module
  (p11-kit-trust.so) that dynamically reads the same source configuration.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOURCE_CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#SOURCE_CONFIGURATION">SOURCE
  CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The dynamic configuration feature uses several source directories that will be
  scanned for any number of source files. <b>It is important to select the
  correct subdirectory for adding files, as the subdirectory defines how
  contained certificates will be trusted or distrusted, and which file formats
  are read.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Files in <b>subdirectories below the directory hierarchy
  /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/</b> contain CA certificates and trust settings
  in the PEM file format. The trust settings found here will be interpreted with
  a <b>low priority</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Files in <b>subdirectories below the directory hierarchy
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/</b> contain CA certificates and trust settings in
  the PEM file format. The trust settings found here will be interpreted with a
  <b>high priority</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>You may use the following rules of thumb to decide, whether your
  configuration files should be added to the /etc or rather to the /usr
  directory hierarchy:</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;If you are manually adding a
  configuration file to a system, you probably want it to override any other
  default configuration, and you most likely should add it to the respective
  subdirectory in the /etc hierarchy.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;If you are creating a package that
  provides additional root CA certificates, that is intended for distribution to
  several computer systems, but you still want to allow the administrator to
  override your list, then your package should add your files to the respective
  subdirectory in the /usr hierarchy.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;If you are creating a package that is
  supposed to override the default system trust settings, that is intended for
  distribution to several computer systems, then your package should install the
  files to the respective subdirectory in the /etc hierarchy.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>QUICK HELP 1</b><b>: To add a certificate in the simple PEM or DER file
  formats to the list of CAs trusted on the system:</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;add it as a new file to directory
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;run <i>update-ca-trust
  extract</i></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>QUICK HELP 2</b><b>: If your certificate is in the extended BEGIN TRUSTED
  file format (which may contain distrust/blacklist trust flags, or trust flags
  for usages other than TLS) then:</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;add it as a new file to directory
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;run <i>update-ca-trust

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>In order to offer simplicity and flexibility, the way certificate files are
  treated depends on the subdirectory they are installed to.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;simple trust anchors subdirectory:
  /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/ or
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;simple blacklist (distrust)
  subdirectory: /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/blacklist/ or
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/blacklist/</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;extended format directory:
  /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>In the main directories /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/ you may install one or multiple files in the
  following file formats:</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;certificate files that include trust
  flags, in the BEGIN/END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE file format (any file name), which
  have been created using the openssl x509 tool and the -addreject -addtrust
  options. Bundle files with multiple certificates are supported.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;files in the p11-kit file format using
  the .p11-kit file name extension, which can (e.g.) be used to distrust
  certificates based on serial number and issuer name, without having the full
  certificate available. (This is currently an undocumented format, to be
  extended later. For examples of the supported formats, see the files shipped
  with the ca-certificates package.)</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;certificate files without trust flags
  in either the DER file format or in the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file
  format (any file name). Such files will be added with neutral trust, neither
  trusted nor distrusted. They will simply be known to the system, which might
  be helpful to assist cryptographic software in constructing chains of
  certificates. (If you want a CA certificate in these file formats to be
  trusted, you should remove it from this directory and move it to the ./anchors
  subdirectory instead.)</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the anchors subdirectories /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/ or
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ you may install one or multiple certificates
  in either the DER file format or in the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file
  format. Each certificate will be treated as <b>trusted</b> for all purposes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the blacklist subdirectories /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/blacklist/ or
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/blacklist/ you may install one or multiple
  certificates in either the DER file format or in the PEM (BEGIN/END
  CERTIFICATE) file format. Each certificate will be treated as
  <b>distrusted</b> for all purposes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Please refer to the x509(1) manual page for the documentation of the BEGIN/END
  CERTIFICATE and BEGIN/END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE file formats.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Applications that rely on a static file for a list of trusted CAs may load one
  of the files found in the /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted directory. After
  modifying any file in the /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/ directories or in any of their subdirectories, or
  after adding a file, it is necessary to run the <i>update-ca-trust extract</i>
  command, in order to update the consolidated files in
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/ .
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Applications that load the classic PKCS#11 module using filename libnssckbi.so
  (which has been converted into a symbolic link pointing to the new module) and
  any application capable of loading PKCS#11 modules and loading
  p11-kit-trust.so, will benefit from the dynamically merged set of certificates
  and trust information stored in the /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ and
  /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/ directories.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXTRACTED_CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#EXTRACTED_CONFIGURATION">EXTRACTED
  CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/ contains generated CA certificate
  bundle files which are created and updated, based on the SOURCE CONFIGURATION
  by running the <i>update-ca-trust extract</i> command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If your application isn&#x2019;t able to load the PKCS#11 module
  p11-kit-trust.so, then you can use these files in your application to load a
  list of global root CA certificates.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Please never manually edit the files stored in this directory, because your
  changes will be lost and the files automatically overwritten, each time the
  <i>update-ca-trust extract</i> command gets executed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order to install new trusted or distrusted certificates, please rather
  install them in the respective subdirectory below the
  /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/ directories, as
  described in the SOURCE CONFIGURATION section.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/ contains a CA certificate bundle
  in the java keystore file format. Distrust information cannot be represented
  in this file format, and distrusted certificates are missing from these files.
  File cacerts contains CA certificates trusted for TLS server authentication.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ contains CA certificate
  bundle files in the extended BEGIN/END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE file format, as
  described in the x509(1) manual page. File ca-bundle.trust.crt contains the
  full set of all trusted or distrusted certificates, including the associated
  trust flags.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/ contains CA certificate bundle
  files in the simple BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE file format, as described in the
  x509(1) manual page. Distrust information cannot be represented in this file
  format, and distrusted certificates are missing from these files. File
  tls-ca-bundle.pem contains CA certificates trusted for TLS server
  authentication. File email-ca-bundle.pem contains CA certificates trusted for
  E-Mail protection. File objsign-ca-bundle.pem contains CA certificates trusted
  for code signing.
