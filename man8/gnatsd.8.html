<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnatsd - GNATS network server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnatsd [--database database | -d database] [--not-inetd |
-n] [--max-access-level level | -m level] [--version | -V]
[--help | -h]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gnatsd is used to service remote GNATS requests such as
querying PRs, PR creation, deletion, and editing, and
miscellaneous database queries. It uses a simple ASCII-based
com&acirc; <br>
mand protocol (similar to SMTP or POP3) for communicating
with remote clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also provides a security
model based either on IP-based authentication (generally a
terrible idea) or username/passwords. Passwords may be
encrypted using UNIX crypt() or MD5 <br>
(for operating systems that support it). Plaintext passwords
are also supported but strongly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the GNATS clients are
capable of communicating via the GNATS remote protocol to
perform their functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnatsd should be run by the
GNATS user (by default gnats), and it is usually started
from inetd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V, --version <br>
Prints the program version to stdout and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Prints a short help text to stdout and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --database <br>
Specifies the default database which is to be serviced by
this invocation of gnatsd. (The selected database may be
changed via the CHDB command; this is simply the default
<br>
if no CHDB command is issued.) If no database is specified,
the database named default is assumed. This option overrides
the database specified in the GNATSDB environment <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--not-inetd, -n <br>
As its name suggests, indicates that gnatsd is not being
invoked from inetd. This can be used when testing gnatsd, or
if it being run via ssh or some other mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has the effect of using the
local hostname where gnatsd is being invoked for
authentication purposes, rather than the remote address of
the connecting client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-access-level, -m <br>
Specifies the maximum access level that the connecting
client can authenticate to. Authentication is as normal but
if the user or host authenticates at a higher level,
ac&acirc; <br>
cess level is set to this level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND PROTOCOL <br>
Commands are issued to gnatsd as one or more words followed
by a carriage-return/linefeed pair. For example, the CHDB
(change databases) command is sent as <br>
CHDB database&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; <br>
[the CRLF will not be explicitly written for future
examples]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replies from gnatsd are returned
as one or more response lines containing a 3-digit numeric
code followed by a human-readable string; the line is
terminated with a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; pair. <br>
For example, one possible response to the CHDB command above
would be: <br>
210 Now accessing GNATS database &rsquo;database&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The three-digit code is normally
followed by a single ASCII space (character 0x20). However,
if additional response lines are to be returned from the
server, there will be a <br>
single dash (&lsquo;-&rsquo;) instead of the space character
after the three-digit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Response code values are divided
into ranges. The first digit reflects the general type of
response (such as &quot;successful&quot; or
&quot;error&quot;), and the subsequent digits identify the
<br>
specific type of response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codes 200-299 <br>
Positive response indicating that the command was
successful. No subsequent data will be transmitted with the
response. [In particular, code 210 (CODE_OK) is used as the
<br>
positive result code for most simple commands.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands that expect additional
data from the client (such as SUBM or VFLD) use a two-step
mechanism for sending the data. The server will respond to
the initial command <br>
with either a 211 (CODE_SEND_PR) or 212 (CODE_SEND_TEXT)
response line, or an error code if an error occurred with
the initial command. The client is then expected to <br>
send the remaining data using the same quoting mechanism as
described for server responses in the 300-349 range. The
server will then send a final response line to the <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codes 300-399 <br>
Positive response indicating that the query request was
successful, and that a PR or other data will follow. Codes
300-349 are used when transmitting PRs, and 350-399 are <br>
used for other responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codes in the 300-349 range are
followed by a series of CRLF-terminated lines containing the
command response, usually a PR. The final line of the result
is a single peri&acirc; <br>
od (&lsquo;.&rsquo;). Result lines that begin with a period
have an extra period prepended to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codes in the 350-399 range use a
different scheme for sending their responses. The
three-digit numeric code will be followed by either a dash
(&lsquo;-&rsquo;) or a single space. If <br>
the code is followed by a dash, that indicates that another
response line will follow. The final line of the response
has a single space after the three-digit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In previous versions of the
protocol the first line of a CODE_INFORMATION (310) response
was to be ignored. This is no longer the case. Instead, any
lines marked with <br>
code CODE_INFORMATION_FILLER (351) are to be ignored. This
allows the server to transmit additional headers or other
human-readable text that can be safely ignored by the <br>
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codes 400-599 <br>
An error occurred, usually because of invalid command
parameters or invalid input from the client, missing
arguments to the comamand, or a command was issued out of
se&acirc; <br>
quence. The human-readable message associated with the
response line describes the general problem encountered with
the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple error messages may be
returned from a command; in this case the &lsquo;-&rsquo;
continuation character is used on all but the last response
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codes 600-799 <br>
An internal error occurred on the server, a timeout occurred
reading data from the client, or a network failure occurred.
These errors are of the &quot;this should not occur&quot;
<br>
nature, and retrying the operation may resolve the problem.
Fortunately, most GNATS transactions are idempotent;
unfortunately, locking the database or a PR are not
re&acirc; <br>
peatable actions (we cannot determine if an existing lock is
the one we originally requested, or someone
else&rsquo;s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Note that the set of GNATS commands and their responses is
somewhat inconsistent and is very much in flux. At present
the GNATS clients are rather simple-minded and not very <br>
strict about processing responses. For example, if the
server were to issue a code 300 (CODE_PR_READY) response to
a CHDB command, the client would happily expect to see a PR
<br>
appear (and would print it out if one was sent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is thus suggested that any
clients that use the GNATS protocol be equally flexible
about the way received responses are handled; in particular,
only the first digit of the re&acirc; <br>
sponse code should be assumed to be meaningful, although
subsequent digits are needed in some cases (codes 300-399).
No attempt should be made to parse the message strings on
er&acirc; <br>
ror response lines; they are only intended to be read by
humans, and will be changed on a regular basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Almost every command may result
in the response 440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR). This indicates that
there was a problem with the command arguments, usually
because of insufficient or too <br>
many arguments being specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER [&lt;userid&gt;
[&lt;password&gt;]] <br>
Specifies the userid and password for database access. Both
a username and a password may be given, only a username may
be given, or both may be omitted; if both are omit&acirc;
<br>
ted, the current access level is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible server responses
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">350 (CODE_INFORMATION) <br>
The current access level is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">422 (CODE_NO_ACCESS) <br>
A matching username and password could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">200 (CODE_OK) <br>
A matching username and password was found, and the login
was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUIT Requests that the
connection be closed. Possible responses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">201 (CODE_CLOSING) <br>
Normal exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quit command has the dubious
distinction of being the only command that cannot fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST &lt;list type&gt; <br>
Describes various aspects of the database. The lists are
returned as a list of records, one per line. Each line may
contain a number of colon-separated fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible values for list type
include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Categories <br>
Describes the legal categories for the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submitters <br>
Describes the set of submitters for the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Responsible <br>
Lists the names in the responsible administrative file,
including their full names and email addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">States Lists the states listed
in the state administrative file, including the state type
(usually blank for most states; the closed state has a
special type).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FieldNames <br>
Lists the entire set of PR fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InitialInputFields <br>
Lists the fields that should be present when a PR is
initially entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InitialRequiredFields <br>
Lists fields that have to be present and nonempty when a PR
is initially entered (fields containing only blank
characters such as spaces or newlines are considered <br>
empty.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Databases <br>
Lists the set of databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">301 (CODE_TEXT_READY) <br>
Normal response, followed by the records making up the list
as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">416 (CODE_INVALID_LIST) <br>
The requested list does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTYP &lt;field&gt;
[&lt;field&gt; ...] <br>
Describes the type of data held in the field(s) specified
with the command. The currently-defined data types are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text A plain text field,
containing exactly one line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MultiText <br>
A text field possibly containing multiple lines of text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enum An enumerated data field;
the value is restricted to one entry out of a list of values
associated with the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MultiEnum <br>
The field contains one or more enumerated values. Values are
separated with spaces or colons (:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer <br>
The field contains an integer value, possibly signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Date The field contains a
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TextWithRegex <br>
The value in the field must match one or more regular
expressions associated with the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">350 (CODE_INFORMATION) <br>
The normal response; the supplied text is the data type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)
<br>
The specified field does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple field names were
given, multiple response lines will be sent, one for each
field, using the standard continuation protocol; each
response except the last will <br>
have a dash (&lsquo;-&rsquo;) immedately after the response
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTYPINFO &lt;field&gt;
&lt;property&gt; <br>
Provides field-type-related information. Currently, only the
property &lsquo;separators&rsquo; for MultiEnum fields is
supported. When &lsquo;separators&rsquo; is specified, the
possible return <br>
codes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">350 (CODE_INFORMATION) <br>
A proper MultiEnum field was specified and the returned text
is the string of separators specified for the field in the
dbconfig file, quoted within &rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">435
(CODE_INVALID_FTYPE_PROPERTY) <br>
The &lsquo;separators&rsquo; property is not defined for
this field, i.e. the specified field is not of type
MultiEnum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, specifying a
different property than &lsquo;separators&rsquo; results in
return code 435 as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FDSC &lt;field&gt;
[&lt;field&gt; ... ] <br>
Returns a human-readable description of the listed field(s).
The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">350 (CODE_INFORMATION) <br>
The normal response; the supplied text is the field
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)
<br>
The specified field does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the FVLD command, the
standard continuation protocol will be used if multiple
fields were specified with the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIELDFLAGS &lt;field&gt;
[&lt;field&gt; ... ] <br>
Returns a set of flags describing the specified field(s).
The possible responses are either 410
(CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME), meaning that the specified field
is invalid or <br>
nonexistent, or 350 (CODE_INFORMATION) which contains the
set of flags for the field. The flags may be blank, which
indicate that no special flags have been set for this <br>
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the FDSC and FTYP commands,
multiple field names may be listed with the command, and a
response line will be returned for each one in the order
that the fields appear <br>
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">textsearch <br>
The field will be searched when a text field search is
requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowAnyValue <br>
For fields that contain enumerated values, any legal value
may be used in the field, not just ones that appear in the
enumerated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">requireChangeReason <br>
If the field is edited, a reason for the change must be
supplied in the new PR text describing the reason for the
change. The reason must be supplied as a multitext <br>
PR field in the new PR whose name is field-Changed-Why
(where field is the name of the field being edited).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readonly <br>
The field is read-only, and cannot be edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FVLD &lt;field&gt; <br>
Returns one or more regular expressions or strings that
describe the valid types of data that can be placed in
field. Exactly what is returned is dependent on the type of
<br>
data that can be stored in the field. For most fields a
regular expression is returned; for enumerated fields, the
returned values are the list of legal strings that can be
<br>
held in the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">301 (CODE_TEXT_READY) <br>
The normal response, which is followed by the list of
regexps or strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)
<br>
The specified field does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VFLD &lt;field&gt; <br>
VFLD can be used to validate a given value for a field in
the database. The client issues the VFLD command with the
name of the field to validate as an argument. The
serv&acirc; <br>
er will either respond with 212 (CODE_SEND_TEXT), or 410
(CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME) if the specified field does not
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the 212 response is
received from the server, the client should then send the
line(s) of text to be validated, using the normal quoting
mechanism described for PRs. <br>
The final line of text is followed by a line containing a
single period, again as when sending PR text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server will then either
respond with 210 (CODE_OK), indicating that the text is
acceptable, or one or more error codes describing the
problems with the field contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUTDEFAULT &lt;field&gt;
[&lt;field&gt; ... ] <br>
Returns the suggested default value for a field when a PR is
initially created. The possible responses are either
410(CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME), meaning that the specified
<br>
field is invalid or nonexistent, or 350 (CODE_INFORMATION)
which contains the default value for the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the FDSC and FTYP commands,
multiple field names may be listed with the command, and a
response line will be returned for each one in the order
that the fields appear <br>
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSET Used to reset the internal
server state. The current query expression is cleared, and
the index of PRs may be reread if it has been updated since
the start of the session. <br>
The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">200 (CODE_OK) <br>
The state has been reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR) <br>
One or more arguments were supplied to the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6xx (internal error) <br>
There were problems resetting the state (usually because the
index could not be reread). The session will be immediately
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LKDB Locks the main GNATS
database. No subsequent database locks will succeed until
the lock is removed. Sessions that attempt to write to the
database will fail. <br>
The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">200 (CODE_OK) <br>
The lock has been established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR) <br>
One or more arguments were supplied to the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED) <br>
The database is already locked, and the lock could not be
obtained after 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6xx (internal error) <br>
An internal error occurred, usually because of permission or
other filesystem-related problems. The lock may or may not
have been established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNDB Unlocks the database. Any
session may steal a database lock; no checking of any sort
is done. <br>
The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">200 (CODE_OK) <br>
The lock has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">432 (CODE_GNATS_NOT_LOCKED) <br>
The database was not locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR) <br>
One or more arguments were supplied to the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6xx (internal error) <br>
The database lock could not be removed, usually because of
permissions or other filesystem-related issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCK &lt;PR&gt; &lt;user&gt;
[&lt;pid&gt;] <br>
Locks the specified PR, marking the lock with the name user
and the optional pid. (No checking is done that the user or
pid arguments are valid or meaningful; they are sim&acirc;
<br>
ply treated as strings.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EDIT command requires that
the PR be locked before it may be successfully executed.
However, it does not require that the lock is owned by the
editing session, so the <br>
usefulness of the lock is simply as an advisory measure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The APPN and REPL commands lock
the PR as part of the editing process, and they do not
require that the PR be locked before they are invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR) <br>
Insufficient or too many arguments were specified to the
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">300 (CODE_PR_READY) <br>
The lock was successfully obtained; the text of the PR
(using the standard quoting mechanism for PRs) follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">400 (CODE_NONEXISTENT_PR) <br>
The PR specified does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">430 (CODE_LOCKED_PR) <br>
The PR is already locked by another session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6xx (internal error) <br>
The PR lock could not be created, usually because of
permissions or other filesystem-related issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNLK &lt;PR&gt; <br>
Unlocks PR. Any user may unlock a PR, as no checking is done
to determine if the requesting session owns the lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR) <br>
Insufficient or too many arguments were specified to the
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">200 (CODE_OK) <br>
The PR was successfully unlocked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">433 (CODE_PR_NOT_LOCKED) <br>
The PR was not locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6xx (internal error) <br>
The PR could not be unlocked, usually because of permission
or other filesystem-related problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE &lt;PR&gt; <br>
Deletes the specified PR. The user making the request must
have admin privileges. If successful, the PR is removed from
the filesystem and the index file; a gap will be <br>
left in the numbering sequence for PRs. No checks are made
that the PR is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">200 (CODE_OK) <br>
The PR was successfully deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">422 (CODE_NO_ACCESS) <br>
The user requesting the delete does not have admin
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">430 (CODE_LOCKED_PR) <br>
The PR is locked by another session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED) <br>
The database has been locked, and no PRs may be updated
until the lock is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6xx (internal error) <br>
The PR could not be successfully deleted, usually because of
permission or other filesystem-related problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHEK [initial] <br>
Used to check the text of an entire PR for errors. Unlike
the VFLD command, it accepts an entire PR at once instead of
the contents of an individual field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial argument indicates
that the PR text to be checked is for a PR that will be
newly created, rather than an edit or replacement of an
existing PR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the CHEK command is
issued, the server will respond with either a 440
(CODE_CMD_ERROR) response indicating that the command
arguments were incorrect, or a 211 <br>
(CODE_SEND_PR) response code will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the 211 response is
received from the server, the client should send the PR
using the normal PR quoting mechanism; the final line of the
PR is then followed by a line <br>
containing a single period, as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server will then respond
with either a 200 (CODE_OK) response, indicating there were
no problems with the supplied text, or one or more error
codes listing the problems <br>
with the PR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDIT &lt;PR&gt; <br>
Verifies the replacement text for PR. If the command is
successful, the contents of PR are completely replaced with
the supplied text. PR must previously have been locked <br>
with the LOCK command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible responses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED) <br>
The database has been locked, and no PRs may be updated
until the lock is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">433 (CODE_PR_NOT_LOCKED) <br>
The PR was not previously locked with the LOCK command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">400 (CODE_NONEXISTENT_PR) <br>
The specified PR does not currently exist. The SUBM command
should be used to create new PRs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">211 (CODE_SEND_PR) <br>

databases (tho it might be interesting if it could) so the
database is always assumed to be local.</p>

--database option is not supplied, it is assumed that the
database is local and that its name is default.</p>
