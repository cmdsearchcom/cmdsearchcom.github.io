<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
iwevent - Display Wireless Events generated by drivers and
setting changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
iwevent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
iwevent displays Wireless Events received through the
RTNetlink socket. Each line displays the specific Wireless
Event which describes what has happened on the specified
wireless <br>
interface. <br>
This command doesn&rsquo;t take any arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
There are two classes of Wireless Events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first class is events
related to a change of wireless settings on the interface
(typically done through iwconfig or a script calling
iwconfig). Only settings that could <br>
result in a disruption of connectivity are reported. The
events currently reported are changing one of the following
setting : <br>
Network ID <br>
ESSID <br>
Frequency <br>
Mode <br>
Encryption <br>
All those events will be generated on all wireless
interfaces by the kernel wireless subsystem (but only if the
driver has been converted to the new driver API).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second class of events are
events generated by the hardware, when something happens or
a task has been finished. Those events include :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Access Point/Cell address
<br>
The interface has joined a new Access Point or Ad-Hoc Cell,
or lost its association with it. This is the same address
that is reported by iwconfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan request completed <br>
A scanning request has been completed, results of the scan
are available (see iwlist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tx packet dropped <br>
A packet directed at this address has been dropped because
the interface believes this node doesn&rsquo;t answer
anymore (usually maximum of MAC level retry exceeded). This
is <br>
usually an early indication that the node may have left the
cell or gone out of range, but it may be due to fading or
excessive contention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom driver event <br>
Event specific to the driver. Please check the driver
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Registered node <br>
The interface has successfully registered a new wireless
client/peer. Will be generated mostly when the interface
acts as an Access Point (mode Master).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expired node <br>
The registration of the client/peer on this interface has
expired. Will be generated mostly when the interface acts as
an Access Point (mode Master).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spy threshold crossed <br>
The signal strength for one of the addresses in the spy list
went under the low threshold or went above the high
threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most wireless drivers generate
only a subset of those events, not all of them, the exact
list depends on the specific hardware/driver combination.
Please refer to driver documen&acirc; <br>
tation for details on when they are generated, and use
iwlist(8) to check what the driver supports.</p>
