<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Copy data to and from any files. Specialized for
&quot;files&quot; that are Linux SCSI devices that support
the SCSI EXTENDED COPY (XCOPY) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the draft stages of SPC-4
the T10 committee has expanded the XCOPY command so that it
now has two variants: &quot;LID1&quot; (for a List
Identifier length of 1 byte) and &quot;LID4&quot; (for <br>
a List Identifier length of 4 bytes). This utility supports
the older, LID1 variant which is also found in SPC-3 and
earlier. While the LID1 variant in SPC-4 is command level
<br>
(binary) compatible with XCOPY as defined in SPC-3, some of
the command naming has changed. This utility uses the older,
SPC-3 XCOPY names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility has similar syntax
and semantics to dd(1) but with no &quot;conversions&quot;
is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first group in the synopsis
above are &quot;standard&quot; Unix dd(1) operands. The
second group are extra options added by this utility. Both
groups are defined below in combined, <br>
alphabetical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the XCOPY command is
sent to IFILE. This can be changed with the --on_dst option
which causes the XCOPY command to be sent to OFILE
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
bpt=BPT <br>
each IO transaction will be made using BPT blocks (or less
if near the end of the copy). Default is 128 for block sizes
less that 2048 bytes, otherwise the default is 32. <br>
So for bs=512 the reads and writes will each convey 64 KiB
of data by default (less if near the end of the transfer or
memory restrictions). When cd/dvd drives are <br>
accessed, the block size is typically 2048 bytes and bpt
defaults to 32 which again implies 64 KiB transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs=BS where BS must be the block
size of the physical device (if either the input or output
files are accessed via SCSI commands). Note that this
differs from dd(1) which per&acirc; <br>
mits BS to be an integral multiple. Defaults to the device
block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat={0|1} <br>
sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command segment descriptor CAT
bit to 0 or 1 (default: 0). The CAT bit (in conjunction with
the PAD bit) controls the handling of residual <br>
data. See section HANDLING OF RESIDUAL DATA for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dc={0|1} <br>
sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command segment descriptor DC
bit to 0 or 1 (default: 0). The DC bit controls whether
COUNT refers to the source (dc=0) or the target (dc=1) <br>
descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conv=CONV <br>
all CONV arguments are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count=COUNT <br>
copy COUNT blocks from IFILE to OFILE. Default is the
minimum (IFILE if dc=0 or OFILE if dc=1) number of blocks
that SCSI devices report from SCSI READ CAPACITY commands
<br>
or that block devices (or their partitions) report. Normal
files are not probed for their size. If skip=SKIP or
skip=SEEK are given and the count is derived (i.e. not <br>
explicitly given) then the derived count is scaled back so
that the copy will not overrun the device. If the file name
is a block device partition and COUNT is not given <br>
then the size of the partition rather than the size of the
whole device is used. If COUNT is not given (or count=-1)
and cannot be derived then an error message is issued <br>
and no copy takes place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ibs=BS if given must be the same
as BS given to &rsquo;bs=&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id_usage={hold|discard|disable}
<br>
sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command parameter list field
called LIST ID USAGE to 0 if the argument is
&rsquo;hold&rsquo;, to 2 if the argument is
&rsquo;discard&rsquo;, or to &rsquo;3&rsquo; if the argument
<br>
is &rsquo;disable&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if=IFILE <br>
read from IFILE instead of stdin. If IFILE is
&rsquo;-&rsquo; then stdin is read. Starts reading at the
beginning of IFILE unless SKIP is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iflag=FLAGS <br>
where FLAGS is a comma separated list of one or more flags
outlined below. These flags are associated with IFILE and
are ignored when IFILE is stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obs=BS if given must be the same
as BS given to &rsquo;bs=&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">of=OFILE <br>
write to OFILE instead of stdout. If OFILE is
&rsquo;-&rsquo; then writes to stdout. If OFILE is /dev/null
then no actual writes are performed. If OFILE is
&rsquo;.&rsquo; (period) then it is <br>
treated the same way as /dev/null (this is a shorthand
notation). If OFILE exists then it is _not_ truncated; it is
overwritten from the start of OFILE unless <br>
&rsquo;oflag=append&rsquo; or SEEK is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oflag=FLAGS <br>
where FLAGS is a comma separated list of one or more flags
outlined below. These flags are associated with OFILE and
are ignored when OFILE is /dev/null, &rsquo;.&rsquo;
(period), or <br>
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_id=ID <br>
sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command parameter list field
called LIST IDENTIFIER to ID. ID should be a value between 0
and 255 (inclusive) and the default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prio=PRIO <br>
sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command parameter list field
called PRIORITY to PRIO. The default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seek=SEEK <br>
start writing SEEK bs-sized blocks from the start of OFILE.
Default is block 0 (i.e. start of file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip=SKIP <br>
start reading SKIP bs-sized blocks from the start of IFILE.
Default is block 0 (i.e. start of file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time={0|1} <br>
when 1, times transfer and does throughput calculation,
outputting the results (to stderr) at completion. When 0
(default) doesn&rsquo;t perform timing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose=VERB <br>
as VERB increases so does the amount of debug output sent to
stderr. Default value is zero which yields the minimum
amount of debug output. A value of 1 reports extra <br>
information that is not repetitive. A value 2 reports cdbs
and responses for SCSI commands that are not repetitive
(i.e. other that READ and WRITE). Error processing is <br>
not considered repetitive. Values of 3 and 4 yield output
for all SCSI commands (and Unix read() and write() calls) so
there can be a lot of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
outputs usage message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--on_dst <br>
send the XCOPY command to the output file/device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--on_src <br>
send the XCOPY command to the input file/device. This is the
default when this option and --on_dst are not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
equivalent to verbose=1. When used twice, equivalent to
verbose=2, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
outputs version number information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLAGS <br>
Here is a list of flags and their meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append causes the O_APPEND flag
to be added to the open of OFILE. For regular files this
will lead to data appended to the end of any existing data.
Cannot be used together with <br>
the seek=SEEK option as they conflict. The default action of
this utility is to overwrite any existing data from the
beginning of the file or, if SEEK is given, starting <br>
at block SEEK. Note that attempting to &rsquo;append&rsquo;
to a device file (e.g. a disk) will usually be ignored or
may cause an error to be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">excl causes the O_EXCL flag to
be added to the open of IFILE and/or OFILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flock after opening the
associated file (i.e. IFILE and/or OFILE) an attempt is made
to get an advisory exclusive lock with the flock() system
call. The flock arguments are <br>
&quot;FLOCK_EX | FLOCK_NB&quot; which will cause the lock to
be taken if available else a &quot;temporarily
unavailable&quot; error is generated. An exit status of 90
is produced in the lat&acirc; <br>
ter case and no copy is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null has no affect, just a
placeholder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY
command segment descriptor PAD bit. The PAD bit (in
conjunction with the CAT bit) controls the handling of
residual data.(See section HANDLING <br>
OF RESIDUAL DATA for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcopy has no affect; for
compatibility with ddpt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HANDLING OF RESIDUAL DATA <br>
The pad and cat bits control the handling of residual data.
As the data can be specified either in terms of source or
target block size and both might have different block sizes
<br>
residual data is likely to happen in these cases. If both
block sizes are identical these bits have no effect as
residual data will not occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of these bits are set,
the EXTENDED COPY command will be aborted with additional
sense &rsquo;UNEXPECTED INEXACT SEGMENT&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only the cat bit is set the
residual data will be retained and made available for
subsequent segment descriptors. Residual data will be
discarded for the last segment descrip&acirc; <br>
tor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pad bit is set for the
source descriptor only, any residual data for both source or
destination will be discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pad bit is set for the
target descriptor only any residual source data will be
handled as if the cat bit is set, but any residual
destination data will be padded to make a <br>
whole block transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pad bit is set for both
source and target any residual source data will be
discarded, and any residual destination data will be
padded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETIRED OPTIONS <br>
Here are some retired options that are still present:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append=0 | 1 <br>
when set, equivalent to &rsquo;oflag=append&rsquo;. When
clear the action is to overwrite the existing file (if it
exists); this is the default. See the &rsquo;append&rsquo;
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Various numeric arguments (e.g. SKIP) may include
multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the
&quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The COUNT, SKIP and SEEK
arguments can take 64 bit values (i.e. very big numbers).
Other values are limited to what can fit in a signed 32 bit
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All informative, warning and
error output is sent to stderr so that dd&rsquo;s output
file can be stdout and remain unpolluted. If no options are
given, then the usage message is out&acirc; <br>
put and nothing else happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a device supports xcopy
operations then it should set the 3PC field (3PC stands for
Third Party Copy) in its standard INQUIRY response. This
utility will attempt a xcopy <br>
operation irrespective of the value in the 3PC field but if
it is zero (cleared) one would expect the xcopy operation to
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status of the SCSI EXTENDED
COPY command can be queried with
sg_copy_results(sg3_utils)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently only block-to-block
transfers are implemented; IFILE and OFILE must refer to a
SCSI block device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No account is taken of
partitions so, for example, /dev/sbc2, /dev/sdc, /dev/sg2,
and /dev/bsg/3:0:0:1 would all refer to the same thing: the
whole logical unit (i.e. the whole <br>
disk) starting at LBA 0. So any partition indication (e.g.
/dev/sdc2) is ignored. The user should set SKIP, SEEK and
COUNT with information obtained from a command like
&rsquo;fdisk <br>
-l -u /dev/sdc&rsquo; to account for partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XCOPY (LID1) capability has been
added to the ddpt utility which is in a package of the same
name. The ddpt utility will run on other OSes (e.g. FreeBSD
and Windows) while <br>
sg_xcopy only runs on Linux. Also ddpt permits the arguments
to ibs= and ibs= to be different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Copy 2M of data from the start of one device to another:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_xcopy if=/dev/sdo
of=/dev/sdp count=2048 list_id=2 dc=1 <br>
sg_xcopy: if=/dev/sdo skip=0 of=/dev/sdp seek=0 count=1024
<br>
Start of loop, count=1024, bpt=65535, lba_in=0, lba_out=0
<br>
sg_xcopy: 1024 blocks, 1 command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check the status of the EXTENDED
COPY command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_copy_results --status
--list_id=2 /dev/sdp <br>
Receive copy results (copy status): <br>
Held data discarded: Yes <br>
Copy manager status: Operation completed without errors <br>
Segments processed: 1 <br>
Transfer count units: 0 <br>
Transfer count: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT,
SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE output the number of remaining blocks to
be transferred and the records in + out counts; then they
have <br>
their default action. SIGUSR1 causes the same information to
be output yet the copy continues. All output caused by
signals is sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_xcopy is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An additional exit status of 90
is generated if the flock flag is given and some other
process holds the advisory exclusive lock.</p>
