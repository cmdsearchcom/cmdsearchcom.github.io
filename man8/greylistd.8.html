<p>greylistd(8) Mail Administration greylistd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
greylistd - simple greylisting system for mail transport
agents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
greylistd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Greylisting <br>
This daemon provides a simple greylisting implementation for
use with Exim and other mail transport agents (MTAs). For a
more elaborate introduction to greylisting, please refer
<br>
to Evan Harris&rsquo; whitepaper at:
http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Greylisting is a simple but
highly effective means to weed out messages that are being
delivered via spamware/ratware tools. The idea is to
establish whether a prior relation&acirc; <br>
ship exists between the sender and the receiver of a
message. Most of the time it does, and the delivery proceeds
normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, if no prior
relationship exists, the delivery is temporarily rejected,
using a 451 SMTP response. Legitimate MTAs will treat this
response accordingly, and <br>
retry the delivery in a while. In contrast, ratware will
usually fail to retry the delivery in a normal fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a result, greylisting is
currently more than 90% effective in blocking incoming junk
mail, while nearly all legitimate mail goes through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three pieces of information
(herafter called a triplet) from the delivery attempt are
cached for future reference:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The address of the host
attempting the delivery <br>
- The envelope sender address (MAIL FROM:) <br>
- The envelope recipient address (RCPT TO:)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a delivery attempt was
temporarily rejected, then after an initial timeout (60
minutes by default), but before a retry expiration time (8
hours by default), new delivery <br>
attempts with the same triplet are accepted, and the triplet
is added to a whitelist. This allows for delivery retries,
presumably from legitimate MTAs, and ensures that future
<br>
mail from the same contact is not subject to
greylisting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a whitelisted triplet has not
been seen for an extended duration (by default 60 days), it
is expired. This prevents unlimited growth of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The downside to greylisting is
that legitimate mail from people who have never sent you
mail in the past (or, at least, within the last 60 days) are
subject to a one-hour delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upside is that the current
generation of ratware tools will not be able to deliver spam
or virii to you. Even if, as a result of lots of sites
incorporating the greylisting <br>
concept, ratware tools are modified such that temporarily
rejected deliveries are retried, you stand an increased
chance of blocking such mail. That is because within the
manda&acirc; <br>
tory 1-hour initial delay, chances are that the sending
host&rsquo;s IP address has been listed in one or more DNS
block lists (such as bl.spamcop.net, cbl.abuseat.org,
etc..), and can <br>
be rejected by your MTA by consulting these lists directly,
or via anti-spam software like SpamAssassin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">greylistd <br>
greylistd is meant to be installed on a server that accepts
incoming mail. The MTA on this server connects to the
greylistd daemon over a UNIX domain socket (by default <br>
/var/run/greylistd/socket), or alternatively via the command
greylist(1), and submits a string (triplet) that identifies
a particular host/sender/recipient relationship. <br>
greylistd responds &quot;white&quot;, &quot;grey&quot; or
&quot;black&quot;, depending on the current listing status
of the provided triplet. Alternatively, if either of the
&quot;--white&quot;, &quot;--grey&quot;, or
&quot;--black&quot; <br>
options precede the data, greylistd responds
&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, indicating whether
the triplet is currently in the corresponding state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Exim 4 <br>
A sample greylistd statement for Exim 4 is provided with
this package, and can normally be found in
&quot;/usr/share/doc/greylistd/examples/exim4-acl-example.txt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Others <br>
What others? :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A prerequisite to greylisting in
general is the ability to perform custom filtering
throughout the various stages in the SMTP transaction, most
notably after the RCPT TO: SMTP <br>
command. In particular, greylistd(8) can be invoked either
over a UNIX domain socket or via the supplied greylist(1)
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although greylistd(8) is written
mainly with Exim in mind, it should be possible to use it
with any MTA that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Allows arbitrary strings to be
passed on via a UNIX domain socket
(/var/run/greylistd/socket) or supplied to external programs
(greylist(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Can defer the incoming
delivery, based on the response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some MTAs either have limited or
no support for such external filters in the SMTP transaction
(e.g. Sendmail), or define a very custom interface for such
filters (e.g. Postifx <br>
&quot;Policy Servers&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That said, solutions exist for
these other MTAs as well. For Postfix, check into
&quot;postgrey&quot;, and for Sendmail there is
&quot;relaydelay&quot;. For other MTAs, check the links on

Harris&rsquo; greylisting project page:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/greylistd/config <br>
Configuration settings. Currently, this file consists of
three sections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[timeout] <br>
Lists various timeouts used to determine how long to keep a
new triplet greylisted, and when to expire previosly known
triplets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[socket] <br>
Specifies path and permissions of the UNIX domain socket on
which greylistd will listen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[data] <br>
Specifies the paths to the data files, containing the data
items and statistics, as well as an update interval
specifying how often data will be written to these
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/greylistd/states <br>
(default path, can be modified in the configuration
file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runtime data. Theare are four
sections: [white], [grey], [black] and [statistics]. The
first three sections consist of lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash = lastseen firstseen
count</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- hash is a 32-bit value
representing a given triplet,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- lastseen is a 32-bit value
representing the timestamp of last delivery attempt for this
triplet,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- firstseen is a 32-bit value
representing the timestamp of first known delivery attempt
for this triplet,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- count is a 32-bit value
representing the number of delivery attempts that have been
made for this triplet in this time period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The [statistics] section
contains a counter for each of the three lists, indicating
how many items that has ever made its way into these lists
by way of the update protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/greylistd/triplets <br>
(default path, can be modified in the configuration
file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unhashed data - i.e. the
original triplets passed to greylistd. Internally,
greylistd(8) hashes the provided data into a single 32-bit
value for efficiency. Prior to version <br>
0.6, the original data was not retained; as of version 0.6,
data is optionally saved into this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data items are saved in the
form: <br>
hash = data ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/greylistd/socket <br>
(default path, can be modified in the configuration
file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UNIX domain socket providing
the main interface to &quot;greylistd&quot;. The MTA can
either connect to this socket directly, or use the supplied
&quot;greylist&quot; utility to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Because triplets and timestamps are hashed into simple
32-bit values, there is a very slim chance that deliveries
that should have been greylisted are allowed through. More
so <br>
for very busy sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands are actually executed
in the daemon, not the &quot;greylist&quot; client. If the
user who invokes &quot;greylist&quot; interactively has a
different time zone than the daemon process, time <br>
and date representations in the output will reflect those of
the daemon.</p>
