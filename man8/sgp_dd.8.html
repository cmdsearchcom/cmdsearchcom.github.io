Copy data to and from any files. Specialised for &quot;files&quot; that are
  Linux SCSI generic (sg) and raw devices. Similar syntax and semantics to
  <b>dd(1)</b> but does not perform any conversions. Uses POSIX threads to
  increase the amount of parallelism. This improves speed in some cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first group in the synopsis above are &quot;standard&quot; Unix <b>dd(1)</b>
  operands. The second group are extra options added by this utility. Both
  groups are defined below.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>bpt</b>=<i>BPT</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">each IO transaction will be made using <i>BPT</i> blocks
      (or less if near the end of the copy). Default is 128 for block sizes less
      that 2048 bytes, otherwise the default is 32. So for bs=512 the reads and
      writes will each convey 64 KiB of data by default (less if near the end of
      the transfer or memory restrictions). When cd/dvd drives are accessed, the
      block size is typically 2048 bytes and bpt defaults to 32 which again
      implies 64 KiB transfers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>bs</b>=<i>BS</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">where <i>BS</i> <b>must</b> be the block size of the
      physical device. Note that this differs from <b>dd(1)</b> which permits
      'bs' to be an integral multiple of the actual device block size. Default
      is 512 which is usually correct for disks but incorrect for cdroms (which
      normally have 2048 byte blocks).</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">size of SCSI READ and/or WRITE commands issued on sg device
      names. Default is 10 byte SCSI command blocks (unless calculations
      indicate that a 4 byte block number may be exceeded, in which case it
      defaults to 16 byte SCSI commands).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>coe</b>=0 | 1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">set to 1 for continue on error. Only applies to errors on

      Default is the minimum (of <i>IFILE</i> and <i>OFILE</i>) number of blocks
      that sg devices report from SCSI READ CAPACITY commands or that block
      devices (or their partitions) report. Normal files are not probed for
      their size. If <i>skip=SKIP</i> or <i>skip=SEEK</i> are given and the
      count is deduced (i.e. not explicitly given) then that count is scaled
      back so that the copy will not overrun the device. If the file name is a
      block device partition and <i>COUNT</i> is not given then the size of the
      partition rather than the size of the whole device is used. If

Here is a list of flags and their meanings:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">append</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">causes the O_APPEND flag to be added to the open of
      <i>OFILE</i>. For normal files this will lead to data appended to the end
      of any existing data. Cannot be used together with the <i>seek=SEEK</i>
      option as they conflict. The default action of this utility is to
      overwrite any existing data from the beginning of the file or, if
      <i>SEEK</i> is given, starting at block <i>SEEK</i>. Note that attempting
      to 'append' to a device file (e.g. a disk) will usually be ignored or may
      cause an error to be reported.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">coe</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">continue on error. When given with 'iflag=', an error that
      is detected in a single SCSI command (typically 'bpt' blocks) is noted (by
      an error message sent to stderr), then zeros are substituted into the
      buffer for the corresponding write operation and the copy continues. Note
      that the <b>sg_dd</b> utility is more sophisticated in such error
      situations when 'iflag=coe'. When given with 'oflag=', any error reported
      by a SCSI WRITE command is reported to stderr and the copy continues (as
      if nothing went wrong).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">dio</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">request the sg device node associated with this flag does
      direct IO. If direct IO is not available, falls back to indirect IO and
      notes this at completion. If direct IO is selected and
      /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio has the value of 0 then a warning is issued (and
      indirect IO is performed).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">direct</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">causes the O_DIRECT flag to be added to the open of
      <i>IFILE</i> and/or <i>OFILE</i>. This flag requires some memory alignment
      on IO. Hence user memory buffers are aligned to the page size. Has no
      effect on sg, normal or raw files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">dpo</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">set the DPO bit (disable page out) in SCSI READ and WRITE
      commands. Not supported for 6 byte cdb variants of READ and WRITE.
      Indicates that data is unlikely to be required to stay in device (e.g.
      disk) cache. May speed media copy and/or cause a media copy to have less
      impact on other device users.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">dsync</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">causes the O_SYNC flag to be added to the open of
      <i>IFILE</i> and/or <i>OFILE</i>. The 'd' is prepended to lower confusion
      with the 'sync=0|1' option which has another action (i.e. a
      synchronisation to media at the end of the transfer).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">excl</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">causes the O_EXCL flag to be added to the open of
      <i>IFILE</i> and/or <i>OFILE</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fua</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">causes the FUA (force unit access) bit to be set in SCSI
      READ and/or WRITE commands. This only has effect with sg devices. The 6
      byte variants of the SCSI READ and WRITE commands do not support the FUA
      bit. Only active for sg device file names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">null</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">has no affect, just a placeholder.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETIRED_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RETIRED_OPTIONS">RETIRED
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
Here are some retired options that are still present:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">coe=0 | 1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">continue on error is 0 (off) by default. When it is 1, it
      is equivalent to 'iflag=coe oflag=coe' described in the FLAGS section
      above. Similar to 'conv=noerror,sync' in <b>dd(1)</b> utility. Default is
      0 which implies stop on error. More advanced coe=1 processing on reads is
      performed by the sg_dd utility.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fua=0 | 1 | 2 | 3</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">force unit access bit. When 3, fua is set on both
      <i>IFILE</i> and <i>OFILE</i>; when 2, fua is set on <i>IFILE</i>;, when
      1, fua is set on <i>OFILE</i>; when 0 (default), fua is cleared on both.
      See the 'fua' flag.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
A raw device must be bound to a block device prior to using sgp_dd. See
  <b>raw(8)</b> for more information about binding raw devices. To be safe, the
  sg device mapping to SCSI block devices should be checked with 'cat
  /proc/scsi/scsi' before use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Raw device partition information can often be found with <b>fdisk(8)</b> [the
  &quot;-ul&quot; argument is useful in this respect].
<div class="Pp"></div>
Various numeric arguments (e.g. <i>SKIP</i>) may include multiplicative suffixes
  or be given in hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in
  the sg3_utils(8) man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>COUNT</i>, <i>SKIP</i> and <i>SEEK</i> arguments can take 64 bit values
  (i.e. very big numbers). Other values are limited to what can fit in a signed
  32 bit number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Data usually gets to the user space in a 2 stage process: first the SCSI adapter
  DMAs into kernel buffers and then the sg driver copies this data into user
  memory (write operations reverse this sequence). This is called &quot;indirect
  IO&quot; and there is a 'dio' option to select &quot;direct IO&quot; which
  will DMA directly into user memory. Due to some issues &quot;direct IO&quot;
  is disabled in the sg driver and needs a configuration change to activate it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All informative, warning and error output is sent to stderr so that dd's output
  file can be stdout and remain unpolluted. If no options are given, then the
  usage message is output and nothing else happens.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Why use sgp_dd? Because in some cases it is twice as fast as dd (mainly with sg
  devices, raw devices give some improvement). Another reason is that big copies
  fill the block device caches which has a negative impact on other machine
  activity.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE
  output the number of remaining blocks to be transferred and the records in +
  out counts; then they have their default action. SIGUSR1 causes the same
  information to be output yet the copy continues. All output caused by signals
  is sent to stderr.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Looks quite similar in usage to dd:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=t bs=512 count=1MB
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will copy 1 million 512 byte blocks from the device associated with
  /dev/sg0 (which should have 512 byte blocks) to a file called t. Assuming
  /dev/sda and /dev/sg0 are the same device then the above is equivalent to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 dd if=/dev/sda of=t bs=512 count=1000000
<div class="Pp"></div>
although dd's speed may improve if bs was larger and count was correspondingly
  scaled. Using a raw device to do something similar on a ATA disk:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hda
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 sgp_dd if=/dev/raw/raw1 of=t bs=512 count=1MB
<div class="Pp"></div>
To copy a SCSI disk partition to an ATA disk partition:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 raw /dev/raw/raw2 /dev/hda3
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 skip=10123456 of=/dev/raw/raw2 bs=512
<div class="Pp"></div>
This assumes a valid partition is found on the SCSI disk at the given skip block
  address (past the 5 GB point of that disk) and that the partition goes to the
  end of the SCSI disk. An explicit count is probably a safer option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To do a fast copy from one SCSI disk to another one with similar geometry
  (stepping over errors on the source disk):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=/dev/sg1 bs=512 coe=1
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
The exit status of sgp_dd is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
  sg3_utils(8) man page. Since this utility works at a higher level than
  individual commands, and there are 'coe' and 'retries' flags, individual SCSI
  command failures do not necessary cause the process to exit.
