<p>RESTORE(8) Cyrus IMAP RESTORE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
restore - Cyrus IMAP documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restore content from Cyrus
backups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
restore [OPTIONS] server [MODE] backup [ mboxname | uniqueid
| guid ]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
restore is a tool for restoring messages and mailboxes from
a Cyrus backup to a Cyrus IMAP server. It must be run from
the server containing the backup storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore reads its configuration
options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified
otherwise by -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server specifies the destination
server to which content should be restored. It should be of
the form &rsquo;host[:port]&rsquo;, where host is either a
hostname, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 <br>
address, and where the optional port is either a known
service name (see services(5)) or a decimal port number. If
port is omitted, imap will be tried first, followed by
csync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The destination server must
point to either an imapd(8) instance with the replication
capability enabled, or a sync_server(8) instance. In either
case it must be Cyrus version <br>
3.0 or newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore will authenticate to the
destination server according to the restore_authname,
restore_password and restore_realm configuration options.
The credentials should corre&acirc; <br>
spond with one of the destination server&rsquo;s admins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup is interpreted according
to the specified MODE. See Modes below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither -a nor -F options
were provided, then the remaining arguments constitute a
list of objects to be restored. These may be mailboxes
(specified by either mboxname or <br>
uniqueid) or messages (specified by their guid). The objects
may be specified in any order, and both mailboxes and
individual messages may be restored in one go. cyr_backup(8)
<br>
can be used to identify objects to restore from a Cyrus
backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected mailboxes will have
their messages restored to a mailbox of the same name, which
will be created if necessary. Individually-selected messages
will be restored to the <br>
mailboxes in which they previously existed. In both cases
the -M option can be used to overrride the destination
mailbox (see below), but note the consequences of doing this
<br>
when multiple mailbox objects have been specified, or when
the -r option is in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailboxes that are created
during the restoration process will have their ACL set to
the one stored in the backup. The -A option can be used to
override this. Mailboxes that <br>
are not created during the restoration process (i.e. when
restoring into mailboxes that already exists) will not have
their ACLs altered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A [acl] <br>
Apply specified acl to restored mailboxes, rather than their
ACLs as stored in the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If acl is the empty string (e.g.
-A &quot;&quot;) or is unspecified, mailboxes will be
restored with the default ACL for their destination owner.
This is mostly useful when restor&acirc; <br>
ing folders from one user&rsquo;s backup into a different
user&rsquo;s mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C config-file <br>
Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than
the default imapd.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Don&rsquo;t trim
deletedprefix from mailbox names prior to restoring. This is
mainly useful for rebuilding failed servers, where deleted
mailboxes should be restored as deleted <br>
mailboxes, not as new ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to trim the
prefix before restoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the original server from
which the backups were produced had delete_mode set to
immediate, then the mailboxes in the backup will not have
such a prefix, and this option <br>
won&rsquo;t have any useful effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See imapd.conf(5) for
information about the deletedprefix and delete_mode
configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F input-file <br>
Get the list of mailboxes or messages from input-file
instead of from the command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input-file should contain one
object specification (either an mboxname, a uniqueid, or a
guid) per line. Empty lines, and lines beginning with a
&rsquo;#&rsquo; character, are <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Local operations only.
Actions required to restore the requested mailboxes and
messages will be performed on the destination server only.
mupdate(8) actions will not <br>
occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is for mupdate
actions to occur if the destination server is part of a
murder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect if the
destination server is not part of a murder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M mboxname <br>
Messages are restored to the mailbox with the specified
mboxname. If no mailbox of this name exists, one will be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple mailbox objects are
to be restored, whether due to being specified on the
command line, in an input-file, or via the -r option, then
the collective contents of <br>
all such mailboxes will be restored to the single mailbox
mboxname. This may not be what you want!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default when restoring
mailboxes is to restore their respective contents into
mailboxes of the same names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default when restoring
individual messages is to restore them into their original
mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P partition <br>
Restore mailboxes to the specified partition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Try to preserve uidvalidity
and other related fields, such that the restored mailboxes
and messages appear like they never left, and IMAP clients
can avoid expensive state <br>
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can only occur if the
mailboxes to be restored do not already exist on the
destination server. As such, this option is mainly useful
when rebuilding a failed server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the destination mailboxes
already exist, restored messages will be appended as if
newly delivered, regardless of whether the -U option was
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Do not restore messages that
are marked as expunged in the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also -x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Try to restore all mailboxes
in the specified backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do nothing. The work required
to perform the restoration will be calculated (and reported
depending on verbosity level), but no restoration will take
place, and no con&acirc; <br>
nection will be made to the destination server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the server argument is
still mandatory with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Recurse into submailboxes.
When restoring mailboxes, also restore any mailboxes
contained within them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to restore only
explicitly-specified mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase the verbosity level.
This option can be specified multiple times for additional
verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w seconds <br>
Wait seconds before starting. This is useful for attaching a
debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Only restore messages that
are marked as expunged in the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be convenient for
restoring messages that were accidentally deleted by the
user, without needing to track down individual message
guids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also -X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Require compression for
server connection. The restore will abort if compression is
unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
-f backup is interpreted as a filename. The named file does
not need to be known about in the backups database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m backup is interpreted as a
mailbox name. There must be a known backup for the user
whose mailbox this is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known backups are recorded in
the database specified by the backup_db and backup_db_path
configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u backup is interpreted as a
userid. There must be a known backup for the specified
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default if no mode
is specified.</p>
