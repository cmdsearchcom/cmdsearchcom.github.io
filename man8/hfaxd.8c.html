<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hfaxd - HylaFAX client-server protocol server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/hfaxd [ -d ] [ -D secs ] [ -q dir ] [ -c config ]
[ -o port ] [ -O ] [ -f bindaddressfamily ] [ -l bindaddress
] [ -p pasv_min_port:pasv_max_port ] [ -i port ] [ -I ] [
<br>
-s port ] [ -S ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hfaxd is the HylaFAX program that implements the server
portion of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the
client-server protocol and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the Simple
Network Paging Protocol (SNPP) used to submit message pager
jobs to the IXO/TAP and UCP support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional client-server
protocols are planned and hfaxd is intended to be the
&lsquo;&lsquo;carrier&rsquo;&rsquo; through which they are
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfaxd is typically used in one
of two ways; either as a stand-alone process that is started
at system boot time to listen for client connections on one
or more ports (in which <br>
case the -i, -o, or -s option must be used), or as a
subservient process to the inetd(8C) program. The two forms
of use may however be combined so long as the same service
is <br>
not provided both by the stand-alone hfaxd and through
inetd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HYLAFAX CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL
SUPPORT <br>
If hfaxd is started with the -i option it will service
clients using the HylaFAX client-server protocol. This
protocol is strongly related to the Internet File Transfer
Protocol <br>
(FTP); so much so in fact that FTP client programs that
include support for &lsquo;&lsquo;quoted
commands&rsquo;&rsquo; may be used to communicate with hfaxd
using the new protocol. (It should also be <br>
possible to use FTP-aware World Wide Web browsers such as
Mosaic and Netscape Navigator to access HylaFAX servers
through the new protocol; but the current format for
information <br>
returned in directory listings confuses them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hfaxd server currently
recognizes the following protocol requests; case is not
distinguished. Entries marked with a &Acirc;&sup1; can be
used only when the client has established admin&acirc; <br>
istrative privileges with ADMIN.</p>

command is received during a data transfer, preceded by a
Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE NETWORK PAGING PROTOCOL
(SNPP) SUPPORT <br>
If hfaxd is started with the -s option it will service
clients using the Simple Network Pager Protocol (SNPP) as

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hfaxd server currently
recognizes the SNPP protocol requests listed below. Requests
marked with a &Acirc;&sup1; are non-standard extensions to
RFC 1861 that may be added to SNPP at some <br>
future time. Case is not distinguished and only the first
four characters of requests are used in identifying

net stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following non-standard or

HELP give help information, e.g., SITE HELP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that hfaxd requires that
SNPP clients login first with the LOGI directive while RFC
1861 permits clients to submit pages anonymously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT ACCESS CONTROL <br>
hfaxd controls client access according to the information in
the file /var/spool/hylafax/etc/hosts.hfaxd. This file
defines the set of users and machines that may receive
ser&acirc; <br>
vice and, optionally, defines password challenges to use in
authenticating clients. Clients may be permitted access to
services with or without a password challenge. Access may
<br>
also be restricted based on the host machine that a request
for service originates from. Consult hosts.hfaxd(5F) for
information on the format and content of this file. The <br>
SITE ADDUSER protocol request is provided for adding new
users to a server (available only to clients with
administrative privileges).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server resources are controlled
based on clients&rsquo; identities. Jobs and documents, both
received and submitted, are protected by the server.
Typically clients are permitted <br>
access to anything they own or that is publicly accessible.
There are also administrative privileges that clients may
acquire and which permit them wide access to objects that
<br>
reside on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A complete client-server
protocol specification is still outstanding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfaxd operates with its root
directory set to the top of the HylaFAX spooling area;
/var/spool/hylafax. This is done so that clients see a
virtual file hierarchy that is com&acirc; <br>
pletely contained within the HylaFAX operating environment
on the server machine. Administrators however must be aware
of this action when specifying files in the hfaxd
configu&acirc; <br>
ration file: absolute pathnames relative to the root of the
spooling should be used to specify filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER ACCESS CONTROL <br>
The file /var/spool/hylafax/etc/shutdown, when present,
specifies when to restrict access to a server machine. When
this file is present and contains valid information hfaxd
<br>
will permit only users with administrative privileges to
access the server. Any other users that request service will
be denied access and negative server responses will include
<br>
any shutdown message specified in the shutdown file. Consult
hylafax-shutdown(5F) for information on the format and
content of this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SHUT protocol request can be
used to schedule a server shutdown; it is available only to
clients with administrative privileges. To make a shutdown
server available again <br>
the shutdown file can be deleted with the DELE protocol
request (this is to be replaced with an
&lsquo;&lsquo;unshut&rsquo;&rsquo; protocol request so that
implementation details are not part of the <br>
protocol).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
hfaxd reads configuration information from the file
/etc/hylafax/hfaxd.conf each time a new server process is
started (i.e. for each new client). This file uses the same
conven&acirc; <br>
tions used by other HylaFAX configuration files; as
described in hylafax-config(5F). The following configuration
parameters are recognized; items marked
&lsquo;&lsquo;(SNPP)&rsquo;&rsquo; are used only <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration parameters are
explained below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FaxContact <br>
The e-mail address to display as a point of contact in the
help text returned to a client in response to the HELP or
SITE HELP commands. By default this is
&lsquo;&lsquo;FaxMas&acirc; <br>
ter@hostname&rsquo;&rsquo;, where hostname is the fully
qualified name for the machine where the server is
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FileFmt The format string to use
when returning file status information with the LIST and
STAT commands. Formats are specified using printf(3S) style
conventions but using the <br>
field identifiers listed below. Each item can include field
width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just
as for printf; e.g. %-8p for an 8-character <br>
wide, left-justified, blank-padded field containing the file
protection flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format Description <br>
a Last access time <br>
c Creation time <br>
d Device number (octal) <br>
f Filename <br>
g Group identifier (decimal) <br>
i Inode number (decimal) <br>
l Link count (decimal) <br>
m Last modification time <br>
o Owner (based on file GID) <br>
p Fax-style protection flags (no group bits) <br>
q UNIX-style protection flags <br>
r Root device number (octal) <br>
s File size in bytes (decimal) <br>
u User identifier (decimal)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format string is
&lsquo;&lsquo;%-7p %3l %8o %8s %-12.12m %.48f&rsquo;&rsquo;.
It is recommended that all items include a field width so
that client applications that construct <br>
headers from the format string can constrain the width of
column title strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IdleTimeout <br>
The initial/default timeout to use in timing out idle
clients. This value defines the maximum amount of time (in
seconds) that hfaxd will wait for a command from a <br>
client before terminating the connection. Unprivileged
clients may alter the idle timeout up to the value of
MaxIdleTimeout; privileged clients may set the timeout to
<br>
any value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JobFmt The format string to use
when returning job status information for jobs in the sendq
and doneq directories. Formats are specified using
printf(3S) style conventions <br>
but using the field identifiers listed below. Each item can
include field width, precision, left-justification,
0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-3j for a <br>
3-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded field
containing the job state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format Description <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format string is
&lsquo;&lsquo;%-4j %3i %1a %6.6o %-12.12e %5P %5D %7z
%.25s&rsquo;&rsquo;. This string constrains each status line
to be less than 80 characters. It is recom&acirc; <br>
mended that all items include a field width so that client
applications, such as faxstat(1) that construct headers from
the format string can constrain the width of <br>
column title strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JobHostID A formatted string of
the format
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;id&gt;[:&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;:&lt;adminwd&gt;]]&rsquo;&rsquo;
that identifies a job host. Multiple instances of JobHostID
are used in the con&acirc; <br>
figuration file to identify multiple job hosts.
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;id&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; is a numeric
identification for the host which is prepended onto job ids
created by that host. This is used <br>
by a client to distinguish between jobs created on different
hosts when it may not initially know to which server it
connected. &lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;id&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; must be
the same number of dig&acirc; <br>
its for all configured job hosts. For compatibility with all
clients &lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;id&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; must be
numeric only. If the instance of JobHostID only includes
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;id&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; then it is <br>
understood to refer to the local host and not a remote host.
It is this configuration entry that causes the prepending of
the &lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;id&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; number onto the
job ids. The <br>
other values for the formatted string refer to connection
details for user-level and admin-level login at the
identified remote host. If only
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;host&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; is provided <br>
then the current user&rsquo;s login credentials are used for
the chained connection. This configuration will cause hfaxd
to connect as a client to the specified remote host <br>
for the requested action when the job id provided by its
client refers to that remote host (the provided job id
matches the &lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;id&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; value in
the host&rsquo;s JobHostID con&acirc; <br>
figuration). To do this the hfaxd client connection to the
remote host requires administrative privileges or
synchonized user accounts on both hosts. Be aware that <br>
when providing &lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;username&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;password&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo;, and especially
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;adminwd&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; in the
configuration that this may compromise job security on the
remote host since users <br>
from this host will be connecting to the remote host as a
different user (and possibly with administrative
privileges). As a null value for
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;adminwd&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; is
permissi&acirc; <br>
ble, administrative privileges may be omitted by using
&lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; for
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;adminwd&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo;. Because of the
chroot under which the client instance of hfaxd operates it
will be nec&acirc; <br>
essary to copy numerous system files to the HylaFAX spool
directory structure so that the chained client connection
can be made to the remote job host. This copy <br>
should be repeated after any upgrades or changes to the
system files. To identify which files must be copied one may
examine strace output for faxstat and look for <br>
which files it opens in the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JobProtection <br>
The default setting of &lsquo;&lsquo;0644&rsquo;&rsquo;
allows all users to view all job parameters in the send and
done queues. The mode determines the permissions of the
clients to see the <br>
jobs, following the HylaFAX permission model of the group
bits controlling uid permissions and the other bits
controlling other permissions. A setting of
&lsquo;&lsquo;0640&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
allows only the job owner and the administrator to view
jobs. If a user doesn&rsquo;t have permissions on the job,
the job will not be visible to them when viewing the <br>
queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KillTimeMap <br>
The mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job expiration
time (kill time). A mapping is specified as a string of
space-separate numbers where each value is the <br>
number of minutes to permit a job to run. The default
mapping is &lsquo;&lsquo;5 5 5 15 60 240 720 1440 1440 1440
1440 1440&rsquo;&rsquo; which expires a job in 5 minutes for
service levels <br>
0-2, 15 minutes for level three, 60 minutes for level four,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDAPServerURI <br>
The full address of the ldap server including port number,
i.e.: ldaps://1.2.3.4:636 (for secure connections) or
ldap://1.2.3.4:389 (for insecure connections)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDAPBaseDN <br>
The full LDAP context where user objects can be found, i.e.:
ou=users,dc=example,dc=com for Active Directory/LDAP or
ou=users,o=organization for Novell eDirectory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDAPReqGroup <br>
The full LDAP context of the group users have to be a member
of to gain HylaFAX access for sending faxes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDAPVersion <br>
Version number of the LDAP Protocol to use (default is
&rsquo;3&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LogFacility <br>
The symbolic name for the syslog(3) facility to use when
logging error messages and informational/debugging messages
requested through the ServerTracing parameter. The <br>
list of facility names is found in the system include file
&lt;syslog.h&gt;; comparisons are case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxAdminAttempts <br>
The maximum number of unsuccessful attempts gain
administrative privileges with the ADMIN command that hfaxd
will permit a client before terminating the connection. <br>
Note that the count of attempts is reset if/when the client
successfully gains administrative privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxConsecutiveBadCmds <br>
The maximum number of consecutive unrecognized,
unimplemented, syntactically incorrect, or otherwise
unacceptable commands to permit a client before terminating
the <br>
connection. This control has two purposes: to handle naive
or malicious clients from sending long streams of nonsense
commands to a server, and to ensure that clients <br>
are forcibly terminated when a server is marked
shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxIdleTimeout <br>
The maximum value that a client may set the idle timeout to.
This value is not enforced if the client has administrative
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxLoginAttempts <br>
The maximum number of unsuccessful attempts to login with
the USER and PASS commands that hfaxd will permit a client
before terminating the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxMsgLength <br>
The maximum number of characters to accept in a pager
message specified with the DATA or MESS commands. Messages
longer than this value are rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ModemFmt The format string to
use when returning modem status information for modems
listed in the status directory. Formats are specified using
printf(3S) style conventions <br>
but using the field identifiers listed below. Each item can
include field width, precision, left-justification,
0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-8h for an <br>
8-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded field
containing the name of the host the server is running
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format Description <br>
h Server hostname <br>
l Local identifier string <br>
m Canonical modem name <br>
n FAX phone number <br>
r Maximum pages that can be received in a single call <br>
s Status information string <br>
t Server and session tracing levels (xxxxx:yyyyy) <br>
v Modem speaker volume as one-character symbol <br>
z A &lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; if a faxgetty(8C) process
is running; otherwise &lsquo;&lsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo;
(space)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format string is
&lsquo;&lsquo;Modem %m (%n): %s&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PagerIDMapFile <br>
The absolute pathname of the file that contains directions
for mapping pager identifiers to IXO/TAP or UCP service
providers (and optionally a pager identification num&acirc;
<br>
ber). Consult pagermap(5F) for information on the format and
content of this file. (Note that absolute pathnames are
relative to the root of the spooling area).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PriorityMap <br>
The mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job scheduling
priority. A mapping is specified as a string of
space-separate numbers where each value is the priority to
<br>
assign to a job. The default mapping is &lsquo;&lsquo;63 127
127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127&rsquo;&rsquo; which
assigns a high priority to service level zero and normal
(default) <br>
priority to all other service levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RcvFmt The format string to use
when returning status information for received facsimile in
the recvq directory. Formats are specified using printf(3S)
style conventions but <br>
using the field identifiers listed below. Each item can
include field width, precision, left-justification,
0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-3b for a
3-char&acirc; <br>
acter wide, left-justified, blank-padded field containing
the signalling rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format Description <br>
X Reception indicator (1=yes, 0=no) <br>
Y Received date and time <br>
Z Received time in seconds since the UNIX epoch <br>
a SubAddress received from sender (if any) <br>
b Signalling rate used during receive <br>
d Data format used during receive <br>
e Error description if an error occurred during receive <br>
f Document filename (relative to the recvq directory) <br>
h Time spent receiving document (HH:MM:SS) <br>
l Page length in mm <br>
m Fax-style protection mode string
(&lsquo;&lsquo;-rwxrwx&rsquo;&rsquo;) <br>
n File size (number of bytes) <br>
o File owner <br>
p Number of pages in document <br>
q UNIX-style protection flags <br>
r Resolution of received data <br>
s Sender identity (TSI) <br>
t Compact representation of the time when the receive
happened <br>
w Page width in mm <br>
z A &lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; if receive is going on;
otherwise &lsquo;&lsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo; (space)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format string is
&lsquo;&lsquo;%-7m %4p%1z %-8.8o %14.14s %7t
%f&rsquo;&rsquo;. This string constrains each status line to
be less than 80 characters. It is recommended that all <br>
items include a field width so that client applications,
such as faxstat(1) that construct headers from the format
string can constrain the width of column title <br>
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RecvqProtection <br>
The permissions setting for administrator, owners, and users
for viewing files in the HylaFAX receive queue. The default
setting of &lsquo;&lsquo;0444&rsquo;&rsquo; allows all users
to view <br>
all files in the queues. A setting of
&lsquo;&lsquo;0440&rsquo;&rsquo; allows only the job owner
and the administrator to view files. A setting of
&lsquo;&lsquo;0040&rsquo;&rsquo; allows only the
administrator to <br>
view the files. If a user doesn&rsquo;t have permissions on
the file, the file will not be visible to them when viewing
the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RetryTimeMap <br>
The mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job retry
time. A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate
numbers where each value is the number of seconds to <br>
delay between delivery attempts. A value of zero causes
retries to be scheduled using the default algorithm used by
the HylaFAX job scheduler. The default mapping is <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;30 60 60 180 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0&rsquo;&rsquo;
which retries a level 0 job after a 30 second delay, levels
1 and 2 after 60 seconds, level 3 after 3 minutes, and other
jobs are <br>
retried according to the usual scheduling algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerTracing <br>
A number that controls the generation of tracing information
by a server. areas that are individually controlled. To
enable tracing of multiple areas of operation, <br>
the flag associated with each area should be bit-or&rsquo;d
to form the value for this tag. <br>
Flag Description <br>
1 (0x00001) General server operation <br>
2 (0x00002) Client-server protocol requests and responses
<br>
4 (0x00004) File transfers from client to server <br>
8 (0x00008) File transfers from server to client <br>
16 (0x00010) Client logins <br>
32 (0x00020) All network connections <br>
64 (0x00040) FIFO messages to and from faxq(8C) <br>
128 (0x00080) TIFF Library errors and warnings <br>
256 (0x00100) Configuration file processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tracing messages are directed to
syslog(3) using the facility specified with the LogFacility
configuration parameter. Note that syslogd(8C) must be
configured to cap&acirc; <br>
ture facility.info, facility.debug, facility.warning, and
facility.err messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShutdownFile <br>
The absolute pathname of the server shutdown file; see
hylafax-shutdown(5F) for information on the format and
content of this file. (Note that absolute pathnames are <br>
relative to the root of the spooling area).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UserAccessFile <br>
The absolute pathname of the user access control file; see
hosts.hfaxd(5F) for information on the format and content of
this file. (Note that absolute pathnames are <br>
relative to the root of the spooling area).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XferLogFile <br>
The absolute pathname of the file to use for logging
client-server file transfers (when enabled through the
ServerTracing parameter). (Note that absolute pathnames are
<br>
relative to the root of the spooling area).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q dir The specified directory is treated as the spooling
area. The default spooling area, /var/spool/hylafax, is
defined at the time the software is built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Stop hfaxd from detaching
itself from the controlling terminal. This option is
normally used only when running hfaxd under a debugger or
when hfaxd is started up from <br>
the inetd(8C) process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D secs Sleep for the specified
number of seconds before actually processing the client to
allow a debugger to attach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f bindaddressfamily <br>
Bind to the specified bindaddressfamily tcp port. Options
are &lsquo;&lsquo;IPv4&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;IPv6&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;all&rsquo;&rsquo;. Please note that this
argument needs to be specified before -i otherwise <br>
it will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l bindaddress <br>
Bind to the specified bindaddress tcp port. Please note that
this argument needs to be specified before -i otherwise it
will be ignored. A better approach to improve <br>
security would be to run hfaxd from xinetd, binding its
service to the specific port. This will also make hylafax
benefits from tcp wrappers and other options provided <br>
by xinetd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port:port <br>
Restrict the range of TCP ports used when binding the socket
for PASV/EPSV mode data transfers. Without this option, bind
will be called with a port of 0, allowing the <br>
kernel to allocate an ephemeral port. To be useful, -p MUST
be specified BEFORE -i due to the way command line arguments
are parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i port Listen on the specified
port for service requests and respond with the client-server
protocol. The port may be specified either symbolically,
e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;hylafax&rsquo;&rsquo; or <br>
numerically. This flag may be specified multiple times to
request service on multiple different ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s port Listen on the specified
port for service requests and respond with the Simple
Network Paging (SNPP) protocol. The port may be specified
either symbolically, e.g. <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;snpp&rsquo;&rsquo; or numerically. This flag
may be specified multiple times to request service on
multiple different ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Service the client-server
protocol using the standard input and output. This option is
useful when hfaxd is started up by inetd(8C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Service the Simple Network
Paging (SNPP) protocol using the standard input and output.
This option is useful when hfaxd is started up by
inetd(8C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Diagnostics generated by hfaxd are logged using
syslog(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config Treat config as a
configuration parameter specification that is interpreted
after reading the configuration file. For example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;-c servertracing:0x4f&rsquo;&rsquo; would set
the <br>
ServerTracing configuration parameter to
&lsquo;&lsquo;0x4f&rsquo;&rsquo;, overriding any setting in
the configuration file.</p>
