<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cupsaddsmb - export printers to samba for windows
clients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cupsaddsmb [ -H samba-server ] [ -U
samba-user[%samba-password] ] [ -h cups-server[:port] ] [ -v
] -a <br>
cupsaddsmb [ -H samba-server ] [ -U
samba-user[%samba-password] ] [ -h cups-server[:port] ] [ -v
] printer [ ... printer ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cupsaddsmb exports printers to the SAMBA software (version
2.2.0 or higher) for use with Windows clients. Depending on
the SAMBA configuration, you may need to provide a password
<br>
to export the printers. This program requires the Windows
printer driver files described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
cupsaddsmb supports the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H samba-server <br>
Specifies the SAMBA server which defaults to the CUPS
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U samba-user[%samba-password]
<br>
Specifies the SAMBA print admin username which defaults to
your current username. If the username contains a percent
(%) character, then the text following the percent is <br>
treated as the SAMBA password to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a <br>
Exports all known printers. Otherwise only the named
printers are exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h cups-server[:port] <br>
Specifies a different CUPS server to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Specifies that verbose information should be shown. This is
useful for debugging SAMBA configuration problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAMBA CONFIGURATION <br>
cupsaddsmb uses the new RPC-based printing support in SAMBA
2.2.x to provide printer drivers and PPD files to Windows
client machines. In order to use this functionality, you
<br>
must first configure the SAMBA smb.conf(5) file to support
printing through CUPS and provide a printer driver download
share, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[global] <br>
load printers = yes <br>
printing = cups <br>
printcap name = cups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[printers] <br>
comment = All Printers <br>
path = /var/spool/samba <br>
browseable = no <br>
public = yes <br>
guest ok = yes <br>
writable = no <br>
printable = yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[print$] <br>
comment = Printer Drivers <br>
path = /etc/samba/drivers <br>
browseable = yes <br>
guest ok = no <br>
read only = yes <br>
write list = root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This configuration assumes a
FHS-compliant installation of SAMBA; adjust the [printers]
and [print$] share paths accordingly on your system as
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MICROSOFT POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR
WINDOWS <br>
The base driver for Windows 2000 and higher is the Microsoft
PostScript driver, which is available on any system running
Windows 2000 or higher in the %WINDIR%&acirc; <br>
TEM32OLSW32X863 folder for 32-bit drivers and
%WINDIR%TEM32OLS4-bit drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CUPS printer driver is
preferred over the Microsoft driver since it supports the
page-label, job-billing, and job-hold-until options fully on
all printers. However, currently <br>
only Windows 2000 and higher is supported by the Microsoft
driver, so you will also need to get the Adobe driver to
support Windows 95, 98, and Me clients. The Adobe and
Micro&acirc; <br>
soft drivers for Windows 2000 are identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have extracted the
driver files, copy the 32-bit drivers to the
/usr/share/cups/drivers directory and the 64-bit drivers to
the /usr/share/cups/drivers/x64 directory <br>
exactly as named below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Windows 2000 and higher] <br>
ps5ui.dll <br>
pscript.hlp <br>
pscript.ntf <br>
pscript5.dll</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Unlike Windows, case is
significant - make sure that you use the lowercase filenames
shown above, otherwise cupsaddsmb will fail to export the
drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUPS POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR
WINDOWS <br>
cupsaddsmb can use the CUPS v6 PostScript printer driver for
Windows, which is available for download from the CUPS web
site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CUPS printer driver is
preferred over the Adobe and Microsoft drivers since it
supports the page-label, job-billing, and job-hold-until
options fully on all printers. How&acirc; <br>
ever, currently only Windows 2000 and higher is supported by
the CUPS driver, so you will also need to get the Adobe
driver to support Windows 95, 98, and Me clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have extracted the
driver files, copy the 32-bit drivers to the
/usr/share/cups/drivers directory and the 64-bit drivers to
the /usr/share/cups/drivers/x64 directory <br>
exactly as named below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Windows 2000 and higher] <br>
cups6.inf (from www.cups.org) <br>
cups6.ini (from www.cups.org) <br>
cupsps6.dll (from www.cups.org) <br>
cupsui6.dll (from www.cups.org) <br>
ps5ui.dll (from your Windows system) <br>
pscript.hlp (from your Windows system) <br>
pscript.ntf (from your Windows system) <br>
pscript5.dll (from your Windows system)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Unlike Windows, case is
significant - make sure that you use the lowercase filenames
shown above, otherwise cupsaddsmb will fail to export the
drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADOBE POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR
WINDOWS 95, 98, AND ME <br>
cupsaddsmb can use the Adobe PostScript printer driver for
Windows 95, 98, and ME, which are available for download
from the Adobe web site (http://www.adobe.com).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Adobe driver does not
support the page-label, job-billing, or job-hold-until
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have installed the
driver on a Windows system, copy the following files to the
/usr/share/cups/drivers directory exactly as named
below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Windows 95, 98, and Me] <br>
ADFONTS.MFM <br>
ADOBEPS4.DRV <br>
ADOBEPS4.HLP <br>
ICONLIB.DLL <br>
PSMON.DLL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Unlike Windows, case is
significant - make sure that you use the UPPERCASE filenames
shown above, otherwise cupsaddsmb will fail to export the
drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
Getting the full set of Windows driver files should be
easier.</p>
