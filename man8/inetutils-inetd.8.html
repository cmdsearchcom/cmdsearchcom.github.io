The <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> program should be run at boot time by
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/rc</i> (see <a class="Xr" title="Xr">rc(8)</a>).
  It then listens for connections on certain internet sockets. When a connection
  is found on one of its sockets, it decides what service the socket corresponds
  to, and invokes a program to service the request. The server program is
  invoked with the service socket as its standard input, output and error
  descriptors. After the program is finished, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b>
  continues to listen on the socket (except in some cases which will be
  described below). Essentially, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> allows
  running one daemon to invoke several others, reducing load on the system.

Upon execution, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> reads its configuration
  information from a configuration file on the command line, by default,
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/inetd.conf and /etc/inetd.d</i>. If the
  configuration pathname is a directory, all the files in the directory are read
  like a configuration file. All of the configuration files are read and merged.
  There must be an entry for each field in the configuration file, with entries
  for each field separated by a tab or a space. Comments are denoted by a ``#''
  at the beginning of a line. The fields of the configuration file are as
  follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre class="Li">
service name 
socket type 
protocol 
wait/nowait[.max] 
user 
server program 
server program arguments
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two types of services that <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> can
  start: standard and TCPMUX. A standard service has a well-known port assigned
  to it; it may be a service that implements an official Internet standard or is
  a BSD-specific service. As described in RFC 1078, TCPMUX services are
  nonstandard services that do not have a well-known port assigned to them. They
  are invoked from <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> when a program connects to
  the &#x201C;tcpmux&#x201D; well-known port and specifies the service name.
  This feature is useful for adding locally-developed servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">service-name</i> entry is the name of a valid
  service in the file <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/services</i>. For
  &#x201C;internal&#x201D; services (discussed below), the service name
  <i class="Em" title="Em">must</i> be the official name of the service (that
  is, the first entry in <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/services</i>). For TCPMUX
  services, the value of the <i class="Em" title="Em">service-name</i> field
  consists of the string &#x201C;tcpmux&#x201D; followed by a slash and the
  locally-chosen service name. The service names listed in
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/services</i> and the name &#x201C;help&#x201D;
  are reserved. Try to choose unique names for your TCPMUX services by prefixing
  them with your organization's name and suffixing them with a version number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">socket-type</i> should be one of
  &#x201C;stream&#x201D;, &#x201C;dgram&#x201D;, &#x201C;raw&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;rdm&#x201D;, or &#x201C;seqpacket&#x201D;, depending on whether the
  socket is a stream, datagram, raw, reliably delivered message, or sequenced
  packet socket. TCPMUX services must use &#x201C;stream&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">protocol</i> must be a valid protocol as given in
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/protocols</i>. Examples might be
  &#x201C;tcp&#x201D; or &#x201C;udp&#x201D;. TCPMUX services must use
  &#x201C;tcp&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">wait/nowait[.max]</i> entry specifies whether the
  server that is invoked by inetd will take over the socket associated with the
  service access point, and thus whether <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b>
  should wait for the server to exit before listening for new service requests.
  Datagram servers must use &#x201C;wait&#x201D;, as they are always invoked
  with the original datagram socket bound to the specified service address.
  These servers must read at least one datagram from the socket before exiting.
  If a datagram server connects to its peer, freeing the socket so
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> can received further messages on the
  socket, it is said to be a &#x201C;multi-threaded&#x201D; server; it should
  read one datagram from the socket and create a new socket connected to the
  peer. It should fork, and the parent should then exit to allow
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> to check for new service requests to spawn
  new servers. Datagram servers which process all incoming datagrams on a socket
  and eventually time out are said to be &#x201C;single-threaded&#x201D;.
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">Comsat(8)</a>, (<a class="Xr" title="Xr">biff(1)</a>)
  and <a class="Xr" title="Xr">talkd(8)</a> are both examples of the latter type
  of datagram server. <a class="Xr" title="Xr">Tftpd(8)</a> is an example of a
  multi-threaded datagram server. The optional &#x201C;max&#x201D; suffix
  (separated from &#x201C;wait&#x201D; or &#x201C;nowait&#x201D; by a dot)
  specifies the maximum number of times a service can be invoked in one minute;
  the default is 40. If a service exceeds this limit,
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> will log the problem and stop servicing
  requests for the specific service for ten minutes. See also the
  <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-R</b> option above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Servers using stream sockets generally are multi-threaded and use the
  &#x201C;nowait&#x201D; entry. Connection requests for these services are
  accepted by <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b>, and the server is given only
  the newly-accepted socket connected to a client of the service. Most
  stream-based services operate in this manner. Stream-based servers that use
  &#x201C;wait&#x201D; are started with the listening service socket, and must
  accept at least one connection request before exiting. Such a server would
  normally accept and process incoming connection requests until a timeout.
  TCPMUX services must use &#x201C;nowait&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The optional &#x201C;max&#x201D; suffix (separated from &#x201C;wait&#x201D; or
  &#x201C;nowait&#x201D; by a dot) is a decimal number that specifies the
  maximum number of server instances that may be spawned from
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> within an interval of 60 seconds. It
  overrides the settings of the <b>-R</b> command line option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">user</i> entry should contain the user name of the
  user as whom the server should run. This allows for servers to be given less
  permission than root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">server-program</i> entry should contain the
  pathname of the program which is to be executed by
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> when a request is found on its socket. If
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> provides this service internally, this
  entry should be &#x201C;internal&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i class="Em" title="Em">server program arguments</i> should be just as
  arguments normally are, starting with argv[0], which is the name of the
  program. If the service is provided internally, the word
  &#x201C;internal&#x201D; should take the place of this entry.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> program provides several
  &#x201C;trivial&#x201D; services internally by use of routines within itself.
  These services are &#x201C;echo&#x201D;, &#x201C;discard&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;chargen&#x201D; (character generator), &#x201C;daytime&#x201D; (human
  readable time), and &#x201C;time&#x201D; (machine readable time, in the form
  of the number of seconds since midnight, January 1, 1900). All of these
  services are tcp based. For details of these services, consult the appropriate
  RFC from the Network Information Center.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> program rereads its configuration file
  when it receives a hangup signal, <code class="Dv" title="Dv">SIGHUP</code>.
  Services may be added, deleted or modified when the configuration file is
  reread.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TCPMUX"><a class="selflink" href="#TCPMUX">TCPMUX</a></h1>
RFC 1078 describes the TCPMUX protocol: ``A TCP client connects to a foreign
  host on TCP port 1. It sends the service name followed by a carriage-return
  line-feed &lt;CRLF&gt;. The service name is never case sensitive. The server
  replies with a single character indicating positive (+) or negative (-)
  acknowledgment, immediately followed by an optional message of explanation,
  terminated with a &lt;CRLF&gt;. If the reply was positive, the selected
  protocol begins; otherwise the connection is closed.'' The program is passed
  the TCP connection as file descriptors 0 and 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the TCPMUX service name begins with a ``+'',
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> returns the positive reply for the program.
  This allows you to invoke programs that use stdin/stdout without putting any
  special server code in them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The special service name &#x201C;help&#x201D; causes
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> to list TCPMUX services in
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">inetd.conf</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
If a connection is made with a streaming protocol (TCP) and if
  <b>--environment</b> option has been given, inetd will set the following
  environment variables before starting the program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PROTO</b>: always &quot;TCP&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TCPLOCALIP</b>: the local IP address of the interface which accepted the
  connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TCPLOCALPORT</b>: the port number on which the TCP connection was
  established.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TCPREMOTEIP</b>: the IP address of the remote client.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TCPREMOTEPORT</b>: the port number on the client side of the TCP connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, if given the <b>--remote</b> option,
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> will set the following environment
  variables:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TCPLOCALHOST</b>: the DNS name of <i>TCPLOCALIP</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TCPREMOTEHOST</b>: the DNS name of <i>TCPREMOTEIP</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Here are several example service entries for the various types of services:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd" style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<pre class="Li">

</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ERROR_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#ERROR_MESSAGES">ERROR
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
The <b class="Nm" title="Nm">inetd</b> server logs error messages using
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">syslog(3)</a>. Important error messages and their
  explanations are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd" style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<pre class="Li">
<i>service</i>/<i>protocol</i> server failing (looping), service terminated.
</pre>
</div>
The number of requests for the specified service in the past minute exceeded the
  limit. The limit exists to prevent a broken program or a malicious user from
  swamping the system. This message may occur for several reasons: 1) there are
  lots of hosts requesting the service within a short time period, 2) a 'broken'
  client program is requesting the service too frequently, 3) a malicious user
  is running a program to invoke the service in a 'denial of service' attack, or
  4) the invoked service program has an error that causes clients to retry
  quickly. Use the [<span class="Op"><b class="Fl" title="Fl">-R</b></span>]
  option, as described above, to change the rate limit. Once the limit is
  reached, the service will be re-enabled automatically in 10 minutes.
