<p>INETD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual INETD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
inetd &acirc; internet &acirc;super-server&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
inetd [-d] [-R rate] [-p [filename]] [--environment]
[--resolve] [configuration_files ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The inetd program should be run at boot time by /etc/rc (see
rc(8)). It then listens for connections on certain internet
sockets. When a connection is found on one of its
sock&acirc; <br>
ets, it decides what service the socket corresponds to, and
invokes a program to service the request. The server program
is invoked with the service socket as its standard input,
<br>
output and error descriptors. After the program is finished,
inetd continues to listen on the socket (except in some
cases which will be described below). Essentially, inetd
<br>
allows running one daemon to invoke several others, reducing
load on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options available for
inetd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Turns on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--environment <br>
Pass local and remote address data via environment
variables. See ENVIRONMENT below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pidfile [filename] <br>
Specifies the pidfile to use instead of the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rate rate <br>
Specifies the maximum number of times a service can be
invoked in one minute; the default is 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resolve <br>
Resolve local and remote IP addresses and pass them to the
server program via TCPLOCALHOST and TCPREMOTEHOST
environment variables. See ENVIRONMENT below. This option
<br>
implies --environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Shows the version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Shows the help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Shows the usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon execution, inetd reads its
configuration information from a configuration file on the
command line, by default, /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/inetd.d.
If the configuration path&acirc; <br>
name is a directory, all the files in the directory are read
like a configuration file. All of the configuration files
are read and merged. There must be an entry for each field
<br>
in the configuration file, with entries for each field
separated by a tab or a space. Comments are denoted by a
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; at the beginning of a line.
The fields of the configuration <br>
file are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service name <br>
socket type <br>
protocol <br>
wait/nowait[.max] <br>
user <br>
server program <br>
server program arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two types of services
that inetd can start: standard and TCPMUX. A standard
service has a well-known port assigned to it; it may be a
service that implements an official <br>
Internet standard or is a BSD-specific service. As described
in RFC 1078, TCPMUX services are nonstandard services that
do not have a well-known port assigned to them. They are
<br>
invoked from inetd when a program connects to the
&acirc;tcpmux&acirc; well-known port and specifies the
service name. This feature is useful for adding
locally-developed servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The service-name entry is the
name of a valid service in the file /etc/services. For
&acirc;internal&acirc; services (discussed below), the
service name must be the official name of the ser&acirc;
<br>
vice (that is, the first entry in /etc/services). For TCPMUX
services, the value of the service-name field consists of
the string &acirc;tcpmux&acirc; followed by a slash and the
locally-cho&acirc; <br>
sen service name. The service names listed in /etc/services
and the name &acirc;help&acirc; are reserved. Try to choose
unique names for your TCPMUX services by prefixing them with
your <br>
organization&rsquo;s name and suffixing them with a version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The socket-type should be one of
&acirc;stream&acirc;, &acirc;dgram&acirc;,
&acirc;raw&acirc;, &acirc;rdm&acirc;, or
&acirc;seqpacket&acirc;, depending on whether the socket is
a stream, datagram, raw, reliably delivered message, or <br>
sequenced packet socket. TCPMUX services must use
&acirc;stream&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol must be a valid
protocol as given in /etc/protocols. Examples might be
&acirc;tcp&acirc; or &acirc;udp&acirc;. TCPMUX services must
use &acirc;tcp&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wait/nowait[.max] entry
specifies whether the server that is invoked by inetd will
take over the socket associated with the service access
point, and thus whether inetd should <br>
wait for the server to exit before listening for new service
requests. Datagram servers must use &acirc;wait&acirc;, as
they are always invoked with the original datagram socket
bound to the <br>
specified service address. These servers must read at least
one datagram from the socket before exiting. If a datagram
server connects to its peer, freeing the socket so inetd
<br>
can received further messages on the socket, it is said to
be a &acirc;multi-threaded&acirc; server; it should read one
datagram from the socket and create a new socket connected
to the peer. <br>
It should fork, and the parent should then exit to allow
inetd to check for new service requests to spawn new
servers. Datagram servers which process all incoming
datagrams on a <br>
socket and eventually time out are said to be
&acirc;single-threaded&acirc;. Comsat(8), (biff(1)) and
talkd(8) are both examples of the latter type of datagram
server. Tftpd(8) is an example <br>
of a multi-threaded datagram server. The optional
&acirc;max&acirc; suffix (separated from &acirc;wait&acirc;
or &acirc;nowait&acirc; by a dot) specifies the maximum
number of times a service can be invoked in one <br>
minute; the default is 40. If a service exceeds this limit,
inetd will log the problem and stop servicing requests for
the specific service for ten minutes. See also the -R <br>
option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Servers using stream sockets
generally are multi-threaded and use the
&acirc;nowait&acirc; entry. Connection requests for these
services are accepted by inetd, and the server is given only
<br>
the newly-accepted socket connected to a client of the
service. Most stream-based services operate in this manner.
Stream-based servers that use &acirc;wait&acirc; are started
with the lis&acirc; <br>
tening service socket, and must accept at least one
connection request before exiting. Such a server would
normally accept and process incoming connection requests
until a time&acirc; <br>
out. TCPMUX services must use &acirc;nowait&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional &acirc;max&acirc;
suffix (separated from &acirc;wait&acirc; or
&acirc;nowait&acirc; by a dot) is a decimal number that
specifies the maximum number of server instances that may be
spawned from inetd <br>
within an interval of 60 seconds. It overrides the settings
of the -R command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user entry should contain
the user name of the user as whom the server should run.
This allows for servers to be given less permission than
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server-program entry should
contain the pathname of the program which is to be executed
by inetd when a request is found on its socket. If inetd
provides this service inter&acirc; <br>
nally, this entry should be &acirc;internal&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server program arguments
should be just as arguments normally are, starting with
argv[0], which is the name of the program. If the service is
provided internally, the word <br>
&acirc;internal&acirc; should take the place of this
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inetd program provides
several &acirc;trivial&acirc; services internally by use of
routines within itself. These services are
&acirc;echo&acirc;, &acirc;discard&acirc;,
&acirc;chargen&acirc; (character generator),
&acirc;daytime&acirc; <br>
(human readable time), and &acirc;time&acirc; (machine
readable time, in the form of the number of seconds since
midnight, January 1, 1900). All of these services are tcp
based. For details <br>
of these services, consult the appropriate RFC from the
Network Information Center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inetd program rereads its
configuration file when it receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP.
Services may be added, deleted or modified when the
configuration file is reread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPMUX <br>
RFC 1078 describes the TCPMUX protocol: &lsquo;&lsquo;A TCP
client connects to a foreign host on TCP port 1. It sends
the service name followed by a carriage-return line-feed
&lt;CRLF&gt;. The <br>
service name is never case sensitive. The server replies
with a single character indicating positive (+) or negative
(-) acknowledgment, immediately followed by an optional
mes&acirc; <br>
sage of explanation, terminated with a &lt;CRLF&gt;. If the
reply was positive, the selected protocol begins; otherwise
the connection is closed.&rsquo;&rsquo; The program is
passed the TCP con&acirc; <br>
nection as file descriptors 0 and 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the TCPMUX service name
begins with a &lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo;, inetd returns
the positive reply for the program. This allows you to
invoke programs that use stdin/stdout without putting any
spe&acirc; <br>
cial server code in them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special service name
&acirc;help&acirc; causes inetd to list TCPMUX services in
inetd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If a connection is made with a streaming protocol (TCP) and
if --environment option has been given, inetd will set the
following environment variables before starting the
program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTO: always
&quot;TCP&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPLOCALIP: the local IP address
of the interface which accepted the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPLOCALPORT: the port number on
which the TCP connection was established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPREMOTEIP: the IP address of
the remote client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPREMOTEPORT: the port number
on the client side of the TCP connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, if given the
--remote option, inetd will set the following environment
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPLOCALHOST: the DNS name of
TCPLOCALIP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPREMOTEHOST: the DNS name of
TCPREMOTEIP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are several example service entries for the various
types of services:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp stream tcp nowait root
/usr/libexec/ftpd ftpd -l <br>
ntalk dgram udp wait root /usr/libexec/ntalkd ntalkd <br>
tcpmux/+date stream tcp nowait guest /bin/date date <br>
tcpmux/phonebook stream tcp nowait guest
/usr/local/bin/phonebook phonebook</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR MESSAGES <br>
The inetd server logs error messages using syslog(3).
Important error messages and their explanations are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service/protocol server failing
(looping), service terminated. <br>
The number of requests for the specified service in the past
minute exceeded the limit. The limit exists to prevent a
broken program or a malicious user from swamping the system.
<br>
This message may occur for several reasons: 1) there are
lots of hosts requesting the service within a short time
period, 2) a &rsquo;broken&rsquo; client program is
requesting the service too <br>
frequently, 3) a malicious user is running a program to
invoke the service in a &rsquo;denial of service&rsquo;
attack, or 4) the invoked service program has an error that
causes clients to <br>
retry quickly. Use the [-R] option, as described above, to
change the rate limit. Once the limit is reached, the
service will be re-enabled automatically in 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service/protocol: No such user
&rsquo;user&rsquo;, service ignored <br>
service/protocol: getpwnam: user: No such user <br>
No entry for user exists in the passwd file. The first
message occurs when inetd (re)reads the configuration file.
The second message occurs when the service is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service: can&rsquo;t set uid
number <br>
service: can&rsquo;t set gid number <br>
The user or group ID for the entry&rsquo;s user is
invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT) are set only for
TCP IPv4 nowait connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The inetd command appeared in 4.3BSD. TCPMUX is based on
code and documentation by Mark Lottor.</p>
