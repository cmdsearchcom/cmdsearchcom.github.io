<p>nsd-control(8) nsd 4.1.14 nsd-control(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nsd-control, nsd-control-setup - NSD remote server control
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nsd-control [-c cfgfile] [-s server] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nsd-control performs remote administration on the nsd(8) DNS
server. It reads the configuration file, contacts the nsd
server over SSL, sends the command and displays the <br>
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show the version and
commandline option help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cfgfile <br>
The config file to read with settings. If not given the
default config file /etc/nsd/nsd.conf is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s server[@port] <br>
IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server to contact. If not given,
the address is read from the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
There are several commands that the server understands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start Start the server. Simply
execs nsd(8). The nsd executable is searched for in the PATH
set in the environment. It is started with the config file
specified using -c or <br>
the default config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop Stop the server. The server
daemon exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload [&lt;zone&gt;] <br>
Reload zonefiles and reopen logfile. Without argument reads
changed zonefiles. With argument reads the zonefile for the
given zone and loads it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reconfig <br>
Reload nsd.conf and apply changes to TSIG keys and
configuration patterns, and apply the changes to add and
remove zones that are mentioned in the config. Other changes
<br>
are not applied, such as listening ip address and port and
chroot. The pattern updates means that the configuration
options for zones (request-xfr, zonefile, notify, ...) <br>
are updated. Also new patterns are available for use with
the addzone command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repattern <br>
Same as the reconfig option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_reopen <br>
Reopen the logfile, for log rotate that wants to move the
logfile away and create a new logfile. The log can also be
reopened with kill -HUP (which also reloads all zone&acirc;
<br>
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Display server status.
Exit code 3 if not running (the connection to the port is
refused), 1 on error, 0 if running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stats Output a sequence of
name=value lines with statistics information, requires NSD
to be compiled with this option enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stats_noreset <br>
Same as stats, but does not zero the counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addzone &lt;zone name&gt;
&lt;pattern name&gt; <br>
Add a new zone to the running server. The zone is added to
the zonelist file on disk, so it stays after a restart. The
pattern name determines the options for the new <br>
zone. For slave zones a zone transfer is immediately
attempted. For zones with a zonefile, the zone file is
attempted to be read in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delzone &lt;zone name&gt; <br>
Remove the zone from the running server. The zone is removed
from the zonelist file on disk, from the nsd.db file and
from the memory. If it had a zonefile, this remains <br>
(but may be outdated). Zones configured inside nsd.conf
itself cannot be removed this way because the daemon does
not write to the nsd.conf file, you need to add such <br>
zones to the zonelist file to be able to delete them with
the delzone command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addzones <br>
Add zones read from stdin of nsd-control. Input is read per
line, with name space patternname on a line. For bulk
additions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delzones <br>
Remove zones read from stdin of nsd-control. Input is one
name per line. For bulk removals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write [&lt;zone&gt;] <br>
Write zonefiles to disk, or the given zonefile to disk.
Zones that have changed (via AXFR or IXFR) are written, or
if the zonefile has not been created yet then it is <br>
created. Directory components of the zonefile path are
created if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify [&lt;zone&gt;] <br>
Send NOTIFY messages to slave servers. Sends to the IP
addresses configured in the &rsquo;notify:&rsquo; lists for
the master zones hosted on this server. Usually NSD sends
NOTIFY <br>
messages right away when a master zone serial is updated. If
a zone is given, notifies are sent for that zone. These
slave servers are supposed to initiate a zone trans&acirc;
<br>
fer request later (to this server or another master), this
can be allowed via the &rsquo;provide-xfr:&rsquo; acl list
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transfer [&lt;zone&gt;] <br>
Attempt to update slave zones that are hosted on this server
by contacting the masters. The masters are configured via
&rsquo;request-xfr:&rsquo; lists. If a zone is given, that
<br>
zone is updated. Usually NSD receives a NOTIFY from the
masters (configured via &rsquo;allow-notify:&rsquo; acl
list) that a new zone serial has to be transferred. For
zones with no <br>
content, NSD may have backed off from asking often because
the masters did not respond, but this command will reset the
backoff to its initial timeout, for frequent <br>
retries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force_transfer [&lt;zone&gt;]
<br>
Force update slave zones that are hosted on this server.
Even if the master hosts the same serial number of the zone,
a full AXFR is performed to fetch it. If you want <br>
to use IXFR and check that the serial number increases, use
the &rsquo;transfer&rsquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonestatus [&lt;zone&gt;] <br>
Print state of the zone, the serial numbers and since when
they have been acquired. Also prints the notify action (to
which server), and zone transfer (and from which <br>
master) if there is activity right now. The state of the
zone is printed as: &rsquo;master&rsquo; (master zones),
&rsquo;ok&rsquo; (slave zone is up-to-date),
&rsquo;expired&rsquo; (slave zone has expired), <br>
&rsquo;refreshing&rsquo; (slave zone has transfers active).
The serial numbers printed are the
&rsquo;served-serial&rsquo; (currently active), the
&rsquo;commit-serial&rsquo; (is in reload), the
&rsquo;noti&acirc; <br>
fied-serial&rsquo; (got notify, busy fetching the data). The
serial numbers are only printed if such a serial number is
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serverpid <br>
Prints the PID of the server process. This is used for
statistics (and only works when NSD is compiled with
statistics enabled). This pid is not for sending unix
sig&acirc; <br>
nals, use the pid from nsd.pid for that, that pid is also
stable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbosity &lt;number&gt; <br>
Change logging verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
The nsd-control program exits with status code 1 on error, 0
on success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SET UP <br>
The setup requires a self-signed certificate and private
keys for both the server and client. The script
nsd-control-setup generates these in the default run
directory, or with <br>
-d in another directory. If you change the access control
permissions on the key files you can decide who can use
nsd-control, by default owner and group but not all users.
The <br>
script preserves private keys present in the directory.
After running the script as root, turn on control-enable in
nsd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATISTIC COUNTERS <br>
The stats command shows a number of statistic counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.queries <br>
number of queries received (the tcp and udp queries added

server-count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time.boot <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time.elapsed <br>

fractional seconds. Can be zero if polled quickly and the
previous stats command resets the counters, so that the next
<br>
gets a fully zero, and zero elapsed time, report.</p>
