<b>lbcd</b> <b>-t</b> [v2] [<i>service</i> ...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>lbcd</b> runs as a daemon and reports various system utilization information
  and optionally service status information via a UDP network protocol. It is
  designed to run on the client systems of a remote load balancing system, such
  as the DNS-based <b>lbnamed</b> load balancer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>lbcd</b> supports two different query protocols, version two and version
  three. (Currently, <b>lbnamed</b> only supports version two queries.) Either
  will return the current time according to that system, the time of the last
  system boot, the time the information about logged in users last changed, the
  load averages (one, five, and fifteen minute), the total and unique logged in
  users, whether a user is logged in on console, percentage full of the system
  <i>/tmp</i> directory is full, and percentage full of the system
  <i>/var/tmp</i> directory. (See, however, the note below about how some of
  this data is replaced with calculated weights for version two responses.) The
  version three protocol can also return weight and increment information about
  a set of services.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The service information is based around a model that returns a weight
  (indicating the current utilization of the box -- the higher, the busier) and
  an increment (an estimate of how much the utilization will increase for each
  additional connection directed to this box) which defaults to one. The intent
  is for the load balancer to query the system periodically, using the returned
  weight as the system load, and to estimate the system load between queries of
  <b>lbcd</b> as the last returned weight plus the last returned increment times
  the number of connections directed to that system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, only one service is returned. That default service weight is
  calculated as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    (&lt;uniq-users&gt; * 100 + 300 * &lt;one-minute-load&gt;
        + (&lt;total-users&gt; - &lt;unique-users&gt;) * 20) * &lt;tmp-penalty&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where &lt;tmp-penalty&gt; is a multiplier applied for the most full of
  <i>/tmp</i> and <i>/var/tmp</i>. &lt;tmp-penalty&gt; will be 1 if both are
  less than 90% full and will range between 2 for 90-93% full up to 32 for 100%
  full. If <i>/tmp</i> or <i>/var/tmp</i> are completely full, the maximum
  possible weight will be returned. Different algorithms for determining the
  weight can be used instead; see the <b>-w</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to use a simple load average instead, pass the <b>-S</b> option to
  <b>lbcd</b> and then the load service will use only the one-minute load. If
  you want every system running <b>lbcd</b> to return the same load, use the
  <b>-R</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the file <i>/etc/nolbcd</i> exists, <b>lbcd</b> will force the weight of the
  default service to the maximum value regardless of the normal service
  calculation. This allows one to effectively remove a host from a load-balanced
  pool by touching a file without having to stop the <b>lbcd</b> daemon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since <b>lbnamed</b> calculates the weight from the one minute load and the
  number of logged-in users and currently only supports version two, <b>lbcd</b>
  will replace the one-minute load with the weight of the primary service when
  responding to a version two query and will set all of the user numbers to zero
  unless <b>-S</b> was given. If <b>-S</b> was given, the values returned will
  be left alone. (This means that <b>-S</b> will override <b>-R</b> for version
  two queries, since <b>-R</b> is equivalent to specifying a service of
  &quot;rr&quot;.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>lbcd</b> responds to any UDP packets on port 4330 (or the port given with the
  <b>-p</b> option). It has no built-in security, so if you do not want to
  disclose the above information to random systems on the Internet, you will
  want to limit access to this port using iptables, firewall rules, or other
  similar measures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>lbcd</b> listens on all addresses and responds on whatever
  address the kernel picks for outgoing packets. <b>lbnamed</b> sends out all of
  its packets and then waits for replies and uses the source address of the
  reply packet to associate that reply with one of the queried hosts. This means
  that if <b>lbnamed</b> is not configured to query the same address as the
  kernel picks for <b>lbcd</b> to respond on, the response may be ignored and
  the host considered down. To work around this, use the <b>-b</b> flag on hosts
  with multiple interfaces to ensure that replies go out on the interface being
  queried. If a host has multiple IP addresses that will be queried, run
  multiple instances of <b>lbcd</b>, one for each interface.

  <dd class="It-tag">The version 3 lbcd protocol allows the client to request
      weight information for a specific protocol. To prevent clients from
      getting information about (and causing <b>lbcd</b> to probe) services that

      <b>-a</b> option are allowed. This option may be given multiple times to
      allow multiple services to be queried. The service specified with
      <b>-w</b>, if any, is always allowed, as is the &quot;default&quot;
      service.

      an IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6), not a hostname.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is ignored if <b>lbcd</b> is passed already open sockets via the

      accurately. This means that version two responses will not contain any
      information derived from custom services or weight settings and the
      <b>-c</b>, <b>-w</b>, and <b>-R</b> options will be ignored for version

    When run with this option, the remaining command-line arguments are taken as

      service arguments to the <b>-w</b> option, with one exception. If the
      first service is the string &quot;v2&quot;, <b>lbcd</b> will behave as if
      it received a protocol version two query packet and will manipulate its
      reply information accordingly before printing it out.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w</b> <i>weight</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify either a service to probe or a weight and increment
      to always return. <i>weight</i> can be a string of the form
      <i>weight</i>:<i>increment</i> where both <i>weight</i> and
      <i>increment</i> are numbers, in which case that weight and increment will
      always be returned. Alternately, it can be the name of a service module,
      in which case that service will be probed and its weight will be returned
      as the service weight (and the one-minute load with version two queries).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The currently supported services are &quot;load&quot; (the default),
      &quot;ftp&quot;, &quot;http&quot;, &quot;imap&quot;, &quot;nntp&quot;,
      &quot;ntp&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;smtp&quot;, &quot;tcp&quot;, and
      &quot;rr&quot; (round-robin, the same as <b>-R</b>). The &quot;http&quot;
      and &quot;tcp&quot; services must be followed by a colon and a port
      number.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option only affects the default service. A version 3 protocol client
      can query any of the supported services provided that the service is
      listed as allowed, using the <b>-a</b> flag. This allows the client to get
      weight and increment information for several different services.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Z</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When <b>lbcd</b> has set up its network socket and is ready
      to answer requests, raise SIGSTOP. This signals to upstart, when using
      &quot;expect stop&quot;, that the daemon is ready to accept connections,
      and upstart will raise SIGCONT to allow <b>lbcd</b> to continue. This
      option is probably only useful when using upstart as the init system.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Run <b>lbcd</b> as a daemon, using the default load service, and writing a PID
  file to <i>/var/run/lbcd.pid</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    lbcd -P /var/run/lbcd.pid
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Run <b>lbcd</b> in the foreground, and log all client requests via syslog. This
  is a typical invocation with systemd, using socket activation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    lbcd -f -l
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The same, but raise SIGSTOP after <b>lbcd</b> is ready to answer queries. This
  is a typical invocation with upstart.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    lbcd -f -l -Z
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Run <b>lbcd</b> as a daemon, with default behavior, but use round-robin as the
  default service. This will equally balance queries across machines instead of
  trying to be sensitive to load.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    lbcd -R
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Determine the weight of the system based on whether the local HTTP port is
  responding. If it isn't, the system will return the maximum weight, which will
  cause it to drop out of the pool.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    lbcd -w http:80
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Run the external program <i>/usr/bin/lb-slapd</i> to determine the weight.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    lbcd -c /usr/bin/ldap-check
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program should print, to standard output, two numbers separated by a space.
  The first will be the weight and the second will be the load. In this case, it
  does a query against a local LDAP search to determine its health. (A good
  approach for LDAP slaves would be to check the syncrepl data to see if the
  slave is up-to-date.)
