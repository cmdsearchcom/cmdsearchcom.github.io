<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lbcd - Report system load for remote load balancing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lbcd [-dfhlRtZ] [-a allowed-service [-a allowed-service]]
<br>
[-b bind-address [-b bind-address]] [-c command] <br>
[-P file] [-p port] [-T seconds] <br>
[-w weight]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd -t [v2] [service ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lbcd runs as a daemon and reports various system utilization
information and optionally service status information via a
UDP network protocol. It is designed to run on the <br>
client systems of a remote load balancing system, such as
the DNS-based lbnamed load balancer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd supports two different
query protocols, version two and version three. (Currently,
lbnamed only supports version two queries.) Either will
return the current time <br>
according to that system, the time of the last system boot,
the time the information about logged in users last changed,
the load averages (one, five, and fifteen minute), the <br>
total and unique logged in users, whether a user is logged
in on console, percentage full of the system /tmp directory
is full, and percentage full of the system /var/tmp <br>
directory. (See, however, the note below about how some of
this data is replaced with calculated weights for version
two responses.) The version three protocol can also return
<br>
weight and increment information about a set of
services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The service information is based
around a model that returns a weight (indicating the current
utilization of the box -- the higher, the busier) and an
increment (an estimate of <br>
how much the utilization will increase for each additional
connection directed to this box) which defaults to one. The
intent is for the load balancer to query the system <br>
periodically, using the returned weight as the system load,
and to estimate the system load between queries of lbcd as
the last returned weight plus the last returned increment
<br>
times the number of connections directed to that system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, only one service is
returned. That default service weight is calculated as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(&lt;uniq-users&gt; * 100 + 300
* &lt;one-minute-load&gt; <br>
+ (&lt;total-users&gt; - &lt;unique-users&gt;) * 20) *
&lt;tmp-penalty&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;tmp-penalty&gt; is a
multiplier applied for the most full of /tmp and /var/tmp.
&lt;tmp-penalty&gt; will be 1 if both are less than 90% full
and will range between 2 for 90-93% <br>
full up to 32 for 100% full. If /tmp or /var/tmp are
completely full, the maximum possible weight will be
returned. Different algorithms for determining the weight
can be used <br>
instead; see the -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use a simple load
average instead, pass the -S option to lbcd and then the
load service will use only the one-minute load. If you want
every system running lbcd <br>
to return the same load, use the -R option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file /etc/nolbcd exists,
lbcd will force the weight of the default service to the
maximum value regardless of the normal service calculation.
This allows one to <br>
effectively remove a host from a load-balanced pool by
touching a file without having to stop the lbcd daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since lbnamed calculates the
weight from the one minute load and the number of logged-in
users and currently only supports version two, lbcd will
replace the one-minute load with <br>
the weight of the primary service when responding to a
version two query and will set all of the user numbers to
zero unless -S was given. If -S was given, the values
returned <br>
will be left alone. (This means that -S will override -R for
version two queries, since -R is equivalent to specifying a
service of &quot;rr&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd responds to any UDP packets
on port 4330 (or the port given with the -p option). It has
no built-in security, so if you do not want to disclose the
above information to <br>
random systems on the Internet, you will want to limit
access to this port using iptables, firewall rules, or other
similar measures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, lbcd listens on all
addresses and responds on whatever address the kernel picks
for outgoing packets. lbnamed sends out all of its packets
and then waits for replies <br>
and uses the source address of the reply packet to associate
that reply with one of the queried hosts. This means that if
lbnamed is not configured to query the same address as <br>
the kernel picks for lbcd to respond on, the response may be
ignored and the host considered down. To work around this,
use the -b flag on hosts with multiple interfaces to <br>
ensure that replies go out on the interface being queried.
If a host has multiple IP addresses that will be queried,
run multiple instances of lbcd, one for each interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a allowed-service <br>
The version 3 lbcd protocol allows the client to request
weight information for a specific protocol. To prevent
clients from getting information about (and causing lbcd to
<br>
probe) services that shouldn&rsquo;t be exposed over
protocol, only services specified with the -a option are
allowed. This option may be given multiple times to allow
multiple <br>
services to be queried. The service specified with -w, if
any, is always allowed, as is the &quot;default&quot;
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a list of the supported
services, and therefore the allowed values for
allowed-service, see the -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client queries are compared
exactly against the allowed-service values, including any
port information after a colon, so all service values that
should be queryable must be <br>
listed using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bind-address <br>
By default, lbcd binds to all available addresses. If this
option is given, lbcd binds only to the specified address
and will only answer UDP queries to that address. This <br>
option may be given multiple times to bind to multiple
addresses. bind-address must be an IP address (either IPv4
or IPv6), not a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored if lbcd
is passed already open sockets via the systemd socket
activation protocol. In that case, the bind addresses of the
sockets should be <br>
controlled via the systemd configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
Obtain the service weight and increment by running an
external command. This command should print to standard
output one line containing two integer numbers, separated by
<br>
whitespace. The first number is taken to be the weight and
the second number is taken to be the increment. (As
mentioned above, when responding to version two protocol
<br>
queries, the weight is returned as the one-minute load
average.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Run in the foreground (the
same as with -f), send informational messages to standard
output instead of syslog, and send errors to standard error
instead of syslog. This is <br>
intended for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Run in the foreground,
meaning don&rsquo;t fork and don&rsquo;t detach from the
controlling terminal. This allows lbcd to be run more simply
via modern init systems such as upstart or <br>
systemd and work properly with process supervisors such as
daemontools or runit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print out usage information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Log every received request to
syslog (or to standard output if -d was given). The requests
will be logged with the LOG_DAEMON facility and the LOG_INFO
priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P file <br>
Store the PID of the running daemon in file. file will be
deleted when lbcd exits normally (via a SIGTERM or SIGINT
signal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Listen on port rather than the default of 4330.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored if lbcd
is passed already open sockets via the systemd socket
activation protocol. In that case, the listening port should
be controlled via the <br>
systemd configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Use round-robin as the
service. This will always return a weight of one and an
increment of one. It is equivalent to &quot;-w rr&quot;. For
version two responses, it will always <br>
return a one-minute load of one regardless of the actual
load average of the system (unless -S is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S When answering version two
queries, do not attempt to adjust for lbnamed&rsquo;s logic
and force it to use the service weight. Instead, report the
load averages and number of <br>
logged in users accurately. This means that version two
responses will not contain any information derived from
custom services or weight settings and the -c, -w, and -R
<br>
options will be ignored for version two responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T seconds <br>
Use a timeout of seconds when doing service probes
(including running a command with -c). The default is five
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Test mode. When run with the
-t flag, lbcd will do all the checks that it would do when
receiving a query packet, print out the results in a
human-readable format to <br>
standard output, and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run with this option, the
remaining command-line arguments are taken as services to
probe. The valid service names are the same as the valid
service arguments to the -w <br>
option, with one exception. If the first service is the
string &quot;v2&quot;, lbcd will behave as if it received a
protocol version two query packet and will manipulate its
reply <br>
information accordingly before printing it out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w weight <br>
Specify either a service to probe or a weight and increment
to always return. weight can be a string of the form
weight:increment where both weight and increment are <br>
numbers, in which case that weight and increment will always
be returned. Alternately, it can be the name of a service
module, in which case that service will be probed and <br>
its weight will be returned as the service weight (and the
one-minute load with version two queries).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The currently supported services
are &quot;load&quot; (the default), &quot;ftp&quot;,
&quot;http&quot;, &quot;imap&quot;, &quot;nntp&quot;,
&quot;ntp&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;smtp&quot;,
&quot;tcp&quot;, and &quot;rr&quot; (round-robin, the same
as -R). The &quot;http&quot; and <br>
&quot;tcp&quot; services must be followed by a colon and a
port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option only affects the
default service. A version 3 protocol client can query any
of the supported services provided that the service is
listed as allowed, using the <br>
-a flag. This allows the client to get weight and increment
information for several different services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z When lbcd has set up its
network socket and is ready to answer requests, raise
SIGSTOP. This signals to upstart, when using &quot;expect
stop&quot;, that the daemon is ready to accept <br>
connections, and upstart will raise SIGCONT to allow lbcd to
continue. This option is probably only useful when using
upstart as the init system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Run lbcd as a daemon, using the default load service, and
writing a PID file to /var/run/lbcd.pid:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd -P /var/run/lbcd.pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run lbcd in the foreground, and
log all client requests via syslog. This is a typical
invocation with systemd, using socket activation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd -f -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same, but raise SIGSTOP
after lbcd is ready to answer queries. This is a typical
invocation with upstart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd -f -l -Z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run lbcd as a daemon, with
default behavior, but use round-robin as the default
service. This will equally balance queries across machines
instead of trying to be sensitive to <br>
load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd -R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determine the weight of the
system based on whether the local HTTP port is responding.
If it isn&rsquo;t, the system will return the maximum
weight, which will cause it to drop out of <br>
the pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd -w http:80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the external program
/usr/bin/lb-slapd to determine the weight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbcd -c /usr/bin/ldap-check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program should print, to
standard output, two numbers separated by a space. The first
will be the weight and the second will be the load. In this
case, it does a query <br>
against a local LDAP search to determine its health. (A good
approach for LDAP slaves would be to check the syncrepl data
to see if the slave is up-to-date.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LISTEN_FDS <br>
LISTEN_PID <br>
If these environment variables are set, lbcd will expect to
be provided its listening sockets via the systemd socket
activation protocol and will not attempt to bind its own
<br>
sockets. For more details on the protocol, see daemon(7) and
sd_listen_fds(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY_SOCKET <br>
If this environment variable is set, lbcd will notify the
socket named in this variable when it is ready to accept
incoming packets using the systemd status notification <br>
protocol. For more details, see daemon(7) and
sd_notify(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that using socket
activation is recommended when running under systemd, and
status notification is not necessary or useful when using
socket activation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/nolbcd <br>
If this file exists, lbcd will force the weight of the
default service to the maximum possible value regardless of
the normal weight calculation. This allows one to <br>
effectively remove a host from a load-balanced pool by
touching a file without having to stop the lbcd daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/nologin <br>
If this file exists, lbcd will force the weight returned by
the default load algorithm to the maximum possible value.
This will only apply if the default load algorithm is <br>
used; if a different algorithm is used, due to -R or -w, no
change to the returned weight will be made.</p>
