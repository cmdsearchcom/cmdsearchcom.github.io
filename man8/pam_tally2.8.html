<p>PAM_TALLY2(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_TALLY2(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_tally2 - The login counter (tallying) module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pam_tally2.so [file=/path/to/counter] [onerr=[fail|succeed]]
[magic_root] [even_deny_root] [deny=n] [lock_time=n]
[unlock_time=n] [root_unlock_time=n] [serialize] [audit]
<br>
[silent] [no_log_info]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pam_tally2 [--file
/path/to/counter] [--user username] [--reset[=n]]
[--quiet]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This module maintains a count of attempted accesses, can
reset count on success, can deny access if too many attempts
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pam_tally2 comes in two parts:
pam_tally2.so and pam_tally2. The former is the PAM module
and the latter, a stand-alone program. pam_tally2 is an
(optional) application which <br>
can be used to interrogate and manipulate the counter file.
It can display users&rsquo; counts, set individual counts,
or clear all counts. Setting artificially high counts may be
<br>
useful for blocking users without changing their passwords.
For example, one might find it useful to clear all counts
every midnight from a cron job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, failed attempts to
access root will not cause the root account to become
blocked, to prevent denial-of-service: if your users
aren&rsquo;t given shell accounts and root may <br>
only login via su or at the machine console (not telnet/rsh,
etc), this is safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
This can be used for auth and account module types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onerr=[fail|succeed] <br>
If something weird happens (like unable to open the file),
return with PAM_SUCCESS if onerr=succeed is given, else with
the corresponding PAM error code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file=/path/to/counter <br>
File where to keep counts. Default is /var/log/tallylog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audit <br>
Will log the user name into the system log if the user is
not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">silent <br>
Don&rsquo;t print informative messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_log_info <br>
Don&rsquo;t log informative messages via syslog(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTH OPTIONS <br>
Authentication phase first increments attempted login
counter and checks if user should be denied access. If the
user is authenticated and the login process continues on
call <br>
to pam_setcred(3) it resets the attempts counter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deny=n <br>
Deny access if tally for this user exceeds n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock_time=n <br>
Always deny for n seconds after failed attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlock_time=n <br>
Allow access after n seconds after failed attempt. If this
option is used the user will be locked out for the specified
amount of time after he exceeded his maximum <br>
allowed attempts. Otherwise the account is locked until the
lock is removed by a manual intervention of the system
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magic_root <br>
If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is
not incremented. The sysadmin should use this for user
launched services, like su, otherwise this argument <br>
should be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even_deny_root <br>
Root account can become unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root_unlock_time=n <br>
This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access
after n seconds to root account after failed attempt. If
this option is used the root user will be locked out for
<br>
the specified amount of time after he exceeded his maximum
allowed attempts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serialize <br>
Serialize access to the tally file using locks. This option
might be used only for non-multithreaded services because it
depends on the fcntl locking of the tally file. <br>
Also it is a good idea to use this option only in such
configurations where the time between auth phase and account
or setcred phase is not dependent on the <br>
authenticating client. Otherwise the authenticating client
will be able to prevent simultaneous authentications by the
same user by simply artificially prolonging the <br>
time the file record lock is held.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCOUNT OPTIONS <br>
Account phase resets attempts counter if the user is not
magic root. This phase can be used optionally for services
which don&rsquo;t call pam_setcred(3) correctly or if the
reset <br>
should be done regardless of the failure of the account
phase of other modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magic_root <br>
If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is
not changed. The sysadmin should use this for user launched
services, like su, otherwise this argument should <br>
be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULE TYPES PROVIDED <br>
The auth and account module types are provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
PAM_AUTH_ERR <br>
A invalid option was given, the module was not able to
retrieve the user name, no valid counter file was found, or
too many failed logins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_SUCCESS <br>
Everything was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_USER_UNKNOWN <br>
User not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
pam_tally2 is not compatible with the old pam_tally faillog
file format. This is caused by requirement of compatibility
of the tallylog file format between 32bit and 64bit <br>
architectures on multiarch systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no setuid wrapper for
access to the data file such as when the pam_tally2.so
module is called from xscreensaver. As this would make it
impossible to share PAM <br>
configuration with such services the following workaround is
used: If the data file cannot be opened because of
insufficient permissions (EACCES) the module returns
PAM_IGNORE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to lock the
account after 4 failed logins. Root account will be locked
as well. The accounts will be automatically unlocked after
20 <br>
minutes. The module does not have to be called in the
account phase because the login calls pam_setcred(3)
correctly.</p>
