<p>RDISC(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual: iputils
RDISC(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rdisc - network router discovery daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rdisc [-abdfrstvV] [-p preference] [-T max_interval]
[send_address] [receive_address]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rdisc implements client side of the ICMP router discover
protocol. rdisc is invoked at boot time to populate the
network routing tables with default routes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdisc listens on the ALL_HOSTS
(224.0.0.1) multicast address (or receive_address provided
it is given) for ROUTER_ADVERTISE messages from routers. The
received messages are han&acirc; <br>
dled by first ignoring those listed router addresses with
which the host does not share a network. Among the remaining
addresses the ones with the highest preference are selected
<br>
as default routers and a default route is entered in the
kernel routing table for each one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, rdisc can avoid
waiting for routers to announce themselves by sending out a
few ROUTER_SOLICITATION messages to the ALL_ROUTERS
(224.0.0.2) multicast address (or <br>
send_address provided it is given) when it is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A timer is associated with each
router address and the address will no longer be considered
for inclusion in the the routing tables if the timer expires
before a new advertise <br>
message is received from the router. The address will also
be excluded from consideration if the host receives an
advertise message with the preference being maximally
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server side of router discovery
protocol is supported by Cisco IOS and by any more or less
complete UNIX routing daemon, f.e gated. Or, rdisc can act
as responder, if compiled <br>
with -DRDISC_SERVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Accept all routers independently of the preference they
have in their advertise messages. Normally rdisc only
accepts (and enters in the kernel routing tables) the router
<br>
or routers with the highest preference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Opposite to -a, i.e. install
only router with the best preference value. It is default
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Send debugging messages to
syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Run rdisc forever even if no
routers are found. Normally rdisc gives up if it has not
received any advertise message after after soliciting three
times, in which case it <br>
exits with a non-zero exit code. If -f is not specified in
the first form then -s must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Responder mode, available
only if compiled with -DRDISC_SERVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Send three solicitation
messages initially to quickly discover the routers when the
system is booted. When -s is specified rdisc exits with a
non-zero exit code if it can <br>
not find any routers. This can be overridden with the -f
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p preference <br>
Set preference in advertisement. Available only with -r
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T max_interval <br>
Set maximum advertisement interval in seconds. Default is
600 secs. Available only with -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Test mode. Do not go to
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose i.e. send lots of
debugging messages to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
This program was developed by Sun Microsystems (see
copyright notice in source file). It was ported to Linux by
Alexey Kuznetsov &lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;. It is now
maintained by <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
rdisc requires CAP_NET_RAW to listen and send ICMP messages
and capability CAP_NET_ADMIN to update routing tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
rdisc is part of iputils package and the latest versions are
available in source form at
http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-current.tar.bz2.</p>
