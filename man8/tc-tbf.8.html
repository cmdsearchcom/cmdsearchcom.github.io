<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tbf - Token Bucket Filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tc qdisc ... tbf rate rate burst bytes/cell ( latency ms |
limit bytes ) [ mpu bytes [ peakrate rate mtu bytes/cell ]
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">burst is also known as buffer
and maxburst. mtu is also known as minburst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Token Bucket Filter is a classful queueing discipline
available for traffic control with the tc(8) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TBF is a pure shaper and never
schedules traffic. It is non-work-conserving and may
throttle itself, although packets are available, to ensure
that the configured rate is not <br>
exceeded. It is able to shape up to 1mbit/s of normal
traffic with ideal minimal burstiness, sending out data
exactly at the configured rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Much higher rates are possible
but at the cost of losing the minimal burstiness. In that
case, data is on average dequeued at the configured rate but
may be sent much faster at <br>
millisecond timescales. Because of further queues living in
network adaptors, this is often not a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHM <br>
As the name implies, traffic is filtered based on the
expenditure of tokens. Tokens roughly correspond to bytes,
with the additional constraint that each packet consumes
some <br>
tokens, no matter how small it is. This reflects the fact
that even a zero-sized packet occupies the link for some
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On creation, the TBF is stocked
with tokens which correspond to the amount of traffic that
can be burst in one go. Tokens arrive at a steady rate,
until the bucket is full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no tokens are available,
packets are queued, up to a configured limit. The TBF now
calculates the token deficit, and throttles until the first
packet in the queue can be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it is not acceptable to burst
out packets at maximum speed, a peakrate can be configured
to limit the speed at which the bucket empties. This
peakrate is implemented as a sec&acirc; <br>
ond TBF with a very small bucket, so that it doesn&rsquo;t
burst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To achieve perfection, the
second bucket may contain only a single packet, which leads
to the earlier mentioned 1mbit/s limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This limit is caused by the fact
that the kernel can only throttle for at minimum 1
&rsquo;jiffy&rsquo;, which depends on HZ as 1/HZ. For
perfect shaping, only a single packet can get sent <br>
per jiffy - for HZ=100, this means 100 packets of on average
1000 bytes each, which roughly corresponds to 1mbit/s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
See tc(8) for how to specify the units of these values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit or latency <br>
Limit is the number of bytes that can be queued waiting for
tokens to become available. You can also specify this the
other way around by setting the latency parameter, <br>
which specifies the maximum amount of time a packet can sit
in the TBF. The latter calculation takes into account the
size of the bucket, the rate and possibly the <br>
peakrate (if set). These two parameters are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">burst Also known as buffer or
maxburst. Size of the bucket, in bytes. This is the maximum
amount of bytes that tokens can be available for
instantaneously. In general, larger <br>
shaping rates require a larger buffer. For 10mbit/s on
Intel, you need at least 10kbyte buffer if you want to reach
your configured rate!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your buffer is too small,
packets may be dropped because more tokens arrive per timer
tick than fit in your bucket. The minimum buffer size can be
calculated by divid&acirc; <br>
ing the rate by HZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Token usage calculations are
performed using a table which by default has a resolution of
8 packets. This resolution can be changed by specifying the
cell size with the <br>
burst. For example, to specify a 6000 byte buffer with a 16
byte cell size, set a burst of 6000/16. You will probably
never have to set this. Must be an integral power of <br>
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpu A zero-sized packet does not
use zero bandwidth. For ethernet, no packet uses less than
64 bytes. The Minimum Packet Unit determines the minimal
token usage (specified in <br>
bytes) for a packet. Defaults to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rate The speed knob. See remarks
above about limits! See tc(8) for units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, if a peakrate is
desired, the following parameters are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">peakrate <br>
Maximum depletion rate of the bucket. The peakrate does not
need to be set, it is only necessary if perfect millisecond
timescale shaping is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtu/minburst <br>
Specifies the size of the peakrate bucket. For perfect
accuracy, should be set to the MTU of the interface. If a
peakrate is needed, but some burstiness is acceptable, <br>
this size can be raised. A 3000 byte minburst allows around
3mbit/s of peakrate, given 1000 byte packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the regular burstsize you
can also specify a cell size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE <br>
To attach a TBF with a sustained maximum rate of 0.5mbit/s,
a peakrate of 1.0mbit/s, a 5kilobyte buffer, with a
pre-bucket queue size limit calculated so the TBF causes at
most <br>
70ms of latency, with perfect peakrate behaviour, issue:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle
10: root tbf rate 0.5mbit burst 5kb latency 70ms peakrate
1mbit minburst 1540</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To attach an inner qdisc, for
example sfq, issue:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent
10:1 handle 100: sfq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without inner qdisc TBF queue
acts as bfifo. If the inner qdisc is changed the
limit/latency is not effective anymore.</p>
