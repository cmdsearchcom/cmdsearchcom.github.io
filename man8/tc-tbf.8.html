The Token Bucket Filter is a classful queueing discipline available for traffic
  control with the <b>tc</b>(8) command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
TBF is a pure shaper and never schedules traffic. It is non-work-conserving and
  may throttle itself, although packets are available, to ensure that the
  configured rate is not exceeded. It is able to shape up to 1mbit/s of normal
  traffic with ideal minimal burstiness, sending out data exactly at the
  configured rates.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Much higher rates are possible but at the cost of losing the minimal burstiness.
  In that case, data is on average dequeued at the configured rate but may be
  sent much faster at millisecond timescales. Because of further queues living
  in network adaptors, this is often not a problem.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ALGORITHM"><a class="selflink" href="#ALGORITHM">ALGORITHM</a></h1>
As the name implies, traffic is filtered based on the expenditure of
  <b>tokens.</b> Tokens roughly correspond to bytes, with the additional
  constraint that each packet consumes some tokens, no matter how small it is.
  This reflects the fact that even a zero-sized packet occupies the link for
  some time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On creation, the TBF is stocked with tokens which correspond to the amount of
  traffic that can be burst in one go. Tokens arrive at a steady rate, until the
  bucket is full.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no tokens are available, packets are queued, up to a configured limit. The
  TBF now calculates the token deficit, and throttles until the first packet in
  the queue can be sent.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If it is not acceptable to burst out packets at maximum speed, a peakrate can be
  configured to limit the speed at which the bucket empties. This peakrate is
  implemented as a second TBF with a very small bucket, so that it doesn't
  burst.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To achieve perfection, the second bucket may contain only a single packet, which
  leads to the earlier mentioned 1mbit/s limit.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This limit is caused by the fact that the kernel can only throttle for at
  minimum 1 'jiffy', which depends on HZ as 1/HZ. For perfect shaping, only a
  single packet can get sent per jiffy - for HZ=100, this means 100 packets of
  on average 1000 bytes each, which roughly corresponds to 1mbit/s.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PARAMETERS"><a class="selflink" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a></h1>
See <b>tc</b>(8) for how to specify the units of these values.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">limit or latency</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Limit is the number of bytes that can be queued waiting for
      tokens to become available. You can also specify this the other way around
      by setting the latency parameter, which specifies the maximum amount of
      time a packet can sit in the TBF. The latter calculation takes into
      account the size of the bucket, the rate and possibly the peakrate (if
      set). These two parameters are mutually exclusive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">burst</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Also known as buffer or maxburst. Size of the bucket, in
      bytes. This is the maximum amount of bytes that tokens can be available
      for instantaneously. In general, larger shaping rates require a larger
      buffer. For 10mbit/s on Intel, you need at least 10kbyte buffer if you
      want to reach your configured rate!
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If your buffer is too small, packets may be dropped because more tokens
      arrive per timer tick than fit in your bucket. The minimum buffer size can
      be calculated by dividing the rate by HZ.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Token usage calculations are performed using a table which by default has a
      resolution of 8 packets. This resolution can be changed by specifying the
      <b>cell</b> size with the burst. For example, to specify a 6000 byte
      buffer with a 16 byte cell size, set a burst of 6000/16. You will probably
      never have to set this. Must be an integral power of 2.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">mpu</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A zero-sized packet does not use zero bandwidth. For
      ethernet, no packet uses less than 64 bytes. The Minimum Packet Unit
      determines the minimal token usage (specified in bytes) for a packet.
      Defaults to zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">rate</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The speed knob. See remarks above about limits! See
      <b>tc</b>(8) for units.</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
Furthermore, if a peakrate is desired, the following parameters are available:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">peakrate</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Maximum depletion rate of the bucket. The peakrate does not
      need to be set, it is only necessary if perfect millisecond timescale
      shaping is required.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">mtu/minburst</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the size of the peakrate bucket. For perfect
      accuracy, should be set to the MTU of the interface. If a peakrate is
      needed, but some burstiness is acceptable, this size can be raised. A 3000
      byte minburst allows around 3mbit/s of peakrate, given 1000 byte packets.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Like the regular burstsize you can also specify a <b>cell</b> size.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_&amp;_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE_&amp;_USAGE">EXAMPLE
  &amp; USAGE</a></h1>
To attach a TBF with a sustained maximum rate of 0.5mbit/s, a peakrate of
  1.0mbit/s, a 5kilobyte buffer, with a pre-bucket queue size limit calculated
  so the TBF causes at most 70ms of latency, with perfect peakrate behaviour,
  issue:
<div class="Pp"></div>
# tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle 10: root tbf rate 0.5mbit \
<br/>
 burst 5kb latency 70ms peakrate 1mbit \
<br/>
 minburst 1540
<div class="Pp"></div>
To attach an inner qdisc, for example sfq, issue:
<div class="Pp"></div>
# tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent 10:1 handle 100: sfq
<div class="Pp"></div>
Without inner qdisc TBF queue acts as bfifo. If the inner qdisc is changed the
  limit/latency is not effective anymore.
