SELinux - NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of a flexible
  mandatory access control architecture in the Linux operating system. The
  SELinux architecture provides general support for the enforcement of many
  kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those based on the
  concepts of Type Enforcement&#x00AE;, Role- Based Access Control, and
  Multi-Level Security. Background information and technical documentation about
  SELinux can be found at http://www.nsa.gov/research/selinux.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>/etc/selinux/config</i> configuration file controls whether SELinux is
  enabled or disabled, and if enabled, whether SELinux operates in permissive
  mode or enforcing mode. The <b>SELINUX</b> variable may be set to any one of
  disabled, permissive, or enforcing to select one of these options. The
  disabled option completely disables the SELinux kernel and application code,
  leaving the system running without any SELinux protection. The permissive
  option enables the SELinux code, but causes it to operate in a mode where
  accesses that would be denied by policy are permitted but audited. The
  enforcing option enables the SELinux code and causes it to enforce access
  denials as well as auditing them. Permissive mode may yield a different set of
  denials than enforcing mode, both because enforcing mode will prevent an
  operation from proceeding past the first denial and because some application
  code will fall back to a less privileged mode of operation if denied access.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>/etc/selinux/config</i> configuration file also controls what policy is
  active on the system. SELinux allows for multiple policies to be installed on
  the system, but only one policy may be active at any given time. At present,
  multiple kinds of SELinux policy exist: targeted, mls for example. The
  targeted policy is designed as a policy where most user processes operate
  without restrictions, and only specific services are placed into distinct
  security domains that are confined by the policy. For example, the user would
  run in a completely unconfined domain while the named daemon or apache daemon
  would run in a specific domain tailored to its operation. The MLS (Multi-Level
  Security) policy is designed as a policy where all processes are partitioned
  into fine-grained security domains and confined by policy. MLS also supports
  the Bell And LaPadula model, where processes are not only confined by the type
  but also the level of the data.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can define which policy you will run by setting the <b>SELINUXTYPE</b>
  environment variable within <i>/etc/selinux/config</i>. You must reboot and
  possibly relabel if you change the policy type to have it take effect on the
  system. The corresponding policy configuration for each such policy must be
  installed in the <i>/etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/</i> directories.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A given SELinux policy can be customized further based on a set of compile-time
  tunable options and a set of runtime policy booleans.
  <b>system-config-selinux</b> allows customization of these booleans and
  tunables.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Many domains that are protected by SELinux also include SELinux man pages
  explaining how to customize their policy.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_LABELING"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_LABELING">FILE
  LABELING</a></h1>
All files, directories, devices ... have a security context/label associated
  with them. These context are stored in the extended attributes of the file
  system. Problems with SELinux often arise from the file system being
  mislabeled. This can be caused by booting the machine with a non SELinux
  kernel. If you see an error message containing file_t, that is usually a good
  indicator that you have a serious problem with file system labeling.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The best way to relabel the file system is to create the flag file
  <i>/.autorelabel</i> and reboot. <b>system-config-selinux</b>, also has this
  capability. The <b>restorecon</b>/<b>fixfiles</b> commands are also available
  for relabeling files.

Every confined service on the system has a man page in the following format:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&lt;servicename&gt;_selinux(8)</b>

For example, httpd has the <b>httpd_selinux(8)</b> man page.

<b>man -k selinux</b>
