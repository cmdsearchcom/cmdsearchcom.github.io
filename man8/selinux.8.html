<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
SELinux - NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation
of a flexible mandatory access control architecture in the
Linux operating system. The SELinux architecture provides
<br>
general support for the enforcement of many kinds of
mandatory access control policies, including those based on
the concepts of Type Enforcement&Acirc;&reg;, Role- Based
Access Control, <br>
and Multi-Level Security. Background information and
technical documentation about SELinux can be found at
http://www.nsa.gov/research/selinux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The /etc/selinux/config
configuration file controls whether SELinux is enabled or
disabled, and if enabled, whether SELinux operates in
permissive mode or enforcing mode. The <br>
SELINUX variable may be set to any one of disabled,
permissive, or enforcing to select one of these options. The
disabled option completely disables the SELinux kernel and
<br>
application code, leaving the system running without any
SELinux protection. The permissive option enables the
SELinux code, but causes it to operate in a mode where
accesses <br>
that would be denied by policy are permitted but audited.
The enforcing option enables the SELinux code and causes it
to enforce access denials as well as auditing them.
Per&acirc; <br>
missive mode may yield a different set of denials than
enforcing mode, both because enforcing mode will prevent an
operation from proceeding past the first denial and because
<br>
some application code will fall back to a less privileged
mode of operation if denied access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The /etc/selinux/config
configuration file also controls what policy is active on
the system. SELinux allows for multiple policies to be
installed on the system, but only one <br>
policy may be active at any given time. At present, multiple
kinds of SELinux policy exist: targeted, mls for example.
The targeted policy is designed as a policy where most <br>
user processes operate without restrictions, and only
specific services are placed into distinct security domains
that are confined by the policy. For example, the user would
<br>
run in a completely unconfined domain while the named daemon
or apache daemon would run in a specific domain tailored to
its operation. The MLS (Multi-Level Security) policy is <br>
designed as a policy where all processes are partitioned
into fine-grained security domains and confined by policy.
MLS also supports the Bell And LaPadula model, where
pro&acirc; <br>
cesses are not only confined by the type but also the level
of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can define which policy you
will run by setting the SELINUXTYPE environment variable
within /etc/selinux/config. You must reboot and possibly
relabel if you change the pol&acirc; <br>
icy type to have it take effect on the system. The
corresponding policy configuration for each such policy must
be installed in the /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A given SELinux policy can be
customized further based on a set of compile-time tunable
options and a set of runtime policy booleans.
system-config-selinux allows customization <br>
of these booleans and tunables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many domains that are protected
by SELinux also include SELinux man pages explaining how to
customize their policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE LABELING <br>
All files, directories, devices ... have a security
context/label associated with them. These context are stored
in the extended attributes of the file system. Problems with
<br>
SELinux often arise from the file system being mislabeled.
This can be caused by booting the machine with a non SELinux
kernel. If you see an error message containing file_t, <br>
that is usually a good indicator that you have a serious
problem with file system labeling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best way to relabel the file
system is to create the flag file /.autorelabel and reboot.
system-config-selinux, also has this capability. The
restorecon/fixfiles commands <br>
are also available for relabeling files.</p>
