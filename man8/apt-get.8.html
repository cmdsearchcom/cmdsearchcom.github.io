<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>apt-get</b> is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be
  considered the user's &quot;back-end&quot; to other tools using the APT
  library. Several &quot;front-end&quot; interfaces exist, such as
  <b>aptitude</b>(8), <b>synaptic</b>(8) and <b>wajig</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unless the <b>-h</b>, or <b>--help</b> option is given, one of the commands
  below must be present.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>update</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">update is used to resynchronize the package
  index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched
  from the location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when
  using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz
  files, so that information about new and updated packages is available. An
  update should always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be
  aware that the overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the
  package files cannot be known in advance.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>upgrade</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">upgrade is used to install the newest versions
  of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated
  in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions
  available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently
  installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and
  installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be
  upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left
  at their current version. An update must be performed first so that
  <b>apt-get</b> knows that new versions of packages are available.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dist-upgrade</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">dist-upgrade in addition to performing the
  function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new
  versions of packages; <b>apt-get</b> has a &quot;smart&quot; conflict
  resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages
  at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command
  may therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a
  list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also
  <b>apt_preferences</b>(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings
  for individual packages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dselect-upgrade</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">dselect-upgrade is used in conjunction with
  the traditional Debian packaging front-end, <b>dselect</b>(1). dselect-upgrade
  follows the changes made by <b>dselect</b>(1) to the Status field of available
  packages, and performs the actions necessary to realize that state (for
  instance, the removal of old and the installation of new packages).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>install</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">install is followed by one or more packages
  desired for installation or upgrading. Each package is a package name, not a
  fully qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian system, apt-utils would be
  the argument provided, not apt-utils_1.2.24_amd64.deb). All packages required
  by the package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved and
  installed. The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate the desired
  packages. If a hyphen is appended to the package name (with no intervening
  space), the identified package will be removed if it is installed. Similarly a
  plus sign can be used to designate a package to install. These latter features
  may be used to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution
  system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following
  the package name with an equals and the version of the package to select. This
  will cause that version to be located and selected for install. Alternatively
  a specific distribution can be selected by following the package name with a
  slash and the version of the distribution or the Archive name (stable,
  testing, unstable).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Both of the version selection mechanisms can downgrade packages and must be used
  with care.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is also the target to use if you want to upgrade one or more
  already-installed packages without upgrading every package you have on your
  system. Unlike the &quot;upgrade&quot; target, which installs the newest
  version of all currently installed packages, &quot;install&quot; will install
  the newest version of only the package(s) specified. Simply provide the name
  of the package(s) you wish to upgrade, and if a newer version is available, it
  (and its dependencies, as described above) will be downloaded and installed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, the <b>apt_preferences</b>(5) mechanism allows you to create an
  alternative installation policy for individual packages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no package matches the given expression and the expression contains one of
  '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX regular expression, and it is
  applied to all package names in the database. Any matches are then installed
  (or removed). Note that matching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches
  'how-lo' and 'lowest'. If this is undesired, anchor the regular expression
  with a '^' or '$' character, or create a more specific regular
  expression.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>remove</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">remove is identical to install except that
  packages are removed instead of installed. Note that removing a package leaves
  its configuration files on the system. If a plus sign is appended to the
  package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be
  installed instead of removed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>purge</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">purge is identical to remove except that
  packages are removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted
  too).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>source</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">source causes <b>apt-get</b> to fetch source
  packages. APT will examine the available packages to decide which source
  package to fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory
  the newest available version of that source package while respecting the
  default release, set with the option APT::Default-Release, the <b>-t</b>
  option or per package with the pkg/release syntax, if possible.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Source packages are tracked separately from binary packages via deb-src lines in
  the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file. This means that you will need to add such a
  line for each repository you want to get sources from; otherwise you will
  probably get either the wrong (too old/too new) source versions or none at
  all.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the <b>--compile</b> option is specified then the package will be compiled to
  a binary .deb using <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> for the architecture as defined
  by the <b>--host-architecture</b> option. If <b>--download-only</b> is
  specified then the source package will not be unpacked.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the source name with an
  equals and then the version to fetch, similar to the mechanism used for the
  package files. This enables exact matching of the source package name and
  version, implicitly enabling the APT::Get::Only-Source option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that source packages are not installed and tracked in the <b>dpkg</b>
  database like binary packages; they are simply downloaded to the current
  directory, like source tarballs.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>build-dep</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">build-dep causes apt-get to install/remove
  packages in an attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source package.
  By default the dependencies are satisfied to build the package natively. If
  desired a host-architecture can be specified with the
  <b>--host-architecture</b> option instead.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>check</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">check is a diagnostic tool; it updates the
  package cache and checks for broken dependencies.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>download</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">download will download the given binary
  package into the current directory.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>clean</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">clean clears out the local repository of
  retrieved package files. It removes everything but the lock file from
  /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>autoclean</b> (and the <b>auto-clean</b> alias since 1.1)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Like clean, autoclean clears out the local
  repository of retrieved package files. The difference is that it only removes
  package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This
  allows a cache to be maintained over a long period without it growing out of
  control. The configuration option APT::Clean-Installed will prevent installed
  packages from being erased if it is set to off.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>autoremove</b> (and the <b>auto-remove</b> alias since 1.1)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">autoremove is used to remove packages that
  were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and
  are now no longer needed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>changelog</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">changelog tries to download the changelog of a
  package and displays it through <b>sensible-pager</b>. By default it displays
  the changelog for the version that is installed. However, you can specify the
  same options as for the <b>install</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>indextargets</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Displays by default a deb822 formatted listing
  of information about all data files (aka index targets) <b>apt-get update</b>
  would download. Supports a <b>--format</b> option to modify the output format
  as well as accepts lines of the default output to filter the records by. The
  command is mainly used as an interface for external tools working with APT to
  get information as well as filenames for downloaded files so they can use them
  as well instead of downloading them again on their own. Detailed documentation
  is omitted here and can instead be found in the source tree in
  doc/acquire-additional-files.txt.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the
  descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean options you
  can override the config file by using something like <b>-f-</b>,<b>--no-f</b>,
  <b>-f=no</b> or several other variations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-install-recommends</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not consider recommended packages as a
  dependency for installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Recommends.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--install-suggests</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Consider suggested packages as a dependency
  for installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Suggests.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-d</b>, <b>--download-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Download only; package files are only
  retrieved, not unpacked or installed. Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::Download-Only.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-f</b>, <b>--fix-broken</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken
  dependencies in place. This option, when used with install/remove, can omit
  any packages to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. If packages are
  specified, these have to completely correct the problem. The option is
  sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time; APT itself does not
  allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a
  system's dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require manual
  intervention (which usually means using <b>dpkg --remove</b> to eliminate some
  of the offending packages). Use of this option together with <b>-m</b> may
  produce an error in some situations. Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::Fix-Broken.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-m</b>, <b>--ignore-missing</b>, <b>--fix-missing</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore missing packages; if packages cannot be
  retrieved or fail the integrity check after retrieval (corrupted package
  files), hold back those packages and handle the result. Use of this option
  together with <b>-f</b> may produce an error in some situations. If a package
  is selected for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the command
  line) and it could not be downloaded then it will be silently held back.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Missing.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-download</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Disables downloading of packages. This is best
  used with <b>--ignore-missing</b> to force APT to use only the .debs it has
  already downloaded. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Quiet; produces output suitable for logging,
  omitting progress indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum
  of 2. You can also use <b>-q=#</b> to set the quiet level, overriding the
  configuration file. Note that quiet level 2 implies <b>-y</b>; you should
  never use -qq without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s as
  APT may decide to do something you did not expect. Configuration Item:
  quiet.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-s</b>, <b>--simulate</b>, <b>--just-print</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>,
  <b>--recon</b>, <b>--no-act</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">No action; perform a simulation of events that
  would occur based on the current system state but do not actually change the
  system. Locking will be disabled ( <b>Debug::NoLocking</b>) so the system
  state could change while <b>apt-get</b> is running. Simulations can also be
  executed by non-root users which might not have read access to all apt
  configuration distorting the simulation. A notice expressing this warning is
  also shown by default for non-root users (
  <b>APT::Get::Show-User-Simulation-Note</b>). Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::Simulate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Simulated runs print out a series of lines, each representing a <b>dpkg</b>
  operation: configure (Conf), remove (Remv) or unpack (Inst). Square brackets
  indicate broken packages, and empty square brackets indicate breaks that are
  of no consequence (rare).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-y</b>, <b>--yes</b>, <b>--assume-yes</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Automatic yes to prompts; assume
  &quot;yes&quot; as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. If an
  undesirable situation, such as changing a held package, trying to install a
  unauthenticated package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get
  will abort. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--assume-no</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Automatic &quot;no&quot; to all prompts.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-No.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-u</b>, <b>--show-upgraded</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show upgraded packages; print out a list of
  all packages that are to be upgraded. Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::Show-Upgraded.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose-versions</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show full versions for upgraded and installed
  packages. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Versions.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-a</b>, <b>--host-architecture</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option controls the architecture packages
  are built for by <b>apt-get source --compile</b> and how
  cross-builddependencies are satisfied. By default is it not set which means
  that the host architecture is the same as the build architecture (which is
  defined by APT::Architecture). Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::Host-Architecture.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-P</b>, <b>--build-profiles</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option controls the activated build
  profiles for which a source package is built by <b>apt-get source
  --compile</b> and how build dependencies are satisfied. By default no build
  profile is active. More than one build profile can be activated at a time by
  concatenating them with a comma. Configuration Item:
  APT::Build-Profiles.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-b</b>, <b>--compile</b>, <b>--build</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Compile source packages after downloading
  them. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Compile.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--ignore-hold</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore package holds; this causes
  <b>apt-get</b> to ignore a hold placed on a package. This may be useful in
  conjunction with dist-upgrade to override a large number of undesired holds.
  Configuration Item: APT::Ignore-Hold.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--with-new-pkgs</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Allow installing new packages when used in
  conjunction with upgrade. This is useful if the update of a installed package
  requires new dependencies to be installed. Instead of holding the package back
  upgrade will upgrade the package and install the new dependencies. Note that
  upgrade with this option will never remove packages, only allow adding new
  ones. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Upgrade-Allow-New.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-upgrade</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not upgrade packages; when used in
  conjunction with install, no-upgrade will prevent packages on the command line
  from being upgraded if they are already installed. Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::Upgrade.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--only-upgrade</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not install new packages; when used in
  conjunction with install, only-upgrade will install upgrades for already
  installed packages only and ignore requests to install new packages.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Upgrade.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--allow-downgrades</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is a dangerous option that will cause apt
  to continue without prompting if it is doing downgrades. It should not be used
  except in very special situations. Using it can potentially destroy your
  system! Configuration Item: APT::Get::allow-downgrades. Introduced in APT
  1.1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--allow-remove-essential</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force yes; this is a dangerous option that
  will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is removing essentials. It
  should not be used except in very special situations. Using it can potentially
  destroy your system! Configuration Item: APT::Get::allow-remove-essential.
  Introduced in APT 1.1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--allow-change-held-packages</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force yes; this is a dangerous option that
  will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is changing held packages.
  It should not be used except in very special situations. Using it can
  potentially destroy your system! Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::allow-change-held-packages. Introduced in APT 1.1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--force-yes</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force yes; this is a dangerous option that
  will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is doing something
  potentially harmful. It should not be used except in very special situations.
  Using force-yes can potentially destroy your system! Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::force-yes. This is deprecated and replaced by
  <b>--allow-downgrades</b>, <b>--allow-remove-essential</b>,
  <b>--allow-change-held-packages</b> in 1.1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--print-uris</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Instead of fetching the files to install their
  URIs are printed. Each URI will have the path, the destination file name, the
  size and the expected MD5 hash. Note that the file name to write to will not
  always match the file name on the remote site! This also works with the source
  and update commands. When used with the update command the MD5 and size are
  not included, and it is up to the user to decompress any compressed files.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Print-URIs.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--purge</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use purge instead of remove for anything that
  would be removed. An asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) will be displayed next to
  packages which are scheduled to be purged. <b>remove --purge</b> is equivalent
  to the <b>purge</b> command. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Purge.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--reinstall</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Re-install packages that are already installed
  and at the newest version. Configuration Item: APT::Get::ReInstall.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--list-cleanup</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option is on by default; use
  --no-list-cleanup to turn it off. When it is on, <b>apt-get</b> will
  automatically manage the contents of /var/lib/apt/lists to ensure that
  obsolete files are erased. The only reason to turn it off is if you frequently
  change your sources list. Configuration Item: APT::Get::List-Cleanup.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-t</b>, <b>--target-release</b>, <b>--default-release</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option controls the default input to the
  policy engine; it creates a default pin at priority 990 using the specified
  release string. This overrides the general settings in /etc/apt/preferences.
  Specifically pinned packages are not affected by the value of this option. In
  short, this option lets you have simple control over which distribution
  packages will be retrieved from. Some common examples might be <b>-t
  '2.1*'</b>, <b>-t unstable</b> or <b>-t sid</b>. Configuration Item:
  APT::Default-Release; see also the <b>apt_preferences</b>(5) manual
  page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--trivial-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Only perform operations that are 'trivial'.
  Logically this can be considered related to <b>--assume-yes</b>; where
  <b>--assume-yes</b> will answer yes to any prompt, <b>--trivial-only</b> will
  answer no. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Trivial-Only.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-remove</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If any packages are to be removed apt-get
  immediately aborts without prompting. Configuration Item:
  APT::Get::Remove.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--auto-remove</b>, <b>--autoremove</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the command is either install or remove,
  then this option acts like running the autoremove command, removing unused
  dependency packages. Configuration Item: APT::Get::AutomaticRemove.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--only-source</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Only has meaning for the source and build-dep
  commands. Indicates that the given source names are not to be mapped through
  the binary table. This means that if this option is specified, these commands
  will only accept source package names as arguments, rather than accepting
  binary package names and looking up the corresponding source package.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Source.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--diff-only</b>, <b>--dsc-only</b>, <b>--tar-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Download only the diff, dsc, or tar file of a
  source archive. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Diff-Only, APT::Get::Dsc-Only,
  and APT::Get::Tar-Only.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--arch-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Only process architecture-dependent
  build-dependencies. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Arch-Only.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--allow-unauthenticated</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore if packages can't be authenticated and
  don't prompt about it. This can be useful while working with local
  repositories, but is a huge security risk if data authenticity isn't ensured
  in another way by the user itself. The usage of the <b>Trusted</b> option for
  <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries should usually be preferred over this global
  override. Configuration Item: APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-allow-insecure-repositories</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Forbid the update command to acquire
  unverifiable data from configured sources. Apt will fail at the update command
  for repositories without valid cryptographically signatures. Configuration
  Item: Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--show-progress</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show user friendly progress information in the
  terminal window when packages are installed, upgraded or removed. For a
  machine parsable version of this data see README.progress-reporting in the apt
  doc directory. Configuration Item: Dpkg::Progress and
  Dpkg::Progress-Fancy.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show a short usage summary.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show the program version.</div>
