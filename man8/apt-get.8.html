apt-get - APT package handling utility -- command-line
interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apt-get [-asqdyfmubV] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file]
[-t=target_release] [-a=architecture] {update | upgrade |

{-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages, and
may be considered the user&rsquo;s &quot;back-end&quot; to
other tools using the APT library. Several
&quot;front-end&quot; interfaces exist, <br>
such as aptitude(8), synaptic(8) and wajig(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the -h, or --help option
is given, one of the commands below must be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update <br>
update is used to resynchronize the package index files from
their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched
from the location(s) specified in <br>
/etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when using a Debian
archive, this command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz
files, so that information about new and updated packages is
<br>
available. An update should always be performed before an
upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that the overall
progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the <br>
package files cannot be known in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade <br>
upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all
packages currently installed on the system from the sources
enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently <br>
installed with new versions available are retrieved and
upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed
packages removed, or packages not already installed
retrieved <br>
and installed. New versions of currently installed packages
that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status
of another package will be left at their current <br>
version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get
knows that new versions of packages are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dist-upgrade <br>
dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of
upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies
with new versions of packages; apt-get has a
&quot;smart&quot; conflict <br>
resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most
important packages at the expense of less important ones if
necessary. The dist-upgrade command may therefore <br>
remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file
contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired
package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism
<br>
for overriding the general settings for individual
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dselect-upgrade <br>
dselect-upgrade is used in conjunction with the traditional
Debian packaging front-end, dselect(1). dselect-upgrade
follows the changes made by dselect(1) to the Status <br>
field of available packages, and performs the actions
necessary to realize that state (for instance, the removal
of old and the installation of new packages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install <br>
install is followed by one or more packages desired for
installation or upgrading. Each package is a package name,
not a fully qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian
<br>
system, apt-utils would be the argument provided, not
apt-utils_1.2.24_amd64.deb). All packages required by the
package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved
<br>
and installed. The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to
locate the desired packages. If a hyphen is appended to the
package name (with no intervening space), the identified
<br>
package will be removed if it is installed. Similarly a plus
sign can be used to designate a package to install. These
latter features may be used to override decisions made <br>
by apt-get&rsquo;s conflict resolution system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A specific version of a package
can be selected for installation by following the package
name with an equals and the version of the package to
select. This will cause that <br>
version to be located and selected for install.
Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by
following the package name with a slash and the version of
the <br>
distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing,
unstable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both of the version selection
mechanisms can downgrade packages and must be used with
care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is also the target to use
if you want to upgrade one or more already-installed
packages without upgrading every package you have on your
system. Unlike the &quot;upgrade&quot; <br>
target, which installs the newest version of all currently
installed packages, &quot;install&quot; will install the
newest version of only the package(s) specified. Simply
provide the <br>
name of the package(s) you wish to upgrade, and if a newer
version is available, it (and its dependencies, as described
above) will be downloaded and installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the apt_preferences(5)
mechanism allows you to create an alternative installation
policy for individual packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no package matches the given
expression and the expression contains one of
&rsquo;.&rsquo;, &rsquo;?&rsquo; or &rsquo;*&rsquo; then it
is assumed to be a POSIX regular expression, and it is
applied to all <br>
package names in the database. Any matches are then
installed (or removed). Note that matching is done by
substring so &rsquo;lo.*&rsquo; matches &rsquo;how-lo&rsquo;
and &rsquo;lowest&rsquo;. If this is <br>
undesired, anchor the regular expression with a
&rsquo;^&rsquo; or &rsquo;$&rsquo; character, or create a
more specific regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove <br>
remove is identical to install except that packages are
removed instead of installed. Note that removing a package
leaves its configuration files on the system. If a plus <br>
sign is appended to the package name (with no intervening
space), the identified package will be installed instead of
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">purge <br>
purge is identical to remove except that packages are
removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted
too).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source <br>
source causes apt-get to fetch source packages. APT will
examine the available packages to decide which source
package to fetch. It will then find and download into the
<br>
current directory the newest available version of that
source package while respecting the default release, set
with the option APT::Default-Release, the -t option or per
<br>
package with the pkg/release syntax, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source packages are tracked
separately from binary packages via deb-src lines in the
sources.list(5) file. This means that you will need to add
such a line for each <br>
repository you want to get sources from; otherwise you will
probably get either the wrong (too old/too new) source
versions or none at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --compile option is
specified then the package will be compiled to a binary .deb
using dpkg-buildpackage for the architecture as defined by
the --host-architecture <br>
option. If --download-only is specified then the source
package will not be unpacked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A specific source version can be
retrieved by postfixing the source name with an equals and
then the version to fetch, similar to the mechanism used for
the package files. <br>
This enables exact matching of the source package name and
version, implicitly enabling the APT::Get::Only-Source
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that source packages are
not installed and tracked in the dpkg database like binary
packages; they are simply downloaded to the current
directory, like source tarballs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">build-dep <br>
build-dep causes apt-get to install/remove packages in an
attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source
package. By default the dependencies are satisfied to build
<br>
the package natively. If desired a host-architecture can be
specified with the --host-architecture option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check <br>
check is a diagnostic tool; it updates the package cache and
checks for broken dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download <br>
download will download the given binary package into the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean <br>
clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package
files. It removes everything but the lock file from
/var/cache/apt/archives/ and
/var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoclean (and the auto-clean
alias since 1.1) <br>
Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of
retrieved package files. The difference is that it only
removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and
<br>
are largely useless. This allows a cache to be maintained
over a long period without it growing out of control. The
configuration option APT::Clean-Installed will prevent <br>
installed packages from being erased if it is set to
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoremove (and the auto-remove
alias since 1.1) <br>
autoremove is used to remove packages that were
automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other
packages and are now no longer needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changelog <br>
changelog tries to download the changelog of a package and
displays it through sensible-pager. By default it displays
the changelog for the version that is installed. <br>
However, you can specify the same options as for the install
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indextargets <br>
Displays by default a deb822 formatted listing of
information about all data files (aka index targets) apt-get
update would download. Supports a --format option to modify
the <br>
output format as well as accepts lines of the default output
to filter the records by. The command is mainly used as an
interface for external tools working with APT to get <br>
information as well as filenames for downloaded files so
they can use them as well instead of downloading them again
on their own. Detailed documentation is omitted here and
<br>
can instead be found in the source tree in
doc/acquire-additional-files.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All command line options may be set using the configuration
file, the descriptions indicate the configuration option to
set. For boolean options you can override the config file
<br>
by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or several other
variations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-install-recommends <br>
Do not consider recommended packages as a dependency for
installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Recommends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--install-suggests <br>
Consider suggested packages as a dependency for installing.
Configuration Item: APT::Install-Suggests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --download-only <br>
Download only; package files are only retrieved, not
unpacked or installed. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Download-Only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fix-broken <br>
Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in
place. This option, when used with install/remove, can omit
any packages to permit APT to deduce a likely <br>
solution. If packages are specified, these have to
completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes
necessary when running APT for the first time; APT itself
does not <br>
allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system. It
is possible that a system&rsquo;s dependency structure can
be so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which
usually <br>
means using dpkg --remove to eliminate some of the offending
packages). Use of this option together with -m may produce
an error in some situations. Configuration Item: <br>
APT::Get::Fix-Broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --ignore-missing,
--fix-missing <br>
Ignore missing packages; if packages cannot be retrieved or
fail the integrity check after retrieval (corrupted package
files), hold back those packages and handle the <br>
result. Use of this option together with -f may produce an
error in some situations. If a package is selected for
installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the command
<br>
line) and it could not be downloaded then it will be
silently held back. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Fix-Missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-download <br>
Disables downloading of packages. This is best used with
--ignore-missing to force APT to use only the .debs it has
already downloaded. Configuration Item: <br>
APT::Get::Download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting
progress indicators. More q&rsquo;s will produce more quiet
up to a maximum of 2. You can also use -q=# to set the quiet
<br>
level, overriding the configuration file. Note that quiet
level 2 implies -y; you should never use -qq without a
no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s as APT may
<br>
decide to do something you did not expect. Configuration
Item: quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --simulate, --just-print,
--dry-run, --recon, --no-act <br>
No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur
based on the current system state but do not actually change
the system. Locking will be disabled <br>
(Debug::NoLocking) so the system state could change while
apt-get is running. Simulations can also be executed by
non-root users which might not have read access to all apt
<br>
configuration distorting the simulation. A notice expressing
this warning is also shown by default for non-root users
(APT::Get::Show-User-Simulation-Note). Configuration <br>
Item: APT::Get::Simulate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simulated runs print out a
series of lines, each representing a dpkg operation:
configure (Conf), remove (Remv) or unpack (Inst). Square
brackets indicate broken packages, <br>
and empty square brackets indicate breaks that are of no
consequence (rare).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --yes, --assume-yes <br>
Automatic yes to prompts; assume &quot;yes&quot; as answer
to all prompts and run non-interactively. If an undesirable
situation, such as changing a held package, trying to
install a <br>
unauthenticated package or removing an essential package
occurs then apt-get will abort. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Assume-Yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--assume-no <br>
Automatic &quot;no&quot; to all prompts. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Assume-No.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --show-upgraded <br>
Show upgraded packages; print out a list of all packages
that are to be upgraded. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Show-Upgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose-versions <br>
Show full versions for upgraded and installed packages.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --host-architecture <br>
This option controls the architecture packages are built for
by apt-get source --compile and how cross-builddependencies
are satisfied. By default is it not set which means <br>
that the host architecture is the same as the build
architecture (which is defined by APT::Architecture).
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Host-Architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --build-profiles <br>
This option controls the activated build profiles for which
a source package is built by apt-get source --compile and
how build dependencies are satisfied. By default no <br>
build profile is active. More than one build profile can be
activated at a time by concatenating them with a comma.
Configuration Item: APT::Build-Profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --compile, --build <br>
Compile source packages after downloading them.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-hold <br>
Ignore package holds; this causes apt-get to ignore a hold
placed on a package. This may be useful in conjunction with
dist-upgrade to override a large number of undesired <br>
holds. Configuration Item: APT::Ignore-Hold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-new-pkgs <br>
Allow installing new packages when used in conjunction with
upgrade. This is useful if the update of a installed package
requires new dependencies to be installed. Instead of <br>
holding the package back upgrade will upgrade the package
and install the new dependencies. Note that upgrade with
this option will never remove packages, only allow adding
<br>
new ones. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Upgrade-Allow-New.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-upgrade <br>
Do not upgrade packages; when used in conjunction with
install, no-upgrade will prevent packages on the command
line from being upgraded if they are already installed. <br>
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--only-upgrade <br>
Do not install new packages; when used in conjunction with
install, only-upgrade will install upgrades for already
installed packages only and ignore requests to install new
<br>
packages. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-downgrades <br>
This is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue
without prompting if it is doing downgrades. It should not
be used except in very special situations. Using it can <br>
potentially destroy your system! Configuration Item:
APT::Get::allow-downgrades. Introduced in APT 1.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-remove-essential <br>
Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to
continue without prompting if it is removing essentials. It
should not be used except in very special situations. <br>
Using it can potentially destroy your system! Configuration
Item: APT::Get::allow-remove-essential. Introduced in APT
1.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-change-held-packages
<br>
Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to
continue without prompting if it is changing held packages.
It should not be used except in very special <br>
situations. Using it can potentially destroy your system!
Configuration Item: APT::Get::allow-change-held-packages.
Introduced in APT 1.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-yes <br>
Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to
continue without prompting if it is doing something
potentially harmful. It should not be used except in very
<br>
special situations. Using force-yes can potentially destroy
your system! Configuration Item: APT::Get::force-yes. This
is deprecated and replaced by --allow-downgrades, <br>
--allow-remove-essential, --allow-change-held-packages in
1.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-uris <br>
Instead of fetching the files to install their URIs are
printed. Each URI will have the path, the destination file
name, the size and the expected MD5 hash. Note that the <br>
file name to write to will not always match the file name on
the remote site! This also works with the source and update
commands. When used with the update command the MD5 <br>
and size are not included, and it is up to the user to
decompress any compressed files. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Print-URIs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--purge <br>
Use purge instead of remove for anything that would be
removed. An asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) will be displayed next
to packages which are scheduled to be purged. remove --purge
is <br>
equivalent to the purge command. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::Purge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reinstall <br>
Re-install packages that are already installed and at the
newest version. Configuration Item: APT::Get::ReInstall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-cleanup <br>
This option is on by default; use --no-list-cleanup to turn
it off. When it is on, apt-get will automatically manage the
contents of /var/lib/apt/lists to ensure that <br>
obsolete files are erased. The only reason to turn it off is
if you frequently change your sources list. Configuration
Item: APT::Get::List-Cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --target-release,
--default-release <br>
This option controls the default input to the policy engine;
it creates a default pin at priority 990 using the specified
release string. This overrides the general settings <br>
in /etc/apt/preferences. Specifically pinned packages are
not affected by the value of this option. In short, this
option lets you have simple control over which distribution
<br>
packages will be retrieved from. Some common examples might
be -t &rsquo;2.1*&rsquo;, -t unstable or -t sid.
Configuration Item: APT::Default-Release; see also the
apt_preferences(5) <br>
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trivial-only <br>
Only perform operations that are &rsquo;trivial&rsquo;.
Logically this can be considered related to --assume-yes;
where --assume-yes will answer yes to any prompt,
--trivial-only will <br>
answer no. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Trivial-Only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-remove <br>
If any packages are to be removed apt-get immediately aborts
without prompting. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Remove.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-remove, --autoremove <br>
If the command is either install or remove, then this option
acts like running the autoremove command, removing unused
dependency packages. Configuration Item: <br>
APT::Get::AutomaticRemove.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--only-source <br>
Only has meaning for the source and build-dep commands.
Indicates that the given source names are not to be mapped
through the binary table. This means that if this option is
<br>
specified, these commands will only accept source package
names as arguments, rather than accepting binary package
names and looking up the corresponding source package. <br>
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff-only, --dsc-only,
--tar-only <br>
Download only the diff, dsc, or tar file of a source
archive. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Diff-Only,
APT::Get::Dsc-Only, and APT::Get::Tar-Only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch-only <br>
Only process architecture-dependent build-dependencies.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Arch-Only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-unauthenticated <br>
Ignore if packages can&rsquo;t be authenticated and
don&rsquo;t prompt about it. This can be useful while
working with local repositories, but is a huge security risk
if data <br>
authenticity isn&rsquo;t ensured in another way by the user
itself. The usage of the Trusted option for sources.list(5)
entries should usually be preferred over this global <br>
override. Configuration Item:
APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-allow-insecure-repositories
<br>
Forbid the update command to acquire unverifiable data from
configured sources. Apt will fail at the update command for
repositories without valid cryptographically <br>
signatures. Configuration Item:
Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-progress <br>
Show user friendly progress information in the terminal
window when packages are installed, upgraded or removed. For
a machine parsable version of this data see <br>
README.progress-reporting in the apt doc directory.
Configuration Item: Dpkg::Progress and
Dpkg::Progress-Fancy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show a short usage summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Show the program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config-file <br>
Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The
program will read the default configuration file and then
this configuration file. If configuration settings need <br>
to be set before the default configuration files are parsed
specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See
apt.conf(5) for syntax information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --option <br>
Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary
configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar. -o and
--option can be used multiple times to set different <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
