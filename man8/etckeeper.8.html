<b>etckeeper command [-d directory]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
etckeeper manages /etc be stored in a git, mercurial, bazaar, or darcs
  repository. By default each of the commands operates on /etc, but a different
  directory can be specified to operate on a clone of the /etc repository
  located elsewhere.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>init</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This initialises and sets up a git, mercurial, bazaar, or
      darcs repository (depending on the VCS setting in
      /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf). Typically this is run in /etc once when
      starting to use etckeeper on a machine. It can also be used to initialise
      a clone of the /etc repository located elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>commit [message]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Commits all changes in /etc to the repository. A commit
      message can be specified. You may also use the underlying VCS to commit
      manually. (Note that etckeeper commit will notice if a user has used sudo
      or su to become root, and record the original username in the
    commit.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>pre-commit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is called as a pre-commit hook. It stores metadata and
      does sanity checks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>pre-install</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is called by apt's DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs hook, or by
      equivalent hooks of other package managers. It allows committing any
      uncommitted changes before packages are installed, upgraded, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>post-install</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is called by apt's DPkg::Post-Invoke hook, or by
      equivalent hooks of other package managers. It commits changes made by
      packages into the repository. (You can also call this by hand after
      running dpkg by hand.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>unclean</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This returns true if the directory contains uncommitted
      changes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>update-ignore [-a]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This updates the VCS ignore file. Content outside a
      &quot;managed by etckeeper&quot; block is not touched. This is generally
      run when upgrading to a new version of etckeeper. (The -a switch will add
      a &quot;managed by etckeeper&quot; block if one is not present.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>vcs subcommand [options ...]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You can use this to run any subcommand of the VCS that
      etckeeper is configured to run. It will be run in /etc. For example,
      &quot;etckeeper vcs diff&quot; will run &quot;git diff&quot;, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>uninit [-f]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command DESTROYS DATA! It is the inverse of the init
      command, removing VCS information and etckeeper's own bookkeeping
      information from the directory. Use with caution. A typical use case would
      be to run etckeeper uninit, then modify etckeeper.conf to use a different
      VCS, and then run etckeeper init. (The -f switch can be used to force
      uninit without prompting.)</dd>
