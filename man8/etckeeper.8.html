<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
etckeeper - store /etc in git, mercurial, bazaar, or
darcs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
etckeeper command [-d directory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
etckeeper manages /etc be stored in a git, mercurial,
bazaar, or darcs repository. By default each of the commands
operates on /etc, but a different directory can be specified
to <br>
operate on a clone of the /etc repository located
elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
init This initialises and sets up a git, mercurial, bazaar,
or darcs repository (depending on the VCS setting in
/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf). Typically this is run in
/etc <br>
once when starting to use etckeeper on a machine. It can
also be used to initialise a clone of the /etc repository
located elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit [message] <br>
Commits all changes in /etc to the repository. A commit
message can be specified. You may also use the underlying
VCS to commit manually. (Note that etckeeper commit will
<br>
notice if a user has used sudo or su to become root, and
record the original username in the commit.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pre-commit <br>
This is called as a pre-commit hook. It stores metadata and
does sanity checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pre-install <br>
This is called by apt&rsquo;s DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs hook,
or by equivalent hooks of other package managers. It allows
committing any uncommitted changes before packages are <br>
installed, upgraded, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post-install <br>
This is called by apt&rsquo;s DPkg::Post-Invoke hook, or by
equivalent hooks of other package managers. It commits
changes made by packages into the repository. (You can also
<br>
call this by hand after running dpkg by hand.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unclean <br>
This returns true if the directory contains uncommitted
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-ignore [-a] <br>
This updates the VCS ignore file. Content outside a
&quot;managed by etckeeper&quot; block is not touched. This
is generally run when upgrading to a new version of
etckeeper. (The <br>
-a switch will add a &quot;managed by etckeeper&quot; block
if one is not present.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vcs subcommand [options ...]
<br>
You can use this to run any subcommand of the VCS that
etckeeper is configured to run. It will be run in /etc. For
example, &quot;etckeeper vcs diff&quot; will run &quot;git
diff&quot;, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uninit [-f] <br>
This command DESTROYS DATA! It is the inverse of the init
command, removing VCS information and etckeeper&rsquo;s own
bookkeeping information from the directory. Use with
cau&acirc; <br>
tion. A typical use case would be to run etckeeper uninit,
then modify etckeeper.conf to use a different VCS, and then
run etckeeper init. (The -f switch can be used to <br>
force uninit without prompting.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf is the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/etckeeper also contains
directories containing the programs that are run for each of
the above commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
ETCKEEPER_CONF_DIR path to configuration directory instead
of default /etc/etckeeper.</p>
