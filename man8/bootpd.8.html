<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bootpd, bootpgw - Internet Boot Protocol server/gateway</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bootpd [ -v ] [ -i -s -t timeout -d level -c chdir-path ] [
bootptab [ dumpfile ] ] <br>
bootpgw [ -v ] [ -i -s -t timeout -d level ] server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bootpd implements an Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
server as defined in RFC951, RFC1532, and RFC1533. This
server also provides some extension to support the static
part of <br>
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as specified in
RFC1533. DHCP is used by Windows NT and 95. Bootpgw
implements a simple BOOTP gateway which can be used to
forward <br>
requests and responses between clients on one subnet and a
BOOTP server (i.e. bootpd) on another subnet. While either
bootpd or bootpgw will forward BOOTREPLY packets, only <br>
bootpgw will forward BOOTREQUEST packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One host on each network segment
is normally configured to run either bootpd or bootpgw from
inetd by including one of the following lines in the file
/etc/inetd.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bootps dgram udp wait root
/usr/sbin/bootpd bootpd bootptab <br>
bootps dgram udp wait root /usr/sbin/bootpgw bootpgw
server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mode of operation is
referred to as &quot;inetd mode&quot; and causes bootpd (or
bootpgw) to be started only when a boot request arrives. If
it does not receive another packet within <br>
fifteen minutes of the last one it received, it will exit to
conserve system resources. The -t option controls this
timeout (see OPTIONS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to run
bootpd (or bootpgw) in &quot;standalone mode&quot; (without
inetd) by simply invoking it from a shell like any other
regular command. Standalone mode is partic&acirc; <br>
ularly useful when bootpd is used with a large configuration
database, where the start up delay might otherwise prevent
timely response to client requests. (Automatic start up <br>
in standalone mode can be done by invoking bootpd from
within /etc/rc.local, for example.) Standalone mode is less
useful for bootgw which has very little start up delay
because <br>
it does not read a configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either program automatically
detects whether it was invoked from inetd or from a shell
and automatically selects the appropriate mode. The -s or -i
option may be used to force <br>
standalone or inetd mode respectively (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-t timeout <br>
Specifies the timeout value (in minutes) that a bootpd or
bootpgw process will wait for a BOOTP packet before exiting.
If no packets are received for timeout seconds, <br>
then the program will exit. A timeout value of zero means
&quot;run forever&quot;. In standalone mode, this option is
forced to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d debug-level <br>
Sets the debug-level variable that controls the amount of
debugging messages generated. For example, -d4 or -d 4 will
set the debugging level to 4. For compatibility <br>
with older versions of bootpd, omitting the numeric
parameter (i.e. just -d) will simply increment the debug
level by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c chdir-path <br>
Sets the current directory used by bootpd while checking the
existence and size of client boot files. This is useful when
client boot files are specified as relative <br>
pathnames, and bootpd needs to use the same current
directory as the TFTP server (typically /tftpboot). This
option is not recognized by bootpgw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Force inetd mode. This option
is obsolete, but remains for compatibility with older
versions of bootpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Force standalone mode. This
option is obsolete, but remains for compatibility with older
versions of bootpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bootptab <br>
Specifies the name of the configuration file from which
bootpd loads its database of known clients and client
options (bootpd only). Default is /etc/bootptab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpfile <br>
Specifies the name of the file that bootpd will dump its
internal database into when it receives a SIGUSR1 signal
(bootpd only). This option is only recognized if bootpd <br>
was compiled with the -DDEBUG flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server Specifies the name of a
BOOTP server to which bootpgw will forward all BOOTREQUEST
packets it receives (bootpgw only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
Both bootpd and bootpgw operate similarly in that both
listen for any packets sent to the bootps port, and both
simply forward any BOOTREPLY packets. They differ in their
han&acirc; <br>
dling of BOOTREQUEST packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When bootpgw is started, it
determines the address of a BOOTP server whose name is
provided as a command line parameter. When bootpgw receives
a BOOTREQUEST packet, it sets the <br>
&quot;gateway address&quot; and &quot;hop count&quot; fields
in the packet and forwards the packet to the BOOTP server at
the address determined earlier. Requests are forwarded only
if they indi&acirc; <br>
cate that the client has been waiting for at least three
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When bootpd is started it reads
a configuration file, (normally /etc/bootptab) that
initializes the internal database of known clients and
client options. This internal database <br>
is reloaded from the configuration file when bootpd receives
a hangup signal (SIGHUP) or when it discovers that the
configuration file has changed. Note that any changes to the
<br>
configuration file should be atomic to avoid race
conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When bootpd receives a
BOOTREQUEST packet, it looks for a database entry matching
the client request. If the client is known, bootpd composes
a BOOTREPLY packet using the data&acirc; <br>
base entry found above, and sends the reply to the client
(possibly using a gateway). If the client is unknown, the
request is discarded (with a notice if debug &gt; 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If bootpd is compiled with the
-DDEBUG option, receipt of a SIGUSR1 signal causes it to
dump its internal database to the file /tmp/bootpd.dump or
the dumpfile specified as a <br>
command line parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During initialization, both
programs determine the UDP port numbers to be used by
calling getservbyname(3) (which normally uses
/etc/services). Two service names (and port num&acirc; <br>
bers) are used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bootps - BOOTP Server listening
port <br>
bootpc - BOOTP Client destination port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the port numbers cannot be
determined using getservbyname then the values default to
boopts=67 and bootpc=68.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/bootptab <br>
Database file read by bootpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/bootpd.dump <br>
Debugging dump file created by bootpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/services <br>
Internet service numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tftpboot <br>
Current directory typically used by the TFTP server and
bootpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>

primarily the work of David Kovar, Drew D. Perkins, and
Walter L. Wimer, at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
