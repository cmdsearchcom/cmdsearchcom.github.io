<p>EXIM_LOCK(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
EXIM_LOCK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exim_lock - Mailbox maintenance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
exim_lock [options]mailbox-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The exim_lock utility locks a mailbox file using the same
algorithm as Exim. For a discussion of locking issues, see
section 25.2. exim_lock can be used to prevent any
modifi&acirc; <br>
cation of a mailbox by Exim or a user agent while
investigating a problem. The utility requires the name of
the file as its first argument. If the locking is
successful, the <br>
second argument is run as a command (using C&rsquo;s
&acirc;system()&acirc; function); if there is no second
argument, the value of the SHELL environment variable is
used; if this is unset or <br>
empty, /bin/sh is run. When the command finishes, the
mailbox is unlocked and the utility ends. The following
options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcntl Use &acirc;fcntl()&acirc;
locking on the open mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interval <br>
This must be followed by a number, which is a number of
seconds; it sets the interval to sleep between retries
(default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lockfile <br>
Create a lock file before opening the mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbx Lock the mailbox using MBX
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress verification
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-retries <br>
This must be followed by a number; it sets the number of
times to try to get the lock (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timeout <br>
This must be followed by a number, which is a number of
seconds; it sets a timeout to be used with a blocking
&acirc;fcntl()&acirc; lock. If it is not set (the default),
a non-block&acirc; <br>
ing call is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Generate verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of -fcntl, -lockfile or
-mbx are given, the default is to create a lock file and
also use &acirc;fcntl()&acirc; locking on the mailbox, which
is the same as Exim&rsquo;s default. <br>
The use of -fcntl requires that the file be writable; the
use of -lockfile requires that the directory containing the
file be writable. Locking by lock file does not last <br>
for ever; Exim assumes that a lock file is expired if it is
more than 30 minutes old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mbx option is mutually
exclusive with -fcntl. It causes a shared lock to be taken
out on the open mailbox, and an exclusive lock on the file
/tmp/.n.m where n and m <br>
are the device number and inode number of the mailbox file.
When the locking is released, if an exclusive lock can be
obtained for the mailbox, the file in /tmp is <br>
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default output contains
verification of the locking that takes place. The -v option
causes some additional information to be given. The -q
option suppresses all out&acirc; <br>
put except error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A command such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exim_lock
/var/spool/mail/spqr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runs an interactive shell while
the file is locked, whereas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exim_lock -q
/var/spool/mail/spqr &lt;&lt;End <br>
&lt;some commands&gt; <br>
End</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runs a specific non-interactive
sequence of commands while the file is locked, suppressing
all verification output. A single command can be run by a
command such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exim_lock -q
/var/spool/mail/spqr &quot;cp /var/spool/mail/spqr
/some/where&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if a command is
supplied, it must be entirely contained within the second
argument - hence the quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows
better groff than us and has more experience in writing
manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.</p>
