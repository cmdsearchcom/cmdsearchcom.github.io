<p>UPSSET.CGI(8) NUT Manual UPSSET.CGI(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
upsset.cgi - Web-based UPS administration program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
upsset.cgi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
As a CGI program, this should be invoked through your web
server. If you run it from the command line, it will sit
there until you give it input resembling a POST request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
upsset.cgi lets you access many administrative functions
within the UPS software from your web browser. You can
change settings and invoke instant commands where
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGING SETTINGS <br>
Some UPS hardware allows you to change certain variables to
other values. To see what&acirc;s available, pick a UPS from
the chooser and select &quot;settings&quot;, then select
&quot;View&quot; to update <br>
the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should see a list of items
with the descriptions on the left side and the possible
options or input spaces on the right. After changing
something, be sure to &quot;Save changes&quot; <br>
to update the values in your UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your UPS doesn&acirc;t
support any read/write variables, there will be nothing to
do on this page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting values in read/write
variables can also be done from the command line with
upsrw(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTANT COMMANDS <br>
Some UPS hardware also has provisions for performing certain
actions at the user&acirc;s command. These include battery
tests, battery calibration, front panel tests (beep!) and
more. <br>
To access this section, do as above, but pick
&quot;Commands&quot; as the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your UPS supports any instant
commands, they will be listed in a chooser widget. Pick the
one you like and &quot;Issue command&quot; to make it
happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
some dangerous commands like &quot;Turn off load&quot; may
not happen right away. This is a feature, not a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The apcsmart driver and some
others require that you send this command twice within a
short window in order to make it happen. This is to keep you
from accidentally killing your <br>
systems by picking the wrong one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To actually turn off the load,
you have to send the command once, then send it again after
3 seconds elapse but before 15 seconds pass. If you do it
too quickly or slowly, you <br>
have to wait at least 3 seconds but not 15 seconds
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also invoke instant
commands from the command line with upscmd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL <br>
upsset will only talk to upsd(8) servers that have been
defined in your hosts.conf(8). If it complains about
&quot;Access to that host is not authorized&quot;, check
your hosts.conf first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
upsset will not run until you convince it that your CGI
directory has been secured. This is due to the possibility
of someone using upsset to try password combinations against
<br>
your upsd(8) server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the example upsset.conf file
for more information on how you do this. The short
explanation is&acirc;if you can&acirc;t lock it down,
don&acirc;t try to run it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
hosts.conf(5), upsset.conf(5)</p>
