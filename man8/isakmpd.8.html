<p>ISAKMPD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ISAKMPD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
isakmpd &acirc; ISAKMP/Oakley a.k.a. IKE key management
daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
isakmpd [-4] [-6] [-c config-file] [-a] [-d] [-D
class=level] [-f fifo] [-i pid-file] [-n] [-p listen-port]
[-P local-port] [-K] [-L] [-l packetlog-file] [-r seed] [-R
report-file] <br>
[-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The isakmpd daemon establishes security associations for
encrypted and/or authenticated network traffic. At this
moment, and probably forever, this means ipsec(4)
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way isakmpd goes about its
work is by maintaining an internal configuration as well as
a policy database which describes what kinds of SAs to
negotiate, and by listening for <br>
different events that trigger these negotiations. The events
that control isakmpd consist of negotiation initiations from
a remote party, user input via a FIFO or by signals, <br>
upcalls from the kernel via a PF_KEY socket, and lastly by
scheduled events triggered by timers running out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most uses of isakmpd will be to
implement so called &quot;virtual private networks&quot; or
VPNs for short. The vpn(8) manual page describes how to set
up isakmpd for a simple VPN. For <br>
other uses, some more knowledge of IKE as a protocol is
required. One source of information are the RFCs mentioned
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup isakmpd forks into
two processes for privilege separation. The unprivileged
child jails itself with chroot(8) to /var/empty. The
privileged process communicates with <br>
the child, reads configuration files and PKI information and
binds to privileged ports on its behalf. See CAVEATS section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 | -6 <br>
These options control what address family (AF_INET and/or
AF_INET6) isakmpd will use. The default is to use both IPv4
and IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a If given, isakmpd does not
set up flows automatically. This is useful when flows are
configured with ipsecadm(4) or by other programs like
bgpd(8). Thus isakmpd only <br>
takes care of the SA establishment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-file <br>
If given, the -c option specifies an alternate configuration
file instead of /etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.conf. As this file may
contain sensitive information, it must be readable <br>
only by the user running the daemon. isakmpd will reread the
configuration file when sent a SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d The -d option is used to make
the daemon run in the foreground, logging to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D class=level <br>
Debugging class. It&rsquo;s possible to specify this
argument many times. It takes a parameter of the form
class=level, where both class and level are numbers. class
denotes a <br>
debugging class, and level the level you want that debugging
class to limit debug printouts at (i.e., all debug printouts
above the level specified will not output any&acirc; <br>
thing). If class is set to &acirc;A&acirc;, then all
debugging classes are set to the specified level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid values for class are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Misc <br>
1 Transport <br>
2 Message <br>
3 Crypto <br>
4 Timer <br>
5 Sysdep <br>
6 SA <br>
7 Exchange <br>
8 Negotiation <br>
9 Policy <br>
10 FIFO user interface <br>
A All</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently used values for level
are 0 to 99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f fifo <br>
The -f option specifies the FIFO (a.k.a. named pipe) where
the daemon listens for user requests. If the path given is a
dash (&acirc;-&acirc;), isakmpd will listen to stdin
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i pid-file <br>
By default the PID of the daemon process will be written to
/var/run/isakmpd.pid. This path can be overridden by
specifying another one as the argument to the -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n When the -n option is given,
the kernel will not take part in the negotiations. This is a
non-destructive mode, so to speak, in that it won&rsquo;t
alter any SAs in the IPsec <br>
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p listen-port <br>
The -p option specifies the listen port the daemon will bind
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P local-port <br>
On the other hand, the port specified to capital -P will be
what the daemon binds its local end to when acting as
initiator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K When this option is given,
isakmpd does not read the policy configuration file and no
keynote(4) policy check is accomplished. This option can be
used when policies for <br>
flows and SA establishment are arranged by other programs
like ipsecadm(8) or bgpd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Enable IKE packet capture.
When this option is given, isakmpd will capture to file an
unencrypted copy of the negotiation packets it is sending
and receiving. This file <br>
can later be read by tcpdump(8) and other utilities using
pcap(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l packetlog-file <br>
As option -L above, but capture to a specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r seed <br>
If given, a deterministic random number sequence will be
used internally. This is useful for setting up regression
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R report-file <br>
When you signal isakmpd a SIGUSR1, it will report its
internal state to a report file, normally
/var/run/isakmpd.report, but this can be changed by feeding
the file name as <br>
an argument to the -R flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enables verbose logging.
Normally, isakmpd is silent and outputs only messages when a
warning or an error occurs. With verbose logging isakmpd
reports successful comple&acirc; <br>
tion of phase 1 (Main and Aggressive) and phase 2 (Quick)
exchanges (Information and Transaction exchanges do not
generate any additional status information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting up an IKE public key
infrastructure (a.k.a. PKI) <br>
In order to use public key based authentication, there has
to be an infrastructure managing the key signing. Either
there is an already existing PKI isakmpd should take part
in, <br>
or there will be a need to set one up. In the former case,
what is needed to be done varies depending on the actual
Certificate Authority used, and is therefore not covered
here, <br>
other than mentioning that openssl(1) needs to be used to
create a certificate signing request that the CA
understands. The latter case, however, is described
here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Create your own CA as
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># openssl genrsa -out
/etc/ssl/private/ca.key 1024 <br>
# openssl req -new -key /etc/ssl/private/ca.key -out
/etc/ssl/private/ca.csr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are then asked to enter
information that will be incorporated into your certificate
request. What you are about to enter is what is called a
Distinguished Name (DN). <br>
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank.
For some fields there will be a default value; if you enter
&acirc;.&acirc;, the field will be left blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># openssl x509 -req -days 365
-in /etc/ssl/private/ca.csr -signkey /etc/ssl/private/ca.key
-extfile /etc/ssl/x509v3.cnf -extensions x509v3_CA -out
/etc/ssl/ca.crt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Create keys and certificates
for your IKE peers. This step as well as the next one, needs
to be done for every peer. Furthermore the last step will
need to be done once for <br>
each ID you want the peer to have. The 10.0.0.1 below
symbolizes that ID, in this case an IPv4 ID, and should be
changed for each invocation. You will be asked for a DN for
<br>
each run. Encoding the ID in the common name is recommended,
as it should be unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># openssl genrsa -out
/etc/isakmpd/private/local.key 1024 <br>
# openssl req -new -key /etc/isakmpd/private/local.key -out
/etc/isakmpd/private/10.0.0.1.csr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now take these certificate
signing requests to your CA and process them like below. You
have to add a subjectAltName extension field to the
certificate in order to make it <br>
usable by isakmpd. There are two possible ways to add the
extensions to the certificate. Either you have to run
certpatch(8) or you have to make use of an OpenSSL
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file, for example /etc/ssl/x509v3.cnf. Replace 10.0.0.1
with the IP-address which isakmpd will use as the
certificate identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use certpatch(8), do the
following</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># openssl x509 -req -days 365
-in 10.0.0.1.csr -CA /etc/ssl/ca.crt -CAkey
/etc/ssl/private/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out 10.0.0.1.crt
<br>
# certpatch -i 10.0.0.1 -k /etc/ssl/private/ca.key
10.0.0.1.crt 10.0.0.1.crt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># setenv CERTIP 10.0.0.1 <br>
# openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in 10.0.0.1.csr -CA
/etc/ssl/ca.crt -CAkey /etc/ssl/private/ca.key
-CAcreateserial -extfile /etc/ssl/x509v3.cnf -extensions
x509v3_IPAddr -out 10.0.0.1.crt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a FQDN certificate, do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># setenv CERTFQDN
somehost.somedomain <br>
# openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in somehost.somedomain.csr
-CA /etc/ssl/ca.crt -CAkey /etc/ssl/private/ca.key
-CAcreateserial -extfile /etc/ssl/x509v3.cnf -extensions
x509v3_FQDN -out somehost.somedomain.crt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or with certpatch(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># certpatch -t fqdn -i
somehost.somedomain -k /etc/ssl/private/ca.key
somehost.somedomain.crt somehost.somedomain.crt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This assumes the previous steps
were used to create a request for somehost.somedomain
instead of 10.0.0.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put the certificate (the file
ending in .crt) in /etc/isakmpd/certs/ on your local system.
Also carry over the CA cert /etc/ssl/ca.crt and put it in
/etc/isakmpd/ca/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To revoke certificates, create a
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) file and install it in the
/etc/isakmpd/crls/ directory. See openssl(1) and the
&acirc;crl&acirc; subcommand for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to store
trusted public keys to make them directly usable by isakmpd.
The keys should be saved in PEM format (see openssl(1)) and
named and stored after this <br>
easy formula:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For IPv4 identities
/etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ipv4/A.B.C.D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For IPv6 identities
/etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ipv6/abcd:abcd::ab:bc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For FQDN identities
/etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/fqdn/foo.bar.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For UFQDN identities
/etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ufqdn/user@foo.bar.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FIFO user interface <br>
When isakmpd starts, it creates a FIFO (named pipe) where it
listens for user requests. All commands start with a single
letter, followed by command-specific options. Available <br>
commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c &lt;name&gt; <br>
Start the named connection, if stopped or inactive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C set [section]:tag=value <br>
C set [section]:tag=value force <br>
C add [section]:tag=value <br>
C rm [section]:tag <br>
C rms [section] <br>
Update the running isakmpd configuration atomically.
&acirc;set&acirc; sets a configuration value consisting of a
section, tag and value triplet. &acirc;set&acirc; will fail
if the configuration <br>
already contains a section with the named tag; use the
&acirc;force&acirc; option to change this behaviour.
&acirc;add&acirc; appends a configuration value to the named
configuration list tag. <br>
&acirc;rm&acirc; removes a tag in a section.
&acirc;rms&acirc; removes an entire section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Sending isakmpd a SIGHUP
or an &quot;R&quot; through the FIFO will void any updates
done to the configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C get [section]:tag <br>
Get the configuration value of the specified section and
tag. The result is stored in /var/run/isakmpd.result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d &lt;cookies&gt; &lt;msgid&gt;
<br>
Delete the specified SA from the system. Specify
&lt;msgid&gt; as &quot;-&quot; to match a Phase 1 SA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D &lt;class&gt; &lt;level&gt;
<br>
D A &lt;level&gt; <br>
D T Set debug class &lt;class&gt; to level &lt;level&gt;. If
&lt;class&gt; is specified as &quot;A&quot;, the level
applies to all debug classes. &quot;D T&quot; toggles all
debug classes to level zero. Another <br>
&quot;D T&quot; command will toggle them back to the earlier
levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p on[=&lt;path&gt;] <br>
p off Enable or disable cleartext IKE packet capture. When
enabling, optionally specify which file isakmpd should
capture the packets to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q Cleanly shutdown the daemon,
as when sent a SIGTERM signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Report isakmpd internal state
to a file. See -R option. Same as when sent a SIGUSR1
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Reinitialize isakmpd, as when
sent a SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Report information on all
known SAs to the /var/run/isakmpd.result file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t &lt;name&gt; <br>
Tear down the named connection, if active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Tear down all active
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/isakmpd/ca/ The directory where CA certificates can be
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/isakmpd/certs/ The
directory where IKE certificates can be found, both the
local certificate(s) and those of the peers, if a choice to
have them kept permanently has <br>
been made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/isakmpd/crls/ The directory
where CRLs can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.conf The
configuration file. As this file can contain sensitive
information it must not be readable by anyone but the user
running isakmpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.policy The
keynote policy configuration file. The same mode
requirements as isakmpd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/isakmpd/private/local.key
<br>

There has to be a certificate for this key in the
certificate directory mentioned above. <br>
The same mode requirements as isakmpd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ Directory
in which trusted public keys can be kept. The keys must be
named in the fashion described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/isakmpd.result The
report file written when the &acirc;S&acirc; or &acirc;C
get&acirc; command is issued in the command FIFO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/ipsec/isakmpd/ A

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The ISAKMP/Oakley key management protocol is described in
the RFCs RFC 2407, RFC 2408 and RFC 2409. This
implementation was done 1998 by Niklas Hallqvist and Niels
Provos, spon&acirc; <br>
sored by Ericsson Radio Systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
When storing a trusted public key for an IPv6 identity, the
most efficient form of address representation, i.e
&quot;::&quot; instead of &quot;:0:0:0:&quot;, must be used
or the matching will fail. <br>
isakmpd uses the output from getnameinfo(3) for the
address-to-name translation. The privileged process only
allows binding to the default port 500 or unprivileged ports
(&gt;1024). <br>
It is not possible to change the interfaces isakmpd listens
on without a restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The -P flag does not do what we document, rather it does
nothing.</p>
