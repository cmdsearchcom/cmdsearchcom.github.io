<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpsd - interface daemon for GPS receivers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpsd [-F control-socket] [-S listener-port] [-b] [-l] [-G]
[-n] [-N] [-h] [-P pidfile] [-D debuglevel] [-V]
[[source-name]...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK START <br>
If you have a GPS attached on the lowest-numbered USB port
of a Linux system, and want to read reports from it on
TCP/IP port 2947, it will normally suffice to do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the lowest-numbered serial
port:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd /dev/ttyS0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the device number as
appropriate if you need to use a different port.
Command-line flags enable verbose logging, a control port,
and other optional extras but should not <br>
be needed for basic operation; the one exception, on very
badly designed hardware, might be -b (which see).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux systems supporting
udev, gpsd is normally started automatically when a USB
plugin event fires (if it is not already running) and is
handed the name of the newly active <br>
device. In that case no invocation is required at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For your initial tests set your
GPS hardware to speak NMEA, as gpsd is guaranteed to be able
to process that. If your GPS has a native or binary mode
with better performance that <br>
gpsd knows how to speak, gpsd will autoconfigure that
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can verify correct operation
by first starting gpsd and then xgps, the X windows test
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have problems, the GPSD
project maintains a FAQ to assist troubleshooting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpsd is a monitor daemon that collects information from
GPSes, differential-GPS radios, or AIS receivers attached to
the host machine. Each GPS, DGPS radio, or AIS receiver is
<br>
expected to be direct-connected to the host via a USB or
RS232C serial device. The serial device may be specified to
gpsd at startup, or it may be set via a command shipped down
<br>
a local control socket (e.g. by a USB hotplug script). Given
a GPS device by either means, gpsd discovers the correct
port speed and protocol for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd should be able to query any
GPS that speaks either the standard textual NMEA 0183
protocol, or the (differing) extended NMEA dialects used by
MKT-3301, iTrax, Motorola <br>
OnCore, Sony CXD2951, and Ashtech/Thales devices. It can
also interpret the binary protocols used by EverMore,
Garmin, Navcom, Rockwell/Zodiac, SiRF, Trimble, and u-blox
ANTARIS <br>
devices. Under Linux it can read NMEA2000 packets through
the kernel CAN socket. It can read heading and attitude
information from the Oceanserver 5000 or TNT Revolution
digital <br>
compasses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GPS reporting formats
supported by your instance of gpsd may differ depending on
how it was compiled; general-purpose versions support many,
but it can be built with protocol <br>
subsets down to a singleton for use in constrained
environments. For a list of the GPS protocols supported by
your instance, see the output of gpsd -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd effectively hides the
differences among the GPS types it supports. It also knows
about and uses commands that tune these GPSes for lower
latency. By using gpsd as an <br>
intermediary, applications avoid contention for serial
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd can use differential-GPS
corrections from a DGPS radio or over the net, from a ground
station running a DGPSIP server or a Ntrip broadcaster that
reports RTCM-104 data; this <br>
will shrink position errors by roughly a factor of four.
When gpsd opens a serial device emitting RTCM-104, it
automatically recognizes this and uses the device as a
correction <br>
source for all connected GPSes that accept RTCM corrections
(this is dependent on the type of the GPS; not all GPSes
have the firmware capability to accept RTCM correction <br>
packets). See the section called &acirc;ACCURACY&acirc; and
the section called &acirc;FILES&acirc; for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client applications will
communicate with gpsd via a TCP/IP port, 2947 by default).
Both IPv4 and IPv6 connections are supported and a client
may connect via either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program accepts the
following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F <br>
Create a control socket for device addition and removal
commands. You must specify a valid pathname on your local
filesystem; this will be created as a Unix-domain socket to
<br>
which you can write commands that edit the daemon&rsquo;s
internal device list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
Set TCP/IP port on which to listen for GPSD clients (default
is 2947).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b <br>
Broken-device-safety mode, otherwise known as read-only
mode. A few bluetooth and USB receivers lock up or become
totally inaccessible when probed or reconfigured; see the
<br>
hardware compatibility list on the GPSD project website for
details. This switch prevents gpsd from writing to a
receiver. This means that gpsd cannot configure the receiver
<br>
for optimal performance, but it also means that gpsd cannot
break the receiver. A better solution would be for Bluetooth
to not be so fragile. A platform independent method <br>
to identify serial-over-Bluetooth devices would also be
nice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G <br>
This flag causes gpsd to listen on all addresses
(INADDR_ANY) rather than just the loop back
(INADDR_LOOPBACK) address. For the sake of privacy and
security, TPV information <br>
is now private to the local machine until the user makes an
effort to expose this to the world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
List all drivers compiled into this gpsd instance. The
letters to the left of each driver name are the gpsd control
commands supported by that driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Don&rsquo;t wait for a client to connect before polling
whatever GPS is associated with it. Some RS232 GPSes wait in
a standby mode (drawing less power) when the host machine is
<br>
not asserting DTR, and some cellphone and handheld embedded
GPSes have similar behaviors. Accordingly, waiting for a
watch request to open the device may save battery power.
<br>
(This capability is rare in consumer-grade devices).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N <br>
Don&rsquo;t daemonize; run in foreground. This switch is
mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Display help message and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
Specify the name and path to record the daemon&rsquo;s
process ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Set debug level. At debug levels 2 and above, gpsd reports
incoming sentence and actions to standard error if gpsd is
in the foreground (-N) or to syslog if in the <br>
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Dump version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments are interpreted as the
names of data sources. Normally, a data source is the device
pathname of a local device from which the daemon may expect
GPS data. But there are <br>
three other special source types recognized, for a total of
four:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local serial or USB device <br>
A normal Unix device name of a serial or USB device to which
a sensor is attached. Example: /dev/ttyUSB0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local PPS device <br>
A normal Unix device name of a PPS device to which a PPS
source is attached. The device name must start with
&quot;/dev/pps&quot; and a local serial or USB GPS device
must also be <br>
available. Example: /dev/pps0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP feed <br>
A URI with the prefix &quot;tcp://&quot;, followed by a
hostname, a colon, and a port number. The daemon will open a
socket to the indicated address and port and read data
packets from <br>
it, which will be interpreted as though they had been issued
by a serial device. Example: tcp://data.aishub.net:4006.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDP feed <br>
A URI with the prefix &quot;udp://&quot;, followed by a
hostname, a colon, and a port number. The daemon will open a
socket listening for UDP datagrams arriving on the indicated
<br>
address and port, which will be interpreted as though they
had been issued by a serial device. Example:
udp://127.0.0.1:5000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ntrip caster <br>
A URI with the prefix &quot;ntrip://&quot; followed by the
name of an Ntrip caster (Ntrip is a protocol for
broadcasting differential-GPS fixes over the net). For Ntrip
services that <br>
require authentication, a prefix of the form
&quot;username:password@&quot; can be added before the name
of the Ntrip broadcaster. For Ntrip service, you must
specify which stream to <br>
use; the stream is given in the form
&quot;/streamname&quot;. An example DGPSIP URI could be
&quot;dgpsip://dgpsip.example.com&quot; and a Ntrip URI
could be <br>

&quot;ntrip://foo:bar@ntrip.example.com:80/example-stream&quot;.
Corrections from the caster will be send to each attached
GPS with the capability to accept them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DGPSIP server <br>
A URI with the prefix &quot;dgpsip://&quot; followed by a
hostname, a colon, and an optional colon-separated port
number (defaulting to 2101). The daemon will handshake with
the DGPSIP <br>
server and read RTCM2 correction data from it. Corrections
from the server will be set to each attached GPS with the
capability to accept them. Example: <br>
dgpsip://dgps.wsrcc.com:2101.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote gpsd feed <br>
A URI with the prefix &quot;gpsd://&quot;, followed by a
hostname and optionally a colony and a port number (if the
port is absent the default gpsd port will be used). The
daemon will <br>
open a socket to the indicated address and port and emulate
a gpsd client, collecting JSON reports from the remote gpsd
instance that will be passed to local clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NMEA2000 CAN data <br>
A URI with the prefix &quot;nmea2000://&quot;, followed by a
CAN devicename. Only Linux socket CAN interfaces are
supported. The interface must be configured to receive CAN
messages <br>
before gpsd can be started. If there is more then one unit
on the CAN bus that provides GPS data, gpsd chooses the unit
from which a GPS message is first seen. Example: <br>
nmea2000://can0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The &quot;ais:://&quot; source
type supported in some older versions of the daemon has been
retired in favor of the more general
&quot;tcp://&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally, the daemon maintains
a device pool holding the pathnames of devices and remote
servers known to the daemon. Initially, this list is the
list of device-name arguments <br>
specified on the command line. That list may be empty, in
which case the daemon will have no devices on its search
list until they are added by a control-socket command (see
the <br>
section called &acirc;GPS DEVICE MANAGEMENT&acirc; for
details on this). Daemon startup will abort with an error if
neither any devices nor a control socket are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a device is activated (i.e.
a client requests data from it), gpsd attempts to execute a
hook from /etc/gpsd/device-hook with first command line
argument set to the pathname <br>
of the device and the second to ACTIVATE. On deactivation it
does the same passing DEACTIVATE for the second
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd can export data to client
applications in three ways: via a sockets interface, via a
shared-memory segment, and via D-Bus. The next three major
sections describe these <br>
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE SOCKET INTERFACE <br>
Clients may communicate with the daemon via textual request
and responses over a socket. It is a bad idea for
applications to speak the protocol directly: rather, they
should use <br>
the libgps client library and take appropriate care to
conditionalize their code on the major and minor protocol
version symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The request-response protocol
for the socket interface is fully documented in
gpsd_json(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHARED-MEMORY AND DBUS
INTERFACES <br>
gpsd has two other (read-only) interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever the daemon recognizes a
packet from any attached device, it writes the accumulated
state from that device to a shared memory segment. The C and
C++ client libraries <br>
shipped with GPSD can read this segment. Client methods, and
various restrictions associated with the read-only nature of
this interface, are documented at libgps(3). The <br>
shared-memory interface is intended primarily for embedded
deployments in which gpsd monitors a single device, and its
principal advantage is that a daemon instance configured
<br>
with shared memory but without the sockets interface loses a
significant amount of runtime weight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon may be configured to
emit a D-Bus signal each time an attached device delivers a
fix. The signal path is path /org/gpsd, the signal interface
is &quot;org.gpsd&quot;, and the <br>
signal name is &quot;fix&quot;. The signal payload layout is
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPS DEVICE MANAGEMENT <br>
gpsd maintains an internal list of GPS devices (the
&quot;device pool&quot;). If you specify devices on the
command line, the list is initialized with those pathnames;
otherwise the list <br>
starts empty. Commands to add and remove GPS device paths
from the daemon&rsquo;s device list must be written to a
local Unix-domain socket which will be accessible only to
programs <br>
running as root. This control socket will be located
wherever the -F option specifies it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A device may will also be
dropped from the pool if GPSD gets a zero length read from
it. This end-of-file condition indicates that the&rsquo;
device has been disconnected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When gpsd is properly installed
along with hotplug notifier scripts feeding it device-add
commands over the control socket, gpsd should require no
configuration or user action to <br>
find devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending SIGHUP to a running gpsd
forces it to close all GPSes and all client connections. It
will then attempt to reconnect to any GPSes on its device
list and resume listening <br>
for client connections. This may be useful if your GPS
enters a wedged or confused state but can be soft-reset by
pulling down DTR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When gpsd is called with no
initial devices (thus, expecting devices to be passed to it
by notifications to the control socket), and reaches a state
where there are no devices <br>
connected and no subscribers after after some devices have
been seen, it shuts down gracefully. It is expected that
future device hotplug events will reactivate it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To point gpsd at a device that
may be a GPS, write to the control socket a plus sign
(&rsquo;+&rsquo;) followed by the device name followed by LF
or CR-LF. Thus, to point the daemon at <br>
/dev/foo. send &quot;+/dev/foo0. To tell the daemon that a
device has been disconnected and is no longer available,
send a minus sign (&rsquo;-&rsquo;) followed by the device
name followed by <br>
LF or CR-LF. Thus, to remove /dev/foo from the search list,
send &quot;-/dev/foo0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send a control string to a
specified device, write to the control socket a
&rsquo;!&rsquo;, followed by the device name, followed by
&rsquo;=&rsquo;, followed by the control string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send a binary control string
to a specified device, write to the control socket a
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, followed by the device name, followed
by &rsquo;=&rsquo;, followed by the control string in paired
<br>
hex digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your client may await a
response, which will be a line beginning with either
&quot;OK&quot; or &quot;ERROR&quot;. An ERROR response to an
add command means the device did not emit data recognizable
<br>
as GPS packets; an ERROR response to a remove command means
the specified device was not in gpsd&rsquo;s device pool. An
ERROR response to a ! command means the daemon did not <br>
recognize the devicename specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control socket is intended
for use by hotplug scripts and other device-discovery
services. This control channel is separate from the public
gpsd service port, and only <br>
locally accessible, in order to prevent remote
denial-of-service and spoofing attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCURACY <br>
The base User Estimated Range Error (UERE) of GPSes is 8
meters or less at 66% confidence, 15 meters or less at 95%
confidence. Actual horizontal error will be UERE times a
<br>
dilution factor dependent on current satellite position.
Altitude determination is more sensitive to variability in
ionospheric signal lag than latitude/longitude is, and is
also <br>
subject to errors in the estimation of local mean sea level;
base error is 12 meters at 66% confidence, 23 meters at 95%
confidence. Again, this will be multiplied by a vertical
<br>
dilution of precision (VDOP) dependent on satellite
geometry, and VDOP is typically larger than HDOP. Users
should not rely on GPS altitude for life-critical tasks such
as <br>
landing an airplane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These errors are intrinsic to
the design and physics of the GPS system. gpsd does its
internal computations at sufficient accuracy that it will
add no measurable position error <br>
of its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DGPS correction will reduce UERE
by a factor of 4, provided you are within about 100mi
(160km) of a DGPS ground station from which you are
receiving corrections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a 4800bps connection, the
time latency of fixes provided by gpsd will be one second or
less 95% of the time. Most of this lag is due to the fact
that GPSes normally emit fixes <br>
once per second, thus expected latency is 0.5sec. On the
personal-computer hardware available in 2005 and later,
computation lag induced by gpsd will be negligible, on the
order <br>
of a millisecond. Nevertheless, latency can introduce
significant errors for vehicles in motion; at 50km/h
(31mi/h) of speed over ground, 1 second of lag corresponds
to 13.8 <br>
meters change in position between updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time reporting of the GPS
system itself has an intrinsic accuracy limit of 14
nanoseconds, but this can only be approximated by
specialized receivers using that send the <br>
high-accuracy PPS (Pulse-Per-Second) over RS232 to cue a
clock crystal. Most GPS receivers only report time to a
precision of 0.01s or 0.001s, and with no accuracy
guarantees <br>
below 1sec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your GPS uses a SiRF chipset
at firmware level 231, reported UTC time may be off by the
difference between whatever default leap-second offset has
been compiled in and <br>
whatever leap-second correction is currently applicable,
from startup until complete subframe information is
received. Firmware levels 232 and up don&rsquo;t have this
problem. You may <br>
run gpsd at debug level 4 to see the chipset type and
firmware revision level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are exactly two
circumstances under which gpsd relies on the host-system
clock:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the GPS broadcast signal, GPS
time is represented using a week number that rolls over
after 2^10 or 2^13 weeks (about 19.6 years, or 157 years),
depending on the spacecraft. <br>
Receivers are required to disambiguate this to the correct
date, but may have difficulty due to not knowing time to
within half this interval, or may have bugs. Users have <br>
reported incorrect dates which appear to be due to this
issue. gpsd uses the startup time of the daemon detect and
compensate for rollovers while it is running, but otherwise
<br>
reports the date as it is reported by the receiver without
attempting to correct it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using an NMEA-only
GPS (that is, not using SiRF or Garmin or Zodiac binary
mode), gpsd relies on the system clock to tell it the
current century. If the system clock <br>
returns an invalid value near zero, and the GPS does not
emit GPZDA at the start of its update cycle (which most
consumer-grade NMEA GPSes do not) then the century part of
the <br>
dates gpsd delivers may be wrong. Additionally, near the
century turnover, a range of dates as wide in seconds as the
accuracy of your system clock may be referred to the wrong
<br>
century.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE WITH NTP <br>
gpsd can provide reference clock information to ntpd, to
keep the system clock synchronized to the time provided by
the GPS receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, gpsd includes support
for interpreting the PPS pulses emitted at the start of
every clock second on the carrier-detect lines of some
serial GPSes; this pulse can be <br>
used to update NTP at much higher accuracy than message time
provides. You can determine whether your GPS emits this
pulse by running at -D 5 and watching for carrier-detect
<br>
state change messages in the logfile. In addition, if your
kernel provides the RFC 2783 kernel PPS API then gpsd will
use that for extra accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detailed instructions for using
GPSD to set up a high-quality time service can be found
among the documentation on the GPSD website.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE WITH D-BUS <br>
On operating systems that support D-BUS, gpsd can be built
to broadcast GPS fixes to D-BUS-aware applications. As D-BUS
is still at a pre-1.0 stage, we will not attempt to <br>
document this interface here. Read the gpsd source code to
learn more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY AND PERMISSIONS ISSUES
<br>
gpsd, if given the -G flag, will listen for connections from
any reachable host, and then disclose the current position.
Before using the -G flag, consider whether you consider <br>
your computer&rsquo;s location to be sensitive data to be
kept private or something that you wish to publish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd must start up as root in
order to open the NTPD shared-memory segment, open its
logfile, and create its local control socket. Before doing
any processing of GPS data, it <br>
tries to drop root privileges by setting its UID to
&quot;nobody&quot; (or another configured userid) and its
group ID to the group of the initial GPS passed on the
command line &acirc; or, if <br>
that device doesn&rsquo;t exist, to the group of
/dev/ttyS0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Privilege-dropping is a hedge
against the possibility that carefully crafted data, either
presented from a client socket or from a subverted serial
device posing as a GPS, could <br>
be used to induce misbehavior in the internals of gpsd. It
ensures that any such compromises cannot be used for
privilege elevation to root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The assumption behind
gpsd&rsquo;s particular behavior is that all the tty devices
to which a GPS might be connected are owned by the same
non-root group and allow group read/write, <br>
though the group may vary because of distribution-specific
or local administrative practice. If this assumption is
false, gpsd may not be able to open GPS devices in order to
<br>
read them (such failures will be logged).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to fend off inadvertent
denial-of-service attacks by port scanners (not to mention
deliberate ones), gpsd will time out inactive client
connections. Before the client <br>
has issued a command that requests a channel assignment, a
short timeout (60 seconds) applies. There is no timeout for
clients in watcher or raw modes; rather, gpsd drops these
<br>
clients if they fail to read data long enough for the
outbound socket write buffer to fill. Clients with an
assigned device in polling mode are subject to a longer
timeout (15 <br>
minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
If multiple NMEA talkers are feeding RMC, GLL, and GGA
sentences to the same serial device (possible with an RS422
adapter hooked up to some marine-navigation systems), a
&rsquo;TPV&rsquo; <br>
response may mix an altitude from one device&rsquo;s GGA
with latitude/longitude from another&rsquo;s RMC/GLL after
the second sentence has arrived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd may change control settings
on your GPS (such as the emission frequency of various
sentences or packets) and not restore the original settings
on exit. This is a result of <br>
inadequacies in NMEA and the vendor binary GPS protocols,
which often do not give clients any way to query the values
of control settings in order to be able to restore them <br>
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using SiRF chips, the
VDOP/TDOP/GDOP figures and associated error estimates are
computed by gpsd rather than reported by the chip. The
computation does not exactly match <br>
what SiRF chips do internally, which includes some satellite
weighting using parameters gpsd cannot see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autobauding on the Trimble GPSes
can take as long as 5 seconds if the device speed is not
matched to the GPS speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generation of position error
estimates (eph, epv, epd, eps, epc) from the incomplete data
handed back by GPS reporting protocols involves both a lot
of mathematical black art and <br>
fragile device-dependent assumptions. This code has been
bug-prone in tbe past and problems may still lurk there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AIDVM decoding of types 16-17,
22-23, and 25-26 is unverified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPSD presently fully recognizes
only the 2.1 level of RTCM2 (message types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
9, 16). The 2.3 message types 13, 14, and 31 are recognized
and reported. Message <br>
types 8, 10-12, 15-27, 28-30 (undefined), 31-37, 38-58
(undefined), and 60-63 are not yet supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ISGPS used for RTCM2 and
subframes decoder logic is sufficiently convoluted to
confuse some compiler optimizers, notably in GCC 3.x at -O2,
into generating bad code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devices meant to use PPS for
high-precision timekeeping may fail if they are specified
after startup by a control-socket command, as opposed to on
the daemon&rsquo;s original command <br>
line. Root privileges are dropped early, and some Unix
variants require them in order to set the PPS line
discipline. Under Linux the POSIX capability to set the line
discipline <br>
is retained, but other platforms cannot use this code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USB GPS devices often do not
identify themselves through the USB subsystem; they
typically present as the class 00h (undefined) or class FFh
(vendor-specific) of USB-to-serial <br>
adapters. Because of this, the Linux hotplug scripts must
tell gpsd to sniff data from every USB-to-serial adapter
that goes active and is known to be of a type used in GPSes.
No <br>
such device is sent configuration strings until after it has
been identified as a GPS, and gpsd never opens a device that
is opened by another process. But there is a tiny window
<br>
for non-GPS devices not opened; if the application that
wants them loses a race with GPSD its device open will fail
and have to be retried after GPSD sniffs the device
(normally <br>
less than a second later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/ttyS0 <br>
Prototype TTY device. After startup, gpsd sets its group ID
to the owning group of this device if no GPS device was
specified on the command line does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/gpsd/device-hook <br>
Optional file containing the device activation/deactivation
script. Note that while /etc/gpsd is the default system
configuration directory, it is possible to build the GPSD
<br>
source code with different assumptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
By setting the environment variable GPSD_SHM_KEY, you can
control the key value used to create the shared-memory
segment used for communication with the client library. This
will <br>
be useful mainly when isolating test instances of gpsd from
production ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICABLE STANDARDS <br>
The official NMEA protocol standards for NMEA0183 and
NMEA2000 are available from the National Marine Electronics
Association, but are proprietary and expensive; the
maintainers <br>
of gpsd have made a point of not looking at them. The GPSD
project website links to several documents that collect
publicly disclosed information about the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsd parses the following NMEA
sentences: RMC, GGA, GLL, GSA, GSV, VTG, ZDA, GBS, HDT, DBT,
GST. It recognizes these with either the normal GP talker-ID
prefix, or with the GN <br>
prefix used by GLONASS, or with the II prefix emitted by
Seahawk Autohelm marine navigation systems, or with the IN
prefix emitted by some Garmin units, or with the EC prefix
<br>
emitted by ECDIS units, or with the SD prefix emitted by
depth sounders, or with the HC and TI prefix emitted by some
Airmar equipment. It recognizes some vendor extensions: the
<br>
PGRME emitted by some Garmin GPS models, the OHPR emitted by
Oceanserver digital compasses, the PTNTHTM emitted by True
North digital compasses, the PMTK omitted by some San Jose
<br>
Navigation GPSes, and the PASHR sentences emitted by some
Ashtech GPSes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that gpsd JSON returns pure
decimal degrees, not the hybrid degree/minute format
described in the NMEA standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Differential-GPS corrections are
conveyed by the RTCM protocols. The applicable standard for
RTCM-104 V2 is RTCM Recommended Standards for Differential
