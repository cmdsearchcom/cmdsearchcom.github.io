If you have a GPS attached on the lowest-numbered USB port of a Linux system,
  and want to read reports from it on TCP/IP port 2947, it will normally suffice
  to do this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the lowest-numbered serial port:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
gpsd /dev/ttyS0
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Change the device number as appropriate if you need to use a different port.
  Command-line flags enable verbose logging, a control port, and other optional
  extras but should not be needed for basic operation; the one exception, on
  very badly designed hardware, might be <b>-b</b> (which see).
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Linux systems supporting udev, gpsd is normally started automatically when a
  USB plugin event fires (if it is not already running) and is handed the name
  of the newly active device. In that case no invocation is required at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For your initial tests set your GPS hardware to speak NMEA, as gpsd is
  guaranteed to be able to process that. If your GPS has a native or binary mode
  with better performance that gpsd knows how to speak, gpsd will autoconfigure
  that mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can verify correct operation by first starting gpsd and then xgps, the X
  windows test client.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have problems, the GPSD project maintains a FAQ to assist
  troubleshooting.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
gpsd is a monitor daemon that collects information from GPSes, differential-GPS
  radios, or AIS receivers attached to the host machine. Each GPS, DGPS radio,
  or AIS receiver is expected to be direct-connected to the host via a USB or
  RS232C serial device. The serial device may be specified to gpsd at startup,
  or it may be set via a command shipped down a local control socket (e.g. by a
  USB hotplug script). Given a GPS device by either means, gpsd discovers the
  correct port speed and protocol for it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsd should be able to query any GPS that speaks either the standard textual
  NMEA 0183 protocol, or the (differing) extended NMEA dialects used by
  MKT-3301, iTrax, Motorola OnCore, Sony CXD2951, and Ashtech/Thales devices. It
  can also interpret the binary protocols used by EverMore, Garmin, Navcom,
  Rockwell/Zodiac, SiRF, Trimble, and u-blox ANTARIS devices. Under Linux it can
  read NMEA2000 packets through the kernel CAN socket. It can read heading and
  attitude information from the Oceanserver 5000 or TNT Revolution digital
  compasses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GPS reporting formats supported by your instance of gpsd may differ
  depending on how it was compiled; general-purpose versions support many, but
  it can be built with protocol subsets down to a singleton for use in
  constrained environments. For a list of the GPS protocols supported by your
  instance, see the output of <b>gpsd -l</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsd effectively hides the differences among the GPS types it supports. It also
  knows about and uses commands that tune these GPSes for lower latency. By
  using gpsd as an intermediary, applications avoid contention for serial
  devices.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsd can use differential-GPS corrections from a DGPS radio or over the net,
  from a ground station running a DGPSIP server or a Ntrip broadcaster that
  reports RTCM-104 data; this will shrink position errors by roughly a factor of
  four. When gpsd opens a serial device emitting RTCM-104, it automatically
  recognizes this and uses the device as a correction source for all connected
  GPSes that accept RTCM corrections (this is dependent on the type of the GPS;
  not all GPSes have the firmware capability to accept RTCM correction packets).
  See the section called &#x201C;ACCURACY&#x201D; and the section called
  &#x201C;FILES&#x201D; for discussion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Client applications will communicate with gpsd via a TCP/IP port, 2947 by
  default). Both IPv4 and IPv6 connections are supported and a client may
  connect via either.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program accepts the following options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
-F
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Create a control socket for device addition
  and removal commands. You must specify a valid pathname on your local
  filesystem; this will be created as a Unix-domain socket to which you can
  write commands that edit the daemon's internal device list.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-S
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set TCP/IP port on which to listen for GPSD
  clients (default is 2947).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-b
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Broken-device-safety mode, otherwise known as
  read-only mode. A few bluetooth and USB receivers lock up or become totally
  inaccessible when probed or reconfigured; see the hardware compatibility list
  on the GPSD project website for details. This switch prevents gpsd from
  writing to a receiver. This means that gpsd cannot configure the receiver for
  optimal performance, but it also means that gpsd cannot break the receiver. A
  better solution would be for Bluetooth to not be so fragile. A platform
  independent method to identify serial-over-Bluetooth devices would also be
  nice.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-G
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This flag causes gpsd to listen on all
  addresses (INADDR_ANY) rather than just the loop back (INADDR_LOOPBACK)
  address. For the sake of privacy and security, TPV information is now private
  to the local machine until the user makes an effort to expose this to the
  world.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-l
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">List all drivers compiled into this gpsd
  instance. The letters to the left of each driver name are the gpsd control
  commands supported by that driver.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-n
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Don't wait for a client to connect before
  polling whatever GPS is associated with it. Some RS232 GPSes wait in a standby
  mode (drawing less power) when the host machine is not asserting DTR, and some
  cellphone and handheld embedded GPSes have similar behaviors. Accordingly,
  waiting for a watch request to open the device may save battery power. (This
  capability is rare in consumer-grade devices).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-N
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Don't daemonize; run in foreground. This
  switch is mainly useful for debugging.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-h
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display help message and terminate.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-P
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify the name and path to record the
  daemon's process ID.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-D
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set debug level. At debug levels 2 and above,
  gpsd reports incoming sentence and actions to standard error if gpsd is in the
  foreground (-N) or to syslog if in the background.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-V
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Dump version and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Arguments are interpreted as the names of data sources. Normally, a data source
  is the device pathname of a local device from which the daemon may expect GPS
  data. But there are three other special source types recognized, for a total
  of four:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Local serial or USB device
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A normal Unix device name of a serial or USB
  device to which a sensor is attached. Example: /dev/ttyUSB0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Local PPS device
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A normal Unix device name of a PPS device to
  which a PPS source is attached. The device name must start with
  &quot;/dev/pps&quot; and a local serial or USB GPS device must also be
  available. Example: /dev/pps0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
TCP feed
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A URI with the prefix &quot;tcp://&quot;,
  followed by a hostname, a colon, and a port number. The daemon will open a
  socket to the indicated address and port and read data packets from it, which
  will be interpreted as though they had been issued by a serial device.
  Example: tcp://data.aishub.net:4006.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
UDP feed
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A URI with the prefix &quot;udp://&quot;,
  followed by a hostname, a colon, and a port number. The daemon will open a
  socket listening for UDP datagrams arriving on the indicated address and port,
  which will be interpreted as though they had been issued by a serial device.
  Example: udp://127.0.0.1:5000.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ntrip caster
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A URI with the prefix &quot;ntrip://&quot;
  followed by the name of an Ntrip caster (Ntrip is a protocol for broadcasting
  differential-GPS fixes over the net). For Ntrip services that require
  authentication, a prefix of the form &quot;username:password@&quot; can be
  added before the name of the Ntrip broadcaster. For Ntrip service, you must
  specify which stream to use; the stream is given in the form
  &quot;/streamname&quot;. An example DGPSIP URI could be
  &quot;dgpsip://dgpsip.example.com&quot; and a Ntrip URI could be
  &quot;ntrip://foo:bar@ntrip.example.com:80/example-stream&quot;. Corrections
  from the caster will be send to each attached GPS with the capability to
  accept them.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
DGPSIP server
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A URI with the prefix &quot;dgpsip://&quot;
  followed by a hostname, a colon, and an optional colon-separated port number
  (defaulting to 2101). The daemon will handshake with the DGPSIP server and
  read RTCM2 correction data from it. Corrections from the server will be set to
  each attached GPS with the capability to accept them. Example:
  dgpsip://dgps.wsrcc.com:2101.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remote gpsd feed
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A URI with the prefix &quot;gpsd://&quot;,
  followed by a hostname and optionally a colony and a port number (if the port
  is absent the default gpsd port will be used). The daemon will open a socket
  to the indicated address and port and emulate a gpsd client, collecting JSON
  reports from the remote gpsd instance that will be passed to local
  clients.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
NMEA2000 CAN data
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A URI with the prefix &quot;nmea2000://&quot;,
  followed by a CAN devicename. Only Linux socket CAN interfaces are supported.
  The interface must be configured to receive CAN messages before gpsd can be
  started. If there is more then one unit on the CAN bus that provides GPS data,
  gpsd chooses the unit from which a GPS message is first seen. Example:
  nmea2000://can0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The &quot;ais:://&quot; source type supported in some older versions of the
  daemon has been retired in favor of the more general &quot;tcp://&quot;.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Internally, the daemon maintains a device pool holding the pathnames of devices
  and remote servers known to the daemon. Initially, this list is the list of
  device-name arguments specified on the command line. That list may be empty,
  in which case the daemon will have no devices on its search list until they
  are added by a control-socket command (see the section called &#x201C;GPS
  DEVICE MANAGEMENT&#x201D; for details on this). Daemon startup will abort with
  an error if neither any devices nor a control socket are specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a device is activated (i.e. a client requests data from it), gpsd attempts
  to execute a hook from /etc/gpsd/device-hook with first command line argument
  set to the pathname of the device and the second to <b>ACTIVATE</b>. On
  deactivation it does the same passing <b>DEACTIVATE</b> for the second
  argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsd can export data to client applications in three ways: via a sockets
  interface, via a shared-memory segment, and via D-Bus. The next three major
  sections describe these interfaces.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_SOCKET_INTERFACE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_SOCKET_INTERFACE">THE
  SOCKET INTERFACE</a></h1>
Clients may communicate with the daemon via textual request and responses over a
  socket. It is a bad idea for applications to speak the protocol directly:
  rather, they should use the libgps client library and take appropriate care to
  conditionalize their code on the major and minor protocol version symbols.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The request-response protocol for the socket interface is fully documented in
  <b>gpsd_json</b>(5).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SHARED-MEMORY_AND_DBUS_INTERFACES"><a class="selflink" href="#SHARED-MEMORY_AND_DBUS_INTERFACES">SHARED-MEMORY
  AND DBUS INTERFACES</a></h1>
gpsd has two other (read-only) interfaces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whenever the daemon recognizes a packet from any attached device, it writes the
  accumulated state from that device to a shared memory segment. The C and C++
  client libraries shipped with GPSD can read this segment. Client methods, and
  various restrictions associated with the read-only nature of this interface,
  are documented at <b>libgps</b>(3). The shared-memory interface is intended
  primarily for embedded deployments in which gpsd monitors a single device, and
  its principal advantage is that a daemon instance configured with shared
  memory but without the sockets interface loses a significant amount of runtime
  weight.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The daemon may be configured to emit a D-Bus signal each time an attached device
  delivers a fix. The signal path is path /org/gpsd, the signal interface is
  &quot;org.gpsd&quot;, and the signal name is &quot;fix&quot;. The signal
  payload layout is as follows:

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GPS_DEVICE_MANAGEMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#GPS_DEVICE_MANAGEMENT">GPS
  DEVICE MANAGEMENT</a></h1>
gpsd
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
maintains an internal list of GPS devices (the &quot;device pool&quot;). If you
  specify devices on the command line, the list is initialized with those
  pathnames; otherwise the list starts empty. Commands to add and remove GPS
  device paths from the daemon's device list must be written to a local
  Unix-domain socket which will be accessible only to programs running as root.
  This control socket will be located wherever the -F option specifies it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A device may will also be dropped from the pool if GPSD gets a zero length read
  from it. This end-of-file condition indicates that the' device has been
  disconnected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When gpsd is properly installed along with hotplug notifier scripts feeding it
  device-add commands over the control socket, gpsd should require no
  configuration or user action to find devices.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sending SIGHUP to a running gpsd forces it to close all GPSes and all client
  connections. It will then attempt to reconnect to any GPSes on its device list
  and resume listening for client connections. This may be useful if your GPS
  enters a wedged or confused state but can be soft-reset by pulling down DTR.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When gpsd is called with no initial devices (thus, expecting devices to be
  passed to it by notifications to the control socket), and reaches a state
  where there are no devices connected and no subscribers <i>after</i> after
  some devices have been seen, it shuts down gracefully. It is expected that
  future device hotplug events will reactivate it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To point gpsd at a device that may be a GPS, write to the control socket a plus
  sign ('+') followed by the device name followed by LF or CR-LF. Thus, to point
  the daemon at /dev/foo. send &quot;+/dev/foo\n&quot;. To tell the daemon that
  a device has been disconnected and is no longer available, send a minus sign
  ('-') followed by the device name followed by LF or CR-LF. Thus, to remove
  /dev/foo from the search list, send &quot;-/dev/foo\n&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To send a control string to a specified device, write to the control socket a
  '!', followed by the device name, followed by '=', followed by the control
  string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To send a binary control string to a specified device, write to the control
  socket a '&amp;', followed by the device name, followed by '=', followed by
  the control string in paired hex digits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Your client may await a response, which will be a line beginning with either
  &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;ERROR&quot;. An ERROR response to an add command means
  the device did not emit data recognizable as GPS packets; an ERROR response to
  a remove command means the specified device was not in gpsd's device pool. An
  ERROR response to a ! command means the daemon did not recognize the
  devicename specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The control socket is intended for use by hotplug scripts and other
  device-discovery services. This control channel is separate from the public
  gpsd service port, and only locally accessible, in order to prevent remote
  denial-of-service and spoofing attacks.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACCURACY"><a class="selflink" href="#ACCURACY">ACCURACY</a></h1>
The base User Estimated Range Error (UERE) of GPSes is 8 meters or less at 66%
  confidence, 15 meters or less at 95% confidence. Actual horizontal error will
  be UERE times a dilution factor dependent on current satellite position.
  Altitude determination is more sensitive to variability in ionospheric signal
  lag than latitude/longitude is, and is also subject to errors in the
  estimation of local mean sea level; base error is 12 meters at 66% confidence,
  23 meters at 95% confidence. Again, this will be multiplied by a vertical
  dilution of precision (VDOP) dependent on satellite geometry, and VDOP is
  typically larger than HDOP. Users should <i>not</i> rely on GPS altitude for
  life-critical tasks such as landing an airplane.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These errors are intrinsic to the design and physics of the GPS system. gpsd
  does its internal computations at sufficient accuracy that it will add no
  measurable position error of its own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
DGPS correction will reduce UERE by a factor of 4, provided you are within about
  100mi (160km) of a DGPS ground station from which you are receiving
  corrections.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On a 4800bps connection, the time latency of fixes provided by gpsd will be one
  second or less 95% of the time. Most of this lag is due to the fact that GPSes
  normally emit fixes once per second, thus expected latency is 0.5sec. On the
  personal-computer hardware available in 2005 and later, computation lag
  induced by gpsd will be negligible, on the order of a millisecond.
  Nevertheless, latency can introduce significant errors for vehicles in motion;
  at 50km/h (31mi/h) of speed over ground, 1 second of lag corresponds to 13.8
  meters change in position between updates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The time reporting of the GPS system itself has an intrinsic accuracy limit of
  14 nanoseconds, but this can only be approximated by specialized receivers
  using that send the high-accuracy PPS (Pulse-Per-Second) over RS232 to cue a
  clock crystal. Most GPS receivers only report time to a precision of 0.01s or
  0.001s, and with no accuracy guarantees below 1sec.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your GPS uses a SiRF chipset at firmware level 231, reported UTC time may be
  off by the difference between whatever default leap-second offset has been
  compiled in and whatever leap-second correction is currently applicable, from
  startup until complete subframe information is received. Firmware levels 232
  and up don't have this problem. You may run gpsd at debug level 4 to see the
  chipset type and firmware revision level.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are exactly two circumstances under which gpsd relies on the host-system
  clock:
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the GPS broadcast signal, GPS time is represented using a week number that
  rolls over after 2^10 or 2^13 weeks (about 19.6 years, or 157 years),
  depending on the spacecraft. Receivers are required to disambiguate this to
  the correct date, but may have difficulty due to not knowing time to within
  half this interval, or may have bugs. Users have reported incorrect dates
  which appear to be due to this issue. gpsd uses the startup time of the daemon
  detect and compensate for rollovers while it is running, but otherwise reports
  the date as it is reported by the receiver without attempting to correct it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using an NMEA-only GPS (that is, not using SiRF or Garmin or Zodiac
  binary mode), gpsd relies on the system clock to tell it the current century.
  If the system clock returns an invalid value near zero, and the GPS does not
  emit GPZDA at the start of its update cycle (which most consumer-grade NMEA
  GPSes do not) then the century part of the dates gpsd delivers may be wrong.
  Additionally, near the century turnover, a range of dates as wide in seconds
  as the accuracy of your system clock may be referred to the wrong century.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USE_WITH_NTP"><a class="selflink" href="#USE_WITH_NTP">USE
  WITH NTP</a></h1>
gpsd can provide reference clock information to ntpd, to keep the system clock
  synchronized to the time provided by the GPS receiver.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Linux, gpsd includes support for interpreting the PPS pulses emitted at the
  start of every clock second on the carrier-detect lines of some serial GPSes;
  this pulse can be used to update NTP at much higher accuracy than message time
  provides. You can determine whether your GPS emits this pulse by running at -D
  5 and watching for carrier-detect state change messages in the logfile. In
  addition, if your kernel provides the RFC 2783 kernel PPS API then gpsd will
  use that for extra accuracy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Detailed instructions for using GPSD to set up a high-quality time service can
  be found among the documentation on the GPSD website.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USE_WITH_D-BUS"><a class="selflink" href="#USE_WITH_D-BUS">USE
  WITH D-BUS</a></h1>
On operating systems that support D-BUS, gpsd can be built to broadcast GPS
  fixes to D-BUS-aware applications. As D-BUS is still at a pre-1.0 stage, we
  will not attempt to document this interface here. Read the gpsd source code to
  learn more.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_AND_PERMISSIONS_ISSUES"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_AND_PERMISSIONS_ISSUES">SECURITY
  AND PERMISSIONS ISSUES</a></h1>
gpsd, if given the -G flag, will listen for connections from any reachable host,
  and then disclose the current position. Before using the -G flag, consider
  whether you consider your computer's location to be sensitive data to be kept
  private or something that you wish to publish.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsd must start up as root in order to open the NTPD shared-memory segment, open
  its logfile, and create its local control socket. Before doing any processing
  of GPS data, it tries to drop root privileges by setting its UID to
  &quot;nobody&quot; (or another configured userid) and its group ID to the
  group of the initial GPS passed on the command line &#x2014; or, if that
  device doesn't exist, to the group of /dev/ttyS0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Privilege-dropping is a hedge against the possibility that carefully crafted
  data, either presented from a client socket or from a subverted serial device
  posing as a GPS, could be used to induce misbehavior in the internals of gpsd.
  It ensures that any such compromises cannot be used for privilege elevation to
  root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The assumption behind gpsd's particular behavior is that all the tty devices to
  which a GPS might be connected are owned by the same non-root group and allow
  group read/write, though the group may vary because of distribution-specific
  or local administrative practice. If this assumption is false, gpsd may not be
  able to open GPS devices in order to read them (such failures will be logged).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to fend off inadvertent denial-of-service attacks by port scanners (not
  to mention deliberate ones), gpsd will time out inactive client connections.
  Before the client has issued a command that requests a channel assignment, a
  short timeout (60 seconds) applies. There is no timeout for clients in watcher
  or raw modes; rather, gpsd drops these clients if they fail to read data long
  enough for the outbound socket write buffer to fill. Clients with an assigned
  device in polling mode are subject to a longer timeout (15 minutes).

If multiple NMEA talkers are feeding RMC, GLL, and GGA sentences to the same
  serial device (possible with an RS422 adapter hooked up to some
  marine-navigation systems), a 'TPV' response may mix an altitude from one
  device's GGA with latitude/longitude from another's RMC/GLL after the second
  sentence has arrived.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsd may change control settings on your GPS (such as the emission frequency of
  various sentences or packets) and not restore the original settings on exit.
  This is a result of inadequacies in NMEA and the vendor binary GPS protocols,
  which often do not give clients any way to query the values of control
  settings in order to be able to restore them later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using SiRF chips, the VDOP/TDOP/GDOP figures and associated error estimates
  are computed by gpsd rather than reported by the chip. The computation does
  not exactly match what SiRF chips do internally, which includes some satellite
  weighting using parameters gpsd cannot see.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Autobauding on the Trimble GPSes can take as long as 5 seconds if the device
  speed is not matched to the GPS speed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generation of position error estimates (eph, epv, epd, eps, epc) from the
  incomplete data handed back by GPS reporting protocols involves both a lot of
  mathematical black art and fragile device-dependent assumptions. This code has
  been bug-prone in tbe past and problems may still lurk there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
AIDVM decoding of types 16-17, 22-23, and 25-26 is unverified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GPSD presently fully recognizes only the 2.1 level of RTCM2 (message types 1, 3,
  4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 16). The 2.3 message types 13, 14, and 31 are recognized and
  reported. Message types 8, 10-12, 15-27, 28-30 (undefined), 31-37, 38-58
  (undefined), and 60-63 are not yet supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ISGPS used for RTCM2 and subframes decoder logic is sufficiently convoluted
  to confuse some compiler optimizers, notably in GCC 3.x at -O2, into
  generating bad code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Devices meant to use PPS for high-precision timekeeping may fail if they are
  specified after startup by a control-socket command, as opposed to on the
  daemon's original command line. Root privileges are dropped early, and some
  Unix variants require them in order to set the PPS line discipline. Under
  Linux the POSIX capability to set the line discipline is retained, but other
  platforms cannot use this code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
USB GPS devices often do not identify themselves through the USB subsystem; they
  typically present as the class 00h (undefined) or class FFh (vendor-specific)
  of USB-to-serial adapters. Because of this, the Linux hotplug scripts must
  tell gpsd to sniff data from every USB-to-serial adapter that goes active and
  is known to be of a type used in GPSes. No such device is sent configuration
  strings until after it has been identified as a GPS, and gpsd never opens a
  device that is opened by another process. But there is a tiny window for
  non-GPS devices not opened; if the application that wants them loses a race
  with GPSD its device open will fail and have to be retried after GPSD sniffs
  the device (normally less than a second later).

By setting the environment variable <b>GPSD_SHM_KEY</b>, you can control the key
  value used to create the shared-memory segment used for communication with the
  client library. This will be useful mainly when isolating test instances of
  gpsd from production ones.

  STANDARDS</a></h1>
The official NMEA protocol standards for NMEA0183 and NMEA2000 are available
  from the National Marine Electronics Association, but are proprietary and
  expensive; the maintainers of gpsd have made a point of not looking at them.
  The GPSD project website links to several documents that collect publicly
  disclosed information about the protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsd parses the following NMEA sentences: RMC, GGA, GLL, GSA, GSV, VTG, ZDA,
  GBS, HDT, DBT, GST. It recognizes these with either the normal GP talker-ID
  prefix, or with the GN prefix used by GLONASS, or with the II prefix emitted
  by Seahawk Autohelm marine navigation systems, or with the IN prefix emitted
  by some Garmin units, or with the EC prefix emitted by ECDIS units, or with
  the SD prefix emitted by depth sounders, or with the HC and TI prefix emitted
  by some Airmar equipment. It recognizes some vendor extensions: the PGRME
  emitted by some Garmin GPS models, the OHPR emitted by Oceanserver digital
  compasses, the PTNTHTM emitted by True North digital compasses, the PMTK
  omitted by some San Jose Navigation GPSes, and the PASHR sentences emitted by
  some Ashtech GPSes.

Note that gpsd JSON returns pure decimal degrees, not the hybrid degree/minute
  format described in the NMEA standard.

Differential-GPS corrections are conveyed by the RTCM protocols. The applicable
  standard for RTCM-104 V2 is RTCM Recommended Standards for Differential GNSS
  (Global Navigation Satellite) Service RTCM Paper 136-2001/SC 104-STD. The
  applicable standard for RTCM-104 V3 is RTCM Standard 10403.1 for Differential
  GNSS Services - Version 3 RTCM Paper 177-2006-SC104-STD. Ordering instructions
  for the RTCM standards are accessible from the website of the Radio Technical
  Commission for Maritime Services under &quot;Publications&quot;.
