<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cryptoboned - The Crypto Bone Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/lib/cryptobone/cryptoboned</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cryptoboned is used to store the message keys and other
secret information for use by the Crypto Bone control
program. While the encrypted data base is stored in the
Linux file <br>
system, the master key which is necessary to decrypt this
secret information will be read during the boot process and
stored in memory only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the machine is booting the
daemon has access to an encrypted file system in which the
master key is stored for a short time of 120 seconds. Once
the master key has been <br>
read, this file system will be unmounted and a new one will
be mounted in the same place. From this point in time the
master key is now active in the daemon&rsquo;s main memory
and is <br>
not visible in the system&rsquo;s file system. This raises
the bar for an attacker to compromise the master key,
because it will be necessary to issue commands in a root
shell to <br>
recover the unmounted, encrypted file system instead of
plain read access to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the boot process has
finished, a restart of the daemon is no longer possible.
This is to further protect the master key while the daemon
is running for normal operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the daemon is running, it
communicates with the cbcontrol program via a socket that is
accessible to root only. The daemon checks, whether or not
the process trying to com&acirc; <br>
municate is /usr/lib/cryptobone/cbcontrol or not. It will
stop all communications if the request originates from a
different program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processes like encryption or
decryption that require secrets are done inside the
cryptobone daemon, so that the results can be transferred
through the socket. All communications <br>
between a legitimate cbcontrol program - that has been
invoked by the graphical user interface - resembles the
communication between an external crypto bone and the
control pro&acirc; <br>
gram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum size of the
information stored in the encrypted data base is 250000
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The cryptobone daemon responses to the following commands
that can be sent through the socket:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all-keys <br>
Prints a list of all keys that are used to store secret
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check pathname <br>
Analyses the encryption method of a PGP-encrypted file.
Prints &quot;AES encrypted data&quot; if AES is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decrypt pathname.asc password
<br>
Attempts to decrypt a PGP-encrypted file with the password
and stores the plain text in a file without the extension
&quot;asc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encrypt base64string password
<br>
PGP-encrypts the base64-decoded plaintext with the password
using AES and stores the result in the file
&quot;/usr/lib/cryptobone/cryptobone/encryptedmessage.asc&quot;.
The password <br>
must be greater than 19 and less than 65 characters. Plain
text messages are limited to 50000 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-element key <br>
Prints the value of the secret stored under the key in the
secrets data base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init <br>
Creates the secrets database if it does not already exist.
Does not overwrite an existing data base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove key <br>
Destroys the secret value stored under the key in the data
base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">replace key new_value <br>
Replaces the stored value with a new value. If the key is
not already used, the value is created under the key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write key value <br>
Creates a new entry in the data base. Does not overwrite an
existing value stored under the key.</p>
