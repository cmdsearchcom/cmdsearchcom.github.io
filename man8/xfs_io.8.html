<p>xfs_io(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual xfs_io(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfs_io - debug the I/O path of an XFS filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfs_io [ -adfmrRstxT ] [ -c cmd ] ... [ -p prog ] file <br>
xfs_io -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfs_io is a debugging tool like xfs_db(8), but is aimed at
examining the regular file I/O paths rather than the raw XFS
volume itself. These code paths include not only the <br>
obvious read/write/mmap interfaces for manipulating files,
but also cover all of the XFS extensions (such as space
preallocation, additional inode flags, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c cmd xfs_io commands may be run interactively (the
default) or as arguments on the command line. Multiple -c
arguments may be given. The commands are run in the sequence
<br>
given, then the program exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prog Set the program name for
prompts and some error messages, the default value is
xfs_io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Create file if it does not
already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Open file read-only,
initially. This is required if file is immutable or
append-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Expert mode. Dangerous
commands are only available in this mode. These commands
also tend to require additional privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the version number and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other open(2) options
described below are also available from the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCEPTS <br>
xfs_io maintains a number of open files and memory mappings.
Files can be initially opened on the command line
(optionally), and additional files can also be opened
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_io commands can be broken up
into three groups. Some commands are aimed at doing regular
file I/O - read, write, sync, space preallocation, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second set of commands exist
for manipulating memory mapped regions of a file - mapping,
accessing, storing, unmapping, flushing, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining commands are for
the navigation and display of data structures relating to
the open files, mappings, and the filesystems where they
reside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many commands have extensive
online help. Use the help command for more details on any
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE I/O COMMANDS <br>
file [ N ] <br>
Display a list of all open files and (optionally) switch to
an alternate current open file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open [[ -acdfrstRT ] path ] <br>
Closes the current file, and opens the file specified by
path instead. Without any arguments, displays statistics
about the current file - see the stat command. <br>
-a opens append-only (O_APPEND). <br>
-d opens for direct I/O (O_DIRECT). <br>
-f creates the file if it doesn&rsquo;t already exist
(O_CREAT). <br>
-r opens read-only (O_RDONLY). <br>
-s opens for synchronous I/O (O_SYNC). <br>
-t truncates on open (O_TRUNC). <br>
-n opens in non-blocking mode if possible (O_NONBLOCK). <br>
-T create a temporary file not linked into the filesystem
namespace (O_TMPFILE). The pathname passed must refer to a
directory which is treated as virtual parent for <br>
the newly created invisible file. Can not be used together
with the -r option. <br>
-R marks the file as a realtime XFS file after opening it,
if it is not already marked as such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o See the open command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close Closes the current open
file, marking the next open file as current (if one
exists).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c See the close command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pread [ -b bsize ] [ -v ] [ -FBR
[ -Z seed ] ] [ -V vectors ] offset length <br>
Reads a range of bytes in a specified blocksize from the
given offset. <br>
-b can be used to set the blocksize into which the read(2)
requests will be split. The default blocksize is 4096 bytes.
<br>
-v dump the contents of the buffer after reading, by default
only the count of bytes actually read is dumped. <br>
-F read the buffers in a forwards sequential direction. <br>
-B read the buffers in a reserve sequential direction. <br>
-R read the buffers in the give range in a random order.
<br>
-Z seed <br>
specify the random number seed used for random reads. <br>
-V vectors <br>
Use the vectored IO read syscall preadv(2) with a number of
blocksize length iovecs. The number of iovecs is set by the
vectors parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r See the pread command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwrite [ -i file ] [ -d ] [ -s
skip ] [ -b size ] [ -S seed ] [ -FBR [ -Z zeed ] ] [ -wW ]
[ -V vectors ] offset length <br>
Writes a range of bytes in a specified blocksize from the
given offset. The bytes written can be either a set pattern
or read in from another file before writing. <br>
-i allows an input file to be specified as the source of the
data to be written. <br>
-d causes direct I/O, rather than the usual buffered I/O, to
be used when reading the input file. <br>
-s specifies the number of bytes to skip from the start of
the input file before starting to read. <br>
-b used to set the blocksize into which the write(2)
requests will be split. The default blocksize is 4096 bytes.
<br>
-S used to set the (repeated) fill pattern which is used
when the data to write is not coming from a file. The
default buffer fill pattern value is 0xcdcdcdcd. <br>
-F write the buffers in a forwards sequential direction.
<br>
-B write the buffers in a reserve sequential direction. <br>
-R write the buffers in the give range in a random order.
<br>
-Z seed <br>
specify the random number seed used for random write <br>
-w call fdatasync(2) once all writes are complete (included
in timing results) <br>
-W call fsync(2) once all writes are complete (included in
timing results) <br>
-V vectors <br>
Use the vectored IO write syscall pwritev(2) with a number
of blocksize length iovecs. The number of iovecs is set by
the vectors parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w See the pwrite command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bmap [ -adlpv ] [ -n nx ] <br>
Prints the block mapping for the current open file. Refer to
the xfs_bmap(8) manual page for complete documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fiemap [ -alv ] [ -n nx ] <br>
Prints the block mapping for the current open file using the
fiemap ioctl. Options behave as described in the xfs_bmap(8)
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extsize [ -R | -D ] [ value ]
<br>
Display and/or modify the preferred extent size used when
allocating space for the currently open file. If the -R
option is specified, a recursive descent is performed for
<br>
all directory entries below the currently open file (-D can
be used to restrict the output to directories only). If the
target file is a directory, then the inherited <br>
extent size is set for that directory (new files created in
that directory inherit that extent size). The value should
be specified in bytes, or using one of the usual <br>
units suffixes (k, m, g, b, etc). The extent size is always
reported in units of bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allocsp size 0 <br>
Sets the size of the file to size and zeroes any additional
space allocated using the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP/XFS_IOC_FREESP
system call described in the xfsctl(3) manual page. <br>
allocsp and freesp do exactly the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freesp size 0 <br>
See the allocsp command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fadvise [ -r | -s | [[ -d | -n |
-w ] offset length ]] <br>
On platforms which support it, allows hints be given to the
system regarding the expected I/O patterns on the file. The
range arguments are required by some advise com&acirc; <br>
mands ([*] below), and the others must have no range
arguments. With no arguments, the POSIX_FADV_NORMAL advice
is implied (default readahead). <br>
-d the data will not be accessed again in the near future
(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED[*]). <br>
-n data will be accessed once and not be reused
(POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE[*]). <br>
-r expect access to data in random order
(POSIX_FADV_RANDOM), which sets readahead to zero. <br>
-s expect access to data in sequential order
(POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL), which doubles the default readahead
on the file. <br>
-w advises the specified data will be needed again
(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED[*]) which forces the maximum
readahead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fdatasync <br>
Calls fdatasync(2) to flush the file&rsquo;s in-core data to
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsync Calls fsync(2) to flush
all in-core file state to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s See the fsync command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync_range [ -a | -b | -w ]
offset length <br>
On platforms which support it, allows control of syncing a
range of the file to disk. With no options,
SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE is implied on the range supplied. <br>
-a wait for IO in the given range to finish after writing
(SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER). <br>
-b wait for IO in the given range to finish before writing
(SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE). <br>
-w start writeback of dirty data in the given range
(SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync Calls sync(2) to flush all
filesystems&rsquo; in-core data to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syncfs Calls syncfs(2) to flush
this filesystem&rsquo;s in-core data to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resvsp offset length <br>
Allocates reserved, unwritten space for part of a file using
the XFS_IOC_RESVSP system call described in the xfsctl(3)
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unresvsp offset length <br>
Frees reserved space for part of a file using the
XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP system call described in the xfsctl(3)
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">falloc [ -k ] offset length <br>
Allocates reserved, unwritten space for part of a file using
the fallocate routine as described in the fallocate(2)
manual page. <br>
-k will set the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag as described in
fallocate(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcollapse offset length <br>
Call fallocate with FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE flag as
described in the fallocate(2) manual page to de-allocates
blocks and eliminates the hole created in this process by
<br>
shifting data blocks into the hole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finsert offset length <br>
Call fallocate with FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE flag as described
in the fallocate(2) manual page to create the hole by
shifting data blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpunch offset length <br>
Punches (de-allocates) blocks in the file by calling
fallocate with the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag as described in
the fallocate(2) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fzero offset length <br>
Call fallocate with FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE flag as described
in the fallocate(2) manual page to allocate and zero blocks
within the range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zero offset length <br>
Call xfsctl with XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE as described in the
xfsctl(3) manual page to allocate and zero blocks within the
range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncate offset <br>
Truncates the current file at the given offset using
ftruncate(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfile -i srcfile | -f N [
offset length ] <br>
On platforms which support it, allows a direct in-kernel
copy between two file descriptors. The current open file is
the target, the source must be specified as another <br>
open file (-f) or by path (-i).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdir [ -v ] [ -o offset ] [
-l length ] <br>
Read a range of directory entries from a given offset of a
directory. <br>
-v verbose mode - dump dirent content as defined in
readdir(3) <br>
-o specify starting offset <br>
-l specify total length to read (in bytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seek -a | -d | -h [ -r ] [ -s ]
offset <br>
On platforms that support the lseek(2) SEEK_DATA and
SEEK_HOLE options, display the offsets of the specified
segments. <br>
-a Display both data and hole segments starting at the
specified offset. <br>
-d Display the data segment starting at the specified
offset. <br>
-h Display the hole segment starting at the specified
offset. <br>
-r Recursively display all the specified segments starting
at the specified offset. <br>
-s Display the starting lseek(2) offset. This offset will be
a calculated value when both data and holes are displayed
together or performing a recusively display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reflink [ -C ] [ -q ] src_file
[src_offset dst_offset length] <br>
On filesystems that support the XFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE or
BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctls, map length bytes at offset
dst_offset in the open file to the same physical blocks <br>
that are mapped at offset src_offset in the file src_file ,
replacing any contents that may already have been there. If
a program writes into a reflinked block range of <br>
either file, the dirty blocks will be cloned, written to,
and remapped (&quot;copy on write&quot;) in the affected
file, leaving the other file(s) unchanged. If src_offset,
<br>
dst_offset, and length are omitted, all contents of src_file
will be reflinked into the open file. <br>
-C Print timing statistics in a condensed format. <br>
-q Do not print timing statistics at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dedupe [ -C ] [ -q ] src_file
src_offset dst_offset length <br>
On filesystems that support the XFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME or
BTRFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME ioctls, map length bytes at
offset dst_offset in the open file to the same physical <br>
blocks that are mapped at offset src_offset in the file
src_file , but only if the contents of both ranges are
identical. This is known as block-based deduplication. If
<br>
a program writes into a reflinked block range of either
file, the dirty blocks will be cloned, written to, and
remapped (&quot;copy on write&quot;) in the affected file,
leaving the <br>
other file(s) unchanged. <br>
-C Print timing statistics in a condensed format. <br>
-q Do not print timing statistics at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMORY MAPPED I/O COMMANDS <br>
mmap [ N | [[ -rwx ] offset length ]] <br>
With no arguments, mmap shows the current mappings.
Specifying a single numeric argument N sets the current
mapping. If two arguments are specified (a range specified
by <br>
offset and length), a new mapping is created spanning the
range, and the protection mode can be given as a combination
of PROT_READ (-r), PROT_WRITE (-w), and PROT_EXEC <br>
(-x). <br>
mm See the mmap command. <br>
mremap [ -f ] [ -m ] new_length <br>
Changes the current mapping size to new_length. Whether the
mapping may be moved is controlled by the flags passed;
MREMAP_FIXED (-f), or MREMAP_MAYMOVE (-m). <br>
mrm See the mremap command. <br>
munmap Unmaps the current memory mapping. <br>
mu See the munmap command. <br>
mread [ -f | -v ] [ -r ] [ offset length ] <br>
Accesses a segment of the current memory mapping, optionally
dumping it to the standard output stream (with -v or -f
option) for inspection. The accesses are performed <br>
sequentially from the start offset by default, but can also
be done from the end backwards through the mapping if the -r
option in specified. The two verbose modes differ <br>
only in the relative offsets they display, the -f option is
relative to file start, whereas -v shows offsets relative to
the start of the mapping. <br>
mr See the mread command. <br>
mwrite [ -r ] [ -S seed ] [ offset length ] <br>
Stores a byte into memory for a range within a mapping. The
default stored value is &rsquo;X&rsquo;, repeated to fill
the range specified, but this can be changed using the -S
<br>
option. The memory stores are performed sequentially from
the start offset by default, but can also be done from the
end backwards through the mapping if the -r option in <br>
specified. <br>
mw See the mwrite command. <br>
msync [ -i ] [ -a | -s ] [ offset length ] <br>
Writes all modified copies of pages over the specified range
(or entire mapping if no range specified) to their backing
storage locations. Also, optionally invalidates <br>
(-i) so that subsequent references to the pages will be
obtained from their backing storage locations (instead of
cached copies). The flush can be done synchronously (-s)
<br>
or asynchronously (-a). <br>
ms See the msync command. <br>
madvise [ -d | -r | -s | -w ] [ offset length ] <br>
Modifies page cache behavior when operating on the current
mapping. The range arguments are required by some advise
commands ([*] below). With no arguments, the <br>
POSIX_MADV_NORMAL advice is implied (default readahead).
<br>
-d the pages will not be needed (POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED[*]).
<br>
-r expect random page references (POSIX_MADV_RANDOM), which
sets readahead to zero. <br>
-s expect sequential page references
(POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL), which doubles the default readahead
on the file. <br>
-w advises the specified pages will be needed again
(POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED[*]) which forces the maximum
readahead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mincore <br>
Dumps a list of pages or ranges of pages that are currently
in core, for the current memory mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER COMMANDS <br>
help [ command ] <br>
Display a brief description of one or all commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print Display a list of all open
files and memory mapped regions. The current file and
current mapping are distinguishable from any others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p See the print command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Exit xfs_io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q See the quit command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsattr [ -R | -D | -a | -v ]
<br>
List extended inode flags on the currently open file. If the
-R option is specified, a recursive descent is performed for
all directory entries below the currently open <br>
file (-D can be used to restrict the output to directories
only). This is a depth first descent, it does not follow
symlinks and it also does not cross mount points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chattr [ -R | -D ] [
+/-riasAdtPneEfS ] <br>
Change extended inode flags on the currently open file. The
-R and -D options have the same meaning as above. The
mapping between each letter and the inode flags (refer to
<br>
xfsctl(3) for the full list) is available via the help
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freeze Suspend all write I/O
requests to the filesystem of the current file. Only
available in expert mode and requires privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thaw Undo the effects of a
filesystem freeze operation. Only available in expert mode
and requires privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flink path <br>
Link the currently open file descriptor into the filesystem
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inject [ tag ] <br>
Inject errors into a filesystem to observe filesystem
behavior at specific points under adverse conditions.
Without the tag argument, displays the list of error tags
<br>
available. Only available in expert mode and requires
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resblks [ blocks ] <br>
Get and/or set count of reserved filesystem blocks using the
XFS_IOC_GET_RESBLKS or XFS_IOC_SET_RESBLKS system calls.
Note -- this can be useful for exercising out of <br>
space behavior. Only available in expert mode and requires
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown [ -f ] <br>
Force the filesystem to shutdown (with or without flushing
the log). Only available in expert mode and requires
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat [ -v ] <br>
Selected statistics from stat(2) and the XFS_IOC_GETXATTR
system call on the current file. If the -v option is
specified, the atime (last access), mtime (last modify), and
<br>
ctime (last change) timestamps are also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statfs Selected statistics from
statfs(2) and the XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY system call on the
filesystem where the current file resides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chproj [ -R|-D ] <br>
Modifies the project identifier associated with the current
path. The -R option will recursively descend if the current
path is a directory. The -D option will also recur&acirc;
<br>
sively descend, only setting modifying projects on
subdirectories. See the xfs_quota(8) manual page for more
information about project identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsproj [ -R|-D ] <br>
Displays the project identifier associated with the current
path. The -R and -D options behave as described above, in
chproj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parent [ -cpv ] <br>
By default this command prints out the parent inode numbers,
inode generation numbers and basenames of all the hardlinks
which point to the inode of the current file. <br>
-p the output is similar to the default output except
pathnames up to the mount-point are printed out instead of
the component name. <br>
-c the file&rsquo;s filesystem will check all the parent
attributes for consistency. <br>
-v verbose output will be printed. <br>
