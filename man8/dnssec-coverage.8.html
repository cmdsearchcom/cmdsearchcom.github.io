<p>DNSSEC-COVERAGE(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-COVERAGE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-coverage - checks future DNSKEY coverage for a
zone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-coverage [-K directory] [-f file] [-d DNSKEY TTL] [-m
max TTL] [-r interval] [-c compilezone path] [zone]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnssec-coverage verifies that the DNSSEC keys for a given
zone or a set of zones have timing metadata set properly to
ensure no future lapses in DNSSEC coverage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If zone is specified, then keys
found in the key repository matching that zone are scanned,
and an ordered list is generated of the events scheduled for
that key (i.e., <br>
publication, activation, inactivation, deletion). The list
of events is walked in order of occurrence. Warnings are
generated if any event is scheduled which could cause the
zone <br>
to enter a state in which validation failures might occur:
for example, if the number of published or active keys for a
given algorithm drops to zero, or if a key is deleted from
<br>
the zone too soon after a new key is rolled, and cached data
signed by the prior key has not had time to expire from
resolver caches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If zone is not specified, then
all keys in the key repository will be scanned, and all
zones for which there are keys will be analyzed. (Note: This
method of reporting is only <br>
accurate if all the zones that have keys in a given
repository share the same TTL parameters.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f file <br>
If a file is specified, then the zone is read from that
file; the largest TTL and the DNSKEY TTL are determined
directly from the zone data, and the -m and -d options do
not <br>
need to be specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K directory <br>
Sets the directory in which keys can be found. Defaults to
the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m maximum TTL <br>
Sets the value to be used as the maximum TTL for the zone or
zones being analyzed when determining whether there is a
possibility of validation failure. When a zone-signing <br>
key is deactivated, there must be enough time for the record
in the zone with the longest TTL to have expired from
resolver caches before that key can be purged from the <br>
DNSKEY RRset. If that condition does not apply, a warning
will be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The length of the TTL can be set
in seconds, or in larger units of time by adding a suffix:
&rsquo;mi&rsquo; for minutes, &rsquo;h&rsquo; for hours,
&rsquo;d&rsquo; for days, &rsquo;w&rsquo; for weeks,
&rsquo;mo&rsquo; for months, &rsquo;y&rsquo; <br>
for years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mandatory unless
the -f has been used to specify a zone file. (If -f has been
specified, this option may still be used; it will overrde
the value found in the <br>
file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DNSKEY TTL <br>
Sets the value to be used as the DNSKEY TTL for the zone or
zones being analyzed when determining whether there is a
possibility of validation failure. When a key is rolled <br>
(that is, replaced with a new key), there must be enough
time for the old DNSKEY RRset to have expired from resolver
caches before the new key is activated and begins <br>
generating signatures. If that condition does not apply, a
warning will be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The length of the TTL can be set
in seconds, or in larger units of time by adding a suffix:
&rsquo;mi&rsquo; for minutes, &rsquo;h&rsquo; for hours,
&rsquo;d&rsquo; for days, &rsquo;w&rsquo; for weeks,
&rsquo;mo&rsquo; for months, &rsquo;y&rsquo; <br>
for years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mandatory unless
the -f has been used to specify a zone file, or a default
key TTL was set with the -L to dnssec-keygen. (If either of
those is true, this <br>
option may still be used; it will overrde the value found in
the zone or key file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r resign interval <br>
Sets the value to be used as the resign interval for the
zone or zones being analyzed when determining whether there
is a possibility of validation failure. This value <br>
defaults to 22.5 days, which is also the default in named.
However, if it has been changed by the sig-validity-interval
option in named.conf, then it should also be changed <br>
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The length of the interval can
be set in seconds, or in larger units of time by adding a
suffix: &rsquo;mi&rsquo; for minutes, &rsquo;h&rsquo; for
hours, &rsquo;d&rsquo; for days, &rsquo;w&rsquo; for weeks,
&rsquo;mo&rsquo; for <br>
months, &rsquo;y&rsquo; for years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c compilezone path <br>
Specifies a path to a named-compilezone binary. Used for
testing.</p>
