dnssec-coverage - checks future DNSKEY coverage for a zone

<b>dnssec-coverage</b> verifies that the DNSSEC keys for a given zone or a set
  of zones have timing metadata set properly to ensure no future lapses in
  DNSSEC coverage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>zone</b> is specified, then keys found in the key repository matching that
  zone are scanned, and an ordered list is generated of the events scheduled for
  that key (i.e., publication, activation, inactivation, deletion). The list of
  events is walked in order of occurrence. Warnings are generated if any event
  is scheduled which could cause the zone to enter a state in which validation
  failures might occur: for example, if the number of published or active keys
  for a given algorithm drops to zero, or if a key is deleted from the zone too
  soon after a new key is rolled, and cached data signed by the prior key has
  not had time to expire from resolver caches.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>zone</b> is not specified, then all keys in the key repository will be
  scanned, and all zones for which there are keys will be analyzed. (Note: This
  method of reporting is only accurate if all the zones that have keys in a
  given repository share the same TTL parameters.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-f <i>file</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If a <b>file</b> is specified, then the zone
  is read from that file; the largest TTL and the DNSKEY TTL are determined
  directly from the zone data, and the <b>-m</b> and <b>-d</b> options do not
  need to be specified on the command line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-K <i>directory</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the directory in which keys can be found.
  Defaults to the current working directory.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-m <i>maximum TTL</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the value to be used as the maximum TTL
  for the zone or zones being analyzed when determining whether there is a
  possibility of validation failure. When a zone-signing key is deactivated,
  there must be enough time for the record in the zone with the longest TTL to
  have expired from resolver caches before that key can be purged from the
  DNSKEY RRset. If that condition does not apply, a warning will be generated.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The length of the TTL can be set in seconds, or in larger units of time by
  adding a suffix: 'mi' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, 'w' for weeks,
  'mo' for months, 'y' for years.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is mandatory unless the <b>-f</b> has been used to specify a zone
  file. (If <b>-f</b> has been specified, this option may still be used; it will
  overrde the value found in the file.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-d <i>DNSKEY TTL</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the value to be used as the DNSKEY TTL
  for the zone or zones being analyzed when determining whether there is a
  possibility of validation failure. When a key is rolled (that is, replaced
  with a new key), there must be enough time for the old DNSKEY RRset to have
  expired from resolver caches before the new key is activated and begins
  generating signatures. If that condition does not apply, a warning will be
  generated.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The length of the TTL can be set in seconds, or in larger units of time by
  adding a suffix: 'mi' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, 'w' for weeks,
  'mo' for months, 'y' for years.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is mandatory unless the <b>-f</b> has been used to specify a zone
  file, or a default key TTL was set with the <b>-L</b> to <b>dnssec-keygen</b>.
  (If either of those is true, this option may still be used; it will overrde
  the value found in the zone or key file.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-r <i>resign interval</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the value to be used as the resign
  interval for the zone or zones being analyzed when determining whether there
  is a possibility of validation failure. This value defaults to 22.5 days,
  which is also the default in <b>named</b>. However, if it has been changed by
  the <b>sig-validity-interval</b> option in <i>named.conf</i>, then it should
  also be changed here.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The length of the interval can be set in seconds, or in larger units of time by
  adding a suffix: 'mi' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, 'w' for weeks,
  'mo' for months, 'y' for years.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-c <i>compilezone path</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies a path to a <b>named-compilezone</b>
  binary. Used for testing.</div>
