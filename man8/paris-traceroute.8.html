<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Paris traceroute is a new version of the well-known network
diagnosis tool. It addresses problems caused by load
balancers with the initial traceroute(8) implementation. By
con&acirc; <br>
trolling the flow identifier of the probes, it is able to
follow accurate paths in networks with load balancers. It is
also able to find all the load balanced paths to the
des&acirc; <br>
tination. Finally, it enriches its output with information
extracted from the received packets, allowing a more precise
analysis of the discovered paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Set the probing
algorithm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hopbyhop <br>
Send q (configured with the -q flag) probes with the same
TTL, then wait for all the replies or a timeout. Increment
the TTL and reiter the operation until we reach the <br>
destination. All packets hold the same flow identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">packetbypacket <br>
It is the classic traceroute(8) algorithm: send one probe at
a time, then wait for a reply or a timeout. Reiter the
operation until we reach the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">concurrent <br>
Send all the probes from min_ttl to max_ttl and wait for all
replies or a timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scout Send a scout probe with a
ttl max to the destination. If the destination can be
reached, compute the number of hops used to reach the
destination and start the concurrent <br>
algorithm with a max_ttl equal to this number of hops. If
the destination cannot be reached, the hopbyhop algorithm
will be used instead. This algorithm is only usable <br>
with UDP probes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exhaustive <br>
Print all the possible &quot;load balanced&quot; paths to
the destination. (See section EXHAUSTIVE ALGORITHM )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Set the initial probe
identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Set the the UDP/TCP
destination port (default: 33457).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Set the initial ttl (default:
1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Print the &quot;IP
Identifier&quot; value of the responses. It is used to
identify the different interfaces of a router, or uncover
NAT boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Display the ttl value of the
reply. Useful to study asymmetric routing and NAT boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Set the data length to be
used in outgoing packets. (default: 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Set the maximum ttl (default:
30).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Set the maximum number of
consecutive unresponsive hops which causes the program to
abort (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Print hop addresses
numerically. The default is to print also hostnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Set the protocol to use
(possible values: udp, tcp, icmp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Set the number of probes per
hop (default: 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Set the UDP/TCP source port
(default: 33456).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Set the Type of Service
(default: 0). This field is taken into account by many
per-flow load balancers: in presence of such a load
balancer, packets having different TOS <br>
values are likely to follow a different paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Set the time to wait between
probes, in milliseconds (default 50ms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the program
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Set the time to wait for a
response, in milliseconds (default 5000ms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXHAUSTIVE ALGORITHM <br>
With the deployment of load balancing, there is no longer
only one path between two Internet hosts. This algorithm
sends enough probes at each hop to find all the possible
<br>
interfaces. Unlike the other algorithms, it varies the flow
identifier of the probes in a controlled manner, to ensure
the discovery of all the interfaces with a high confidence
<br>
degree. It also categorizes load balancers as
&quot;per-packet&quot; (pseudo-random, round-robin packet
balancing) or &quot;per-flow&quot; (packets belonging to the
same flow follow the same path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of per-flow load
balancing, it prints additional information to track flows.
The following trace shows the enriched output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14 1.1.1.1:0,1,3 539.065 ms
1.1.1.2:2,4,5 492.152 ms <br>
15 2.2.2.2:0,1,3 563.163 ms 2.2.2.3:2,4,5 470.919 ms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integers listed after the
interface addresses are &quot;flow identifiers&quot;: they
are used to identify a flow in the set of interfaces found
by the algorithm. For example, flow #0 tra&acirc; <br>
verses interfaces 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2. This is the same for
flows 1 and 3 while flows 2, 4 and 5 traverse 1.1.1.2 and
2.2.2.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
The following information are extracted from the response
packets and displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Response TTL <br>
The TTL of the responses (from the routers and the
destination) is optionally displayed in square brackets (Use
the -l flag ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Original TTL <br>
This is the TTL of the probe when it was received and
dropped by the router. If the original TTL is different than
1, it is displayed with a !Tx symbol, where x is the <br>
value of the TTL. For example, !T0 indicates that the value
of the TTL was 0 when the probe reached the router that
discarded it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP Identifier <br>
This the identifier of the IP error packet sent by the
router. This field is set with the value of an internal
16-bit counter usually incremented for each packet sent.
<br>
This value is optionally displayed inside brackets. For
instance {1234} indicates that the probe had its identifier
set to 1234.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MPLS labels <br>
If the packet contains ICMP extensions for MPLS, the MPLS
label stack is diplayed in an additionnal line just after
the current hop line. Labels of the same stack are <br>
separated with a &quot;|&quot; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other ICMP error messages <br>
Paris traceroutes uses the same convensions as traceroute(8)
to display unexpected ICMP messages (i.e. different than
TIME_EXCEEDED, PORT_UNREACHABLE and ECHO_REPLY).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
traceroute(8), pathchar(8), netstat(1), ping(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The initial version of traceroute(8) was implemented by Van
Jacobson from a suggestion by Steve Deering. Paris
traceroute was implemented by Xavier Cuvellier. Debugged and
<br>
enhanced by Brice Augustin.</p>
