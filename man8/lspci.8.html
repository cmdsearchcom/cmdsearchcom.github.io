<p>lspci(8) The PCI Utilities lspci(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lspci - list all PCI devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lspci [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lspci is a utility for displaying information about PCI
buses in the system and devices connected to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, it shows a brief
list of devices. Use the options described below to request
either a more verbose output or output intended for parsing
by other programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are going to report bugs
in PCI device drivers or in lspci itself, please include
output of &quot;lspci -vvx&quot; or even better &quot;lspci
-vvxxx&quot; (however, see below for possible <br>
caveats).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some parts of the output,
especially in the highly verbose modes, are probably
intelligible only to experienced PCI hackers. For exact
definitions of the fields, please consult <br>
either the PCI specifications or the header.h and
/usr/include/linux/pci.h include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to some parts of the PCI
configuration space is restricted to root on many operating
systems, so the features of lspci available to normal users
are limited. However, <br>
lspci tries its best to display as much as available and
mark all other information with &lt;access denied&gt;
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Basic display modes <br>
-m Dump PCI device data in a backward-compatible machine
readable form. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mm Dump PCI device data in a
machine readable form for easy parsing by scripts. See below
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Show a tree-like diagram
containing all buses, bridges, devices and connections
between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display options <br>
-v Be verbose and display detailed information about all
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Be very verbose and display
more details. This level includes everything deemed
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vvv Be even more verbose and
display everything we are able to parse, even if it
doesn&rsquo;t look interesting at all (e.g., undefined
memory regions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Show kernel drivers handling
each device and also kernel modules capable of handling it.
Turned on by default when -v is given in the normal mode of
output. (Currently <br>
works only on Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Show hexadecimal dump of the
standard part of the configuration space (the first 64 bytes
or 128 bytes for CardBus bridges).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xxx Show hexadecimal dump of
the whole PCI configuration space. It is available only to
root as several PCI devices crash when you try to read some
parts of the config space <br>
(this behavior probably doesn&rsquo;t violate the PCI
standard, but it&rsquo;s at least very stupid). However,
such devices are rare, so you needn&rsquo;t worry much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xxxx Show hexadecimal dump of
the extended (4096-byte) PCI configuration space available
on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express buses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Bus-centric view. Show all
IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by the cards on the PCI
bus instead of as seen by the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Always show PCI domain
numbers. By default, lspci suppresses them on machines which
have only domain 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to control resolving
ID&rsquo;s to names <br>
-n Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of
looking them up in the PCI ID list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nn Show PCI vendor and device
codes as both numbers and names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Use DNS to query the central
PCI ID database if a device is not found in the local
pci.ids file. If the DNS query succeeds, the result is
cached in ~/.pciids-cache and it <br>
is recognized in subsequent runs even if -q is not given any
more. Please use this switch inside automated scripts only
with caution to avoid overloading the database <br>
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qq Same as -q, but the local
cache is reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Query the central database
even for entries which are recognized locally. Use this if
you suspect that the displayed entry is wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for selection of devices
<br>
-s
[[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;device&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]
<br>
Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your
machine has several host bridges, they can either share a
common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI
<br>
domain of its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus
(0 to ff), device (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7). Each
component of the device address can be omitted or set <br>
to &quot;*&quot;, both meaning &quot;any value&quot;. All
numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., &quot;0:&quot; means all
devices on bus 0, &quot;0&quot; means all functions of
device 0 on any bus, &quot;0.3&quot; selects third <br>
function of device 0 on all buses and &quot;.4&quot; shows
only the fourth function of each device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d
[&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;][:&lt;class&gt;] <br>
Show only devices with specified vendor, device and class
ID. The ID&rsquo;s are given in hexadecimal and may be
omitted or given as &quot;*&quot;, both meaning &quot;any
value&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options <br>
-i &lt;file&gt; <br>
Use &lt;file&gt; as the PCI ID list instead of
/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;file&gt; <br>
Use &lt;file&gt; as the map of PCI ID&rsquo;s handled by
kernel modules. By default, lspci uses
/lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap. Applies only to
Linux systems with recent <br>
enough module tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Invoke bus mapping mode which
performs a thorough scan of all PCI devices, including those
behind misconfigured bridges, etc. This option gives
meaningful results only <br>
with a direct hardware access mode, which usually requires
root privileges. Please note that the bus mapper only scans
PCI domain 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Shows lspci version. This option should be used
stand-alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCI access options <br>
The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices
(see pcilib(7) for details). You can use the following
options to influence its behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A &lt;method&gt; <br>
The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI
hardware. By default, it uses the first access method
available, but you can use this option to override this <br>
decision. See -A help for a list of available methods and
their descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O &lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<br>
The behavior of the library is controlled by several named
parameters. This option allows to set the value of any of
the parameters. Use -O help for a list of known <br>
parameters and their default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H1 Use direct hardware access
via Intel configuration mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand
for -A intel-conf1.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H2 Use direct hardware access
via Intel configuration mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand
for -A intel-conf2.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;file&gt; <br>
Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of devices
and values of their configuration registers from the given
file produced by an earlier run of lspci -x. This <br>
is very useful for analysis of user-supplied bug reports,
because you can display the hardware configuration in any
way you want without disturbing the user with requests <br>
for more dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Increase debug level of the
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT <br>
If you intend to process the output of lspci automatically,
please use one of the machine-readable output formats (-m,
-vm, -vmm) described in this section. All other formats are
<br>
likely to change between versions of lspci.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All numbers are always printed
in hexadecimal. If you want to process numeric ID&rsquo;s
instead of names, please add the -n switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple format (-m) <br>
In the simple format, each device is described on a single
line, which is formatted as parameters suitable for passing
to a shell script, i.e., values separated by whitespaces,
<br>
quoted and escaped if necessary. Some of the arguments are
positional: slot, class, vendor name, device name, subsystem
vendor name and subsystem name (the last two are empty if
<br>
the device has no subsystem); the remaining arguments are
option-like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rrev Revision number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pprogif <br>
Programming interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The relative order of positional
arguments and options is undefined. New options can be added
in future versions, but they will always have a single
argument not separated from <br>
the option by any spaces, so they can be easily ignored if
not recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose format (-vmm) <br>
The verbose output is a sequence of records separated by
blank lines. Each record describes a single device by a
sequence of lines, each line containing a single &lsquo;tag:
value&rsquo; <br>
pair. The tag and the value are separated by a single tab
character. Neither the records nor the lines within a record
are in any particular order. Tags are case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following tags are
defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slot The name of the slot where
the device resides ([domain:]bus:device.function). This tag
is always the first in a record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Class Name of the class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vendor Name of the vendor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device Name of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVendor <br>
Name of the subsystem vendor (optional).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SDevice <br>
Name of the subsystem (optional).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PhySlot <br>
The physical slot where the device resides (optional, Linux
only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rev Revision number
(optional).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ProgIf Programming interface
(optional).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Driver Kernel driver currently
handling the device (optional, Linux only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Kernel module reporting
that it is capable of handling the device (optional, Linux
only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUMANode <br>
NUMA node this device is connected to (optional, Linux
only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New tags can be added in future
versions, so you should silently ignore any tags you
don&rsquo;t recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backward-compatible verbose
format (-vm) <br>
In this mode, lspci tries to be perfectly compatible with
its old versions. It&rsquo;s almost the same as the regular
verbose format, but the Device tag is used for both the slot
and <br>
the device name, so it occurs twice in a single record.
Please avoid using this format in any new code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids <br>
A list of all known PCI ID&rsquo;s (vendors, devices,
classes and subclasses). Maintained at
http://pciids.sourceforge.net/, use the update-pciids
utility to download the most <br>
recent version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids.gz
<br>
If lspci is compiled with support for compression, this file
is tried before pci.ids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.pciids-cache <br>
All ID&rsquo;s found in the DNS query mode are cached in
this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Sometimes, lspci is not able to decode the configuration
registers completely. This usually happens when not enough
documentation was available to the authors. In such cases,
<br>
it at least prints the &lt;?&gt; mark to signal that there
is potentially something more to say. If you know the
details, patches will be of course welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to the extended
configuration space is currently supported only by the
linux_sysfs back-end.</p>
