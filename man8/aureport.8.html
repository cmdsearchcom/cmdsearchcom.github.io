AUREPORT:(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aureport - a tool that produces summary reports of audit
daemon logs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aureport [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
aureport is a tool that produces summary reports of the
audit system logs. The aureport utility can also take input
from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data. The
<br>
reports have a column label at the top to help with
interpretation of the various fields. Except for the main
summary report, all reports have the audit event number. You
can <br>
subsequently lookup the full event with ausearch -a event
number. You may need to specify start &amp; stop times if
you get multiple hits. The reports produced by aureport can
be <br>
used as building blocks for more complicated analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-au, --auth <br>
Report about authentication attempts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --avc <br>
Report about avc messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--comm Report about commands
run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config <br>
Report about config changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cr, --crypto <br>
Report about crypto events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --event <br>
Report about events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --file <br>
Report about files and af_unix sockets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--failed <br>
Only select failed events for processing in the reports. The
default is both success and failed events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --host <br>
Report about hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print brief command
summary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interpret <br>
Interpret numeric entities into text. For example, uid is
converted to account name. The conversion is done using the
current resources of the machine where the search <br>
is being run. If you have renamed the accounts, or
don&rsquo;t have the same accounts on your machine, you
could get misleading results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-if, --input file | directory
<br>
Use the given file or directory instead of the logs. This is
to aid analysis where the logs have been moved to another
machine or only part of a log was saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input-logs <br>
Use the log file location from auditd.conf as input for
analysis. This is needed if you are using aureport from a
cron job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--integrity <br>
Report about integrity events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --key <br>
Report about audit rule keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --login <br>
Report about logins</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mods <br>
Report about account modifications</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ma, --mac <br>
Report about Mandatory Access Control (MAC) events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --anomaly <br>
Report about anomaly events. These events include NIC going
into promiscuous mode and programs segfaulting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--node node-name <br>
Only select events originating from node name string for
processing in the reports. The default is to include all
nodes. Multiple nodes are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nc, --no-config <br>
Do not include the CONFIG_CHANGE event. This is particularly
useful for the key report because audit rules have key
labels in many cases. Using this option gets rid of <br>
these false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pid <br>
Report about processes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --response <br>
Report about responses to anomaly events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --syscall <br>
Report about syscalls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--success <br>
Only select successful events for processing in the reports.
The default is both success and failed events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary <br>
Run the summary report that gives a total of the elements of
the main report. Not all reports have a summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --log <br>
This option will output a report of the start and end times
for each log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tty Report about tty
keystrokes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-te, --end [end-date] [end-time]
<br>
Search for events with time stamps equal to or before the
given end time. The format of end time depends on your
locale. If the date is omitted, today is assumed. If the
<br>
time is omitted, now is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time
rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using
the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time <br>
is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced by the
LC_TIME environmental variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use the word: now,
recent, today, yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month,
this-year. Today means starting now. Recent is 10 minutes
ago. Yesterday is 1 <br>
second after midnight the previous day. This-week means
starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week
determined by your locale (see localtime). Week-ago means 1
<br>
second after midnight exactly 7 days ago. This-month means 1
second after midnight on day 1 of the month. This-year means
the 1 second after midnight on the first day of <br>
the first month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tm, --terminal <br>
Report about terminals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ts, --start [start-date]
[start-time] <br>
Search for events with time stamps equal to or after the

the LC_TIME environmental variable.</p>

recent, today, yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month,
this-year. Today means starting at 1 second after midnight.
Recent is 10 minutes <br>
ago. Yesterday is 1 second after midnight the previous day.
This-week means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of
the week determined by your locale (see local&acirc; <br>
time). Week-ago means starting 1 second after midnight
exactly 7 days ago. This-month means 1 second after midnight
on day 1 of the month. This-year means the 1 second <br>
after midnight on the first day of the first month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user <br>
Report about users</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
