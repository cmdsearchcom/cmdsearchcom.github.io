auth_krb5 - nnrpd Kerberos&#x00A0;v5 authenticator
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>auth_krb5</b> [<b>-i</b> <i>instance</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program does authentication for <b>nnrpd</b> against a
  Kerberos&#x00A0;v5&#x00A0;KDC. This is NOT real Kerberos authentication using
  service tickets; instead, a username and password is used to attempt to obtain
  a Kerberos&#x00A0;v5&#x00A0;TGT to confirm that they are valid. As such, this
  authenticator assumes that <b>nnrpd</b> has been given the user's username and
  password, and therefore is not as secure as real Kerberos authentication. It
  generally should only be used with NNTP over TLS to protect the password from
  sniffing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, you do not want to use this authenticator. Instead, use
  <b>ckpasswd</b> with PAM support and configure the <b>nnrpd</b> PAM stack to
  use a Kerberos PAM module. A full Kerberos PAM module is more sophisticated
  about how it validates passwords and has a much broader array of options than
  this authenticator.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b> <i>instance</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If this option is given, <i>instance</i> will be used as
      the instance of the principal received from <b>nnrpd</b> and
      authentication will be done against that principal instead of the base
      principal. In other words, a principal like &quot;user&quot;, when passed
      to <b>auth_krb5</b> invoked with &quot;-i nntp&quot;, will be transformed
      into &quot;user/nntp&quot; before attempting Kerberos authentication.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since giving one's password to <b>nnrpd</b> is not as secure as normal
      Kerberos authentication, this option supports a configuration where all
      users are given a separate instance just for news authentication with its
      own password, so their regular account password isn't exposed via
    NNTP.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
The following <i>readers.conf</i>(5) fragment tells nnrpd to authenticate users
  by attempting to obtain Kerberos&#x00A0;v5&#x00A0;TGTs for them, appending an
  instance of &quot;nntp&quot; to usernames before doing so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    auth kerberos {
        auth: &quot;auth_krb5 -i nntp&quot;
    }
    access kerberos {
        users: &quot;*/nntp&quot;
        newsgroups: example.*
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Access is granted to the example.* groups for all users who successfully
  authenticate.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Currently, any username containing realm information (containing &quot;@&quot;)
  is rejected. This is to prevent someone from passing in a username
  corresponding to a principal in another realm that they have access to and
  gaining access to the news server via it. However, this is also something that
  people may wish to do under some circumstances, so there should be a better
  way of handling it (such as, perhaps, a list of acceptable realms or a
  <b>-r</b> flag specifying the realm in which to attempt authentication).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's not clear the right thing to do when the username passed in contains a
  &quot;/&quot; and <b>-i</b> was also given. Right now, <b>auth_krb5</b> will
  create a malformed Kerberos principal with multiple instances and attempt to
  authenticate against it, which will fail but perhaps not with the best error
  message.
