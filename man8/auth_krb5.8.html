<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
auth_krb5 - nnrpd Kerberos v5 authenticator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
auth_krb5 [-i instance]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program does authentication for nnrpd against a
Kerberos v5 KDC. This is NOT real Kerberos authentication
using service tickets; instead, a username and password is
used to <br>
attempt to obtain a Kerberos v5 TGT to confirm that they are
valid. As such, this authenticator assumes that nnrpd has
been given the user&rsquo;s username and password, and
therefore <br>
is not as secure as real Kerberos authentication. It
generally should only be used with NNTP over TLS to protect
the password from sniffing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, you do not want to use
this authenticator. Instead, use ckpasswd with PAM support
and configure the nnrpd PAM stack to use a Kerberos PAM
module. A full Kerberos PAM <br>
module is more sophisticated about how it validates
passwords and has a much broader array of options than this
authenticator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i instance <br>
If this option is given, instance will be used as the
instance of the principal received from nnrpd and
authentication will be done against that principal instead
of the base <br>
principal. In other words, a principal like
&quot;user&quot;, when passed to auth_krb5 invoked with
&quot;-i nntp&quot;, will be transformed into
&quot;user/nntp&quot; before attempting Kerberos <br>
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since giving one&rsquo;s
password to nnrpd is not as secure as normal Kerberos
authentication, this option supports a configuration where
all users are given a separate instance <br>
just for news authentication with its own password, so their
regular account password isn&rsquo;t exposed via NNTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following readers.conf(5) fragment tells nnrpd to
authenticate users by attempting to obtain Kerberos v5 TGTs
for them, appending an instance of &quot;nntp&quot; to
usernames before <br>
doing so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth kerberos { <br>
auth: &quot;auth_krb5 -i nntp&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">access kerberos { <br>
users: &quot;*/nntp&quot; <br>
newsgroups: example.* <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access is granted to the
example.* groups for all users who successfully
authenticate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Currently, any username containing realm information
(containing &quot;@&quot;) is rejected. This is to prevent
someone from passing in a username corresponding to a
principal in another <br>
realm that they have access to and gaining access to the
news server via it. However, this is also something that
people may wish to do under some circumstances, so there
should <br>
be a better way of handling it (such as, perhaps, a list of
acceptable realms or a -r flag specifying the realm in which
to attempt authentication).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not clear the right
thing to do when the username passed in contains a
&quot;/&quot; and -i was also given. Right now, auth_krb5
will create a malformed Kerberos principal with <br>
multiple instances and attempt to authenticate against it,
which will fail but perhaps not with the best error
message.</p>
