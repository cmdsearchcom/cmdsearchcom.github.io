ipmi-pef-config - configure PEF values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmi-pef-config [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ipmi-pef-config is a Platform Event Filtering (PEF)
configuration utility. This configuration tool is for
advanced IPMI users and generally not-required for IPMI to
function. <br>
Most IPMI users will not need to use this tool. For
configuration of general BMC parameters, sensors, or
chassis, please see the bmc-config(8),
ipmi-sensors-config(8), and ipmi- <br>
chassis-config(8) tools respectively. For some OEM specific
configurations, please see ipmi-oem(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are general IPMI
options, tool specific options, trouble shooting
information, workaround information, examples, and known
issues. For a general introduction to <br>
FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7). See GENERAL USE below for a
description on how most will want to use
Ipmi-pef-config.</p>

fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I CIPHER-SUITE-ID,
--cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID <br>
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0

cation. The authentication algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signa&acirc; <br>
tures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The following cipher suite <br>
ids are currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI-PEF-CONFIG OPTIONS <br>
The following options are specific to Ipmi-pef-config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
Show general information about PEF configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG OPTIONS <br>
The following options are used to read, write, and find
differences in configuration values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --checkout <br>
Fetch configuration information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --commit <br>
Update configuration information from a config file or key
pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --diff <br>
Show differences between stored information and a config
file or key pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n FILENAME, --filename=FILENAME
<br>
Specify a config file for checkout/commit/diff. If specified
with checkout, cannot use with multiple hosts or with
--always-prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &quot;KEY=VALUE&quot;,
--key-pair=&quot;KEY=VALUE&quot; <br>
Specify KEY=VALUE pairs for checkout/commit/diff. Specify
KEY by SectionName:FieldName. This option can be used
multiple times. On commit, any KEY=VALUE pairs will
over&acirc; <br>
write any pairs specified in a file with --filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S SECTION, --section=SECTION
<br>
Specify a SECTION for checkout. This option can be used
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --listsections <br>
List available sections for checkout. Some sections in the
list may not be checked out by default and may require
verbosity to be increased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Output verbose information. When used with --checkout,
additional uncommon sections and/or fields will be shown. In
ipmi-pef-config, this includes checking out sections <br>
for each channel on a system, if multiple channels
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Output very verbose
information. Output additional detailed information about
what fields can and cannot be checked out, and sometimes the
reason why. Sometimes output <br>
fields that are identified as unsupported on the
motherboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lan-channel-number=NUMBER <br>
Use an specific channel number for LAN configuration.
Particularly useful if motherboard contains multiple LAN
channels and a user wishes to use a specific one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED OPTIONS <br>
The following options manipulate hostranged output. See
HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information on
hostranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --buffer-output <br>
Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard
output until the node has completed its IPMI operation. When
specifying this option, data may appear to output <br>
slower to the user since the the entire IPMI operation must
complete before any data can be output. See HOSTRANGED
SUPPORT below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --consolidate-output <br>
Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output
from every node specified will be consolidated so that nodes
with identical output are not output twice. A <br>
header will list those nodes with the consolidated output.
When this option is specified, no output can be seen until
the IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If <br>
the user breaks out of the program early, all currently
consolidated output will be dumped. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F NUM, --fanout=NUM <br>
Specify multiple host fanout. A &quot;sliding window&quot;
(or fanout) algorithm is used for parallel IPMI
communication so that slower nodes or timed out nodes will
not impede par&acirc; <br>
allel communication. The maximum number of threads available
at the same time is limited by the fanout. The default is
64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --eliminate <br>
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by ipmidetect. This
attempts to remove the common issue of hostranged execution
timing out due to several nodes being removed <br>
from service in a large cluster. The ipmidetectd daemon must
be running on the node executing the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--always-prefix <br>
Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or
communicating in-band. This option is primarily useful for
scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if speci&acirc;
<br>
fied with the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL USE <br>
Most users of will want to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A) Run with --checkout to get a
copy of the current configuration and store it in a file.
The standard output can be redirected to a file or a file
can be specified with the <br>
--filename option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B) Edit the configuration file
with an editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C) Commit the configuration back
using the --commit option and specifying the configuration
file with the --filename option. The configuration can be
committed to multiple hosts <br>
in parallel via the hostrange support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although not typically
necessarily, some motherboards do not store configuration
values in non-volatile memory. Therefore, after system
reboots, some configuration values may <br>
have changed. The user may wish to run configuration tools
on each boot to ensure configuration values remain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITING THE CHECKOUT FILE <br>
Options for editing fields in the checkout file are usually
listed in a comment above the field. When there are to many
options to make it practical, they are listed here in the
<br>
MAN page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sensor_Type Options <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI-PEF-CONFIG SPECIAL CASE
CONFIGURATION INFORMATION <br>
On some motherboards, multiple channels may exist for LAN
IPMI communication. If multiple channels exist,
configuration of both channels can be viewed and ultimately
configured <br>
by running --checkout under verbose mode. Each section name
will be suffixed appropriately with the word Channel and the
channel number. For example, you might see a Commu&acirc;
<br>
nity_String_Channel_1 and Community_String_Channel_3, where
you can configure the Community String on Channels 1 and 3
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED SUPPORT <br>
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma
separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the
general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt;
k, etc. The <br>
later form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19]
does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a
<br>
degenerate range: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This range syntax is meant only
as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming
convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list <br>
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of range usage
follow: <br>
foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 <br>
foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10 <br>
foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a reminder to the reader,
some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern
matching. Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to
enclose ranged lists within <br>
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple hosts are
specified by the user, a thread will be executed for each
host in parallel up to the configured fanout (which can be
adjusted via the -F option). This <br>
will allow communication to large numbers of nodes far more
quickly than if done in serial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, standard output from
each node specified will be output with the hostname
prepended to each line. Although this output is readable in
many situations, it may be dif&acirc; <br>
ficult to read in other situations. For example, output from
multiple nodes may be mixed together. The -B and -C options
can be used to change this default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In-band IPMI Communication will
be used when the host &quot;localhost&quot; is specified.
This allows the user to add the localhost into the
hostranged output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN problems involve a
misconfiguration of the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double
check to make sure the following are configured properly in
the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC: IP <br>
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connec&acirc; <br>
tions, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration <br>
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inband IPMI problems are
typically caused by improperly configured drivers or
non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are many of the
common issues for error messages. For additional support,
please e-mail the &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;username invalid&quot; -
The username entered (or a NULL username if none was
entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also
be possible the remote BMC&rsquo;s username con&acirc; <br>
figuration is incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password invalid&quot; -
The password entered (or a NULL password if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the
password for the user is not correctly configured <br>
on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password verification
timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed out. A
&quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above) or a
generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. <br>
During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The
K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is
not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level
insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher user
privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may <br>
require authenticating to a different user which has a
higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level cannot be
obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege level you are
attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
allowed for this user. Please try <br>
again with a lower privilege. It may also be possible the
maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try <br>
again with an alternate authentication type or alternate
privilege level. It may also be possible the available
authentication types you can authenticate with are not
correctly <br>
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher suite id
unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may <br>
also be possible the available cipher suite ids are not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
- IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please
try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection timeout&quot; -
Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of potential
errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be <br>
resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the
network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration
and connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;session timeout&quot; -
The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect. If this
error occurs often, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are con&acirc; <br>
siderably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;device not found&quot; -
The specified device could not be found. Please check
configuration or inputs and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;message timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC busy&quot; - The BMC
is currently busy. It may be processing information or have
too many simultaneous sessions to manage. Please wait and
try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;could not find inband
device&quot; - An inband device could not be found. Please
check configuration or specify specific device or driver on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; - The
inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC
or service processor. The BMC or service processor may be
busy or (worst case) possibly non- <br>
functioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;internal IPMI error&quot;
- An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how
to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to
report the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKAROUNDS <br>
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI
solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of
work&acirc; <br>
arounds currently available to handle discovered compliance
issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so
they will be transparent to the user. However, some will
<br>
require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardware listed below may
only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on.
Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
below. Similar machines from <br>
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds <br>
listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe your hardware has
an additional compliance issue that needs a workaround to be
implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or <br>
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumeio - This workaround flag
will assume inband interfaces communicate with system I/O
rather than being memory-mapped. This will work around
systems that report invalid base <br>
addresses. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;device not
supported&quot; or &quot;could not find inband device&quot;
errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spinpoll - This workaround flag
will inform some inband drivers (most notably the KCS
driver) to spin while polling rather than putting the
process to sleep. This may signifi&acirc; <br>
cantly improve the wall clock running time of tools because
an operating system scheduler&rsquo;s granularity may be
much larger than the time it takes to perform a single IPMI
message <br>
transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool
for a more useful task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authcap - This workaround flag
will skip early checks for username capabilities,
authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
authentication to succeed. It works <br>
around multiple issues in which the remote system does not
properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see <br>
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel <br>
SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochecksumcheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums <br>
due to implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise
valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes validation of packet integrity in a number of
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most
situations. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification time&acirc; <br>
out&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
&quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too.
Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F,
and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idzero - This workaround flag
will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client.
It works around IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs
to the client. Those hitting <br>
this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpectedauth - This workaround
flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked
as though they were expected. It works around an issue when
packets contain non-null <br>
authentication data when they should be null due to disabled
per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell
Pow&acirc; <br>
erEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forcepermsg - This workaround
flag will force per-message authentication to be used no
matter what is advertised by the remote system. It works
around an issue when per-message <br>
authentication is advertised as disabled on the remote
system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue <br>
observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endianseq - This workaround flag
will flip the endian of the session sequence numbers to
allow the session to continue properly. It works around IPMI
1.5 session sequence numbers <br>
that are the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noauthcodecheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command
responses. It works around systems that return <br>
invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the validity <br>
of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is
unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting this issue
may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session
timeout&quot;, or &quot;password veri&acirc; <br>
fication timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Xyratex
FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intel20 - This workaround flag
will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
password truncation if the <br>
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with <br>
Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermicro20 - This workaround
flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0
authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI
firmware. The issues covered include han&acirc; <br>
dling invalid length authentication codes. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors.
Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card.
Confirmed <br>
fixed on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sun20 - This workaround flag
will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and <br>
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround <br>
automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot;
workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opensesspriv - This workaround
flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s IPMI 2.0
connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing
algorithm used by the remote system. The privi&acirc; <br>
lege level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those
hit&acirc; <br>
ting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;,
&quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status
code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500
with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu <br>
II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and
Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is
automatically trig&acirc; <br>
gered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integritycheckvalue - This
workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check
value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity <br>
check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermi&acirc; <br>
cro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some
motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not
support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection <br>
timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be worked around by
using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
--driver-type=LAN_2_0. Issue observed on HP Proliant DL
145.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slowcommit - This workaround
will slow down commits to the BMC by sleeping one second
between the commit of sections. It works around motherboards
that have BMCs that can be <br>
overwhelmed by commits. Those hitting this issue may see
commit errors or commits not being written to the BMC. Issue
observed on Supermicro H8QME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">veryslowcommit - This workaround
will slow down commits to the BMC by sleeping one second
between the commit of every key. It works around
motherboards that have BMCs that can be <br>
overwhelmed by commits. Those hitting this issue may see
commit errors or commits not being written to the BMC. Issue
observed on Quanta S99Q/Dell FS12-TY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On non-fatal
error, exit status is 1. On fatal error, exit status is
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple hosts are specified
for communication, the exit status is 0 if and only if all
targets successfully execute. If any non-fatal error occurs,
exit status is 1. If any <br>
fatal error occurs, exit status is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
On older operating systems, if you input your username,
password, and other potentially security relevant
information on the command line, this information may be
discovered by <br>
other users when using tools like the ps(1) command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K <br>
options. Configuring security relevant information in the
FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way
to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent brute force
attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock up&quot;
after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need
to wait awhile in order to this tempo&acirc; <br>
rary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may authenticate
again.</p>
