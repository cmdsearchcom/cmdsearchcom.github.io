Stochastic Fair Blue is a classless qdisc to manage congestion based on packet
  loss and link utilization history while trying to prevent non-responsive flows
  (i.e. flows that do not react to congestion marking or dropped packets) from
  impacting performance of responsive flows. Unlike RED, where the marking
  probability has to be configured, BLUE tries to determine the ideal marking
  probability automatically.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ALGORITHM"><a class="selflink" href="#ALGORITHM">ALGORITHM</a></h1>
The <b>BLUE</b> algorithm maintains a probability which is used to mark or drop
  packets that are to be queued. If the queue overflows, the mark/drop
  probability is increased. If the queue becomes empty, the probability is
  decreased. The <b>Stochastic Fair Blue</b> (SFB) algorithm is designed to
  protect TCP flows against non-responsive flows.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This SFB implementation maintains 8 levels of 16 bins each for accounting. Each
  flow is mapped into a bin of each level using a per-level hash value.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Every bin maintains a marking probability, which gets increased or decreased
  based on bin occupancy. If the number of packets exceeds the size of that bin,
  the marking probability is increased. If the number drops to zero, it is
  decreased.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The marking probability is based on the minimum value of all bins a flow is
  mapped into, thus, when a flow does not respond to marking or gradual packet
  drops, the marking probability quickly reaches one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In this case, the flow is rate-limited to <b>penalty_rate</b> packets per
  second.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
Due to SFBs nature, it is possible for responsive flows to share all of its bins
  with a non-responsive flow, causing the responsive flow to be misidentified as
  being non-responsive.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The probability of a responsive flow to be misidentified is dependent on the
  number of non-responsive flows, M. It is (1 - (1 - (1 / 16.0)) ** M) **8, so
  for example with 10 non-responsive flows approximately 0.2% of responsive
  flows will be misidentified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To mitigate this, SFB performs performs periodic re-hashing to avoid
  misclassification for prolonged periods of time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default hashing method will use source and destination ip addresses and port
  numbers if possible, and also supports tunneling protocols. Alternatively, an
  external classifier can be configured, too.

  <dd class="It-tag">Double buffering warmup wait time, in milliseconds. To
      avoid destroying the probability history when rehashing is performed, this

      section 4.4 of the SFB reference. While one set is used to manage the
      queue, a second set is warmed up: Whenever a flow is then determined to be
      non-responsive, the marking probabilities in the second set are updated.
      When the rehashing happens, these bins will be used to manage the queue
      and all non-responsive flows can be rate-limited immediately. This value

SFB automatically enables use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). Also,
  this SFB implementation does not queue packets itself. Rather, packets are
  enqueued to the inner qdisc (defaults to pfifo). Because sfb maintains virtual
  queue states, the inner qdisc must not drop a packet previously queued.
  Furthermore, if a buckets queue has a very high marking rate, this
  implementation will start dropping packets instead of marking them, as such a
  situation points to either bad congestion, or an unresponsive flow.
