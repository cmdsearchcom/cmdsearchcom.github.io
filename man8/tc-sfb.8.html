<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Stochastic Fair Blue is a classless qdisc to manage
congestion based on packet loss and link utilization history
while trying to prevent non-responsive flows (i.e. flows
that do <br>
not react to congestion marking or dropped packets) from
impacting performance of responsive flows. Unlike RED, where
the marking probability has to be configured, BLUE tries to
<br>
determine the ideal marking probability automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHM <br>
The BLUE algorithm maintains a probability which is used to
mark or drop packets that are to be queued. If the queue
overflows, the mark/drop probability is increased. If the
<br>
queue becomes empty, the probability is decreased. The
Stochastic Fair Blue (SFB) algorithm is designed to protect
TCP flows against non-responsive flows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This SFB implementation
maintains 8 levels of 16 bins each for accounting. Each flow
is mapped into a bin of each level using a per-level hash
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every bin maintains a marking
probability, which gets increased or decreased based on bin
occupancy. If the number of packets exceeds the size of that
bin, the marking probabil&acirc; <br>
ity is increased. If the number drops to zero, it is
decreased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The marking probability is based
on the minimum value of all bins a flow is mapped into,
thus, when a flow does not respond to marking or gradual
packet drops, the marking proba&acirc; <br>
bility quickly reaches one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, the flow is
rate-limited to penalty_rate packets per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Due to SFBs nature, it is possible for responsive flows to
share all of its bins with a non-responsive flow, causing
the responsive flow to be misidentified as being
non-respon&acirc; <br>
sive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The probability of a responsive
flow to be misidentified is dependent on the number of
non-responsive flows, M. It is (1 - (1 - (1 / 16.0)) ** M)
**8, so for example with 10 non- <br>
responsive flows approximately 0.2% of responsive flows will
be misidentified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To mitigate this, SFB performs
performs periodic re-hashing to avoid misclassification for
prolonged periods of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default hashing method will
use source and destination ip addresses and port numbers if
possible, and also supports tunneling protocols.
Alternatively, an external classi&acirc; <br>
fier can be configured, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
rehash Time interval in milliseconds when queue perturbation
occurs to avoid erroneously detecting unrelated, responsive
flows as being part of a non-responsive flow for pro&acirc;
<br>
longed periods of time. Defaults to 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db Double buffering warmup wait
time, in milliseconds. To avoid destroying the probability
history when rehashing is performed, this implementation
maintains a second set of <br>
levels/bins as described in section 4.4 of the SFB
reference. While one set is used to manage the queue, a
second set is warmed up: Whenever a flow is then determined
to <br>
be non-responsive, the marking probabilities in the second
set are updated. When the rehashing happens, these bins will
be used to manage the queue and all non-responsive <br>
flows can be rate-limited immediately. This value determines
how much time has to pass before the 2nd set will start to
be warmed up. Defaults to one minute, should be <br>
lower than rehash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit Hard limit on the real
(not average) total queue size in packets. Further packets
are dropped. Defaults to the transmit queue length of the
device the qdisc is attached <br>
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max Maximum length of a buckets
queue, in packets, before packets start being dropped.
Should be sightly larger than target , but should not be set
to values exceeding 1.5 <br>
times that of target . Defaults to 25.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target The desired average bin
length. If the bin queue length reaches this value, the
marking probability is increased by increment. The default
value depends on the max set&acirc; <br>
ting, with max set to 25 target will default to 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">increment <br>
A value used to increase the marking probability when the
queue appears to be over-used. Must be between 0 and 1.0.
Defaults to 0.00050.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decrement <br>
Value used to decrease the marking probability when the
queue is found to be empty. Must be between 0 and 1.0.
Defaults to 0.00005.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">penalty_rate <br>
The maximum number of packets belonging to flows identified
as being non-responsive that can be enqueued per second.
Once this number has been reached, further packets of <br>
such non-responsive flows are dropped. Set this to a
reasonable fraction of your uplink throughput; the default
value of 10 packets is probably too small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">penalty_burst <br>
The number of packets a flow is permitted to exceed the
penalty rate before packets start being dropped. Defaults to
20 packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATISTICS <br>
This qdisc exposes additional statistics via &rsquo;tc -s
qdisc&rsquo; output. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">earlydrop <br>
The number of packets dropped before a per-flow queue was
full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ratedrop <br>
The number of packets dropped because of rate-limiting. If
this value is high, there are many non-reactive flows being
sent through sfb. In such cases, it might be better <br>
to embed sfb within a classful qdisc to better control such
flows using a different, shaping qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bucketdrop <br>
The number of packets dropped because a per-flow queue was
full. High bucketdrop may point to a high number of
aggressive, short-lived flows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">queuedrop <br>
The number of packets dropped due to reaching limit. This
should normally be 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">marked The number of packets
marked with ECN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxqlen <br>
The length of the current longest per-flow (virtual)
queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxprob <br>
The maximum per-flow drop probability. 1 means that some
flows have been detected as non-reactive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
SFB automatically enables use of Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN). Also, this SFB implementation does not
queue packets itself. Rather, packets are enqueued to the
inner <br>
qdisc (defaults to pfifo). Because sfb maintains virtual
queue states, the inner qdisc must not drop a packet
previously queued. Furthermore, if a buckets queue has a
very high <br>
marking rate, this implementation will start dropping
packets instead of marking them, as such a situation points
to either bad congestion, or an unresponsive flow.</p>

To attach to interface $DEV, using default options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tc qdisc add dev $DEV handle
1: root sfb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only use destination ip
addresses for assigning packets to bins, perturbing hash
results every 10 minutes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tc filter add dev $DEV parent
1: handle 1 flow hash keys dst perturb 600</p>
