<p>TRACEROUTE(8) Traceroute For Linux TRACEROUTE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
traceroute - print the route packets trace to network
host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
traceroute [-46dFITUnreAV] [-f first_ttl] [-g gate,...] <br>
[-i device] [-m max_ttl] [-p port] [-s src_addr] <br>
[-q nqueries] [-N squeries] [-t tos] <br>
[-l flow_label] [-w waittime] [-z sendwait] [-UL] [-D] <br>
[-P proto] [--sport=port] [-M method] [-O mod_options] <br>
[--mtu] [--back] <br>
host [packet_len] <br>
traceroute6 [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
traceroute tracks the route packets taken from an IP network
on their way to a given host. It utilizes the IP
protocol&rsquo;s time to live (TTL) field and attempts to
elicit an ICMP <br>
TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to
the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">traceroute6 is equivalent to
traceroute -6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only required parameter is
the name or IP address of the destination host . The
optional packet_len&lsquo;gth is the total size of the
probing packet (default 60 bytes for IPv4 <br>
and 80 for IPv6). The specified size can be ignored in some
situations or increased up to a minimal value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program attempts to trace
the route an IP packet would follow to some internet host by
launching probe packets with a small ttl (time to live) then
listening for an ICMP <br>
&quot;time exceeded&quot; reply from a gateway. We start our
probes with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an
ICMP &quot;port unreachable&quot; (or TCP reset), which
means we got to the <br>
&quot;host&quot;, or hit a max (which defaults to 30 hops).
Three probes (by default) are sent at each ttl setting and a
line is printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and
round <br>
trip time of each probe. The address can be followed by
additional information when requested. If the probe answers
come from different gateways, the address of each responding
<br>
system will be printed. If there is no response within a 5.0
seconds (default), an &quot;*&quot; (asterisk) is printed
for that probe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the trip time, some
additional annotation can be printed: !H, !N, or !P (host,
network or protocol unreachable), !S (source route failed),
!F (fragmentation needed), !X <br>
(communication administratively prohibited), !V (host
precedence violation), !C (precedence cutoff in effect), or
!&lt;num&gt; (ICMP unreachable code &lt;num&gt;). If almost
all the probes <br>
result in some kind of unreachable, traceroute will give up
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We don&rsquo;t want the
destination host to process the UDP probe packets, so the
destination port is set to an unlikely value (you can change
it with the -p flag). There is no such a <br>
problem for ICMP or TCP tracerouting (for TCP we use
half-open technique, which prevents our probes to be seen by
applications on the destination host).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the modern network
environment the traditional traceroute methods can not be
always applicable, because of widespread use of firewalls.
Such firewalls filter the &quot;unlikely&quot; <br>
UDP ports, or even ICMP echoes. To solve this, some
additional tracerouting methods are implemented (including
tcp), see LIST OF AVAILABLE METHODS below. Such methods try
to use <br>
particular protocol and source/destination port, in order to
bypass firewalls (to be seen by firewalls just as a start of
allowed type of a network session).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help Print help info and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, -6 Explicitly force IPv4 or
IPv6 tracerouting. By default, the program will try to
resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol
automatically. If resolving a <br>
host name returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, traceroute
will use IPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --icmp <br>
Use ICMP ECHO for probes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --tcp <br>
Use TCP SYN for probes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Enable socket level debugging (when the Linux kernel
supports it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --dont-fragment <br>
Do not fragment probe packets. (For IPv4 it also sets DF
bit, which tells intermediate routers not to fragment
remotely as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Varying the size of the probing
packet by the packet_len command line parameter, you can
manually obtain information about the MTU of individual
network hops. The --mtu <br>
option (see below) tries to do this automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that non-fragmented
features (like -F or --mtu) work properly since the Linux
kernel 2.6.22 only. Before that version, IPv6 was always
fragmented, IPv4 could use <br>
the once the discovered final mtu only (from the route
cache), which can be less than the actual mtu of a
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f first_ttl, --first=first_ttl
<br>
Specifies with what TTL to start. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g gateway, --gateway=gateway
<br>
Tells traceroute to add an IP source routing option to the
outgoing packet that tells the network to route the packet
through the specified gateway (most routers have dis&acirc;
<br>
abled source routing for security reasons). In general,
several gateway&rsquo;s is allowed (comma separated). For
IPv6, the form of num,addr,addr... is allowed, where num is
a <br>
route header type (default is type 2). Note the type 0 route
header is now deprecated (rfc5095).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface,
--interface=interface <br>
Specifies the interface through which traceroute should send
packets. By default, the interface is selected according to
the routing table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m max_ttl, --max-hops=max_ttl
<br>
Specifies the maximum number of hops (max time-to-live
value) traceroute will probe. The default is 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N squeries,
--sim-queries=squeries <br>
Specifies the number of probe packets sent out
simultaneously. Sending several probes concurrently can
speed up traceroute considerably. The default value is 16.
<br>
Note that some routers and hosts can use ICMP rate
throttling. In such a situation specifying too large number
can lead to loss of some responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not try to map IP
addresses to host names when displaying them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
For UDP tracing, specifies the destination port base
traceroute will use (the destination port number will be
incremented by each probe). <br>
For ICMP tracing, specifies the initial ICMP sequence value
(incremented by each probe too). <br>
For TCP and others specifies just the (constant) destination
port to connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tos, --tos=tos <br>
For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS) and Precedence
value. Useful values are 16 (low delay) and 8 (high
throughput). Note that in order to use some TOS precedence
val&acirc; <br>
ues, you have to be super user. <br>
For IPv6, set the Traffic Control value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l flow_label,
--flowlabel=flow_label <br>
Use specified flow_label for IPv6 packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w waittime, --wait=waittime
<br>
Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe
(default 5.0 sec).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q nqueries, --queries=nqueries
<br>
Sets the number of probe packets per hop. The default is
3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Bypass the normal routing
tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error
is returned. This option <br>
can be used to ping a local host through an interface that
has no route through it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s source_addr,
--source=source_addr <br>
Chooses an alternative source address. Note that you must
select the address of one of the interfaces. By default, the
address of the outgoing interface is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z sendwait, --sendwait=sendwait
<br>
Minimal time interval between probes (default 0). If the
value is more than 10, then it specifies a number in
milliseconds, else it is a number of seconds (float point
<br>
values allowed too). Useful when some routers use rate-limit
for ICMP messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --extensions <br>
Show ICMP extensions (rfc4884). The general form is
CLASS/TYPE: followed by a hexadecimal dump. The MPLS
(rfc4950) is shown parsed, in a form: <br>
MPLS:L=label,E=exp_use,S=stack_bottom,T=TTL (more objects
separated by / ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --as-path-lookups <br>
Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and print
results directly after the corresponding addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are additional options
intended for advanced usage (such as alternate trace methods
etc.):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sport=port <br>
Chooses the source port to use. Implies -N 1. Normally
source ports (if applicable) are chosen by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fwmark=mark <br>
Set the firewall mark for outgoing packets (since the Linux
kernel 2.6.25).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M method, --module=name <br>
Use specified method for traceroute operations. Default
traditional udp method has name default, icmp (-I) and tcp
(-T) have names icmp and tcp respectively. <br>
Method-specific options can be passed by -O . Most methods
have their simple shortcuts, (-I means -M icmp, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O option, --options=options
<br>
Specifies some method-specific option. Several options are
separated by comma (or use several -O on cmdline). Each
method may have its own specific options, or many not <br>
have them at all. To print information about available
options, use -O help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --udp <br>
Use UDP to particular destination port for tracerouting
(instead of increasing the port per each probe). Default
port is 53 (dns).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-UL Use UDPLITE for tracerouting
(default port is 53).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --dccp <br>
Use DCCP Requests for probes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P protocol, --protocol=protocol
<br>
Use raw packet of specified protocol for tracerouting.
Default protocol is 253 (rfc3692).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mtu Discover MTU along the
path being traced. Implies -F -N 1. New mtu is printed once
in a form of F=NUM at the first probe of a hop which
requires such mtu to be reached. <br>
(Actually, the correspond &quot;frag needed&quot; icmp
message normally is sent by the previous hop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that some routers might
cache once the seen information on a fragmentation. Thus you
can receive the final mtu from a closer hop. Try to specify
an unusual tos by <br>
-t , this can help for one attempt (then it can be cached
there as well). <br>
See -F option for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--back Print the number of
backward hops when it seems different with the forward
direction. This number is guessed in assumption that remote
hops send reply packets with initial <br>
ttl set to either 64, or 128 or 255 (which seems a common
practice). It is printed as a negate value in a form of
&rsquo;-NUM&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST OF AVAILABLE METHODS <br>
In general, a particular traceroute method may have to be
chosen by -M name, but most of the methods have their simple
cmdline switches (you can see them after the method name,
<br>
if present).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
The traditional, ancient method of tracerouting. Used by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Probe packets are udp datagrams
with so-called &quot;unlikely&quot; destination ports. The
&quot;unlikely&quot; port of the first probe is 33434, then
for each next probe it is incremented by one. <br>
Since the ports are expected to be unused, the destination
host normally returns &quot;icmp unreach port&quot; as a
final response. (Nobody knows what happens when some
application lis&acirc; <br>
tens for such ports, though).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is allowed for
unprivileged users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmp -I <br>
Most usual method for now, which uses icmp echo packets for
probes. <br>
If you can ping(8) the destination host, icmp tracerouting
is applicable as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method may be allowed for
unprivileged users since the kernel 3.0 (IPv4 only), which
supports new dgram icmp (or &quot;ping&quot;) sockets. To
allow such sockets, sysadmin should pro&acirc; <br>
vide net/ipv4/ping_group_range sysctl range to match any
group of the user. <br>
Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw Use only raw sockets (the
traditional way). <br>
This way is tried first by default (for compatibility
reasons), then new dgram icmp sockets as fallback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dgram Use only dgram icmp
sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp -T <br>
Well-known modern method, intended to bypass firewalls. <br>
Uses the constant destination port (default is 80,
http).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If some filters are present in
the network path, then most probably any
&quot;unlikely&quot; udp ports (as for default method) or
even icmp echoes (as for icmp) are filtered, and whole <br>
tracerouting will just stop at such a firewall. To bypass a
network filter, we have to use only allowed protocol/port
combinations. If we trace for some, say, mailserver, then
<br>
more likely -T -p 25 can reach it, even when -I can not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method uses well-known
&quot;half-open technique&quot;, which prevents applications
on the destination host from seeing our probes at all.
Normally, a tcp syn is sent. For non-lis&acirc; <br>
tened ports we receive tcp reset, and all is done. For
active listening ports we receive tcp syn+ack, but answer by
tcp reset (instead of expected tcp ack), this way the remote
<br>
tcp session is dropped even without the application ever
taking notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a couple of options for
tcp method:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syn,ack,fin,rst,psh,urg,ece,cwr
<br>
Sets specified tcp flags for probe packet, in any
combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flags=num <br>
Sets the flags field in the tcp header exactly to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ecn Send syn packet with tcp
flags ECE and CWR (for Explicit Congestion Notification,
rfc3168).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sack,timestamps,window_scaling
<br>
Use the corresponding tcp header option in the outgoing
probe packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysctl Use current sysctl
(/proc/sys/net/*) setting for the tcp header options above
and ecn. Always set by default, if nothing else
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mss=num <br>
Use value of num for maxseg tcp header option (when
syn).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info Print tcp flags of final
tcp replies when the target host is reached. Allows to
determine whether an application listens the port and other
useful things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default options is
syn,sysctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpconn <br>
An initial implementation of tcp method, simple using
connect(2) call, which does full tcp session opening. Not
recommended for normal use, because a destination
application is <br>
always affected (and can be confused).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">udp -U <br>
Use udp datagram with constant destination port (default 53,
dns). <br>
Intended to bypass firewall as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that unlike in tcp method,
the correspond application on the destination host always
receive our probes (with random data), and most can easily
be confused by them. Most <br>
cases it will not respond to our packets though, so we will
never see the final hop in the trace. (Fortunately, it seems
that at least dns servers replies with something angry).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is allowed for
unprivileged users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">udplite -UL <br>
Use udplite datagram for probes (with constant destination
port, default 53).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is allowed for
unprivileged users. <br>
Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">coverage=num <br>
Set udplite send coverage to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dccp -D <br>
Use DCCP Request packets for probes (rfc4340).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method uses the same
&quot;half-open technique&quot; as used for TCP. The default
destination port is 33434.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service=num <br>
Set DCCP service code to num (default is 1885957735).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw -P proto <br>
Send raw packet of protocol proto. <br>
No protocol-specific headers are used, just IP header only.
<br>
Implies -N 1. <br>
Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol=proto <br>
Use IP protocol proto (default 253).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
To speed up work, normally several probes are sent
simultaneously. On the other hand, it creates a &quot;storm
of packages&quot;, especially in the reply direction.
Routers can throttle <br>
the rate of icmp responses, and some of replies can be lost.
To avoid this, decrease the number of simultaneous probes,
or even set it to 1 (like in initial traceroute
implemen&acirc; <br>
tation), i.e. -N 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final (target) host can drop
some of the simultaneous probes, and might even answer only
the latest ones. It can lead to extra &quot;looks like
expired&quot; hops near the final hop. <br>
We use a smart algorithm to auto-detect such a situation,
but if it cannot help in your case, just use -N 1 too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For even greater stability you
can slow down the program&rsquo;s work by -z option, for
example use -z 0.5 for half-second pause between probes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If some hops report nothing for
every method, the last chance to obtain something is to use
ping -R command (IPv4, and for nearest 8 hops only).</p>
