<p>LVM(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual LVM(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lvm &acirc; LVM2 tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lvm [command|file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lvm provides the command-line tools for LVM2. A separate
manual page describes each command in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If lvm is invoked with no
arguments it presents a readline prompt (assuming it was
compiled with readline support). LVM commands may be entered
interactively at this prompt with <br>
readline facilities including history and command name and
option completion. Refer to readline(3) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If lvm is invoked with argv[0]
set to the name of a specific LVM command (for example by
using a hard or soft link) it acts as that command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On invocation, lvm requires that
only the standard file descriptors stdin, stdout and stderr
are available. If others are found, they get closed and
messages are issued warning <br>
about the leak. This warning can be suppressed by setting
the environment variable LVM_SUPPRESS_FD_WARNINGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where commands take VG or LV
names as arguments, the full path name is optional. An LV
called &quot;lvol0&quot; in a VG called &quot;vg0&quot; can
be specified as &quot;vg0/lvol0&quot;. Where a list of VGs
<br>
is required but is left empty, a list of all VGs will be
substituted. Where a list of LVs is required but a VG is
given, a list of all the LVs in that VG will be substituted.
<br>
So lvdisplay vg0 will display all the LVs in
&quot;vg0&quot;. Tags can also be used - see --addtag
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One advantage of using the
built-in shell is that configuration information gets cached
internally between commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file containing a simple
script with one command per line can also be given on the
command line. The script can also be executed directly if
the first line is #! followed by <br>
the absolute path of lvm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILT-IN COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are built into lvm without links
normally being created in the filesystem for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config The same as lvmconfig(8)
below. <br>
devtypes Display the recognised built-in block device types.
<br>
dumpconfig The same as lvmconfig(8) below. <br>
formats Display recognised metadata formats. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are not
implemented in LVM2 but might be in the future: lvmsadc,
lvmsar, pvdata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are available for many of the
commands. They are implemented generically and documented
here rather than repeated on individual manual pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional hyphens within option
names are ignored. For example, --readonly and --read-only
are both accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h|-?|--help <br>
Display the help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v|--verbose <br>
Set verbose level. Repeat from 1 to 3 times to increase the
detail of messages sent to stdout and stderr. Overrides
config file setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--debug <br>
Set debug level. Repeat from 1 to 6 times to increase the
detail of messages sent to the log file and/or syslog (if
configured). Overrides config file setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q|--quiet <br>
Suppress output and log messages. Overrides -d and -v.
Repeat once to also suppress any prompts with answer
&rsquo;no&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yes <br>
Don&rsquo;t prompt for confirmation interactively but
instead always assume the answer is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;. Take
great care if you use this!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t|--test <br>
Run in test mode. Commands will not update metadata. This is
implemented by disabling all metadata writing but
nevertheless returning success to the calling function. <br>
This may lead to unusual error messages in multi-stage
operations if a tool relies on reading back metadata it
believes has changed but hasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--driverloaded {y|n} <br>
Whether or not the device-mapper kernel driver is loaded. If
you set this to n, no attempt will be made to contact the
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A|--autobackup {y|n} <br>
Whether or not to metadata should be backed up automatically
after a change. You are strongly advised not to disable
this! See vgcfgbackup(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P|--partial <br>
When set, the tools will do their best to provide access to
Volume Groups that are only partially available (one or more
Physical Volumes belonging to the Volume Group are <br>
missing from the system). Where part of a logical volume is
missing, /dev/ioerror will be substituted, and you could use
dmsetup(8) to set this up to return I/O errors <br>
when accessed, or create it as a large block device of
nulls. Metadata may not be changed with this option. To
insert a replacement Physical Volume of the same or large
<br>
size use pvcreate -u to set the uuid to match the original
followed by vgcfgrestore(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S|--select Selection <br>
For reporting commands, display only rows that match
Selection criteria. All rows are displayed with the
additional &quot;selected&quot; column (-o selected) showing
1 if the row <br>
matches the Selection and 0 otherwise. For non-reporting
commands which process LVM entities, the selection can be
used to match items to process. See SELECTION CRITERIA <br>
section of this man page for more information about the way
the selection criteria are constructed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M|--metadatatype Type <br>
Specifies which type of on-disk metadata to use, such as
lvm1 or lvm2, which can be abbreviated to 1 or 2
respectively. The default (lvm2) can be changed by setting
for&acirc; <br>
mat in the global section of the config file
lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignorelockingfailure <br>
This lets you proceed with read-only metadata operations
such as lvchange -ay and vgchange -ay even if the locking
module fails. One use for this is in a system init <br>
script if the lock directory is mounted read-only when the
script runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignoreskippedcluster <br>
Use to avoid exiting with an non-zero status code if the
command is run without clustered locking and some clustered
Volume Groups have to be skipped over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--readonly <br>
Run the command in a special read-only mode which will read
on-disk metadata without needing to take any locks. This can
be used to peek inside metadata used by a virtual <br>
machine image while the virtual machine is running. It can
also be used to peek inside the metadata of clustered Volume
Groups when clustered locking is not configured or <br>
running. No attempt will be made to communicate with the
device-mapper kernel driver, so this option is unable to
report whether or not Logical Volumes are actually in <br>
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foreign <br>
Cause the command to access foreign VGs, that would
otherwise be skipped. It can be used to report or display a
VG that is owned by another host. This option can cause a
<br>
command to perform poorly because lvmetad caching is not
used and metadata is read from disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shared <br>
Cause the command to access shared VGs, that would otherwise
be skipped when lvmlockd is not being used. It can be used
to report or display a lockd VG without locking. <br>
Applicable only if LVM is compiled with lockd support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--addtag Tag <br>
Add the tag Tag to a PV, VG or LV. Supply this argument
multiple times to add more than one tag at once. A tag is a
word that can be used to group LVM2 objects of the <br>
same type together. Tags can be given on the command line in
place of PV, VG or LV arguments. Tags should be prefixed
with @ to avoid ambiguity. Each tag is expanded by <br>
replacing it with all objects possessing that tag which are
of the type expected by its position on the command line.
PVs can only possess tags while they are part of a <br>
Volume Group: PV tags are discarded if the PV is removed
from the VG. As an example, you could tag some LVs as
database and others as userdata and then activate the
data&acirc; <br>
base ones with lvchange -ay @database. Objects can possess
multiple tags simultaneously. Only the new LVM2 metadata
format supports tagging: objects using the LVM1 meta&acirc;
<br>
data format cannot be tagged because the on-disk format does
not support it. Characters allowed in tags are: A-Z a-z 0-9
_ + . - and as of version 2.02.78 the following <br>
characters are also accepted: / = ! : # &amp;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deltag Tag <br>
Delete the tag Tag from a PV, VG or LV, if it&rsquo;s
present. Supply this argument multiple times to remove more
than one tag at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alloc
{anywhere|contiguous|cling|inherit|normal} <br>
Selects the allocation policy when a command needs to
allocate Physical Extents from the Volume Group. Each Volume
Group and Logical Volume has an allocation policy <br>
defined. The default for a Volume Group is normal which
applies common-sense rules such as not placing parallel
stripes on the same Physical Volume. The default for a <br>
Logical Volume is inherit which applies the same policy as
for the Volume Group. These policies can be changed using
lvchange(8) and vgchange(8) or overridden on the com&acirc;
<br>
mand line of any command that performs allocation. The
contiguous policy requires that new Physical Extents be
placed adjacent to existing Physical Extents. The cling <br>
policy places new Physical Extents on the same Physical
Volume as existing Physical Extents in the same stripe of
the Logical Volume. If there are sufficient free
Physi&acirc; <br>
cal Extents to satisfy an allocation request but normal
doesn&rsquo;t use them, anywhere will - even if that reduces
performance by placing two stripes on the same Physical
Vol&acirc; <br>
ume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--commandprofile ProfileName
<br>
Selects the command configuration profile to use when
processing an LVM command. See also lvm.conf(5) for more
information about command profile config and the way it <br>
fits with other LVM configuration methods. Using
--commandprofile option overrides any command profile
specified via LVM_COMMAND_PROFILE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--metadataprofile ProfileName
<br>
Selects the metadata configuration profile to use when
processing an LVM command. When using metadata profile
during Volume Group or Logical Volume creation, the metadata
<br>
profile name is saved in metadata. When such Volume Group or
Logical Volume is processed next time, the metadata profile
is automatically applied and the use of --metadat&acirc;
<br>
aprofile option is not necessary. See also lvm.conf(5) for
more information about metadata profile config and the way
it fits with other LVM configuration methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--profile ProfileName <br>
A short form of --metadataprofile for vgcreate, lvcreate,
vgchange and lvchange command and a short form of
--commandprofile for any other command (with the exception
of <br>
lvmconfig command where the --profile has special meaning,
see lvmconfig(8) for more information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reportformat {basic|json} <br>
Overrides current output format for reports which is defined
globally by report/output_format configuration setting in
lvm.conf(5). The basic format is the original for&acirc;
<br>
mat with columns and rows and if there is more than one
report per command, each report is prefixed with
report&rsquo;s name for identification. The json stands for
report out&acirc; <br>
put in JSON format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config ConfigurationString
<br>
Uses the ConfigurationString as direct string representation
of the configuration to override the existing configuration.
The ConfigurationString is of exactly the same <br>
format as used in any LVM configuration file. See
lvm.conf(5) for more information about direct config
override on command line and the way it fits with other LVM
configu&acirc; <br>
ration methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALID NAMES <br>
The valid characters for VG and LV names are: a-z A-Z 0-9 +
_ . -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VG names cannot begin with a
hyphen. The name of a new LV also cannot begin with a
hyphen. However, if the configuration setting
metadata/record_lvs_history is enabled then an <br>
LV name with a hyphen as a prefix indicates that, although
the LV was removed, it is still being tracked because it
forms part of the history of at least one LV that is still
<br>
present. This helps to record the ancestry of thin snapshots
even after some links in the chain have been removed. A
reference to the historical LV &rsquo;lvol1&rsquo; in VG
&rsquo;vg00&rsquo; would <br>
be &rsquo;vg00/-lvol1&rsquo; or just &rsquo;-lvol1&rsquo; if
the VG is already set. (The latter form must be preceded by
&rsquo;--&rsquo; to terminate command line option processing
before reaching this argument.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also various reserved
names that are used internally by lvm that can not be used
as LV or VG names. A VG cannot be called anything that
exists in /dev/ at the time of <br>
creation, nor can it be called &rsquo;.&rsquo; or
&rsquo;..&rsquo;. An LV cannot be called &rsquo;.&rsquo;,
&rsquo;..&rsquo;, &rsquo;snapshot&rsquo; or
&rsquo;pvmove&rsquo;. The LV name may also not contain any
of the following strings: &rsquo;_cdata&rsquo;, <br>
&rsquo;_cmeta&rsquo;, &rsquo;_corig&rsquo;,
&rsquo;_mlog&rsquo;, &rsquo;_mimage&rsquo;,
&rsquo;_pmspare&rsquo;, &rsquo;_rimage&rsquo;,
&rsquo;_rmeta&rsquo;, &rsquo;_tdata&rsquo;,
&rsquo;_tmeta&rsquo; or &rsquo;_vorigin&rsquo;. A directory
bearing the name of each Volume Group is created under <br>
/dev when any of its Logical Volumes are activated. Each
active Logical Volume is accessible from this directory as a
symbolic link leading to a device node. Links or nodes in
<br>
/dev/mapper are intended only for internal use and the
precise format and escaping might change between releases
and distributions. Other software and scripts should use the
<br>
/dev/VolumeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName format to reduce the
chance of needing amendment when the software is updated.
Should you need to process the node names in /dev/mapper,
<br>
you may use dmsetup splitname to separate out the original
VG, LV and internal layer names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIQUE NAMES <br>
VG names should be unique. vgcreate will produce an error if
the specified VG name matches an existing VG name. However,
there are cases where different VGs with the same name <br>
can appear to LVM, e.g. after moving disks or changing
filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When VGs with the same name
exist, commands operating on all VGs will include all of the
VGs with the same name. If the ambiguous VG name is
specified on the command line, the <br>
command will produce an error. The error states that
multiple VGs exist with the specified name. To process one
of the VGs specifically, the --select option should be used
with <br>
the UUID of the intended VG: &rsquo;--select
vg_uuid=&lt;uuid&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exception is if all but one
of the VGs with the shared name is foreign (see
lvmsystemid(7).) In this case, the one VG that is not
foreign is assumed to be the intended VG and <br>
is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LV names are unique within a VG.
The name of an historical LV cannot be reused until the
historical LV has itself been removed or renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALLOCATION <br>
When an operation needs to allocate Physical Extents for one
or more Logical Volumes, the tools proceed as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First of all, they generate the
complete set of unallocated Physical Extents in the Volume
Group. If any ranges of Physical Extents are supplied at the
end of the command line, <br>
only unallocated Physical Extents within those ranges on the
specified Physical Volumes are considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then they try each allocation
policy in turn, starting with the strictest policy
(contiguous) and ending with the allocation policy specified
using --alloc or set as the default <br>
for the particular Logical Volume or Volume Group concerned.
For each policy, working from the lowest-numbered Logical
Extent of the empty Logical Volume space that needs to be
<br>
filled, they allocate as much space as possible according to
the restrictions imposed by the policy. If more space is
needed, they move on to the next policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restrictions are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contiguous requires that the
physical location of any Logical Extent that is not the
first Logical Extent of a Logical Volume is adjacent to the
physical location of the Logical <br>
Extent immediately preceding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cling requires that the Physical
Volume used for any Logical Extent to be added to an
existing Logical Volume is already in use by at least one
Logical Extent earlier in that <br>
Logical Volume. If the configuration parameter
allocation/cling_tag_list is defined, then two Physical
Volumes are considered to match if any of the listed tags is
present on <br>
both Physical Volumes. This allows groups of Physical
Volumes with similar properties (such as their physical
location) to be tagged and treated as equivalent for
allocation <br>
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a Logical Volume is striped
or mirrored, the above restrictions are applied
independently to each stripe or mirror image (leg) that
needs space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal will not choose a
Physical Extent that shares the same Physical Volume as a
Logical Extent already allocated to a parallel Logical
Volume (i.e. a different stripe or mir&acirc; <br>
ror image/leg) at the same offset within that parallel
Logical Volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When allocating a mirror log at
the same time as Logical Volumes to hold the mirror data,
Normal will first try to select different Physical Volumes
for the log and the data. If <br>
that&rsquo;s not possible and the
allocation/mirror_logs_require_separate_pvs configuration
parameter is set to 0, it will then allow the log to share
Physical Volume(s) with part of <br>
the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When allocating thin pool
metadata, similar considerations to those of a mirror log in
the last paragraph apply based on the value of the
allocation/thin_pool_meta&acirc; <br>
data_require_separate_pvs configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you rely upon any layout
behaviour beyond that documented here, be aware that it
might change in future versions of the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you supply on
the command line two empty Physical Volumes that have an
identical number of free Physical Extents available for
allocation, the current code con&acirc; <br>
siders using each of them in the order they are listed, but
there is no guarantee that future releases will maintain
that property. If it is important to obtain a specific
lay&acirc; <br>
out for a particular Logical Volume, then you should build
it up through a sequence of lvcreate(8) and lvconvert(8)
steps such that the restrictions described above applied to
<br>
each step leave the tools no discretion over the layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view the way the allocation
process currently works in any specific case, read the debug
logging output, for example by adding -vvvv to a
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGICAL VOLUME TYPES <br>
Some logical volume types are simple to create and can be
done with a single lvcreate(8) command. The linear and
striped logical volume types are an example of this. Other
log&acirc; <br>
ical volume types may require more than one command to
create. The cache (lvmcache(7)) and thin provisioning
(lvmthin(7)) types are examples of this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTION CRITERIA <br>
The selection criteria are a set of statements combined by
logical and grouping operators. The statement consists of
column name for which a set of valid values is defined using
<br>
comparison operators. For complete list of column names
(fields) that can be used in selection, see the output of
&lt;lvm reporting command&gt; -S help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparison operators (cmp_op)
<br>
=~ Matching regular expression. <br>
!~ Not matching regular expression. <br>
= Equal to. <br>
!= Not equal to. <br>
&gt;= Greater than or equal to. <br>
&gt; Greater than <br>
&lt;= Less than or equal to. <br>
&lt; Less than.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary logical operators
(cmp_log) <br>
&amp;&amp; All fields must match <br>
, All fields must match <br>
|| At least one field must match <br>
# At least one field must match</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unary logical operators <br>
! Logical negation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grouping operators <br>
( Left parenthesis <br>
) Right parenthesis <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Informal grammar specification
<br>
STATEMENT = column cmp_op VALUE | STATEMENT log_op STATEMENT
| (STATEMENT) | !(STATEMENT)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALUE = [VALUE log_op VALUE]
<br>
For list-based types: string list. Matches strictly. The
log_op must always be of one type within the whole list
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALUE = {VALUE log_op VALUE}
<br>
For list-based types: string list. Matches a subset. The
log_op must always be of one type within the whole list
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALUE = value <br>
For scalar types: number (integer), size (floating point
number with size unit suffix), percent (floating point
number with or without % suffix), string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All tools return a status code of zero on success or
non-zero on failure. The non-zero codes distinguish only
between the broad categories of unrecognised commands,
problems <br>
processing the command line arguments and any other
failures. As LVM remains under active development, the code
used in a specific case occasionally changes between
releases. <br>
Message text may also change.</p>
