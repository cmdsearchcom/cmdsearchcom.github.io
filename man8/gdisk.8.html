<p>GDISK(8) GPT fdisk Manual GDISK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gdisk - Interactive GUID partition table (GPT)
manipulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gdisk [ -l ] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GPT fdisk (aka gdisk) is a text-mode menu-driven program for
creation and manipulation of partition tables. It will
automatically convert an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR)
<br>
partition table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR
carrier partition to the newer Globally Unique Identifier
(GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID
parti&acirc; <br>
tion table. When used with the -l command-line option, the
program displays the current partition table and then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPT fdisk operates mainly on the
GPT headers and partition tables; however, it can and will
generate a fresh protective MBR, when required. (Any boot
loader code in the protec&acirc; <br>
tive MBR will not be disturbed.) If you&rsquo;ve created an
unusual protective MBR, such as a hybrid MBR created by
gptsync or gdisk&rsquo;s own hybrid MBR creation feature,
this should not <br>
be disturbed by most ordinary actions. Some advanced data
recovery options require you to understand the distinctions
between the main and backup data, as well as between the GPT
<br>
headers and the partition tables. For information on MBR vs.
GPT, as well as GPT terminology and structure, see the
extended gdisk documentation at http://www.rods&acirc; <br>
books.com/gdisk/ or consult Wikipedia.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gdisk program employs a user
interface similar to that of Linux&rsquo;s fdisk, but gdisk
modifies GPT partitions. It also has the capability of
transforming MBR partitions or BSD <br>
disklabels into GPT partitions. Like the original fdisk
program, gdisk does not modify disk structures until you
explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a mistake, you
can <br>
exit from the program with the &rsquo;q&rsquo; option to
leave your partitions unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, gdisk operates on
disk device files, such as /dev/sda or /dev/hda under Linux,
/dev/disk0 under Mac OS X, or /dev/ad0 or /dev/da0 under
FreeBSD. The program can also <br>
operate on disk image files, which can be either copies of
whole disks (made with dd, for instance) or raw disk images
used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that only
<br>
raw disk images are supported; gdisk cannot work on
compressed or other advanced disk image formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MBR partitioning system uses
a combination of cylinder/head/sector (CHS) addressing and
logical block addressing (LBA). The former is klunky and
limiting. GPT drops CHS <br>
addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode exclusively. Thus, GPT
data structures, and therefore gdisk, do not need to deal
with CHS geometries and all the problems they create. Users
<br>
of fdisk will note that gdisk lacks the options and
limitations associated with CHS geometries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, you should use
an OS-specific partition table program whenever possible.
For example, you should make Mac OS X partitions with the
Mac OS X Disk Utility program <br>
and Linux partitions with the Linux gdisk or GNU Parted
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon start, gdisk attempts to
identify the partition type in use on the disk. If it finds
valid GPT data, gdisk will use it. If gdisk finds a valid
MBR or BSD disklabel but no <br>
GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR or disklabel
into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have unusable
first and/or final partitions because they overlap with the
<br>
GPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can identify, but
not use data in, Apple Partition Map (APM) disks, which are
used on 680x0- and PowerPC-based Macintoshes. Upon exiting
<br>
with the &rsquo;w&rsquo; option, gdisk replaces the MBR or
disklabel with a GPT. This action is potentially dangerous!
Your system may become unbootable, and partition type codes
may become <br>
corrupted if the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot
problems are particularly likely if you&rsquo;re
multi-booting with any GPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly
launch gdisk on an <br>
MBR disk, you can safely exit the program without making any
changes by using the &rsquo;q&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MBR-to-GPT conversion will
leave at least one gap in the partition numbering if the
original MBR used logical partitions. These gaps are
harmless, but you can eliminate them <br>
by using the &rsquo;s&rsquo; option, if you like. (Doing
this may require you to update your /etc/fstab file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating a fresh partition
table, certain considerations may be in order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For data (non-boot) disks, and
for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the
boot loader, partitions may be created in whatever order and
in whatever sizes <br>
are desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Boot disks for EFI-based
systems require an EFI System Partition (gdisk internal code
0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32. The recommended size of this
partition is between 100 <br>
and 300 MiB. Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that
GNU Parted identifies such partitions as having the
&quot;boot flag&quot; set.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some boot loaders for
BIOS-based systems make use of a BIOS Boot Partition (gdisk
internal code 0xEF02), in which the secondary boot loader is
stored, possibly without the <br>
benefit of a filesystem. (GRUB2 may optionally use such a
partition.) This partition can typically be quite small
(roughly 32 to 200 KiB), but you should consult your boot
<br>
loader documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If Windows is to boot from a
GPT disk, a partition of type Microsoft Reserved (gdisk
internal code 0x0C01) is recommended. This partition should
be about 128 MiB in size. <br>
It ordinarily follows the EFI System Partition and
immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that
old versions of GNU Parted create all FAT partitions as <br>
this type, which actually makes the partition unusable for
normal file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some OSes&rsquo; GPT utilities
create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after each
partition. The intent is to enable future disk utilities to
use this space. Such free space <br>
is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help in
future disk maintenance. You can use GPT fdisk&rsquo;s
relative partition positioning option (specifying the
starting <br>
sector as &rsquo;+128M&rsquo;, for instance) to simplify
creating such gaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l List the partition tables for the specified devices and
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most interactions with gdisk
occur with its interactive text-mode menus. Three menus
exist: the main menu, the recovery &amp; transformation
menu, and the experts&rsquo; menu. The main <br>
menu provides the functions that are most likely to be
useful for typical partitioning tasks, such as creating and
deleting partitions, changing partition type codes, and so
on. <br>
Specific functions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Save partition data to a
backup file. You can back up your current in-memory
partition table to a disk file using this option. The
resulting file is a binary file consist&acirc; <br>
ing of the protective MBR, the main GPT header, the backup
GPT header, and one copy of the partition table, in that
order. Note that the backup is of the current in-memory <br>
data structures, so if you launch the program, make changes,
and then use this option, the backup will reflect your
changes. Note also that the restore option is on the <br>
recovery &amp; transformation menu; the backup option is on
the main menu to encourage its use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Change the GPT name of a
partition. This name is encoded as a UTF-16 string, but
proper entry and display of anything beyond basic ASCII
values requires suitable locale <br>
and font support. For the most part, Linux ignores the
partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. GPT
fdisk sets a default name based on the partition type <br>
code. Note that the GPT partition name is different from the
filesystem name, which is encoded in the filesystem&rsquo;s
data structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Delete a partition. This
action deletes the entry from the partition table but does
not disturb the data within the sectors originally allocated
to the partition on the <br>
disk. If a corresponding hybrid MBR partition exists, gdisk
deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent 0xEE (EFI GPT)
MBR protective partition to fill the new free <br>
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Show detailed partition
information. The summary information produced by the
&rsquo;p&rsquo; command necessarily omits many details, such
as the partition&rsquo;s unique GUID and the trans&acirc;
<br>
lation of gdisk&rsquo;s internal partition type code to a
plain type name. The &rsquo;i&rsquo; option displays this
information for a single partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Display a summary of partition
types. GPT uses a GUID to identify partition types for
particular OSes and purposes. For ease of data entry, gdisk
compresses these into <br>
two-byte (four-digit hexadecimal) values that are related to
their equivalent MBR codes. Specifically, the MBR code is
multiplied by hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the <br>
code for Linux swap space in MBR is 0x82, and it&rsquo;s
0x8200 in gdisk. A one-to-one correspondence is impossible,
though. Most notably, the codes for all varieties of FAT and
<br>
NTFS partition correspond to a single GPT code (entered as
0x0700 in sgdisk). Some OSes use a single MBR code but
employ many more codes in GPT. For these, gdisk adds code
<br>
numbers sequentially, such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD
disklabel, 0xa501 for FreeBSD boot, 0xa502 for FreeBSD swap,
and so on. Note that these two-byte codes are unique to <br>
gdisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Create a new partition. This
command is modelled after the equivalent fdisk option,
although some differences exist. You enter a partition
number, starting sector, and an <br>
ending sector. Both start and end sectors can be specified
in absolute terms as sector numbers or as positions measured
in kibibytes (K), mebibytes (M), gibibytes (G), <br>
tebibytes (T), or pebibytes (P); for instance, 40M specifies
a position 40MiB from the start of the disk. You can specify
locations relative to the start or end of the <br>
specified default range by preceding the number by a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo; symbol, as in +2G to
specify a point 2GiB after the default start sector, or
-200M to specify a point <br>
200MiB before the last available sector. Pressing the Enter
key with no input specifies the default value, which is the
start of the largest available block for the start <br>
sector and the end of the same block for the end sector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Clear out all partition data.
This includes GPT header data, all partition definitions,
and the protective MBR. The sector alignment is reset to the
default (2048 sectors, <br>
or 1MB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Display basic partition
summary data. This includes partition numbers, starting and
ending sector numbers, partition sizes, gdisk&rsquo;s
partition types codes, and partition <br>
names. For additional information, use the &rsquo;i&rsquo;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit from the program without
saving your changes. Use this option if you just wanted to
view information or if you make a mistake and want to back
out of all your <br>
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Enter the recovery &amp;
transformation menu. This menu includes emergency recovery
options (to fix damaged GPT data structures) and options to
transform to or from other par&acirc; <br>
titioning systems, including creating hybrid MBRs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Sort partition entries. GPT
partition numbers need not match the order of partitions on
the disk. If you want them to match, you can use this
option. Note that some par&acirc; <br>
titioning utilities sort partitions whenever they make
changes. Such changes will be reflected in your device
filenames, so you may need to edit /etc/fstab if you use
this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Change a single
partition&rsquo;s type code. You enter the type code using a
two-byte hexadecimal number, as described earlier. You may
also enter a GUID directly, if you have <br>
one and gdisk doesn&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Verify disk. This option
checks for a variety of problems, such as incorrect CRCs and
mismatched main and backup data. This option does not
automatically correct most <br>
problems, though; for that, you must use options on the
recovery &amp; transformation menu. If no problems are
found, this command displays a summary of unallocated disk
<br>
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Write data. Use this command
to save your changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Enter the experts&rsquo; menu.
Using this option provides access to features you can use to
get into even more trouble than the main menu allows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Print the menu. Type this
command (or any other unrecognized command) to see a summary
of available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second gdisk menu is the
recovery &amp; transformation menu, which provides access to
data recovery options and features related to the
transformation of partitions between par&acirc; <br>
titioning schemes (converting BSD disklabels into GPT
partitions or creating hybrid MBRs, for instance). A few
options on this menu duplicate functionality on the main
menu, for <br>
the sake of convenience. The options on this menu are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Rebuild GPT header from
backup. You can use the backup GPT header to rebuild the
main GPT header with this option. It&rsquo;s likely to be
useful if your main GPT header was <br>
damaged or destroyed (say, by sloppy use of dd).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Load backup partition table.
Ordinarily, gdisk uses only the main partition table
(although the backup&rsquo;s integrity is checked when you
launch the program). If the main <br>
partition table has been damaged, you can use this option to
load the backup from disk and use it instead. Note that this
will almost certainly produce no or strange par&acirc; <br>
tition entries if you&rsquo;ve just converted an MBR disk to
GPT format, since there will be no backup partition table on
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Use main GPT header and
rebuild the backup. This option is likely to be useful if
the backup GPT header has been damaged or destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Load main partition table.
This option reloads the main partition table from disk.
It&rsquo;s only likely to be useful if you&rsquo;ve tried to
use the backup partition table (via <br>
&rsquo;c&rsquo;) but it&rsquo;s in worse shape then the main
partition table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Load MBR and build fresh GPT
from it. Use this option if your GPT is corrupt or conflicts
with the MBR and you want to use the MBR as the basis for a
new set of GPT parti&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Convert GPT into MBR and exit.
This option converts as many partitions as possible into MBR
form, destroys the GPT data structures, saves the new MBR,
and exits. Use this <br>
option if you&rsquo;ve tried GPT and find that MBR works
better for you. Note that this function generates up to four
primary MBR partitions or three primary partitions and as
<br>
many logical partitions as can be generated. Each logical
partition requires at least one unallocated block
immediately before its first block. Therefore, it may be
possi&acirc; <br>
ble to convert a maximum of four partitions on disks with
tightly-packed partitions; however, if free space was
inserted between partitions when they were created, and if
<br>
the disk is under 2 TiB in size, it should be possible to
convert all the partitions to MBR form. See also the
&rsquo;h&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Create a hybrid MBR. This is
an ugly workaround that enables GPT-unaware OSes, or those
that can&rsquo;t boot from a GPT disk, to access up to three
of the partitions on the <br>
disk by creating MBR entries for them. Note that these
hybrid MBR entries can easily go out of sync with the GPT
entries, particularly when hybrid-unaware GPT utilities <br>
are used to edit the disk. Thus, you may need to recreate
the hybrid MBR if you use such tools. Unlike the
&rsquo;g&rsquo; option, this option does not support
converting any parti&acirc; <br>
tions into MBR logical partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Show detailed partition
information. This option is identical to the &rsquo;i&rsquo;
option on the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Load partition data from a
backup file. This option is the reverse of the
&rsquo;b&rsquo; option on the main menu. Note that restoring
partition data from anything but the original <br>
disk is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Return to the main menu. This
option enables you to enter main-menu commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Print protective MBR data. You
can see a summary of the protective MBR&rsquo;s partitions
with this option. This may enable you to spot glaring
problems or help identify the <br>
partitions in a hybrid MBR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Print the partition table.
This option is identical to the &rsquo;p&rsquo; option in
the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit without saving changes.
This option is identical to the &rsquo;q&rsquo; option in
the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Transform BSD partitions into
GPT partitions. This option works on BSD disklabels held
within GPT (or converted MBR) partitions. Converted
partitions&rsquo; type codes are <br>
likely to need manual adjustment. gdisk will attempt to
convert BSD disklabels stored on the main disk when
launched, but this conversion is likely to produce first
and/or <br>
last partitions that are unusable. The many BSD variants
means that the probability of gdisk being unable to convert
a BSD disklabel is high compared to the likelihood of <br>
problems with an MBR conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Verify disk. This option is
identical to the &rsquo;v&rsquo; option in the main
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Write table to disk and exit.
This option is identical to the &rsquo;w&rsquo; option in
the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Enter the experts&rsquo; menu.
This option is identical to the &rsquo;x&rsquo; option in
the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Print the menu. This option
(or any unrecognized entry) displays a summary of the menu
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third gdisk menu is the
experts&rsquo; menu. This menu provides advanced options
that aren&rsquo;t closely related to recovery or
transformation between partitioning systems. Its options
<br>
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Set attributes. GPT provides a
64-bit attributes field that can be used to set features for
each partition. gdisk supports four attributes: system
partition, read-only, <br>
hidden, and do not automount. You can set other attributes,
but their numbers aren&rsquo;t translated into anything
useful. In practice, most OSes seem to ignore these <br>
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Change partition GUID. You can
enter a custom unique GUID for a partition using this
option. (Note this refers to the GUID that uniquely
identifies a partition, not to its <br>
type code, which you can change with the &rsquo;t&rsquo;
main-menu option.) Ordinarily, gdisk assigns this number
randomly; however, you might want to adjust the number
manually if <br>
you&rsquo;ve wound up with the same GUID on two partitions
because of buggy GUID assignments (hopefully not in gdisk)
or sheer incredible coincidence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Display the sector alignment
value. See the description of the &rsquo;l&rsquo; option for
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Move backup GPT data
structures to the end of the disk. Use this command if
you&rsquo;ve added disks to a RAID array, thus creating a
virtual disk with space that follows the <br>
backup GPT data structures. This command moves the backup
GPT data structures to the end of the disk, where they
belong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Randomize the disk&rsquo;s
GUID and all partitions&rsquo; unique GUIDs (but not their
partition type code GUIDs). This function may be used after
cloning a disk with another utility <br>
in order to render all GUIDs once again unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Change disk GUID. Each disk
has a unique GUID code, which gdisk assigns randomly upon
creation of the GPT data structures. You can generate a
fresh random GUID or enter <br>
one manually with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Recompute CHS values in
protective or hybrid MBR. This option can sometimes help if
a disk utility, OS, or BIOS doesn&rsquo;t like the CHS
values used by the partitions in the <br>
protective or hybrid MBR. In particular, the GPT
specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for over-8GiB
partitions, but this value is technically illegal by the
<br>
usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they encounter this
value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS value --
0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, enabling these <br>
BIOSes to boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Show detailed partition
information. This option is identical to the &rsquo;i&rsquo;
option on the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Change the sector alignment
value. Disks with more logical sectors per physical sectors
(such as modern Advanced Format drives), some RAID
configurations, and many SSD <br>
devices, can suffer performance problems if partitions are
not aligned properly for their internal data structures. On
new disks, GPT fdisk attempts to align partitions on <br>
2048-sector (1MiB) boundaries by default, which optimizes
performance for all of these disk types. On pre-partitioned
disks, GPT fdisk attempts to identify the alignment <br>
value used on that disk, but will set 8-sector alignment on
disks larger than 300 GB even if lesser alignment values are
detected. In either case, it can be changed by <br>
using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Return to the main menu. This
option enables you to enter main-menu commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Create a new protective MBR.
Use this option if the current protective MBR is damaged in
a way that gdisk doesn&rsquo;t automatically detect and
correct, or if you want to con&acirc; <br>
vert a hybrid MBR into a &quot;pure&quot; GPT with a
conventional protective MBR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Print protective MBR data. You
can see a summary of the protective MBR&rsquo;s partitions
with this option. This may enable you to spot glaring
problems or help identify the <br>
partitions in a hybrid MBR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Print the partition table.
This option is identical to the &rsquo;p&rsquo; option in
the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit without saving changes.
This option is identical to the &rsquo;q&rsquo; option in
the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Enter the recovery &amp;
transformations menu. This option is identical to the
&rsquo;r&rsquo; option on the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Resize partition table. The
default partition table size is 128 entries. Officially,
sizes of less than 16KB (128 entries, given the normal entry
size) are unsupported by <br>
the GPT specification; however, in practice they seem to
work, and can sometimes be useful in converting MBR disks.
Larger sizes also work fine. OSes may impose their own <br>
limits on the number of partitions, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Swap two partitions&rsquo;
entries in the partition table. One partition may be empty.
For instance, if partitions 1-4 are defined, transposing 1
and 5 results in a table with <br>
partitions numbered from 2-5. Transposing partitions in this
way has no effect on their disk space allocation; it only
alters their order in the partition table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Replicate the current
device&rsquo;s partition table on another device. You will
be prompted to type the new device&rsquo;s filename. After
the write operation completes, you can con&acirc; <br>
tinue editing the original device&rsquo;s partition table.
Note that the replicated partition table is an exact copy,
including all GUIDs; if the device should have its own <br>
unique GUIDs, you should use the f option on the new
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Verify disk. This option is
identical to the &rsquo;v&rsquo; option in the main
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z Zap (destroy) the GPT data
structures and exit. Use this option if you want to
repartition a GPT disk using fdisk or some other GPT-unaware
program. You&rsquo;ll be given the <br>
choice of preserving the existing MBR, in case it&rsquo;s a
hybrid MBR with salvageable partitions or if you&rsquo;ve
already created new MBR partitions and want to erase the
remnants <br>
of your GPT partitions. If you&rsquo;ve already created new
MBR partitions, it&rsquo;s conceivable that this option will
damage the first and/or last MBR partitions! Such an event
is <br>
unlikely, but could occur if your new MBR partitions overlap
the old GPT data structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Print the menu. This option
(or any unrecognized entry) displays a summary of the menu
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many cases, you can press the
Enter key to select a default option when entering data.
When only one option is possible, gdisk usually bypasses the
prompt entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As of January 2013 (version 0.8.6), gdisk should be
considered beta software. Known bugs and limitations
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program compiles correctly
only on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows. Linux
versions for x86-64 (64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC
(32-bit) have been tested, <br>
with the x86-64 version having seen the most testing. Under
FreeBSD, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions have been
tested. Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X and Win&acirc;
<br>
dows have been tested by the author, although I&rsquo;ve
heard of 64-bit versions being successfully compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The FreeBSD version of the
program can&rsquo;t write changes to the partition table to
a disk when existing partitions on that disk are mounted.
(The same problem exists with <br>
many other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.)
This limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The fields used to display the
start and end sector numbers for partitions in the
&rsquo;p&rsquo; command are 14 characters wide. This
translates to a limitation of about 45 PiB. On <br>
larger disks, the displayed columns will go out of
alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* In the Windows version, only
ASCII characters are supported in the partition name field.
If an existing partition uses non-ASCII UTF-16 characters,
they&rsquo;re likely to be <br>
corrupted in the &rsquo;i&rsquo; and &rsquo;p&rsquo; menu
options&rsquo; displays; however, they should be preserved
when loading and saving partitions. Binaries for Linux,
FreeBSD, and OS X support <br>
full UTF-16 partition names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program can load only up
to 128 partitions (4 primary partitions and 124 logical
partitions) when converting from MBR format. This limit can
be raised by changing the <br>
#define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in the basicmbr.h source code
file and recompiling; however, such a change will require
using a larger-than-normal partition table. (The limit <br>
of 128 partitions was chosen because that number equals the
128 partitions supported by the most common partition table
size.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Converting from MBR format
sometimes fails because of insufficient space at the start
or (more commonly) the end of the disk. Resizing the
partition table (using the &rsquo;s&rsquo; <br>
option in the experts&rsquo; menu) can sometimes overcome
this problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary
to resize a partition using GNU Parted or a similar tool
<br>
prior to conversion with gdisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* MBR conversions work only if
the disk has correct LBA partition descriptors. These
descriptors should be present on any disk over 8 GiB in size
or on smaller disks parti&acirc; <br>
tioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* BSD disklabel support can
create first and/or last partitions that overlap with the
GPT data structures. This can sometimes be compensated by
adjusting the partition table <br>
size, but in extreme cases the affected partition(s) may
need to be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Because of the highly variable
nature of BSD disklabel structures, conversions from this
form may be unreliable -- partitions may be dropped,
converted in a way that cre&acirc; <br>
ates overlaps with other partitions, or converted with
incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with
caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Booting after converting an
MBR or BSD disklabel disk is likely to be disrupted.
Sometimes re-installing a boot loader will fix the problem,
but other times you may need <br>
to switch boot loaders. Except on EFI-based platforms,
Windows through at least Windows 7 doesn&rsquo;t support
booting from GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the
&rsquo;h&rsquo; <br>
option on the recovery &amp; transformation menu) or
abandoning GPT in favor of MBR may be your only options in
this case.</p>
