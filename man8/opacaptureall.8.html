<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
opacaptureall</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Chassis and Host) Captures
supporting information for a problem report from all hosts
or Intel(R) Omni-Path Chassis and uploads to this
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Hosts : When a host
opacaptureall is performed, opacapture is run to create the
specified capture file within ~root on each host (with the
.tgz suffix added as needed). The <br>
files are uploaded and unpacked into a matching directory
name within upload_dir/hostname/ on the local system. The
default file name is hostcapture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Chassis: When a chassis
opacaptureall is performed, opacapture is run on each
chassis and its output is saved to
upload_dir/chassisname/file on the local system. The default
<br>
file name is chassiscapture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For both host and chassis
capture, the uploaded captures are combined into a .tgz file
with the file name specified and the suffix .all.tgz
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax <br>
opacaptureall [-C] [-p] [-f hostfile] [-F chassisfile] <br>
[-h &rsquo;hosts&rsquo;] <br>
[-H &rsquo;chassis&rsquo;] [-t portsfile] [-d upload_dir]
[-S] [-D detail_level] [ file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
--help Produces full help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Performs capture against
chassis. Default is hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Performs capture upload in
parallel on all host/chassis. For a host capture, this only
affects the upload phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f hostfile <br>
File with hosts in cluster. Default is
/etc/sysconfig/opa/hosts file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F chassisfile <br>
File containing a list of chassis in the cluster. Default is
/etc/sysconfig/opa/chassis file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hosts List of hosts on which
to perform a capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H chassis <br>
List of chassis on which to perform a capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t portsfile <br>
File with list of local HFI ports used to access fabric(s)
for switch access, default is /etc/sysconfig/opa/ports
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d upload_dir <br>
Directory to upload to, default is uploads. If not
specified, the environment variable UPLOADS_DIR is used. If
that is not exported, the default (./uploads) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Securely prompts for password
for administrator on a chassis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D detail_level <br>
Level of detail of the capture passed to host opacapture.
(Only used for host captures; ignored for chassis
captures.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Local. Obtains local
information from each host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Fabric. In addition to Local,
also obtains basic fabric information by queries to the SM
and fabric error analysis using opareport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Fabric+FDB. In addition to
Fabric, also obtains the Forwarding Database (FDB), which
includes the switch forwarding tables from the SM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Analysis. In addition to
Fabric+FDB, also obtains opaallanalysis results. If
opaallanalysis has not yet been run, it is run as part of
the capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Detail levels 2-4 can be
used when fabric operational problems occur. If the problem
is node-specific, detail level 1 should be sufficient.
Detail levels 2-4 require an <br>
operational Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Suite Fabric Manager.
Typically your support representative requests a given
detail level. If a given detail level takes excessively long
or <br>
fails to be gathered, try a lower detail level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For detail levels 2-4, the
additional information is only gathered on the node running
the opacaptureall command. The information is gathered for
every fabric specified in the <br>
/etc/sysconfig/opa/ports file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file Name for capture file. The
suffix .tgz is appended if it is not specified in the
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples Host Capture Examples
<br>
opacaptureall <br>
# Creates a hostcapture directory in upload_dir/hostname/
for each host in <br>
/etc/sysconfig/opa/hosts file, then creates
hostcapture.all.tgz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opacaptureall mycapture <br>
# Creates a mycapture directory in upload_dir/hostname/ for
each host in <br>
/etc/sysconfig/opa/hosts file, then creates
mycapture.all.tgz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opacaptureall -h #8217#180;arwen
elrond&Acirc;&acute; 030127capture <br>
# Gets the list of hosts from arwen elrond file and creates
030127cap#8217#8208; <br>
ture.tgz file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chassis Capture Examples <br>
opacaptureall -C <br>

for each chassis <br>
in /etc/sysconfig/opa/chassis file, then creates
chassiscapture.all.tgz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opacaptureall -C mycapture <br>
# Creates a mycapture.tgz file in upload_dir/chassisname/
for each chassis <br>
in /etc/sysconfig/opa/chassis file, then creates
mycapture.all.tgz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opacaptureall -C -H
#8217#180;chassis1 chassis2&Acirc;&acute; 030127capture <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment Variables <br>
The following environment variables are also used by this
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTS List of hosts, used if -h
option not supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHASSIS List of chassis, used if
-C is used and -h option is not supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTS_FILE <br>
File containing a list of hosts, used in the absence of -f
and -h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHASSIS_FILE <br>
File containing a list of chassis, used in the absence of -F
and -H.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPLOADS_DIR <br>
Directory to upload to, used in the absence of -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF_MAX_PARALLEL <br>
When -p option is used, maximum concurrent operations are
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF_CHASSIS_LOGIN_METHOD <br>
How to log into chassis. Can be Telnet or SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF_CHASSIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD <br>
Password for administrator on all chassis. Used in absence
of -S option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More Information <br>
When performing opacaptureall against hosts, internally SSH
is used. The command opacaptureall requires that
password-less SSH be set up between the host running
Intel(R) Omni- <br>
Path Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset and the hosts
opacaptureall is operating against. The opasetupssh command
can aid in setting up password-less SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing operations
against chassis, set up of SSH keys is recommended (see
opasetupssh ). If SSH keys are not set up, all chassis must
be configured with the same admin <br>
password and use of the -S option is recommended. The -S
option avoids the need to keep the password in configuration
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The resulting host capture
files can require significant amounts of space on the
Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset host.
Actual size varies, but sizes can <br>
be multiple megabytes per host. Intel recommends that you
ensure adequate space is available on the Intel(R) Omni-Path
Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset system. In many cases, it
<br>
may not be necessary to run opacaptureall against all hosts
or chassis; instead, a representative subset may be
sufficient. Consult with your support representative for
further <br>
information.</p>
