<p>E2FSCK(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual E2FSCK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
e2fsck - check a Linux ext2/ext3/ext4 file system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
e2fsck [ -pacnyrdfkvtDFV ] [ -b superblock ] [ -B blocksize
] [ -l|-L bad_blocks_file ] [ -C fd ] [ -j external-journal
] [ -E extended_options ] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
e2fsck is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file
systems. For ext3 and ext4 filesystems that use a journal,
if the system has been shut down uncleanly without any <br>
errors, normally, after replaying the committed transactions
in the journal, the file system should be marked as clean.
Hence, for filesystems that use journalling, e2fsck <br>
will normally replay the journal and exit, unless its
superblock indicates that further checking is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">device is the device file where
the filesystem is stored (e.g. /dev/hdc1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in general it is not
safe to run e2fsck on mounted filesystems. The only
exception is if the -n option is specified, and -c, -l, or
-L options are not specified. <br>
However, even if it is safe to do so, the results printed by
e2fsck are not valid if the filesystem is mounted. If e2fsck
asks whether or not you should check a filesystem <br>
which is mounted, the only correct answer is
&lsquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo;. Only experts who really know
what they are doing should consider answering this question
in any other way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a This option does the same thing as the -p option. It is
provided for backwards compatibility only; it is suggested
that people use -p option whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b superblock <br>
Instead of using the normal superblock, use an alternative
superblock specified by superblock. This option is normally
used when the primary superblock has been cor&acirc; <br>
rupted. The location of the backup superblock is dependent
on the filesystem&rsquo;s blocksize. For filesystems with 1k
blocksizes, a backup superblock can be found at block <br>
8193; for filesystems with 2k blocksizes, at block 16384;
and for 4k blocksizes, at block 32768.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional backup superblocks
can be determined by using the mke2fs program using the -n
option to print out where the superblocks were created. The
-b option to mke2fs, <br>
which specifies blocksize of the filesystem must be
specified in order for the superblock locations that are
printed out to be accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an alternative superblock is
specified and the filesystem is not opened read-only, e2fsck
will make sure that the primary superblock is updated
appropriately upon com&acirc; <br>
pletion of the filesystem check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B blocksize <br>
Normally, e2fsck will search for the superblock at various
different block sizes in an attempt to find the appropriate
block size. This search can be fooled in some <br>
cases. This option forces e2fsck to only try locating the
superblock at a particular blocksize. If the superblock is
not found, e2fsck will terminate with a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c This option causes e2fsck to
use badblocks(8) program to do a read-only scan of the
device in order to find any bad blocks. If any bad blocks
are found, they are added to <br>
the bad block inode to prevent them from being allocated to
a file or directory. If this option is specified twice, then
the bad block scan will be done using a non- <br>
destructive read-write test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C fd This option causes e2fsck
to write completion information to the specified file
descriptor so that the progress of the filesystem check can
be monitored. This option is <br>
typically used by programs which are running e2fsck. If the
file descriptor number is negative, then absolute value of
the file descriptor will be used, and the progress <br>
information will be suppressed initially. It can later be
enabled by sending the e2fsck process a SIGUSR1 signal. If
the file descriptor specified is 0, e2fsck will <br>
print a completion bar as it goes about its business. This
requires that e2fsck is running on a video console or
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print debugging output
(useless unless you are debugging e2fsck).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Optimize directories in
filesystem. This option causes e2fsck to try to optimize all
directories, either by reindexing them if the filesystem
supports directory indexing, <br>
or by sorting and compressing directories for smaller
directories, or for filesystems using traditional linear
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even without the -D option,
e2fsck may sometimes optimize a few directories --- for
example, if directory indexing is enabled and a directory is
not indexed and would ben&acirc; <br>
efit from being indexed, or if the index structures are
corrupted and need to be rebuilt. The -D option forces all
directories in the filesystem to be optimized. This <br>
can sometimes make them a little smaller and slightly faster
to search, but in practice, you should rarely need to use
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D option will detect
directory entries with duplicate names in a single
directory, which e2fsck normally does not enforce for
performance reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E extended_options <br>
Set e2fsck extended options. Extended options are comma
separated, and may take an argument using the equals
(&rsquo;=&rsquo;) sign. The following options are
supported:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ea_ver=extended_attribute_version
<br>
Set the version of the extended attribute blocks which
e2fsck will require while checking the filesystem. The
version number may be 1 or 2. The default <br>
extended attribute version format is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_only <br>
Only replay the journal if required, but do not perform any
further checks or repairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fragcheck <br>
During pass 1, print a detailed report of any discontiguous
blocks for files in the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard <br>
Attempt to discard free blocks and unused inode blocks after
the full filesystem check (discarding blocks is useful on
solid state devices and sparse / thin- <br>
provisioned storage). Note that discard is done in pass 5
AFTER the filesystem has been fully checked and only if it
does not contain recognizable errors. How&acirc; <br>
ever there might be cases where e2fsck does not fully
recognize a problem and hence in this case this option may
prevent you from further manual data recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodiscard <br>
Do not attempt to discard free blocks and unused inode
blocks. This option is exactly the opposite of discard
option. This is set as default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force checking even if the
file system seems clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Flush the filesystem
device&rsquo;s buffer caches before beginning. Only really
useful for doing e2fsck time trials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j external-journal <br>
Set the pathname where the external-journal for this
filesystem can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k When combined with the -c
option, any existing bad blocks in the bad blocks list are
preserved, and any new bad blocks found by running
badblocks(8) will be added to the <br>
existing bad blocks list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename <br>
Add the block numbers listed in the file specified by
filename to the list of bad blocks. The format of this file
is the same as the one generated by the badblocks(8) <br>
program. Note that the block numbers are based on the
blocksize of the filesystem. Hence, badblocks(8) must be
given the blocksize of the filesystem in order to obtain
<br>
correct results. As a result, it is much simpler and safer
to use the -c option to e2fsck, since it will assure that
the correct parameters are passed to the badblocks <br>
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L filename <br>
Set the bad blocks list to be the list of blocks specified
by filename. (This option is the same as the -l option,
except the bad blocks list is cleared before the blocks <br>
listed in the file are added to the bad blocks list.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Open the filesystem
read-only, and assume an answer of &lsquo;no&rsquo; to all
questions. Allows e2fsck to be used non-interactively. This
option may not be specified at the same <br>
time as the -p or -y options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Automatically repair
(&quot;preen&quot;) the file system. This option will cause
e2fsck to automatically fix any filesystem problems that can
be safely fixed without human inter&acirc; <br>
vention. If e2fsck discovers a problem which may require the
system administrator to take additional corrective action,
e2fsck will print a description of the problem and <br>
then exit with the value 4 logically or&rsquo;ed into the
exit code. (See the EXIT CODE section.) This option is
normally used by the system&rsquo;s boot scripts. It may not
be <br>
specified at the same time as the -n or -y options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r This option does nothing at
all; it is provided only for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Print timing statistics for
e2fsck. If this option is used twice, additional timing
statistics are printed on a pass by pass basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Assume an answer of
&lsquo;yes&rsquo; to all questions; allows e2fsck to be used
non-interactively. This option may not be specified at the
same time as the -n or -p options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
The exit code returned by e2fsck is the sum of the following
conditions: <br>
0 - No errors <br>
1 - File system errors corrected <br>
2 - File system errors corrected, system should <br>
be rebooted <br>
4 - File system errors left uncorrected <br>
8 - Operational error <br>
16 - Usage or syntax error <br>
32 - E2fsck canceled by user request <br>
128 - Shared library error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The following signals have the following effect when sent to
e2fsck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
This signal causes e2fsck to start displaying a completion
bar or emitting progress information. (See discussion of the
-C option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
This signal causes e2fsck to stop displaying a completion
bar or emitting progress information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Almost any piece of software will have bugs. If you manage
to find a filesystem which causes e2fsck to crash, or which
e2fsck is unable to repair, please report it to the <br>
author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please include as much
information as possible in your bug report. Ideally, include
a complete transcript of the e2fsck run, so I can see
exactly what error messages are dis&acirc; <br>
played. (Make sure the messages printed by e2fsck are in
English; if your system has been configured so that
e2fsck&rsquo;s messages have been translated into another
language, please <br>
set the the LC_ALL environment variable to C so that the
transcript of e2fsck&rsquo;s output will be useful to me.)
If you have a writable filesystem where the transcript can
be <br>
stored, the script(1) program is a handy way to save the
output of e2fsck to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also useful to send the
output of dumpe2fs(8). If a specific inode or inodes seems
to be giving e2fsck trouble, try running the debugfs(8)
command and send the output of <br>
the stat(1u) command run on the relevant inode(s). If the
inode is a directory, the debugfs dump command will allow
you to extract the contents of the directory inode, which
can <br>
sent to me after being first run through uuencode(1). The
most useful data you can send to help reproduce the bug is a
compressed raw image dump of the filesystem, generated <br>
using e2image(8). See the e2image(8) man page for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always include the full version
string which e2fsck displays when it is run, so I know which
version you are running.</p>
