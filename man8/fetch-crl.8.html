<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fetch-crl utility will retrieve certificate revocation
lists (CRLs) for a set of installed trust anchors, based on
crl_url files or IGTF-style info files. It will install <br>
these for use with OpenSSL, NSS or third-party tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It works based on a list of
trust anchors, for each of which one or more CRLs should be
installed in a CRL store. And for each of these CRLs, one or
more URLs can be specified <br>
from which the specific CRL can be retrieved. There are
several supported formats for CRL stores:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openssl <br>
has a directory in which hash. i files are stored, one CRL
per file, and all CRLs for the trust anchors whose subject
distinguished name hashes to hash are read and eval&acirc;
<br>
uated for each certificate issues by the CAs whose subject
name hash matches hash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenSSL in version 1 changes its
subject name hashing algorithm, though, so that for one
trust anchor two hashes could be used, depending on the
specific OpenSSL version <br>
at hand. If OpenSSL version 1 or higher is used by fetch-crl
and the default mode is used, each CRL is written out twice,
once for each possible hash value. This mode in <br>
controlled by the opensslmode = { dual | single }
configuration option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pem writes out the CRL in PEM
(RFC 1421) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">der writes out the CRL in binary
under distinguished encoding rules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nss will use the crlutil from
the Mozilla NSS tools to add or replace a CRL in the NSS
cert8.db database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each CRLs can be retrieved from
one of several URLs. These URLs are listed by default in the
trust anchor meta-data: the .info file or the .crl_url file,
as shipped with the <br>
trust anchor. In the crl_url file, there is one URL per
line; in the .info file, the crl_url attribute is a
semi-colon separated list of URLs. These URLs are then tried
in order <br>
to retrieve a fresh CRL. Once data has been successfully
retrieved, this data is used as the CRL if it passes
verification, signature checking and expiration checks.
Http, https, <br>
ftp and file URLs are supported. If data for a CRL has been
downloaded but this data fails any of the subsequent checks
(signature validation, freshness), the CRL data is
dis&acirc; <br>
carded and NO further URLs are tried for this CRL!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URLs can be pre-pended or
post-pended to the default list via the configuration file.
This can be used to prefer a local mirror repository over
any URLs shipped by the trust <br>
anchor provider, without the need to modify the trust anchor
metadata. By post-pending a URL, a &rsquo;last-resort&rsquo;
download location can be added in case the CA provided URLs
cannot <br>
be used. The pre- and post-pended URLS are subject to token
expansion of the tokens @ALIAS@, @ANCHORNAME@, and @R@,
where R is the sequence number of the CRL on a per-trust
<br>
anchor basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Retrieved CRLs may be PEM
(RFC1421) or DER encoded. They are automatically converted
as needed by fetch-crl, using the OpenSSL command-line
tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Retrieving a CRL without having
an accompanying CA root certificate in an OpenSSL-accessible
form (like @ALIAS@.0 or @ANCHORNAME@.@R@ will result in a
verification failures. The <br>
CA lookup directory and patterns can be configured via the
configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOKEN EXPANSION <br>
In paths and name templates, tokens are expanded to allow a
single pattern to be used for all trust anchors. The
nametemplate_*, catemplate, prepend_url, and postpend_url
config&acirc; <br>
uration settings are subject to token expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following tokens are
recognised</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ALIAS@ <br>
The alias name of the trust anchor as defined in the info
file. If there is no info file and the meta-data is
retrieved from crl_url files, then the alias is set to the
<br>
basename (excluding the .crl_url suffix) of the filename of
the trust anchor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ANCHORNAME@ <br>
The file name of the trust anchor, without any .info or
.url_crl suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@R@ The CRL sequence number,
counting from 0. Note that most trust anchors only have a
single CRL, with sequence number &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h --help <br>
Show help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l --infodir metadata-directory
<br>
The script will search this directory for files with the
suffix &rsquo;.info&rsquo; or &rsquo;.crl_url&rsquo;. Note:
the CRL files to download must be in either PEM or DER
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o --out outputDirectory <br>
Directory where to put the downloaded and processed CRLs.
The directory to be used as argument for this option is
typically /etc/grid-security/certificates Default: <br>
infodir (meta-data directory)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a --agingtolerance hours <br>
The maximum age of the locally downloaded CRL before
download failures trigger actual error messages. This error
message suppression mechanism only works if the CRL has <br>
been downloaded at least once and either the crl_url files
are named after the hash of the CRL issuer name, or a state
directory is used to preserve state across invoca&acirc;
<br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 24 hour aging
tolerance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quiet <br>
Quiet mode (do not print information messages)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r --randomwait s <br>
Wait up to s seconds before starting the retrieval
process(es).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --parallelism n <br>
Do the retrieval for several trust anchors in parallel, with
up to n processes doing retrievals. At most n downloads will
be active at any one time. Multiple CRLs for the <br>
same trust anchor are still downloaded sequentially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inet6glue <br>
Load the Net::INET6Glue module to enable IPv6 support in
LWP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--define key=value <br>
Add definitions to the configuration at runtime. The
key=value pair is appended to the main section of the
configuration, unless a colon is used in the key: then the
part <br>
before the colon is the config file section name, and the
part thereafter the key inside that section. To merely set a
valueless option, set to to the null-string
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
See http://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/FetchCRL3 or the included
example file for a description of the configuration options.
The default location of the configuration file is <br>
/etc/fetch-crl.conf. Supplementary configuration is read
from all files located in /etc/fetch-crl.d/, or the
directory designated by the cfgdir directive, whose collated
con&acirc; <br>
tents are added to the existing configuration data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Defaults can be set in the fetch-crl system configuration
file /etc/fetch-crl.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status
is 1 and diagnostics will be written to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Although fetch-crl3 will install multiple CRLs in the CRL
stores (called &rsquo;.r0&rsquo;, &rsquo;.r1&rsquo;, or
labelled appropriately in an NSS store), if the number of
CRLs decreases the left-overs <br>
are not automatically removed. So if the number of CRLs for
a particular CA does down from n to n-1, the file
&rsquo;.rn&rsquo; must be removed manually.</p>
