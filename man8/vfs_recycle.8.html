<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vfs_recycle - Samba VFS recycle bin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vfs objects = recycle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vfs_recycle intercepts file
deletion requests and moves the affected files to a
temporary repository rather than deleting them immediately.
This gives the same effect as the <br>
Recycle Bin on Windows computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Recycle Bin will not appear
in Windows Explorer views of the network file system (share)
nor on any mapped drive. Instead, a directory called
.recycle will be automatically <br>
created when the first file is deleted and
recycle:repository is not configured. If recycle:repository
is configured, the name of the created directory depends on
<br>
recycle:repository. Users can recover files from the recycle
bin. If the recycle:keeptree option has been specified,
deleted files will be found in a path identical with that
<br>
from which the file was deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This module is stackable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
recycle:repository = PATH <br>
Path of the directory where deleted files should be
moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not set, the
default path .recycle is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:directory_mode = MODE
<br>
Set MODE to the octal mode the recycle repository should be
created with. The recycle repository will be created when
first file is deleted. If recycle:subdir_mode is not <br>
set, MODE also applies to subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not set, the
default mode 0700 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:subdir_mode = MODE <br>
Set MODE to the octal mode with which sub directories of the
recycle repository should be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not set,
subdirectories will be created with the mode from
recycle:directory_mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:keeptree = BOOL <br>
Specifies whether the directory structure should be
preserved or whether the files in a directory that is being
deleted should be kept separately in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:versions = BOOL <br>
If this option is True, two files with the same name that
are deleted will both be kept in the repository. Newer
deleted versions of a file will be called &quot;Copy #x of
<br>
filename&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:touch = BOOL <br>
Specifies whether a file&rsquo;s access date should be
updated when the file is moved to the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:touch_mtime = BOOL <br>
Specifies whether a file&rsquo;s last modified date should
be updated when the file is moved to the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:minsize = BYTES <br>
Files that are smaller than the number of bytes specified by
this parameter will not be put into the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:maxsize = BYTES <br>
Files that are larger than the number of bytes specified by
this parameter will not be put into the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:exclude = LIST <br>
List of files that should not be put into the repository
when deleted, but deleted in the normal way. Wildcards such
as * and ? are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:exclude_dir = LIST <br>
List of directories whose files should not be put into the
repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way.
Wildcards such as * and ? are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recycle:noversions = LIST <br>
Specifies a list of paths (wildcards such as * and ? are
supported) for which no versioning should be used. Only
useful when recycle:versions is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Move files &quot;deleted&quot; on share to
/data/share/.recycle instead of deleting them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[share] <br>
path = /data/share <br>
vfs objects = recycle <br>
recycle:repository = .recycle <br>
recycle:keeptree = yes <br>
recycle:versions = yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of the Samba
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux <br>
kernel is developed.</p>
