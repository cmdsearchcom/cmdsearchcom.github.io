vfs_recycle - Samba VFS recycle bin

This VFS module is part of the <b>samba</b>(7) suite.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The vfs_recycle intercepts file deletion requests and moves the affected files
  to a temporary repository rather than deleting them immediately. This gives
  the same effect as the Recycle Bin on Windows computers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Recycle Bin will not appear in Windows Explorer views of the network file
  system (share) nor on any mapped drive. Instead, a directory called .recycle
  will be automatically created when the first file is deleted and
  recycle:repository is not configured. If recycle:repository is configured, the
  name of the created directory depends on recycle:repository. Users can recover
  files from the recycle bin. If the recycle:keeptree option has been specified,
  deleted files will be found in a path identical with that from which the file
  was deleted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This module is stackable.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
recycle:repository = PATH
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Path of the directory where deleted files
  should be moved.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If this option is not set, the default path .recycle is used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:directory_mode = MODE
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set MODE to the octal mode the recycle
  repository should be created with. The recycle repository will be created when
  first file is deleted. If recycle:subdir_mode is not set, MODE also applies to
  subdirectories.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If this option is not set, the default mode 0700 is used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:subdir_mode = MODE
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set MODE to the octal mode with which sub
  directories of the recycle repository should be created.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If this option is not set, subdirectories will be created with the mode from
  recycle:directory_mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:keeptree = BOOL
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies whether the directory structure
  should be preserved or whether the files in a directory that is being deleted
  should be kept separately in the repository.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:versions = BOOL
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If this option is True, two files with the
  same name that are deleted will both be kept in the repository. Newer deleted
  versions of a file will be called &quot;Copy #x of filename&quot;.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:touch = BOOL
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies whether a file's access date should
  be updated when the file is moved to the repository.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:touch_mtime = BOOL
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies whether a file's last modified date
  should be updated when the file is moved to the repository.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:minsize = BYTES
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Files that are smaller than the number of
  bytes specified by this parameter will not be put into the repository.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:maxsize = BYTES
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Files that are larger than the number of bytes
  specified by this parameter will not be put into the repository.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:exclude = LIST
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">List of files that should not be put into the
  repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way. Wildcards such as *
  and ? are supported.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:exclude_dir = LIST
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">List of directories whose files should not be
  put into the repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way. Wildcards
  such as * and ? are supported.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recycle:noversions = LIST
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies a list of paths (wildcards such as *
  and ? are supported) for which no versioning should be used. Only useful when
  recycle:versions is enabled.</div>

Move files &quot;deleted&quot; on <i>share</i> to <i>/data/share/.recycle</i>
  instead of deleting them:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
         <i>[share]</i>
	 <b>path = /data/share</b>
	 <b>vfs objects = recycle</b>
	 <b>recycle:repository = .recycle</b>
	 <b>recycle:keeptree = yes</b>
