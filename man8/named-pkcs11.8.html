<p>NAMED(8) BIND9 NAMED(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
named - Internet domain name server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
named [-4] [-6] [-c config-file] [-d debug-level] [-E
engine-name] [-f] [-g] [-m flag] [-n #cpus] [-p port] [-s]
[-S #max-socks] [-t directory] [-U #listeners] [-u user]
[-v] <br>
[-V] [-x cache-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
named is a Domain Name System (DNS) server, part of the BIND
9 distribution from ISC. For more information on the DNS,
see RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked without arguments,
named will read the default configuration file
/etc/named.conf, read any initial data, and listen for
queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-4 <br>
Use IPv4 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv6.
-4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 <br>
Use IPv6 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv4.
-4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-file <br>
Use config-file as the configuration file instead of the
default, /etc/named.conf. To ensure that reloading the
configuration file continues to work after the server has
<br>
changed its working directory due to to a possible directory
option in the configuration file, config-file should be an
absolute pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d debug-level <br>
Set the daemon&rsquo;s debug level to debug-level. Debugging
traces from named become more verbose as the debug level
increases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E engine-name <br>
Use a crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine) for the crypto
operations it supports, for instance re-signing with private
keys from a secure key store. When compiled with PKCS#11
<br>
support engine-name defaults to pkcs11, the empty name
resets it to no engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not
daemonize).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
Run the server in the foreground and force all logging to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m flag <br>
Turn on memory usage debugging flags. Possible flags are
usage, trace, record, size, and mctx. These correspond to
the ISC_MEM_DEBUGXXXX flags described in
&lt;isc/mem.h&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n #cpus <br>
Create #cpus worker threads to take advantage of multiple
CPUs. If not specified, named will try to determine the
number of CPUs present and create one thread per CPU. If it
<br>
is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a single worker
thread will be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Listen for queries on port port. If not specified, the
default is port 53.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Write memory usage statistics to stdout on exit. <br>
Note: This option is mainly of interest to BIND 9 developers
and may be removed or changed in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S #max-socks <br>
Allow named to use up to #max-socks sockets. <br>
Warning: This option should be unnecessary for the vast
majority of users. The use of this option could even be
harmful because the specified value may exceed the <br>
limitation of the underlying system API. It is therefore set
only when the default configuration causes exhaustion of
file descriptors and the operational environment <br>
is known to support the specified number of sockets. Note
also that the actual maximum number is normally a little
fewer than the specified value because named <br>
reserves some file descriptors for its internal use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t directory <br>
Chroot to directory after processing the command line
arguments, but before reading the configuration file. <br>
Warning: This option should be used in conjunction with the
-u option, as chrooting a process running as root
doesn&rsquo;t enhance security on most systems; the way <br>
chroot(2) is defined allows a process with root privileges
to escape a chroot jail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U #listeners <br>
Use #listeners worker threads to listen for incoming UDP
packets on each address. If not specified, named will use
the number of detected CPUs. If -n has been set to a higher
<br>
value than the number of CPUs, then -U may be increased as
high as that value, but no higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Setuid to user after completing privileged operations, such
as creating sockets that listen on privileged ports. <br>
Note: On Linux, named uses the kernel&rsquo;s capability
mechanism to drop all root privileges except the ability to
bind(2) to a privileged port and set process resource <br>
limits. Unfortunately, this means that the -u option only
works when named is run on kernel 2.2.18 or later, or kernel
2.3.99-pre3 or later, since previous kernels did <br>
not allow privileges to be retained after setuid(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Report the version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Report the version number and build options, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x cache-file <br>
Load data from cache-file into the cache of the default
view. <br>
Warning: This option must not be used. It is only of
interest to BIND 9 developers and may be removed or changed
in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
In routine operation, signals should not be used to control
the nameserver; rndc should be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
Force a reload of the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT, SIGTERM <br>
Shut down the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result of sending any other
signals to the server is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The named configuration file is too complex to describe in
detail here. A complete description is provided in the BIND
9 Administrator Reference Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">named inherits the umask (file
creation mode mask) from the parent process. If files
created by named, such as journal files, need to have custom
permissions, the umask should be <br>
set explicitly in the script used to start the named
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/named.conf <br>
The default configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/named/named.pid <br>
The default process-id file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Red Hat SELinux BIND Security Profile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, Red Hat ships BIND
with the most secure SELinux policy that will not prevent
normal BIND operation and will prevent exploitation of all
known BIND security <br>
vulnerabilities . See the selinux(8) man page for
information about SElinux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not necessary to run named
in a chroot environment if the Red Hat SELinux policy for
named is enabled. When enabled, this policy is far more
secure than a chroot <br>
environment. Users are recommended to enable SELinux and
remove the bind-chroot package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this extra security comes
some restrictions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the SELinux policy
does not allow named to write any master zone database
files. Only the root user may create files in the
$ROOTDIR/var/named zone database file <br>
directory (the options { &quot;directory&quot; } option),
where $ROOTDIR is set in /etc/sysconfig/named.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;named&quot; group must
be granted read privelege to these files in order for named
to be enabled to read them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any file created in the zone
database file directory is automatically assigned the
SELinux file context named_zone_t .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, SELinux prevents any
role from modifying named_zone_t files; this means that
files in the zone database directory cannot be modified by
dynamic DNS (DDNS) updates or <br>
zone transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Red Hat BIND distribution
and SELinux policy creates three directories where named is
allowed to create and modify files: /var/named/slaves,
/var/named/dynamic <br>
/var/named/data. By placing files you want named to modify,
such as slave or DDNS updateable zone files and database /
statistics dump files in these directories, named will work
<br>
normally and no further operator action is required. Files
in these directories are automatically assigned the
&rsquo;named_cache_t&rsquo; file context, which SELinux
allows named to write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Red Hat BIND SDB support:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Red Hat ships named with
compiled in Simplified Database Backend modules that ISC
provides in the &quot;contrib/sdb&quot; directory. Install
bind-sdb package if you want use them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SDB modules for LDAP,
PostGreSQL, DirDB and SQLite are compiled into
named-sdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the documentation for the
various SDB modules in /usr/share/doc/bind-sdb-*/ .</p>
