<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipsec_rsasigkey - generate RSA signature key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipsec rsasigkey [--verbose] [--seeddev device] [--seed
numbits] [--configdir nssdbdir] [--password nsspassword]
[--hostname hostname] [nbits]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rsasigkey generates an RSA public/private key pair, suitable
for digital signatures, of (exactly) nbits bits (that is,
two primes each of exactly nbits/2 bits, and related <br>
numbers) and emits it on standard output as ASCII (mostly
hex) data. nbits must be a multiple of 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The public exponent is forced to
the value 3, which has important speed advantages for
signature checking. Beware that the resulting keys have
known weaknesses as encryption keys <br>
and should not be used for that purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --verbose option makes
rsasigkey give a running commentary on standard error. By
default, it works in silence until it is ready to generate
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --seeddev option specifies a
source for random bits used to seed the crypto
library&rsquo;s RNG. The default is /dev/random (see
random(4)). FreeS/WAN and Openswan without NSS <br>
support used this option to specify the random source used
to directly create keys. Libreswan only uses it to seed the
NSS crypto libraries RNG. Under Linux with hardware random
<br>
support, special devices might show up as /dev/*rng*
devices. However, these should never be accessed directly
using this option, as hardware failures could lead to
extremely <br>
non-random values (streams of zeroes have been observed in
the wild)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --seedbits option specifies
how many seed bits are pulled from the random device to seed
the NSS PRNG. The default of 480bit comes from FIPS
requirements. Seed bits are <br>
rounded up to a multiple of 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of a different random
device or a reduction of seedbits from the default value is
prevented when the system is running in FIPS mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --configdir option specifies
the nss configuration directory to use. This is the
directory where the NSS certificate, key and security
modules databases reside. The default <br>
value is /etc/ipsec.d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --password option specifies
the nss cryptographic module authentication password if the
NSS module has been configured to require it. A password is
required by hardware <br>
tokens and also by the internal software token module when
configured to run in FIPS mode. If the argument is
configdir/nsspassword, the password comes from that file;
otherwise <br>
argument is the password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --hostname option specifies
what host name to use in the first line of the output (see
below); the default is what gethostname(2) returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format looks like
this (with long numbers trimmed down for clarity):</p>

Exponent2: 0x8e70b5ad8d...9142168d7dcc7 <br>
Coefficient: 0xafb761d001...0c13e98d98</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first (comment) line,
indicating the nature and date of the key, and giving a host
name, is used by ipsec_showhostkey(8) when generating some
forms of key output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commented-out pubkey= line
contains the public key, the public exponent and the modulus
combined in approximately RFC 2537 format (the one deviation
is that the combined <br>
value is given with a 0s prefix, rather than in unadorned
base-64), suitable for use in the ipsec.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Modulus, PublicExponent and
PrivateExponent lines give the basic signing and
verification data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Prime1 and Prime2 lines give
the primes themselves (aka p and q), largest first. The
Exponent1 and Exponent2 lines give the private exponent mod
p-1 and q-1 respectively. The <br>
Coefficient line gives the Chinese Remainder Theorem
coefficient, which is the inverse of q, mod p. These
additional numbers (which must all be kept as secret as the
private <br>
exponent) are precomputed aids to rapid signature
generation. When NSS is used, these values are not available
outside the NSS security database (software token or
hardware <br>
token) and are instead filled in with the CKA_ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No attempt is made to break long
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The US patent on the RSA
algorithm expired 20 Sept 2000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
ipsec rsasigkey --verbose 4096 &gt;mykey.txt <br>
generates a 4096-bit signature key and puts it in the file
mykey.txt, with running commentary on standard error. The
file contents can be inserted verbatim into a suitable <br>
entry in the ipsec.secrets file (see ipsec_secrets(5)), and
the public key can then be extracted and edited into the
ipsec.conf (see ipsec_showhostkey(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Originally written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer. Updated
for the Libreswan Project by Paul Wouters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --round and --noopt options
were obsoleted as these were only used with the old
non-library crypto code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --random device is only used
for seeding the crypto library, not for direct random to
generate keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is an internal limit on nbits, currently 20000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsasigkey&rsquo;s run time is
difficult to predict, since /dev/random output can be
arbitrarily delayed if the system&rsquo;s entropy pool is
low on randomness, and the time taken by the <br>
search for primes is also somewhat unpredictable.
Specifically, embedded systems and most virtual machines are
low on entropy. In such a situation, consider generating the
RSA <br>
key on another machine, and copying ipsec.secrets and the
ipsec.d/*db files to the embedded platform. Note that NSS
embeds the full path in the DB files, so the path on proxy
<br>
machine must be identical to the path on the destination
machine.</p>
