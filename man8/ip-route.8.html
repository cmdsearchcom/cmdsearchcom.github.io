<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ip route is used to manipulate entries in the kernel routing
tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Route types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unicast - the route entry
describes real paths to the destinations covered by the
route prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unreachable - these destinations
are unreachable. Packets are discarded and the ICMP message
host unreachable is generated. The local senders get an
EHOSTUNREACH error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blackhole - these destinations
are unreachable. Packets are discarded silently. The local
senders get an EINVAL error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prohibit - these destinations
are unreachable. Packets are discarded and the ICMP message
communication administratively prohibited is generated. The
local senders get an <br>
EACCES error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local - the destinations are
assigned to this host. The packets are looped back and
delivered locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">broadcast - the destinations are
broadcast addresses. The packets are sent as link
broadcasts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">throw - a special control route
used together with policy rules. If such a route is
selected, lookup in this table is terminated pretending that
no route was found. With&acirc; <br>
out policy routing it is equivalent to the absence of the
route in the routing table. The packets are dropped and the
ICMP message net unreachable is generated. The local <br>
senders get an ENETUNREACH error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nat - a special NAT route.
Destinations covered by the prefix are considered to be
dummy (or external) addresses which require translation to
real (or internal) ones <br>
before forwarding. The addresses to translate to are
selected with the attribute via. Warning: Route NAT is no
longer supported in Linux 2.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">anycast - not implemented the
destinations are anycast addresses assigned to this host.
They are mainly equivalent to local with one difference:
such addresses are <br>
invalid when used as the source address of any packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multicast - a special type used
for multicast routing. It is not present in normal routing
tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Route tables: Linux-2.x can pack
routes into several routing tables identified by a number in
the range from 1 to 2^31 or by name from the file
/etc/iproute2/rt_tables By default <br>
all normal routes are inserted into the main table (ID 254)
and the kernel only uses this table when calculating routes.
Values (0, 253, 254, and 255) are reserved for built-in <br>
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually, one other table always
exists, which is invisible but even more important. It is
the local table (ID 255). This table consists of routes for
local and broadcast <br>
addresses. The kernel maintains this table automatically and
the administrator usually need not modify it or even look at
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The multiple routing tables
enter the game when policy routing is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route add <br>
add new route</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route change <br>
change route</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route replace <br>
change or add new one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to TYPE PREFIX (default) <br>
the destination prefix of the route. If TYPE is omitted, ip
assumes type unicast. Other values of TYPE are listed above.
PREFIX is an IP or IPv6 address option&acirc; <br>
ally followed by a slash and the prefix length. If the
length of the prefix is missing, ip assumes a full-length
host route. There is also a special PREFIX default <br>
- which is equivalent to IP 0/0 or to IPv6 ::/0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tos TOS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsfield TOS <br>
the Type Of Service (TOS) key. This key has no associated
mask and the longest match is understood as: First, compare
the TOS of the route and of the packet. If <br>
they are not equal, then the packet may still match a route
with a zero TOS. TOS is either an 8 bit hexadecimal number
or an identifier from <br>
/etc/iproute2/rt_dsfield.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">metric NUMBER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preference NUMBER <br>
the preference value of the route. NUMBER is an arbitrary
32bit number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">table TABLEID <br>
the table to add this route to. TABLEID may be a number or a
string from the file /etc/iproute2/rt_tables. If this
parameter is omitted, ip assumes the main ta&acirc; <br>
ble, with the exception of local, broadcast and nat routes,
which are put into the local table by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev NAME <br>
the output device name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">via ADDRESS <br>
the address of the nexthop router. Actually, the sense of
this field depends on the route type. For normal unicast
routes it is either the true next hop router or, <br>
if it is a direct route installed in BSD compatibility mode,
it can be a local address of the interface. For NAT routes
it is the first address of the block of <br>
translated IP destinations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src ADDRESS <br>
the source address to prefer when sending to the
destinations covered by the route prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realm REALMID <br>
the realm to which this route is assigned. REALMID may be a
number or a string from the file
/etc/iproute2/rt_realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtu MTU</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtu lock MTU <br>
the MTU along the path to the destination. If the modifier
lock is not used, the MTU may be updated by the kernel due
to Path MTU Discovery. If the modifier lock is <br>
used, no path MTU discovery will be tried, all packets will
be sent without the DF bit in IPv4 case or fragmented to MTU
for IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">window NUMBER <br>
the maximal window for TCP to advertise to these
destinations, measured in bytes. It limits maximal data
bursts that our TCP peers are allowed to send to us.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rtt TIME <br>
the initial RTT (&rsquo;Round Trip Time&rsquo;) estimate. If
no suffix is specified the units are raw values passed
directly to the routing code to maintain compatibility with
<br>
previous releases. Otherwise if a suffix of s, sec or secs
is used to specify seconds and ms, msec or msecs to specify
milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rttvar TIME (2.3.15+ only) <br>
the initial RTT variance estimate. Values are specified as
with rtt above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rto_min TIME (2.6.23+ only) <br>
the minimum TCP Retransmission TimeOut to use when
communicating with this destination. Values are specified as
with rtt above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssthresh NUMBER (2.3.15+ only)
<br>
an estimate for the initial slow start threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwnd NUMBER (2.3.15+ only) <br>
the clamp for congestion window. It is ignored if the lock
flag is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initcwnd NUMBER (2.5.70+ only)
<br>
the initial congestion window size for connections to this
destination. Actual window size is this value multiplied by
the MSS (&lsquo;&lsquo;Maximal Segment Size&rsquo;&rsquo;)
for same <br>
connection. The default is zero, meaning to use the values
specified in RFC2414.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initrwnd NUMBER (2.6.33+ only)
<br>
the initial receive window size for connections to this
destination. Actual window size is this value multiplied by
the MSS of the connection. The default value <br>
is zero, meaning to use Slow Start value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">features FEATURES (3.18+only)
<br>
Enable or disable per-route features. Only available feature
at this time is ecn to enable explicit congestion
notification when initiating connections to the <br>
given destination network. When responding to a connection
request from the given network, ecn will also be used even
if the net.ipv4.tcp_ecn sysctl is set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quickack BOOL (3.11+ only) <br>
Enable or disable quick ack for connections to this
destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">congctl NAME (3.20+ only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">congctl lock NAME (3.20+ only)
<br>
Sets a specific TCP congestion control algorithm only for a
given destination. If not specified, Linux keeps the current
global default TCP congestion control <br>
algorithm, or the one set from the application. If the
modifier lock is not used, an application may nevertheless
overwrite the suggested congestion control algo&acirc; <br>
rithm for that destination. If the modifier lock is used,
then an application is not allowed to overwrite the
specified congestion control algorithm for that desti&acirc;
<br>
nation, thus it will be enforced/guaranteed to use the
proposed algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">advmss NUMBER (2.3.15+ only)
<br>
the MSS (&rsquo;Maximal Segment Size&rsquo;) to advertise to
these destinations when establishing TCP connections. If it
is not given, Linux uses a default value calculated <br>
from the first hop device MTU. (If the path to these
destination is asymmetric, this guess may be wrong.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reordering NUMBER (2.3.15+ only)
<br>
Maximal reordering on the path to this destination. If it is
not given, Linux uses the value selected with sysctl
variable net/ipv4/tcp_reordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nexthop NEXTHOP <br>
the nexthop of a multipath route. NEXTHOP is a complex value
with its own syntax similar to the top level argument
lists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">via ADDRESS - is the nexthop
router.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev NAME - is the output
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weight NUMBER - is a weight for
this element of a multipath route reflecting its relative
bandwidth or quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scope SCOPE_VAL <br>
the scope of the destinations covered by the route prefix.
SCOPE_VAL may be a number or a string from the file
/etc/iproute2/rt_scopes. If this parameter is omit&acirc;
<br>
ted, ip assumes scope global for all gatewayed unicast
routes, scope link for direct unicast and broadcast routes
and scope host for local routes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol RTPROTO <br>
the routing protocol identifier of this route. RTPROTO may
be a number or a string from the file
/etc/iproute2/rt_protos. If the routing protocol ID is not
given, <br>
ip assumes protocol boot (i.e. it assumes the route was
added by someone who doesn&rsquo;t understand what they are
doing). Several protocol values have a fixed interpre&acirc;
<br>
tation. Namely:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redirect - the route was
installed due to an ICMP redirect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel - the route was installed
by the kernel during autoconfiguration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">boot - the route was installed
during the bootup sequence. If a routing daemon starts, it
will purge all of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static - the route was installed
by the administrator to override dynamic routing. Routing
daemon will respect them and, probably, even advertise them
to <br>
its peers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ra - the route was installed by
Router Discovery protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the values are not
reserved and the administrator is free to assign (or not to
assign) protocol tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onlink pretend that the nexthop
is directly attached to this link, even if it does not match
any interface prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expires TIME (4.4+ only) <br>
the route will be deleted after the expires time. Only
support IPv6 at present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route delete <br>
delete route <br>
ip route del has the same arguments as ip route add, but
their semantics are a bit different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key values (to, tos, preference
and table) select the route to delete. If optional
attributes are present, ip verifies that they coincide with
the attributes of the route <br>
to delete. If no route with the given key and attributes was
found, ip route del fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route show <br>
list routes <br>
the command displays the contents of the routing tables or
the route(s) selected by some criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to SELECTOR (default) <br>
only select routes from the given range of destinations.
SELECTOR consists of an optional modifier (root, match or
exact) and a prefix. root PREFIX selects routes <br>
with prefixes not shorter than PREFIX. F.e. root 0/0 selects
the entire routing table. match PREFIX selects routes with
prefixes not longer than PREFIX. F.e. <br>
match 10.0/16 selects 10.0/16, 10/8 and 0/0, but it does not
select 10.1/16 and 10.0.0/24. And exact PREFIX (or just
PREFIX) selects routes with this exact prefix. <br>
If neither of these options are present, ip assumes root 0/0
i.e. it lists the entire table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tos TOS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsfield TOS <br>
only select routes with the given TOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">table TABLEID <br>
show the routes from this table(s). The default setting is
to show table main. TABLEID may either be the ID of a real
table or one of the special values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all - list all of the
tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache - dump the routing
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cloned</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cached list cloned routes i.e.
routes which were dynamically forked from other routes
because some route attribute (f.e. MTU) was updated.
Actually, it is equivalent to <br>
table cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from SELECTOR <br>
the same syntax as for to, but it binds the source address
range rather than destinations. Note that the from option
only works with cloned routes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol RTPROTO <br>
only list routes of this protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scope SCOPE_VAL <br>
only list routes with this scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type TYPE <br>
only list routes of this type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev NAME <br>
only list routes going via this device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">via PREFIX <br>
only list routes going via the nexthop routers selected by
PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src PREFIX <br>
only list routes with preferred source addresses selected by
PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realm REALMID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realms FROMREALM/TOREALM <br>
only list routes with these realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route flush <br>
flush routing tables <br>
this command flushes routes selected by some criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments have the same
syntax and semantics as the arguments of ip route show, but
routing tables are not listed but purged. The only
difference is the default <br>
action: show dumps all the IP main routing table but flush
prints the helper page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -statistics option, the
command becomes verbose. It prints out the number of deleted
routes and the number of rounds made to flush the routing
table. If the <br>
option is given twice, ip route flush also dumps all the
deleted routes in the format described in the previous
subsection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route get <br>
get a single route <br>
this command gets a single route to a destination and prints
its contents exactly as the kernel sees it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to ADDRESS (default) <br>
the destination address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from ADDRESS <br>
the source address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tos TOS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsfield TOS <br>
the Type Of Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iif NAME <br>
the device from which this packet is expected to arrive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oif NAME <br>
force the output device on which this packet will be
routed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connected <br>
if no source address (option from) was given, relookup the
route with the source set to the preferred address received
from the first lookup. If policy routing is <br>
used, it may be a different route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this operation is not
equivalent to ip route show. show shows existing routes. get
resolves them and creates new clones if necessary.
Essentially, get is <br>
equivalent to sending a packet along this path. If the iif
argument is not given, the kernel creates a route to output
packets towards the requested destination. This is <br>
equivalent to pinging the destination with a subsequent ip
route ls cache, however, no packets are actually sent. With
the iif argument, the kernel pretends that a packet <br>
arrived from this interface and searches for a path to
forward the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route save <br>
save routing table information to stdout <br>
This command behaves like ip route show except that the
output is raw data suitable for passing to ip route
restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route restore <br>
restore routing table information from stdin <br>
This command expects to read a data stream as returned from
ip route save. It will attempt to restore the routing table
information exactly as it was at the time of the <br>
save, so any translation of information in the stream (such
as device indexes) must be done first. Any existing routes
are left unchanged. Any routes specified in the data <br>
stream that already exist in the table will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
ip ro <br>
Show all route entries in the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip route add default via
192.168.1.1 dev eth0 <br>
Adds a default route (for all addresses) via the local
gateway 192.168.1.1 that can be reached on device eth0.</p>
