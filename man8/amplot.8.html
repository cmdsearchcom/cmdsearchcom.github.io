<p>AMPLOT(8) System Administration Commands AMPLOT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
amplot - visualize the behavior of Amanda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
amplot [-b] [-c] [-e] [-g] [-l] [-p] [-t T] amdump_files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Amplot reads an amdump output file that Amanda generates
each run (e.g. amdump.1) and translates the information into
a picture format that may be used to determine how your <br>
installation is doing and if any parameters need to be
changed. Amplot also prints out amdump lines that it either
does not understand or knows to be warning or error lines
and <br>
a summary of the start, end and total time for each backup
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amplot is a shell script that
executes an awk program (amplot.awk) to scan the amdump
output file. It then executes a gnuplot program (amplot.g)
to generate the graph. The awk <br>
program is written in an enhanced version of awk, such as
GNU awk (gawk(1) version 2.15 or later) or nawk(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During execution, amplot
generates a few temporary files that gnuplot uses. These
files are deleted at the end of execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the amanda(8) man page for
more details about Amanda.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b <br>
Generate b/w postscript file (need -p).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Compress amdump_files after plotting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Extend the X (time) axis if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
Direct gnuplot output directly to the X11 display
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
Direct postscript output to file YYYYMMDD.ps (opposite of
-g).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Generate landscape oriented output (needs -p).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t T <br>
Set the right edge of the plot to be T hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amdump_files may be in
various compressed formats (compress, gzip, pact,
compact).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERPRETATION <br>
The figure is divided into a number of regions. There are
titles on the top that show important statistical
information about the configuration and from this execution
of amdump. <br>
In the figure, the X axis is time, with 0 being the moment
amdump was started. The Y axis is divided into 5
regions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUEUES: How many backups have
not been started, how many are waiting on space in the
holding disk and how many have been transferred successfully
to tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%BANDWIDTH: Percentage of
allowed network bandwidth in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOLDING DISK: The higher line
depicts space allocated on the holding disk to backups in
progress and completed backups waiting to be written to
tape. The lower line depicts the <br>
fraction of the holding disk containing completed backups
waiting to be written to tape including the file currently
being written to tape. The scale is percentage of the
holding <br>
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAPE: Tape drive usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%DUMPERS: Percentage of active
dumpers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idle period at the left of
the graph is time amdump is asking the machines how much
data they are going to dump. This process can take a while
if hosts are down or it takes <br>
them a long time to generate estimates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Reports lines it does not recognize, mainly error cases but
some are legitimate lines the program needs to be taught
about.</p>
