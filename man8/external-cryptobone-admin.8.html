<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
external-cryptobone-admin - Administration tool for an
external Crypto Bone device to store message keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/bin/external-cryptobone-admin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program cryptobone is the graphical user interface for a
secure messaging system that makes sure a user&rsquo;s email
is always encrypted. In its default mode the cryptobone
pro&acirc; <br>
gram uses an encrypted data base of keys that are stored on
the same machine (ALL-IN-ONE mode). The GUI has access to
these message encryption keys via the cryptobone daemon <br>
running on the same machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional protection of the
message keys can be achieved by using a second, external
device for storing the encryption keys, the external Crypto
Bone. This external device can <br>
be another Linux computer dedicated to this task or a Beagle
Bone or a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program
external-cryptobone-admin is used for all administrative
tasks to turn a Linux computer into an external Crypto Bone
that can be used from a different machine with <br>
the cryptobone GUI. While both components, the ALL-IN-ONE
Crypto Bone and the EXTERNAL Crypto Bone are distributed in
the same package, they are designed to run on different <br>
computer systems. When only one computer system is used for
the Crypto Bone, using the ALL-IN-ONE version is
recommended, because it communicates directly to the
cryptobone dae&acirc; <br>
mon via a UNIX socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After installation the external
Crypto Bone is not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the external Crypto Bone is
enabled through the program external-cryptobone-admin, the
system will create three secrets that need to be transferred
to the Linux computer on <br>
which the cryptobone GUI is used. After enabling the
external Crypto Bone, the system tries to write these
secrets to a mounted disk partition with the
&quot;BOOT&quot; label, so a USB <br>
memory key with a file system, labeled &quot;BOOT&quot;,
must be inserted in the computer when the daemon is enabled.
Use this USB partition to transfer the secrets manually to
the main <br>
computer where you run the cryptobone GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the system hosting the
external Crypto Bone boots a second time, the secrets are
reliably destroyed on this system. In normal operation the
master key used to decrypt the <br>
message key data base must be provided from outside the
system via the encrypted ssh link to the main machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The administration tool also
allows to replace the standard firewall daemon with a more
restrictive firewall configuration that isolates the machine
on which the external Crypto <br>
Bone is running as much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In additon to that the secure
shell daemon can be hardened to disallow password login and
root login via port 22. The external Crypto Bone will be
contacted via ssh using the RSA <br>
public key authentication method only. The necessary RSA
private key is one of the three secrets and must be
transferred to the main Linux computer via USB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that enabling the
restrictive firewall and hardening sshd, would impede the
use as a general-purpose computer, but that is exactly what
is intended, when a system is used <br>
as an isolated, external Crypto Bone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the external Crypto
Bone can be reset, in which case the encrypted data base and
all access information for the ssh tunnel is lost. Be extra
careful when using this <br>
reset button, because this option is for the unlikely event
that you willfully want to destroy all external Crypto Bone
data to re-start pristinely .</p>
