<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>gdnsd-plugin-geoip</b> uses MaxMind's GeoIP binary databases to map address
  and CNAME results based on geography and monitored service availability. It
  fully supports both IPv6 and the emerging edns-client-subnet standard. If a
  request contains the edns-client-subnet option with a source netmask greater
  than zero, the edns-client-subnet information will be used instead of the
  source IP of the request (the IP of the querying cache).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It supports both the legacy GeoIP1 format databases which typically end in
  <i>.dat</i> and the newer GeoIP2 format database which typically end in
  <i>.mmdb</i>. There are a few differences in the plugin's behavior depending
  on the database type in use, which are noted throughout this document. It is
  notable that what was called the singular &quot;Region&quot; in GeoIP1 is now
  multiple &quot;Subdivisions&quot; in GeoIP2. Both occupy the hierarchical
  space between &quot;Country&quot; and &quot;City&quot; level information. In
  the GeoIP2 case there can be several layers of Subdivisions, which depend
  entirely on how a Country is broken down in ISO3166-2. Assume the terms Region
  and Subdivision are interchangeable for the most part throughout this
  document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It can also be used with no GeoIP database at all, in which case the only
  network-mapping input comes from the &quot;nets&quot; config data or an
  external &quot;nets&quot; file, which explicitly map subnets to datacenter
  lists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This plugin can operate in an automatic distance-based mode (using City-level
  coordinate information rather than an external file and a Region-level db). It
  can also operate coordinate-free and rely on the user to configure a
  hierarchical map of cascading default user-location-to-datacenter mappings,
  starting at the continent level.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two modes can also be effectively mixed at geographic boundaries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each &quot;map&quot; you define (which maps geographic location codes to
  preference-ordered lists of your datacenter locations), this plugin merges all
  of the raw GeoIP subnets into the largest possible supernets which contain
  identical responses in your configuration. These in turn are used to set
  larger edns-client-subnet scope masks than you'd see simply returning raw
  GeoIP results.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PLUGIN_METAFO"><a class="selflink" href="#PLUGIN_METAFO">PLUGIN_METAFO</a></h1>
The documentation for <i>gdnsd-plugin-metafo</i>(8) is required reading for
  understanding the geoip plugin documentation here. The geoip plugin is an
  exact superset of the metafo plugin, and re-uses almost all of the metafo
  plugin's source code. Metafo does failover along a single, global, ordered
  list of datacenters. What plugin_geoip adds on top of the functionality of
  metafo is the ability to have the order of the datacenter failover list become
  dynamic per-request based on geographic hints derived from the client's
  network address.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_LOCATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_LOCATIONS">FILE
  LOCATIONS</a></h1>
The configuration of this plugin can reference several external configuration
  and/or data files. By default, all files referenced in this plugin's
  configuration are loaded from the <i>geoip</i> subdirectory of the daemon's
  configuration directory (default <i>/etc/gdnsd</i>). You can load from other
  locations by specifying absolute file paths.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_TOP-LEVEL"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_TOP-LEVEL">CONFIGURATION
  - TOP-LEVEL</a></h1>
The top level of the geoip plugin's configuration (i.e. &quot;plugins =&gt; {
  geoip =&gt; { ... } }&quot;) supports only two special keys, both of which are
  required and expanded upon in detail in the next two sections:
  &quot;maps&quot;, and &quot;resources&quot;. The &quot;maps&quot; section
  defines one or more named mappings of location information from GeoIP binary
  databases to ordered subsets of datacenter names. The &quot;resources&quot;
  section defines one or more named resources, each of which references one of
  the named maps and resolves datacenter names to specific sets of addresses or
  CNAMEs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any other keys present at this level will be inherited down inside of each
  per-resource hash inside the &quot;resources&quot; stanza, acting as
  per-resource defaults for anything not defined explicitly there.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_MAPS"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_MAPS">CONFIGURATION
  - MAPS</a></h1>
The &quot;maps&quot; stanza supports one special configuration key at the top
  level:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;city_region_names_=_region_codes.csv&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;city_region_names_=_region_codes.csv&quot;">&quot;city_region_names
  = region_codes.csv&quot;</a></h2>
String, filename, optional. GeoIP1 City databases use FIPS 10-4 codes for the
  names of Regions outside of the US and Canada, and two-letter national alpha
  codes within the US and Canada. For example the Geneve region of Switzerland
  is identified as 07 in the database. By default you would have to use these
  relatively confusing region codes in your hierarchical maps that make use of
  Region-level information (e.g. &quot;EU =&gt; { CH =&gt; { 07 =&gt; { Geneva
  =&gt; [ ... ] } } } }&quot;. If this option is specified, it points to a text
  file that maps these FIPS codes to canonical, memorable full names for clearer
  map configuration (e.g. &quot;EU =&gt; { CH =&gt; { Geneve =&gt; { Geneva
  =&gt; [ ... ] } } } }&quot;. Note that while older versions of this data did
  not map the US/Canadian two-letter alpha codes, newer versions do (e.g. TX
  -&gt; Texas).
<div class="Pp"></div>
This setting does not affect the GeoIP &quot;Region&quot; -format databases,
  which have no region codes outside of the US and Canada, and always need the
  two-letter alpha codes in the map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It also does not affect GeoIP2 databases, as they all use ISO3166-2 codes for
  subdivision (aka region) data directly, which are at least usually more
  intuitive than FIPS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The file format is a simple subset of the CSV format with 3 fields: ISO 3166-1
  country code, FIPS 10-4 region code (or two-letter alpha in US/Canada), and
  the region name in double-quotes. It is recommended you download this file
  directly from MaxMind's reference copy in this format. As of this writing, it
  is available from them at the following URL:
  &lt;http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/misc/region_codes.csv&gt;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_PER-MAP"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_PER-MAP">CONFIGURATION
  - PER-MAP</a></h1>
All other &quot;maps&quot;-level configuration keys are the names of the maps
  you choose to define. A map, conceptually, is a mapping between geography
  and/or network topology to varying ordered datacenter sub-sets. The value of
  each named map must be a hash, and the following configuration keys apply
  within:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;geoip2_db_=_GeoIP2-City.mmdb&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;geoip2_db_=_GeoIP2-City.mmdb&quot;">&quot;geoip2_db
  = GeoIP2-City.mmdb&quot;</a></h2>
String, filename, optional. This is the filename of a MaxMind GeoIP2 format
  database. It should contain either the City or Country data model. There is no
  distinction made here for the IP version, and it is normal for these databases
  to contain both IPv4 and IPv6 data together. If one or the other is missing,
  clients using that address family will be defaulted. If this parameter is set,
  then the legacy &quot;geoip_db&quot; and &quot;geoip_db_v4_overlay&quot; are
  not allowed alongside it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;geoip_db_=_GeoIPv6.dat&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;geoip_db_=_GeoIPv6.dat&quot;">&quot;geoip_db
  = GeoIPv6.dat&quot;</a></h2>
String, filename, optional. This is the filename of one of the supported MaxMind
  GeoIP1 database types. It will be reloaded at runtime (without any significant
  query interruptions) if a change to the database file is detected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;geoip_db_v4_overlay_=_GeoIP.dat&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;geoip_db_v4_overlay_=_GeoIP.dat&quot;">&quot;geoip_db_v4_overlay
  = GeoIP.dat&quot;</a></h2>
String, pathname, optional. This specifies an optional IPv4-level GeoIP1
  database to overwrite the IPv4 sub-space of the IPv6 data loaded from
  &quot;geoip_db&quot;. It must be a V4-format database, and
  &quot;geoip_db&quot; must be defined as a V6-format database. In all other
  respects, it is similar to &quot;geoip_db&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of this writing, MaxMind doesn't sell a commercial GeoIP1v6 database. What
  they offer are free IPv6 GeoLite1 database downloads, which include the IPv4
  subset in the less-accurate GeoLite1 form. This option allows you to use these
  GeoLite1v6 databases for IPv6 coverage, and then overlay your paid commercial
  GeoIP1v4 data on top for more accurate IPv4 results.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;datacenters_=_[_one,_two,_three,_..._]&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;datacenters_=_[_one,_two,_three,_..._]&quot;">&quot;datacenters
  = [ one, two, three, ... ]&quot;</a></h2>
Array of strings, required. This is the total set of datacenter names used by
  this map. You must define at least one datacenter name (although 2 or more
  would be infinitely more useful). At this time, there is a maximum limit of
  254 datacenter names per map, although this could be raised if anyone requires
  it. The order specified here is the fallback default result ordering in
  various default cases (e.g. if no explicit top-level map default list is
  given).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;city_no_region_=_true&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;city_no_region_=_true&quot;">&quot;city_no_region
  = true&quot;</a></h2>
Boolean, default &quot;false&quot;. If this key is set to &quot;true&quot; and
  the database is a City-level database, the Region/Subdivision-level
  information within it will be completely ignored for mapping purposes. Your
  hierarchical map structure will now be &quot;continent =&gt; country =&gt;
  city&quot; rather than &quot;continent =&gt; country =&gt; region/subdivision
  =&gt; city&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;nets_=_{_..._}&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;nets_=_{_..._}&quot;">&quot;nets
  = { ... }&quot;</a></h2>
Key-value hash, optional (see below for alternate form). If specified, the
  contents should be key-value pairs of &quot;network/netmask&quot; mapped to a
  datacenter name (or an array of datacenter names). Any network-to-datacenter
  mappings specified here will override mappings determined via GeoIP. Note that
  it is illegal to specify networks in the IPv4-like subspaces of IPv6 other
  than v4compat, but it is legal to specify actual IPv4 networks (which are
  treated identically to v4compat). See the section on IPv4 Compatible Addresses
  later in this document for more details. The order of the networks is
  unimportant; they will always be sorted and inserted such that an entry which
  is a subnet of another entry is not obliterated by the parent supernet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    nets =&gt; {
        10.0.0.0/8 =&gt; [ dc1, dc2 ],
        192.0.2.128/25 =&gt; dc3
        2001:DB8::/32 =&gt; [ dc4, dc5, dc6 ],
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the case that one entry is a subnet of another with a different result
  dclist, the entries are merged correctly such that the supernet surrounds the
  subnet. In the case of an exact duplicate entry (or an effective one, after
  merging smaller subnets) with a different dclist, it is arbitrary which one
  &quot;wins&quot; and the condition is warned about. If you care about this
  case, you should sanitize your nets data beforehand with an external tool
  and/or parse for the warning message in log outputs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;nets_=_nets_file_name&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;nets_=_nets_file_name&quot;">&quot;nets
  = nets_file_name&quot;</a></h2>
String pathname, optional. A variant of the above, but the contents of the
  key-value hash are loaded from the named external file. This makes life easier
  for external tools and scripts generating large sets of nets entries (e.g.
  from BGP data). The file will be monitored for changes and reloaded at runtime
  much like the GeoIP databases.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;map_=_{_..._}&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;map_=_{_..._}&quot;">&quot;map
  = { ... }&quot;</a></h2>
Key-value hash, optional. This is the heart of a named map which uses GeoIP: the
  map itself, which maps places to ordered lists of datacenters. It requires
  that &quot;geoip_db&quot; or &quot;geoip2_db&quot; is also specified, and
  makes no sense without it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a nested key-value hash. At each level, the keys are location codes
  (continent, country, region/subdivision, or city information depending on
  depth), and the values are either an ordered datacenter array (e.g. &quot;[
  dc03, dc01, dc04 ]&quot;), or a sub-hash containing a deeper level of
  distinction. At each layer, a special key named &quot;default&quot; is
  available, which sets the default for everything within the current scope. The
  top-level default itself defaults to the ordered list from
  &quot;datacenters&quot; in the normal case. If the entire &quot;map&quot;
  stanza is missing or empty, you just get the default behavior of
  &quot;default&quot;. A datacenter array can also be empty, which implies that
  this location is mapped to receive no response data (the server will still
  respond to the query, and will not issue an NXDOMAIN. It will simply be a
  NODATA/NOERROR response like you'd get if there were no records of this type,
  but could be records of other types for the same name).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The map has slightly different interpretations for GeoIP2 vs GeoIP1 databases:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">GeoIP1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The meaningful location keys at the top level are continent
      codes, of which there are primarily seven in MaxMind's databases:
      &quot;AF&quot; for Africa, &quot;AS&quot; for Asia, &quot;NA&quot; for
      North America, &quot;SA&quot; for South America, &quot;EU&quot; for
      Europe, &quot;OC&quot; for Oceania, and &quot;AN&quot; for Antarctica.
      There is also an eighth continent-level code which is, literally,
      &quot;--&quot;. This is a sort of fallback &quot;no information
      available&quot; continent code, and it contains the special country codes
      &quot;A1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;, &quot;O1&quot;, and &quot;--&quot;, which
      represent Anonymous Proxies, Satellite Providers, Other, and Unknown,
      respsectively.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The next layer (the sub-hash beneath any continent code) maps ISO-3166-1
      2-letter country codes, which as with continents can map directly to
      datacenters, or to yet another recursive layer.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The next two layers deep are for Region and City level information, only
      available from the Region and City type databases. The Region database
      type only provides region information for the US and Canada, using the
      standard local 2-letter abbreviations (e.g. AB for Alberta, OK for
      Oklahama). The City databases use those same region abbreviations for the
      US and Canada, but use either FIPS 10-4 2-letter codes or full region
      names for the rest of the world's regions (as detailed earlier in, and
      controlled by, the &quot;city_region_names&quot; option).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The actual City names at the final layer appear to be encoded using some
      form of ISO8859-1 and/or CP1252 character set in the databases themselves,
      and your map entries will have to match byte-for-byte in the case of
      non-ASCII characters. May come up with a better solution for this down the
      road.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">GeoIP2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">As with GeoIP1, the top level of the hierarchy is comprised
      of MaxMind's seven continent codes: &quot;AF&quot; for Africa,
      &quot;AS&quot; for Asia, &quot;NA&quot; for North America, &quot;SA&quot;
      for South America, &quot;EU&quot; for Europe, &quot;OC&quot; for Oceania,
      and &quot;AN&quot; for Antarctica. There is no special &quot;--&quot;
      continent for various types of unknowns; those database entries that lack
      some or all information at this level simply take the appropriate defaults
      for the level of detail they possess.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The next level, again as in GeoIP1, is the ISO 3166-1 2-letter country code.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    From here GeoIP2 has a number of Subdivision levels, the count of which
      varies for different network database entries. In the US, for example,
      there is only one level of subdivision data for the US States. In the
      Czech Republic there are two levels of subdivision: first into 14 regions,
      and then further into 91 districts. Subdivisions are all specified using
      their ISO 3166-2 codes directly.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    After all subdivision levels, the final level is the City level. The City
      names are all in the UTF-8 character set. Currently this plugin only uses
      the English city names from the database, even though other languages may
      be available depending on the database.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As a pragmatic answer to the issues that can arise with multiple subdivision
      layers, in the GeoIP2 case the map automatically searches deeper in the
      database data when no map match is found at a given level of the map
      hierarchy beneath the Country level. This means you can skip over any
      levels of Subdivision detail in your map that are irrelevant to you. This
      mostly supplants the practical need for the &quot;city_no_region&quot; and
      &quot;skip_level&quot; functionality that was used with GeoIP1 maps, but
      those features remain functional as well.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, this targets the New Zealand regional council subdivision of
      Otago without explicitly specifying the enclosing subdivision for the
      South Island:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  { OC =&gt; { NZ =&gt; { OTA =&gt; [...] } } }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As another example, this works correctly for targeting the city of Paris
      without caring about what layers of subdivisions lie between it and FR:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  { EU =&gt; { FR =&gt; { Paris =&gt; [...] } } }
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also one other special key (aside from &quot;default&quot;) available
  at all levels of the map hierarchy, a boolean named &quot;skip_level&quot;,
  default &quot;false&quot;. If set within the hierarchical &quot;map&quot; at
  any layer, it causes the next layer of detail to be skipped for this portion
  of the map. For example, setting this at the very top layer would mean that
  the top layer would contain country-level codes directly, without an enclosing
  continent-level hierarchy. Setting it within a country would mean that city
  names are used directly within that country, without an intervening layer of
  region names. This option is not aware of the &quot;city_no_region&quot;
  option, so e.g. setting that option and specifying &quot;skip_level&quot; at
  the country-level would result in no further information being available
  within that country (as &quot;skip_level&quot; would skip the remaining layer
  of city data).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_MAPS_-_CITY_AUTO_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_MAPS_-_CITY_AUTO_MODE">CONFIGURATION
  - MAPS - CITY AUTO MODE</a></h1>
&quot;City-auto-mode&quot; is a special mode of operation that automatically
  maps out the world to your datacenters based on coordinate math, so that you
  don't have to manually construct a complex hierarchical &quot;map&quot;. It
  can still be mixed with &quot;map&quot; of course, allowing you to use
  auto-mode for only select geographic areas if you wish (or disabling it for
  select areas by specifying manual lists). The key parameter is
  &quot;auto_dc_coords&quot;, which enables city-auto-mode.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;auto_dc_coords = { ... }&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Key-value hash, optional. If this option is specified, the
      whole map's basic mode of operation changes to &quot;city-auto-mode&quot;.
      The contents of the hash are a key for each datacenter named in
      &quot;datacenters&quot;, with their values set to an array of &quot;[lat,
      lon]&quot; in decimal degree units. When city-auto-mode is enabled by
      this, the following configuration-validation changes occur from the
      default, static-mapping mode: the loaded GeoIP database(s) are required be
      City-level databases, and the special keyword &quot;auto&quot; becomes a
      legal &quot;datacenter list&quot; in the &quot;map&quot; stanza.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With city-auto-mode enabled, the top-level map &quot;default&quot; defaults
      to &quot;auto&quot;, but can be overridden with a manual list. For any
      location that maps to &quot;auto&quot;, the coordinates specified here in
      &quot;auto_dc_coords&quot; will be compared with the coordinates from the
      City-level database(s) to determine an automatic distance-sorted
      datacenter list.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you omit one or more defined datacenters from the coordinate list in
      &quot;auto_dc_coords&quot;, those datacenters will not be used in
      automatic results, but will still be available for manual use via
      &quot;map&quot; and/or &quot;nets&quot; entries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;auto_dc_limit = N&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Unsigned integer, optional, default 3. When city-auto-mode
      is in effect, this is the upper length limit for auto-generated lists. 3
      is a reasonable default even if you have a considerably longer set of
      datacenters, as this provides a primary as well as two fallbacks. Raising
      this to a large number in the presence of a long datacenter list will
      cause the set of unique result datacenter lists to increase rapidly, and
      thus reduce the optimization of the final result database for
      edns-client-subnet purposes. It's really not worth raising this value in
      almost any case, unless you really need to handle more than 3 random
      datacenters going offline at the same time and still have clients fail
      elsewhere. The value zero is treated as unlimited (highly
    un-recommended).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under city-auto-mode, when the top-level default is (explicitly or implicitly)
  &quot;auto&quot;, there is still a fallback static ordering which is the whole
  ordered &quot;datacenters&quot; list, which is the normal static default
  &quot;default&quot; when not in city-auto-mode. This fallback is used when no
  location information is available at all (e.g. IPv6 client vs IPv4 GeoIP DB,
  Anonymous Proxies, etc).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MAP_TESTING"><a class="selflink" href="#MAP_TESTING">MAP
  TESTING</a></h1>
A binary program &quot;gdnsd_geoip_test&quot; is included. This can be used
  directly from the commandline, parses the relevant bits of your gdnsd config
  file for geoip map info, and then provides datacenter list results for IP
  address + map combinations supplied by the user. Useful for debugging your
  maps and testing the mapping of client IPs. It has a separate manpage
  <i>gdnsd_geoip_test</i>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_-_RESOURCES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_-_RESOURCES">CONFIGURATION
  - RESOURCES</a></h1>
Resource-level configuration within the &quot;resources&quot; stanza is nearly
  identical to the resources configuration of the metafo plugin, with all of the
  same basic behaviors about synthesizing or directly referencing the
  configuration of other plugins per-datacenter. The only real difference is
  that metafo's per-resource &quot;datacenters&quot; array is replaced with
  &quot;map =&gt; mapname&quot;, which references one of the maps defined in the
  &quot;maps&quot; stanza, described in detail earlier. The set of defined
  datacenters in the &quot;dcmap&quot; stanza must match the total set of
  datacenters defined by the referenced map.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="META-PLUGIN_INTERACTION"><a class="selflink" href="#META-PLUGIN_INTERACTION">META-PLUGIN
  INTERACTION</a></h1>
Both of the meta-plugins (&quot;metafo&quot; and &quot;geoip&quot;) can
  reference their own as well as each others' resources by direct reference
  within a &quot;dcmap&quot;, so long as a resource does not directly refer to
  itself. This allows plugin-layering configurations such as geoip -&gt; metafo
  -&gt; weighted, or metafo -&gt; geoip -&gt; multifo, or even metafo -&gt;
  metafo -&gt; simplefo, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bear in mind that once you begin using inter-meta-plugin references, you could
  create a reference loop. gdnsd does not currently detect or prevent such
  loops, and they will cause complete runtime failure when queried, probably by
  running out of stack space during recursion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, &quot;geoip&quot; can synthesize configuration for
  &quot;metafo&quot; resources, but the reverse does not hold;
  &quot;metafo&quot; cannot synthesize configuration for &quot;geoip&quot;
  resources.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IPv4_Compatible_Addresses"><a class="selflink" href="#IPv4_Compatible_Addresses">IPv4
  Compatible Addresses</a></h1>
This plugin knows of six different relatively-trivial ways to map IPv4 addresses
  into the IPv6 address space. These are shown below in as much detail matters
  to this plugin, with &quot;NNNN:NNNN&quot; in place of the copied IPv4 address
  bytes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
         ::0000:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 4291 - v4compat (deprecated)
         ::ffff:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 4291 - v4mapped
    ::ffff:0000:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 2765 - SIIT (obsoleted)
       64:ff9b::NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 6052 - Well-Known Prefix
    2001:0000:X:NNNN:NNNN/32   # RFC 4380 - Teredo (IPv4 bits are flipped)
           2002:NNNN:NNNN::/16 # RFC 3056 - 6to4
    (in the Teredo case above, &quot;X&quot; represents some variable non-zero bytes
     that occupy the center 64 bits of the address).
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of this plugin's internal lookup databases are IPv6 databases, and any
  IPv4-like information is always stored in the v4compat space within these
  databases. When doing runtime lookups all other v4-like addresses (raw IPv4
  addresses, v4mapped, SIIT, WKP, Teredo, and 6to4) are converted to the
  canonical v4compat IPv6 representation before querying the internal databases.
  The other representations (v4mapped, SIIT, WKP, Teredo, 6to4) are Undefined
  internally, and will never be referenced at lookup-time due to the v4compat
  conversion mentioned earlier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;nets&quot; stanza is not allowed to specify entries in the four
  undefined v4-like IPv6 spaces (those other than v4compat). Specify those
  networks as normal IPv4 networks or v4compat networks instead. Legitimate IPv6
  &quot;nets&quot; entries which happen to be a supernet of any v4-like spaces
  will *not* unduly affect v4-like lookups. There is no functional difference
  between v4compat and native v4 forms in &quot;nets&quot;, e.g.
  &quot;192.0.2.0/24&quot; and &quot;::C000:0200/120&quot; are completely
  identical.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GeoIP databases that are natively IPv4-only get all of their data loaded into
  the v4compat space only. For IPv6 GeoIP databases, by default we load the
  v4compat space directly (which is where MaxMind stores IPv4 data in their IPv6
  databases), but ignore the v4mapped/SIIT/Teredo/6to4 spaces (some of which are
  empty in MaxMind's databases, and some of which simply alias the v4compat
  space). When using an IPv6 GeoIP database combined with an IPv4 GeoIP overlay
  (geoip_db_v4_overlay config), the v4compat space of the IPv6 database is also
  ignored on loading, and the direct IPv4 data from the IPv4 databasee takes its
  place.
