<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gdnsd-plugin-geoip uses MaxMind&rsquo;s GeoIP binary
databases to map address and CNAME results based on
geography and monitored service availability. It fully
supports both IPv6 and <br>
the emerging edns-client-subnet standard. If a request
contains the edns-client-subnet option with a source netmask
greater than zero, the edns-client-subnet information will
be <br>
used instead of the source IP of the request (the IP of the
querying cache).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It supports both the legacy
GeoIP1 format databases which typically end in .dat and the
newer GeoIP2 format database which typically end in .mmdb.
There are a few differences in <br>
the plugin&rsquo;s behavior depending on the database type
in use, which are noted throughout this document. It is
notable that what was called the singular &quot;Region&quot;
in GeoIP1 is now <br>
multiple &quot;Subdivisions&quot; in GeoIP2. Both occupy the
hierarchical space between &quot;Country&quot; and
&quot;City&quot; level information. In the GeoIP2 case there
can be several layers of <br>
Subdivisions, which depend entirely on how a Country is
broken down in ISO3166-2. Assume the terms Region and
Subdivision are interchangeable for the most part throughout
this <br>
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can also be used with no
GeoIP database at all, in which case the only
network-mapping input comes from the &quot;nets&quot; config
data or an external &quot;nets&quot; file, which explicitly
map <br>
subnets to datacenter lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin can operate in an
automatic distance-based mode (using City-level coordinate
information rather than an external file and a Region-level
db). It can also operate <br>
coordinate-free and rely on the user to configure a
hierarchical map of cascading default
user-location-to-datacenter mappings, starting at the
continent level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two modes can also be
effectively mixed at geographic boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each &quot;map&quot; you
define (which maps geographic location codes to
preference-ordered lists of your datacenter locations), this
plugin merges all of the raw GeoIP subnets into <br>
the largest possible supernets which contain identical
responses in your configuration. These in turn are used to
set larger edns-client-subnet scope masks than you&rsquo;d
see simply <br>
returning raw GeoIP results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLUGIN_METAFO <br>
The documentation for gdnsd-plugin-metafo(8) is required
reading for understanding the geoip plugin documentation
here. The geoip plugin is an exact superset of the metafo
<br>
plugin, and re-uses almost all of the metafo plugin&rsquo;s
source code. Metafo does failover along a single, global,
ordered list of datacenters. What plugin_geoip adds on top
of <br>
the functionality of metafo is the ability to have the order
of the datacenter failover list become dynamic per-request
based on geographic hints derived from the client&rsquo;s
<br>
network address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE LOCATIONS <br>
The configuration of this plugin can reference several
external configuration and/or data files. By default, all
files referenced in this plugin&rsquo;s configuration are
loaded from <br>
the geoip subdirectory of the daemon&rsquo;s configuration
directory (default /etc/gdnsd). You can load from other
locations by specifying absolute file paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - TOP-LEVEL <br>
The top level of the geoip plugin&rsquo;s configuration
(i.e. &quot;plugins =&gt; { geoip =&gt; { ... } }&quot;)
supports only two special keys, both of which are required
and expanded upon in detail <br>
in the next two sections: &quot;maps&quot;, and
&quot;resources&quot;. The &quot;maps&quot; section defines
one or more named mappings of location information from
GeoIP binary databases to ordered subsets <br>
of datacenter names. The &quot;resources&quot; section
defines one or more named resources, each of which
references one of the named maps and resolves datacenter
names to specific sets <br>
of addresses or CNAMEs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other keys present at this
level will be inherited down inside of each per-resource
hash inside the &quot;resources&quot; stanza, acting as
per-resource defaults for anything not <br>
defined explicitly there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - MAPS <br>
The &quot;maps&quot; stanza supports one special
configuration key at the top level:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;city_region_names =
region_codes.csv&quot; <br>
String, filename, optional. GeoIP1 City databases use FIPS
10-4 codes for the names of Regions outside of the US and
Canada, and two-letter national alpha codes within the US
<br>
and Canada. For example the Geneve region of Switzerland is
identified as 07 in the database. By default you would have
to use these relatively confusing region codes in your <br>
hierarchical maps that make use of Region-level information
(e.g. &quot;EU =&gt; { CH =&gt; { 07 =&gt; { Geneva =&gt; [
... ] } } } }&quot;. If this option is specified, it points
to a text file that <br>
maps these FIPS codes to canonical, memorable full names for
clearer map configuration (e.g. &quot;EU =&gt; { CH =&gt; {
Geneve =&gt; { Geneva =&gt; [ ... ] } } } }&quot;. Note that
while older <br>
versions of this data did not map the US/Canadian two-letter
alpha codes, newer versions do (e.g. TX -&gt; Texas).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting does not affect the
GeoIP &quot;Region&quot; -format databases, which have no
region codes outside of the US and Canada, and always need
the two-letter alpha codes in the map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also does not affect GeoIP2
databases, as they all use ISO3166-2 codes for subdivision
(aka region) data directly, which are at least usually more
intuitive than FIPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file format is a simple
subset of the CSV format with 3 fields: ISO 3166-1 country
code, FIPS 10-4 region code (or two-letter alpha in
US/Canada), and the region name in <br>
double-quotes. It is recommended you download this file
directly from MaxMind&rsquo;s reference copy in this format.
As of this writing, it is available from them at the
following <br>
URL:
&lt;http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/misc/region_codes.csv&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - PER-MAP <br>
All other &quot;maps&quot;-level configuration keys are the
names of the maps you choose to define. A map, conceptually,
is a mapping between geography and/or network topology to
varying <br>
ordered datacenter sub-sets. The value of each named map
must be a hash, and the following configuration keys apply
within:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;geoip2_db =
GeoIP2-City.mmdb&quot; <br>
String, filename, optional. This is the filename of a
MaxMind GeoIP2 format database. It should contain either the
City or Country data model. There is no distinction made
<br>
here for the IP version, and it is normal for these
databases to contain both IPv4 and IPv6 data together. If
one or the other is missing, clients using that address
family will <br>
be defaulted. If this parameter is set, then the legacy
&quot;geoip_db&quot; and &quot;geoip_db_v4_overlay&quot; are
not allowed alongside it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;geoip_db =
GeoIPv6.dat&quot; <br>
String, filename, optional. This is the filename of one of
the supported MaxMind GeoIP1 database types. It will be
reloaded at runtime (without any significant query <br>
interruptions) if a change to the database file is
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;geoip_db_v4_overlay =
GeoIP.dat&quot; <br>
String, pathname, optional. This specifies an optional
IPv4-level GeoIP1 database to overwrite the IPv4 sub-space
of the IPv6 data loaded from &quot;geoip_db&quot;. It must
be a <br>
V4-format database, and &quot;geoip_db&quot; must be defined
as a V6-format database. In all other respects, it is
similar to &quot;geoip_db&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of this writing, MaxMind
doesn&rsquo;t sell a commercial GeoIP1v6 database. What they
offer are free IPv6 GeoLite1 database downloads, which
include the IPv4 subset in the less- <br>
accurate GeoLite1 form. This option allows you to use these
GeoLite1v6 databases for IPv6 coverage, and then overlay
your paid commercial GeoIP1v4 data on top for more accurate
<br>
IPv4 results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;datacenters = [ one, two,
three, ... ]&quot; <br>
Array of strings, required. This is the total set of
datacenter names used by this map. You must define at least
one datacenter name (although 2 or more would be infinitely
<br>
more useful). At this time, there is a maximum limit of 254
datacenter names per map, although this could be raised if
anyone requires it. The order specified here is the <br>
fallback default result ordering in various default cases
(e.g. if no explicit top-level map default list is
given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;city_no_region =
true&quot; <br>
Boolean, default &quot;false&quot;. If this key is set to
&quot;true&quot; and the database is a City-level database,
the Region/Subdivision-level information within it will be
completely ignored <br>
for mapping purposes. Your hierarchical map structure will
now be &quot;continent =&gt; country =&gt; city&quot; rather
than &quot;continent =&gt; country =&gt; region/subdivision
=&gt; city&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;nets = { ... }&quot; <br>
Key-value hash, optional (see below for alternate form). If
specified, the contents should be key-value pairs of
&quot;network/netmask&quot; mapped to a datacenter name (or
an array of <br>
datacenter names). Any network-to-datacenter mappings
specified here will override mappings determined via GeoIP.
Note that it is illegal to specify networks in the IPv4-like
<br>
subspaces of IPv6 other than v4compat, but it is legal to
specify actual IPv4 networks (which are treated identically
to v4compat). See the section on IPv4 Compatible Addresses
<br>
later in this document for more details. The order of the
networks is unimportant; they will always be sorted and
inserted such that an entry which is a subnet of another
entry <br>
is not obliterated by the parent supernet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nets =&gt; { <br>
10.0.0.0/8 =&gt; [ dc1, dc2 ], <br>
192.0.2.128/25 =&gt; dc3 <br>
2001:DB8::/32 =&gt; [ dc4, dc5, dc6 ], <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case that one entry is a
subnet of another with a different result dclist, the
entries are merged correctly such that the supernet
surrounds the subnet. In the case of an <br>
exact duplicate entry (or an effective one, after merging
smaller subnets) with a different dclist, it is arbitrary
which one &quot;wins&quot; and the condition is warned
about. If you <br>
care about this case, you should sanitize your nets data
beforehand with an external tool and/or parse for the
warning message in log outputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;nets =
nets_file_name&quot; <br>
String pathname, optional. A variant of the above, but the
contents of the key-value hash are loaded from the named
external file. This makes life easier for external tools and
<br>
scripts generating large sets of nets entries (e.g. from BGP
data). The file will be monitored for changes and reloaded
at runtime much like the GeoIP databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;map = { ... }&quot; <br>
Key-value hash, optional. This is the heart of a named map
which uses GeoIP: the map itself, which maps places to
ordered lists of datacenters. It requires that
&quot;geoip_db&quot; or <br>
&quot;geoip2_db&quot; is also specified, and makes no sense
without it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a nested key-value hash.
At each level, the keys are location codes (continent,
country, region/subdivision, or city information depending
on depth), and the values are <br>
either an ordered datacenter array (e.g. &quot;[ dc03, dc01,
dc04 ]&quot;), or a sub-hash containing a deeper level of
distinction. At each layer, a special key named
&quot;default&quot; is <br>
available, which sets the default for everything within the
current scope. The top-level default itself defaults to the
ordered list from &quot;datacenters&quot; in the normal
case. If <br>
the entire &quot;map&quot; stanza is missing or empty, you
just get the default behavior of &quot;default&quot;. A
datacenter array can also be empty, which implies that this
location is mapped to <br>
receive no response data (the server will still respond to
the query, and will not issue an NXDOMAIN. It will simply be
a NODATA/NOERROR response like you&rsquo;d get if there were
no <br>
records of this type, but could be records of other types
for the same name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The map has slightly different
interpretations for GeoIP2 vs GeoIP1 databases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeoIP1 <br>
The meaningful location keys at the top level are continent
codes, of which there are primarily seven in MaxMind&rsquo;s
databases: &quot;AF&quot; for Africa, &quot;AS&quot; for
Asia, &quot;NA&quot; for North <br>
America, &quot;SA&quot; for South America, &quot;EU&quot;
for Europe, &quot;OC&quot; for Oceania, and &quot;AN&quot;
for Antarctica. There is also an eighth continent-level code
which is, literally, &quot;--&quot;. This is <br>
a sort of fallback &quot;no information available&quot;
continent code, and it contains the special country codes
&quot;A1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;, &quot;O1&quot;, and
&quot;--&quot;, which represent Anonymous Proxies, <br>
Satellite Providers, Other, and Unknown, respsectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next layer (the sub-hash
beneath any continent code) maps ISO-3166-1 2-letter country
codes, which as with continents can map directly to
datacenters, or to yet another <br>
recursive layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next two layers deep are for
Region and City level information, only available from the
Region and City type databases. The Region database type
only provides region <br>
information for the US and Canada, using the standard local
2-letter abbreviations (e.g. AB for Alberta, OK for
Oklahama). The City databases use those same region <br>
abbreviations for the US and Canada, but use either FIPS
10-4 2-letter codes or full region names for the rest of the
world&rsquo;s regions (as detailed earlier in, and
controlled <br>
by, the &quot;city_region_names&quot; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual City names at the
final layer appear to be encoded using some form of
ISO8859-1 and/or CP1252 character set in the databases
themselves, and your map entries will <br>
have to match byte-for-byte in the case of non-ASCII
characters. May come up with a better solution for this down
the road.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeoIP2 <br>
As with GeoIP1, the top level of the hierarchy is comprised
of MaxMind&rsquo;s seven continent codes: &quot;AF&quot; for
Africa, &quot;AS&quot; for Asia, &quot;NA&quot; for North
America, &quot;SA&quot; for South <br>
America, &quot;EU&quot; for Europe, &quot;OC&quot; for
Oceania, and &quot;AN&quot; for Antarctica. There is no
special &quot;--&quot; continent for various types of
unknowns; those database entries that lack some <br>
or all information at this level simply take the appropriate
defaults for the level of detail they possess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next level, again as in
GeoIP1, is the ISO 3166-1 2-letter country code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From here GeoIP2 has a number of
Subdivision levels, the count of which varies for different
network database entries. In the US, for example, there is
only one level of <br>
subdivision data for the US States. In the Czech Republic
there are two levels of subdivision: first into 14 regions,
and then further into 91 districts. Subdivisions are <br>
all specified using their ISO 3166-2 codes directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After all subdivision levels,
the final level is the City level. The City names are all in
the UTF-8 character set. Currently this plugin only uses the
English city names <br>
from the database, even though other languages may be
available depending on the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a pragmatic answer to the
issues that can arise with multiple subdivision layers, in
the GeoIP2 case the map automatically searches deeper in the
database data when no map <br>
match is found at a given level of the map hierarchy beneath
the Country level. This means you can skip over any levels
of Subdivision detail in your map that are irrelevant <br>
to you. This mostly supplants the practical need for the
&quot;city_no_region&quot; and &quot;skip_level&quot;
functionality that was used with GeoIP1 maps, but those
features remain functional <br>
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, this targets the
New Zealand regional council subdivision of Otago without
explicitly specifying the enclosing subdivision for the
South Island:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ OC =&gt; { NZ =&gt; { OTA
=&gt; [...] } } }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As another example, this works
correctly for targeting the city of Paris without caring
about what layers of subdivisions lie between it and FR:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ EU =&gt; { FR =&gt; { Paris
=&gt; [...] } } }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also one other special
key (aside from &quot;default&quot;) available at all levels
of the map hierarchy, a boolean named
&quot;skip_level&quot;, default &quot;false&quot;. If set
within the <br>
hierarchical &quot;map&quot; at any layer, it causes the
next layer of detail to be skipped for this portion of the
map. For example, setting this at the very top layer would
mean that <br>
the top layer would contain country-level codes directly,
without an enclosing continent-level hierarchy. Setting it
within a country would mean that city names are used <br>
directly within that country, without an intervening layer
of region names. This option is not aware of the
&quot;city_no_region&quot; option, so e.g. setting that
option and specifying <br>
&quot;skip_level&quot; at the country-level would result in
no further information being available within that country
(as &quot;skip_level&quot; would skip the remaining layer of
city data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - MAPS - CITY AUTO
MODE <br>
&quot;City-auto-mode&quot; is a special mode of operation
that automatically maps out the world to your datacenters
based on coordinate math, so that you don&rsquo;t have to
manually construct a <br>
complex hierarchical &quot;map&quot;. It can still be mixed
with &quot;map&quot; of course, allowing you to use
auto-mode for only select geographic areas if you wish (or
disabling it for select <br>
areas by specifying manual lists). The key parameter is
&quot;auto_dc_coords&quot;, which enables
city-auto-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;auto_dc_coords = { ...
}&quot; <br>
Key-value hash, optional. If this option is specified, the
whole map&rsquo;s basic mode of operation changes to
&quot;city-auto-mode&quot;. The contents of the hash are a
key for each <br>
datacenter named in &quot;datacenters&quot;, with their
values set to an array of &quot;[lat, lon]&quot; in decimal
degree units. When city-auto-mode is enabled by this, the
following <br>
configuration-validation changes occur from the default,
static-mapping mode: the loaded GeoIP database(s) are
required be City-level databases, and the special keyword
<br>
&quot;auto&quot; becomes a legal &quot;datacenter list&quot;
in the &quot;map&quot; stanza.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With city-auto-mode enabled, the
top-level map &quot;default&quot; defaults to
&quot;auto&quot;, but can be overridden with a manual list.
For any location that maps to &quot;auto&quot;, the
coordinates <br>
specified here in &quot;auto_dc_coords&quot; will be
compared with the coordinates from the City-level
database(s) to determine an automatic distance-sorted
datacenter list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you omit one or more defined
datacenters from the coordinate list in
&quot;auto_dc_coords&quot;, those datacenters will not be
used in automatic results, but will still be available <br>
for manual use via &quot;map&quot; and/or &quot;nets&quot;
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;auto_dc_limit = N&quot;
<br>
Unsigned integer, optional, default 3. When city-auto-mode
is in effect, this is the upper length limit for
auto-generated lists. 3 is a reasonable default even if you
have <br>
a considerably longer set of datacenters, as this provides a
primary as well as two fallbacks. Raising this to a large
number in the presence of a long datacenter list will <br>
cause the set of unique result datacenter lists to increase
rapidly, and thus reduce the optimization of the final
result database for edns-client-subnet purposes. It&rsquo;s
<br>
really not worth raising this value in almost any case,
unless you really need to handle more than 3 random
datacenters going offline at the same time and still have
clients <br>
fail elsewhere. The value zero is treated as unlimited
(highly un-recommended).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under city-auto-mode, when the
top-level default is (explicitly or implicitly)
&quot;auto&quot;, there is still a fallback static ordering
which is the whole ordered &quot;datacenters&quot; list,
<br>
which is the normal static default &quot;default&quot; when
not in city-auto-mode. This fallback is used when no
location information is available at all (e.g. IPv6 client
vs IPv4 GeoIP <br>
DB, Anonymous Proxies, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAP TESTING <br>
A binary program &quot;gdnsd_geoip_test&quot; is included.
This can be used directly from the commandline, parses the
relevant bits of your gdnsd config file for geoip map info,
and then <br>
provides datacenter list results for IP address + map
combinations supplied by the user. Useful for debugging your
maps and testing the mapping of client IPs. It has a
separate <br>
manpage gdnsd_geoip_test(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION - RESOURCES <br>
Resource-level configuration within the
&quot;resources&quot; stanza is nearly identical to the
resources configuration of the metafo plugin, with all of
the same basic behaviors about <br>
synthesizing or directly referencing the configuration of
other plugins per-datacenter. The only real difference is
that metafo&rsquo;s per-resource &quot;datacenters&quot;
array is replaced <br>
with &quot;map =&gt; mapname&quot;, which references one of
the maps defined in the &quot;maps&quot; stanza, described
in detail earlier. The set of defined datacenters in the
&quot;dcmap&quot; stanza must <br>
match the total set of datacenters defined by the referenced
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">META-PLUGIN INTERACTION <br>
Both of the meta-plugins (&quot;metafo&quot; and
&quot;geoip&quot;) can reference their own as well as each
others&rsquo; resources by direct reference within a
&quot;dcmap&quot;, so long as a resource does not <br>
directly refer to itself. This allows plugin-layering
configurations such as geoip -&gt; metafo -&gt; weighted, or
metafo -&gt; geoip -&gt; multifo, or even metafo -&gt;
metafo -&gt; simplefo, <br>
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bear in mind that once you begin
using inter-meta-plugin references, you could create a
reference loop. gdnsd does not currently detect or prevent
such loops, and they will <br>
cause complete runtime failure when queried, probably by
running out of stack space during recursion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, &quot;geoip&quot;
can synthesize configuration for &quot;metafo&quot;
resources, but the reverse does not hold; &quot;metafo&quot;
cannot synthesize configuration for &quot;geoip&quot;
resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv4 Compatible Addresses <br>
This plugin knows of six different relatively-trivial ways
to map IPv4 addresses into the IPv6 address space. These are
shown below in as much detail matters to this plugin, <br>
with &quot;NNNN:NNNN&quot; in place of the copied IPv4
address bytes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">::0000:NNNN:NNNN/96 # RFC 4291 -
v4compat (deprecated) <br>
::ffff:NNNN:NNNN/96 # RFC 4291 - v4mapped <br>
::ffff:0000:NNNN:NNNN/96 # RFC 2765 - SIIT (obsoleted) <br>
64:ff9b::NNNN:NNNN/96 # RFC 6052 - Well-Known Prefix <br>
2001:0000:X:NNNN:NNNN/32 # RFC 4380 - Teredo (IPv4 bits are
flipped) <br>
2002:NNNN:NNNN::/16 # RFC 3056 - 6to4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(in the Teredo case above,
&quot;X&quot; represents some variable non-zero bytes <br>
that occupy the center 64 bits of the address).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of this plugin&rsquo;s
internal lookup databases are IPv6 databases, and any
IPv4-like information is always stored in the v4compat space
within these databases. When doing <br>
runtime lookups all other v4-like addresses (raw IPv4
addresses, v4mapped, SIIT, WKP, Teredo, and 6to4) are
converted to the canonical v4compat IPv6 representation
before <br>
querying the internal databases. The other representations
(v4mapped, SIIT, WKP, Teredo, 6to4) are Undefined
internally, and will never be referenced at lookup-time due
to the <br>
v4compat conversion mentioned earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;nets&quot; stanza is
not allowed to specify entries in the four undefined v4-like
IPv6 spaces (those other than v4compat). Specify those
networks as normal IPv4 networks or <br>
v4compat networks instead. Legitimate IPv6 &quot;nets&quot;
entries which happen to be a supernet of any v4-like spaces
will *not* unduly affect v4-like lookups. There is no
functional <br>
difference between v4compat and native v4 forms in
&quot;nets&quot;, e.g. &quot;192.0.2.0/24&quot; and
&quot;::C000:0200/120&quot; are completely identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeoIP databases that are
natively IPv4-only get all of their data loaded into the
v4compat space only. For IPv6 GeoIP databases, by default we
load the v4compat space directly <br>
(which is where MaxMind stores IPv4 data in their IPv6
databases), but ignore the v4mapped/SIIT/Teredo/6to4 spaces
(some of which are empty in MaxMind&rsquo;s databases, and
some of <br>
which simply alias the v4compat space). When using an IPv6
GeoIP database combined with an IPv4 GeoIP overlay
(geoip_db_v4_overlay config), the v4compat space of the IPv6
<br>
database is also ignored on loading, and the direct IPv4
data from the IPv4 databasee takes its place.</p>
