<p>LD.SO(8) Linux Programmer&rsquo;s Manual LD.SO(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ld.so, ld-linux.so* - dynamic linker/loader</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
The dynamic linker can be run either indirectly by running
some dynamically linked program or shared object (in which
case no command-line options to the dynamic linker can be
<br>
passed and, in the ELF case, the dynamic linker which is
stored in the .interp section of the program is executed) or
directly by running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib/ld-linux.so.* [OPTIONS]
[PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The programs ld.so and ld-linux.so* find and load the shared
objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare the
program to run, and then run it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux binaries require dynamic
linking (linking at run time) unless the -static option was
given to ld(1) during compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program ld.so handles a.out
binaries, a format used long ago; ld-linux.so* handles ELF
(/lib/ld-linux.so.1 for libc5, /lib/ld-linux.so.2 for
glibc2), which everybody has been <br>
using for years now. Otherwise, both have the same behavior,
and use the same support files and programs ldd(1),
ldconfig(8), and /etc/ld.so.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When resolving shared object
dependencies, the dynamic linker first inspects each
dependency string to see if it contains a slash (this can
occur if a shared object pathname con&acirc; <br>
taining slashes was specified at link time). If a slash is
found, then the dependency string is interpreted as a
(relative or absolute) pathname, and the shared object is
loaded <br>
using that pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a shared object dependency
does not contain a slash, then it is searched for in the
following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o (ELF only) Using the
directories specified in the DT_RPATH dynamic section
attribute of the binary if present and DT_RUNPATH attribute
does not exist. Use of DT_RPATH is dep&acirc; <br>
recated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Using the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unless the executable is being run in
secure-execution mode; see below). in which case it is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o (ELF only) Using the
directories specified in the DT_RUNPATH dynamic section
attribute of the binary if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o From the cache file
/etc/ld.so.cache, which contains a compiled list of
candidate shared objects previously found in the augmented
library path. If, however, the binary was <br>
linked with the -z nodeflib linker option, shared objects in
the default paths are skipped. Shared objects installed in
hardware capability directories (see below) are pre&acirc;
<br>
ferred to other shared objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In the default path /lib, and
then /usr/lib. (On some 64-bit architectures, the default
paths for 64-bit shared objects are /lib64, and then
/usr/lib64.) If the binary was <br>
linked with the -z nodeflib linker option, this step is
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rpath token expansion <br>
ld.so understands certain strings in an rpath specification
(DT_RPATH or DT_RUNPATH); those strings are substituted as
follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ORIGIN (or equivalently
${ORIGIN}) <br>
This expands to the directory containing the program or
shared object. Thus, an application located in somedir/app
could be compiled with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc
-Wl,-rpath,&rsquo;$ORIGIN/../lib&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so that it finds an associated
shared object in somedir/lib no matter where somedir is
located in the directory hierarchy. This facilitates the
creation of &quot;turn-key&quot; <br>
applications that do not need to be installed into special
directories, but can instead be unpacked into any directory
and still find their own shared objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LIB (or equivalently ${LIB})
<br>
This expands to lib or lib64 depending on the architecture
(e.g., on x86-64, it expands to lib64 and on x86-32, it
expands to lib).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PLATFORM (or equivalently
${PLATFORM}) <br>
This expands to a string corresponding to the processor type
of the host system (e.g., &quot;x86_64&quot;). On some
architectures, the Linux kernel doesn&rsquo;t provide a
platform <br>
string to the dynamic linker. The value of this string is
taken from the AT_PLATFORM value in the auxiliary vector
(see getauxval(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--list List all dependencies and how they are resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify <br>
Verify that program is dynamically linked and this dynamic
linker can handle it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inhibit-cache <br>
Do not use /etc/ld.so.cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--library-path path <br>
Use path instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
setting (see below). The names ORIGIN, LIB, and PLATFORM are
interpreted as for the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inhibit-rpath list <br>
Ignore RPATH and RUNPATH information in object names in
list. This option is ignored when running in
secure-execution mode (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--audit list <br>
Use objects named in list as auditors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Various environment variables influence the operation of the
dynamic linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secure-execution mode <br>
For security reasons, the effects of some environment
variables are voided or modified if the dynamic linker
determines that the binary should be run in secure-execution
mode. <br>
This determination is made by checking whether the AT_SECURE
entry in the auxiliary vector (see getauxval(3)) has a
nonzero value. This entry may have a nonzero value for
vari&acirc; <br>
ous reasons, including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The process&rsquo;s real and
effective user IDs differ, or the real and effective group
IDs differ. This typically occurs as a result of executing a
set-user-ID or set-group-ID <br>
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A process with a non-root user
ID executed a binary that conferred permitted or effective
capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A nonzero value may have been
set by a Linux Security Module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment variables <br>
Among the more important environment variables are the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_ASSUME_KERNEL (glibc since
2.2.3) <br>
Each shared object can inform the dynamic linker of the
minimum kernel ABI version that it requires. (This
requirement is encoded in an ELF note section that is
viewable <br>
via readelf -n as a section labeled NT_GNU_ABI_TAG.) At run
time, the dynamic linker determines the ABI version of the
running kernel and will reject loading shared <br>
objects that specify minimum ABI versions that exceed that
ABI version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_ASSUME_KERNEL can be used to
cause the dynamic linker to assume that it is running on a
system with a different kernel ABI version. For example, the
following command <br>
line causes the dynamic linker to assume it is running on
Linux 2.2.5 when loading the shared objects required by
myprog:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
./myprog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that provide multiple
versions of a shared object (in different directories in the
search path) that have different minimum kernel ABI version
requirements, <br>
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL can be used to select the version of the
object that is used (dependent on the directory search
order). Historically, the most common use of the <br>
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL feature was to manually select the older
LinuxThreads POSIX threads implementation on systems that
provided both LinuxThreads and NPTL (which latter was <br>
typically the default on such systems); see pthreads(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_BIND_NOW <br>
(libc5; glibc since 2.1.1) If set to a nonempty string,
causes the dynamic linker to resolve all symbols at program
startup instead of deferring function call resolution <br>
to the point when they are first referenced. This is useful
when using a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
A list of directories in which to search for ELF libraries
at execution-time. The items in the list are separated by
either colons or semicolons. Similar to the PATH <br>
environment variable. This variable is ignored in
secure-execution mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within the pathnames specified
in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the dynamic linker expands the strings
$ORIGIN, $LIB, and $PLATFORM (or the versions using curly
braces around the <br>
names) as described above in Rpath token expansion. Thus,
for example, the following would cause a library to be
searched for in either the lib or lib64 subdirectory <br>
below the directory containing the program to be
executed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&rsquo;$ORIGIN/$LIB&rsquo; prog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note the use of single quotes,
which prevent expansion of ORIGIN and LIB as shell
variables!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PRELOAD <br>
A list of additional, user-specified, ELF shared objects to
be loaded before all others. The items of the list can be
separated by spaces or colons. This can be used to <br>
selectively override functions in other shared objects. The
objects are searched for using the rules given under
DESCRIPTION. In secure-execution mode, preload pathnames
<br>
containing slashes are ignored, and shared objects in the
standard search directories are loaded only if the
set-user-ID mode bit is enabled on the shared object
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within the pathnames specified
in LD_PRELOAD, the dynamic linker understands the strings
$ORIGIN, $LIB, and $PLATFORM (or the versions using curly
braces around the names) <br>
as described above in Rpath token expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS <br>
(ELF only) If set (to any value), causes the program to list
its dynamic dependencies, as if run by ldd(1), instead of
running normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then there are lots of more or
less obscure variables, many obsolete or only for internal
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
(libc5) Version of LD_LIBRARY_PATH for a.out binaries only.
Old versions of ld-linux.so.1 also supported
LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_AOUT_PRELOAD <br>
(libc5) Version of LD_PRELOAD for a.out binaries only. Old
versions of ld-linux.so.1 also supported LD_ELF_PRELOAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_AUDIT <br>
(glibc since 2.4) A colon-separated list of user-specified,
ELF shared objects to be loaded before all others in a
separate linker namespace (i.e., one that does not <br>
intrude upon the normal symbol bindings that would occur in
the process). These objects can be used to audit the
operation of the dynamic linker. LD_AUDIT is ignored in <br>
secure-execution mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dynamic linker will notify
the audit shared objects at so-called auditing
checkpoints&acirc;for example, loading a new shared object,
resolving a symbol, or calling a symbol <br>
from another shared object&acirc;by calling an appropriate
function within the audit shared object. For details, see
rtld-audit(7). The auditing interface is largely
compati&acirc; <br>
ble with that provided on Solaris, as described in its
Linker and Libraries Guide, in the chapter Runtime Linker
Auditing Interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_BIND_NOT <br>
(glibc since 2.1.95) If this environment variable is set to
a nonempty string, do not update the GOT (global offset
table) and PLT (procedure linkage table) after resolv&acirc;
<br>
ing a symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_DEBUG <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Output verbose debugging information about
the dynamic linker. If set to all prints all debugging
information it has, if set to help prints a help mes&acirc;
<br>
sage about which categories can be specified in this
environment variable. Since glibc 2.3.4, LD_DEBUG is ignored
in secure-execution mode, unless the file <br>
/etc/suid-debug exists (the content of the file is
irrelevant).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT <br>
(glibc since 2.1) File in which LD_DEBUG output should be
written. The default is standard error. LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT is
ignored in secure-execution mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK <br>
(glibc since 2.1.91) If this environment variable is defined
(with any value), allow weak symbols to be overridden
(reverting to old glibc behavior). Since glibc 2.3.4, <br>
LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK is ignored in secure-execution mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_HWCAP_MASK <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Mask for hardware capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_KEEPDIR <br>
(a.out only)(libc5) Don&rsquo;t ignore the directory in the
names of a.out libraries to be loaded. Use of this option is
strongly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_NOWARN <br>
(a.out only)(libc5) Suppress warnings about a.out libraries
with incompatible minor version numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_ORIGIN_PATH <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Path where the binary is found. Since
glibc 2.4, LD_ORIGIN_PATH is ignored in secure-execution
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_POINTER_GUARD <br>
(glibc from 2.4 to 2.22) Set to 0 to disable pointer
guarding. Any other value enables pointer guarding, which is
also the default. Pointer guarding is a security
mecha&acirc; <br>
nism whereby some pointers to code stored in writable
program memory (return addresses saved by setjmp(3) or
function pointers used by various glibc internals) are
mangled <br>
semi-randomly to make it more difficult for an attacker to
hijack the pointers for use in the event of a buffer overrun
or stack-smashing attack. Since glibc 2.23, <br>
LD_POINTER_GUARD can no longer be used to disable pointer
guarding, which is now always enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PROFILE <br>
(glibc since 2.1) The name of a (single) shared object to be
profiled, specified either as a pathname or a soname.
Profiling output is appended to the file whose name is: <br>
&quot;$LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT/$LD_PROFILE.profile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Directory where LD_PROFILE output should
be written. If this variable is not defined, or is defined
as an empty string, then the default is /var/tmp. <br>
LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT is ignored in secure-execution mode;
instead /var/profile is always used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_SHOW_AUXV <br>
(glibc since 2.1) If this environment variable is defined
(with any value), show the auxiliary array passed up from
the kernel (see also getauxval(3)). Since glibc 2.3.5, <br>
LD_SHOW_AUXV is ignored in secure-execution mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_TRACE_PRELINKING <br>
(glibc since 2.4) If this environment variable is defined
(with any value), trace prelinking of the object whose name
is assigned to this environment variable. (Use <br>
ldd(1) to get a list of the objects that might be traced.)
If the object name is not recognized, then all prelinking
activity is traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS <br>
By default (i.e., if this variable is not defined),
executables and prelinked shared objects will honor base
addresses of their dependent shared objects and
(nonprelinked) <br>
position-independent executables (PIEs) and other shared
objects will not honor them. If LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS is defined
with the value 1, both executables and PIEs will <br>
honor the base addresses. If LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS is defined
with the value 0, neither executables nor PIEs will honor
the base addresses. This variable is ignored in <br>
secure-execution mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_VERBOSE <br>
(glibc since 2.1) If set to a nonempty string, output symbol
versioning information about the program if the
LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable has been
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_WARN <br>
(ELF only)(glibc since 2.1.3) If set to a nonempty string,
warn about unresolved symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC <br>
(x86-64 only)(glibc since 2.23) According to the Intel
Silvermont software optimization guide, for 64-bit
applications, branch prediction performance can be
negatively <br>
impacted when the target of a branch is more than 4GB away
from the branch. If this environment variable is set (to any
value), ld.so will first try to map executable <br>
pages using the mmap(2) MAP_32BIT flag, and fall back to
mapping without that flag if that attempt fails. NB:
MAP_32BIT will map to the low 2GB (not 4GB) of the address
<br>
space. Because MAP_32BIT reduces the address range available
for address space layout randomization (ASLR),
LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC is always disabled in
secure-execu&acirc; <br>
tion mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDD_ARGV0 <br>
(libc5) argv[0] to be used by ldd(1) when none is
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/lib/ld.so <br>
a.out dynamic linker/loader <br>
/lib/ld-linux.so.{1,2} <br>
ELF dynamic linker/loader <br>
/etc/ld.so.cache <br>
File containing a compiled list of directories in which to
search for shared objects and an ordered list of candidate
shared objects. <br>
/etc/ld.so.preload <br>
File containing a whitespace-separated list of ELF shared
objects to be loaded before the program. <br>
lib*.so* <br>
shared objects</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The ld.so functionality is available for executables
compiled using libc version 4.4.3 or greater. ELF
functionality is available since Linux 1.1.52 and libc5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hardware capabilities <br>
Some shared objects are compiled using hardware-specific
instructions which do not exist on every CPU. Such objects
should be installed in directories whose names define the
<br>
required hardware capabilities, such as /usr/lib/sse2/. The
dynamic linker checks these directories against the hardware
of the machine and selects the most suitable version of <br>
a given shared object. Hardware capability directories can
be cascaded to combine CPU features. The list of supported
hardware capability names depends on the CPU. The
follow&acirc; <br>
ing names are currently recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alpha ev4, ev5, ev56, ev6,
ev67</p>
