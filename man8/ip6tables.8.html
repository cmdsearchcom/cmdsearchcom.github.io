<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Iptables and ip6tables are used to set up, maintain, and
inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6 packet filter rules in
the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined.
<br>
Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also
contain user-defined chains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each chain is a list of rules
which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what
to do with a packet that matches. This is called a
&lsquo;target&rsquo;, which may be a jump to a <br>
user-defined chain in the same table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGETS <br>
A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet and a
target. If the packet does not match, the next rule in the
chain is examined; if it does match, then the next rule is
spec&acirc; <br>
ified by the value of the target, which can be the name of a
user-defined chain, one of the targets described in
iptables-extensions(8), or one of the special values ACCEPT,
DROP <br>
or RETURN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCEPT means to let the packet
through. DROP means to drop the packet on the floor. RETURN
means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule
in the previous (call&acirc; <br>
ing) chain. If the end of a built-in chain is reached or a
rule in a built-in chain with target RETURN is matched, the
target specified by the chain policy determines the fate
<br>
of the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TABLES <br>
There are currently five independent tables (which tables
are present at any time depends on the kernel configuration
options and which modules are present).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --table table <br>
This option specifies the packet matching table which the
command should operate on. If the kernel is configured with
automatic module loading, an attempt will be made to <br>
load the appropriate module for that table if it is not
already there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tables are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter: <br>
This is the default table (if no -t option is passed). It
contains the built-in chains INPUT (for packets destined to
local sockets), FORWARD (for packets being routed <br>
through the box), and OUTPUT (for locally-generated
packets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nat: <br>
This table is consulted when a packet that creates a new
connection is encountered. It consists of three built-ins:
PREROUTING (for altering packets as soon as they <br>
come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets
before routing), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as
they are about to go out). IPv6 NAT support is <br>
available since kernel 3.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mangle: <br>
This table is used for specialized packet alteration. Until
kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for
altering incoming packets before routing) and <br>
OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before
routing). Since kernel 2.4.18, three other built-in chains
are also supported: INPUT (for packets coming into <br>
the box itself), FORWARD (for altering packets being routed
through the box), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as
they are about to go out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw: <br>
This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from
connection tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target.
It registers at the netfilter hooks with higher <br>
priority and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any
other IP tables. It provides the following built-in chains:
PREROUTING (for packets arriving via any network <br>
interface) OUTPUT (for packets generated by local
processes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">security: <br>
This table is used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
networking rules, such as those enabled by the SECMARK and
CONNSECMARK targets. Mandatory Access Control is <br>
implemented by Linux Security Modules such as SELinux. The
security table is called after the filter table, allowing
any Discretionary Access Control (DAC) rules in <br>
the filter table to take effect before MAC rules. This table
provides the following built-in chains: INPUT (for packets
coming into the box itself), OUTPUT (for <br>
altering locally-generated packets before routing), and
FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the
box).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options that are recognized by iptables and ip6tables
can be divided into several different groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
These options specify the desired action to perform. Only
one of them can be specified on the command line unless
otherwise stated below. For long versions of the command and
<br>
option names, you need to use only enough letters to ensure
that iptables can differentiate it from all other
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --append chain
rule-specification <br>
Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain.
When the source and/or destination names resolve to more
than one address, a rule will be added for each possi&acirc;
<br>
ble address combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --check chain
rule-specification <br>
Check whether a rule matching the specification does exist
in the selected chain. This command uses the same logic as
-D to find a matching entry, but does not alter the <br>
existing iptables configuration and uses its exit code to
indicate success or failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delete chain
rule-specification <br>
-D, --delete chain rulenum <br>
Delete one or more rules from the selected chain. There are
two versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a
number in the chain (starting at 1 for the first <br>
rule) or a rule to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --insert chain [rulenum]
rule-specification <br>
Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given
rule number. So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules
are inserted at the head of the chain. This is <br>
also the default if no rule number is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --replace chain rulenum
rule-specification <br>
Replace a rule in the selected chain. If the source and/or
destination names resolve to multiple addresses, the command
will fail. Rules are numbered starting at 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --list [chain] <br>
List all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is
selected, all chains are listed. Like every other iptables
command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the
<br>
default), so NAT rules get listed by <br>
iptables -t nat -n -L <br>
Please note that it is often used with the -n option, in
order to avoid long reverse DNS lookups. It is legal to
specify the -Z (zero) option as well, in which case the <br>
chain(s) will be atomically listed and zeroed. The exact
output is affected by the other arguments given. The exact
rules are suppressed until you use <br>
iptables -L -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --list-rules [chain] <br>
Print all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is
selected, all chains are printed like iptables-save. Like
every other iptables command, it applies to the specified
<br>
table (filter is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --flush [chain] <br>
Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if
none is given). This is equivalent to deleting all the rules
one by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --zero [chain [rulenum]]
<br>
Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains, or only the
given chain, or only the given rule in a chain. It is legal
to specify the -L, --list (list) option as well, <br>
to see the counters immediately before they are cleared.
(See above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --new-chain chain <br>
Create a new user-defined chain by the given name. There
must be no target of that name already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --delete-chain [chain] <br>
Delete the optional user-defined chain specified. There must
be no references to the chain. If there are, you must delete
or replace the referring rules before the chain <br>
can be deleted. The chain must be empty, i.e. not contain
any rules. If no argument is given, it will attempt to
delete every non-builtin chain in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --policy chain target <br>
Set the policy for the built-in (non-user-defined) chain to
the given target. The policy target must be either ACCEPT or
DROP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --rename-chain old-chain
new-chain <br>
Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.
This is cosmetic, and has no effect on the structure of the
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help. Give a (currently very
brief) description of the command syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
The following parameters make up a rule specification (as
used in the add, delete, insert, replace and append
commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --ipv4 <br>
This option has no effect in iptables and iptables-restore.
If a rule using the -4 option is inserted with (and only
with) ip6tables-restore, it will be silently ignored. <br>
Any other uses will throw an error. This option allows to
put both IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a single rule file for use
with both iptables-restore and ip6tables-restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ipv6 <br>
If a rule using the -6 option is inserted with (and only
with) iptables-restore, it will be silently ignored. Any
other uses will throw an error. This option allows to put
<br>
both IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a single rule file for use with
both iptables-restore and ip6tables-restore. This option has
no effect in ip6tables and ip6tables-restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!] -p, --protocol protocol <br>
The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check. The
specified protocol can be one of tcp, udp, udplite, icmp,
icmpv6,esp, ah, sctp, mh or the special keyword
&quot;all&quot;, <br>
or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these
protocols or a different one. A protocol name from
/etc/protocols is also allowed. A &quot;!&quot; argument
before the pro&acirc; <br>
tocol inverts the test. The number zero is equivalent to
all. &quot;all&quot; will match with all protocols and is
taken as default when this option is omitted. Note that, in
<br>
ip6tables, IPv6 extension headers except esp are not
allowed. esp and ipv6-nonext can be used with Kernel version
2.6.11 or later. The number zero is equivalent to all, <br>
which means that you cannot test the protocol field for the
value 0 directly. To match on a HBH header, even if it were
the last, you cannot use -p 0, but always need -m <br>
hbh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!] -s, --source
address[/mask][,...] <br>
Source specification. Address can be either a network name,
a hostname, a network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP
address. Hostnames will be resolved once only, <br>
before the rule is submitted to the kernel. Please note that
specifying any name to be resolved with a remote query such
as DNS is a really bad idea. The mask can be <br>
either an ipv4 network mask (for iptables) or a plain
number, specifying the number of 1&rsquo;s at the left side
of the network mask. Thus, an iptables mask of 24 is
equiva&acirc; <br>
lent to 255.255.255.0. A &quot;!&quot; argument before the
address specification inverts the sense of the address. The
flag --src is an alias for this option. Multiple addresses
<br>
can be specified, but this will expand to multiple rules
(when adding with -A), or will cause multiple rules to be
deleted (with -D).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!] -d, --destination
address[/mask][,...] <br>
Destination specification. See the description of the -s
(source) flag for a detailed description of the syntax. The
flag --dst is an alias for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --match match <br>
Specifies a match to use, that is, an extension module that
tests for a specific property. The set of matches make up
the condition under which a target is invoked. <br>
Matches are evaluated first to last as specified on the
command line and work in short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one
extension yields false, evaluation will stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --jump target <br>
This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if
the packet matches it. The target can be a user-defined
chain (other than the one this rule is in), one of the <br>
special builtin targets which decide the fate of the packet
immediately, or an extension (see EXTENSIONS below). If this
option is omitted in a rule (and -g is not used), <br>
then matching the rule will have no effect on the
packet&rsquo;s fate, but the counters on the rule will be
incremented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --goto chain <br>
This specifies that the processing should continue in a user
specified chain. Unlike the --jump option return will not
continue processing in this chain but instead in the <br>
chain that called us via --jump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!] -i, --in-interface name <br>
Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only
for packets entering the INPUT, FORWARD and PREROUTING
chains). When the &quot;!&quot; argument is used before the
inter&acirc; <br>
face name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends
in a &quot;+&quot;, then any interface which begins with
this name will match. If this option is omitted, any
inter&acirc; <br>
face name will match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!] -o, --out-interface name
<br>
Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent
(for packets entering the FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING
chains). When the &quot;!&quot; argument is used before the
<br>
interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name
ends in a &quot;+&quot;, then any interface which begins
with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any
<br>
interface name will match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!] -f, --fragment <br>
This means that the rule only refers to second and further
IPv4 fragments of fragmented packets. Since there is no way
to tell the source or destination ports of such a <br>
packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will not match any
rules which specify them. When the &quot;!&quot; argument
precedes the &quot;-f&quot; flag, the rule will only match
head fragments, <br>
or unfragmented packets. This option is IPv4 specific, it is
not available in ip6tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --set-counters packets bytes
<br>
This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and
byte counters of a rule (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE
operations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
The following additional options can be specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Verbose output. This option makes the list command show the
interface name, the rule options (if any), and the TOS
masks. The packet and byte counters are also listed, <br>
with the suffix &rsquo;K&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo; or
&rsquo;G&rsquo; for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000
multipliers respectively (but see the -x flag to change
this). For appending, insertion, deletion <br>
and replacement, this causes detailed information on the
rule or rules to be printed. -v may be specified multiple
times to possibly emit more detailed debug statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wait [seconds] <br>
Wait for the xtables lock. To prevent multiple instances of
the program from running concurrently, an attempt will be
made to obtain an exclusive lock at launch. By <br>
default, the program will exit if the lock cannot be
obtained. This option will make the program wait
(indefinitely or for optional seconds) until the exclusive
lock can <br>
be obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numeric <br>
Numeric output. IP addresses and port numbers will be
printed in numeric format. By default, the program will try
to display them as host names, network names, or ser&acirc;
<br>
vices (whenever applicable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exact <br>
Expand numbers. Display the exact value of the packet and
byte counters, instead of only the rounded number in
K&rsquo;s (multiples of 1000) M&rsquo;s (multiples of 1000K)
or G&rsquo;s <br>
(multiples of 1000M). This option is only relevant for the
-L command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line-numbers <br>
When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of
each rule, corresponding to that rule&rsquo;s position in
the chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--modprobe=command <br>
When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use command to
load any necessary modules (targets, match extensions,
etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MATCH AND TARGET EXTENSIONS <br>
iptables can use extended packet matching and target
modules. A list of these is available in the
iptables-extensions(8) manpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Various error messages are printed to standard error. The
exit code is 0 for correct functioning. Errors which appear
to be caused by invalid or abused command line parameters
<br>
cause an exit code of 2, and other errors cause an exit code
of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Bugs? What&rsquo;s this? ;-) Well, you might want to have a
look at http://bugzilla.netfilter.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WITH IPCHAINS <br>
This iptables is very similar to ipchains by Rusty Russell.
The main difference is that the chains INPUT and OUTPUT are
only traversed for packets coming into the local host and
<br>
originating from the local host respectively. Hence every
packet only passes through one of the three chains (except
loopback traffic, which involves both INPUT and OUTPUT <br>
chains); previously a forwarded packet would pass through
all three.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other main difference is
that -i refers to the input interface; -o refers to the
output interface, and both are available for packets
entering the FORWARD chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The various forms of NAT have
been separated out; iptables is a pure packet filter when
using the default &lsquo;filter&rsquo; table, with optional
extension modules. This should simplify <br>
much of the previous confusion over the combination of IP
masquerading and packet filtering seen previously. So the
following options are handled differently: <br>
-j MASQ <br>
-M -S <br>
-M -L <br>
There are several other changes in iptables.</p>
