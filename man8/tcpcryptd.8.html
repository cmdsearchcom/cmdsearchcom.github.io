A list of all options is produced by:

<b>tcpcryptd -h</b></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Configuration of packet-diversion rules allows the system administrator to
  control which TCP connections are protected by <b>tcpcryptd</b>. The daemon
  receives packets for transformation via a &quot;divert port&quot;,
  configurable with <b>-p</b> <i>port</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The daemon communicates with user programs via a &quot;control socket&quot;,
  configurable with <b>-u</b> <i>socket_address</i>. If <i>socket_address</i>
  begins with &quot;/&quot;, it is interpreted as a filesystem path pointing to
  a unix-domain socket; if it is of the form &quot;: <i>port</i>&quot;, it is
  interpreted as the internet address localhost: <i>port</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Verbosity may be increased with multiple <b>-v</b> options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;phone-home&quot; test will be performed at daemon startup to confirm
  end-to-end functionality of the implementation (by default, with the authors'
  server), but may be redirected to another test-server with <b>-s</b>
  <i>hostname</i> or disabled completely with <b>-f</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>tcpcryptd</b> daemon transforms TCP segments via a kernel
  &quot;divert&quot; port in order to implement &quot;opportunistic
  encryption&quot; according to the <i>tcpcrypt</i> protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a peer that signals in the connection handshake that it has support for the
  <i>tcpcrypt</i> protocol, ephemeral keys are exchanged and used to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of the connection's application data. (The
  protocol protects the integrity of parts of the TCP header as well.) When a
  peer does not indicate support for the protocol, the daemon will pass the
  remainder of the connection unperturbed (and thus unprotected).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Application software need not be modified to take advantage of this facility,
  which provides confidentiality in the face of passive network attackers (those
  who cannot modify network data in transit). But in order to protect
  communication from active attackers, the application must intentionally
  authenticate the connection as described below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Authentication"><a class="selflink" href="#Authentication">Authentication</a></h2>
The <i>tcpcrypt</i> protocol does not itself protect communications against
  &quot;active attackers&quot;, that is, those who are able to modify network
  packets in transit. Such an attacker may perform a &quot;man in the
  middle&quot; attack that allows her to behave as the endpoint of the encrypted
  connection and thus compromise its security.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, applications aware of <i>tcpcrypt</i> may authenticate the connection
  in whatever manner they choose, aided by an identifier for the connection that
  is derived from the protocol and made available by <b>tcpcryptd</b>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>session id</i> is derived from the ephemeral keys used to encrypt each
  connection protected by <i>tcpcrypt</i>. This identifier is
  (probabalistically) unique over all connections, is not secret, and may be
  extracted by applications via the user library <b>libtcpcrypt</b>. Session ids
  for all active connections may also be listed with the netstat-like utility
  <b>tcnetstat</b>(8).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Connection peers may ensure they are communicating securely with each other
  (enjoying confidentiality and integrity in the face of active network
  attackers) by confirming that the <i>tcpcrypt</i> session ids derived at each
  end are identical. For example, they may bind the session id together with a
  shared secret such as a password, sign it with public keys, use a voice
  connection to speak a fingerprint of it, or simply record it for later
  confirmation.
