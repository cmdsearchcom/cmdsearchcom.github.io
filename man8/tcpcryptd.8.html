<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcpcryptd - Implement the tcpcrypt protocol by transparently
modifying network I/O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcpcryptd [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A list of all options is produced by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpcryptd -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration of
packet-diversion rules allows the system administrator to
control which TCP connections are protected by tcpcryptd.
The daemon receives packets for transforma&acirc; <br>
tion via a &quot;divert port&quot;, configurable with -p
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon communicates with
user programs via a &quot;control socket&quot;, configurable
with -u socket_address. If socket_address begins with
&quot;/&quot;, it is interpreted as a filesystem path <br>
pointing to a unix-domain socket; if it is of the form
&quot;:port&quot;, it is interpreted as the internet address
localhost:port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbosity may be increased with
multiple -v options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;phone-home&quot; test
will be performed at daemon startup to confirm end-to-end
functionality of the implementation (by default, with the
authors&rsquo; server), but may be redirected to <br>
another test-server with -s hostname or disabled completely
with -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The tcpcryptd daemon transforms TCP segments via a kernel
&quot;divert&quot; port in order to implement
&quot;opportunistic encryption&quot; according to the
tcpcrypt protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a peer that signals in the
connection handshake that it has support for the tcpcrypt
protocol, ephemeral keys are exchanged and used to protect
the confidentiality and <br>
integrity of the connection&rsquo;s application data. (The
protocol protects the integrity of parts of the TCP header
as well.) When a peer does not indicate support for the
protocol, <br>
the daemon will pass the remainder of the connection
unperturbed (and thus unprotected).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Application software need not be
modified to take advantage of this facility, which provides
confidentiality in the face of passive network attackers
(those who cannot modify <br>
network data in transit). But in order to protect
communication from active attackers, the application must
intentionally authenticate the connection as described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authentication <br>
The tcpcrypt protocol does not itself protect communications
against &quot;active attackers&quot;, that is, those who are
able to modify network packets in transit. Such an attacker
may <br>
perform a &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack that allows
her to behave as the endpoint of the encrypted connection
and thus compromise its security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, applications aware of
tcpcrypt may authenticate the connection in whatever manner
they choose, aided by an identifier for the connection that
is derived from the proto&acirc; <br>
col and made available by tcpcryptd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session id is derived from the
ephemeral keys used to encrypt each connection protected by
tcpcrypt. This identifier is (probabalistically) unique over
all connections, is not <br>
secret, and may be extracted by applications via the user
library libtcpcrypt. Session ids for all active connections
may also be listed with the netstat-like utility
tcnet&acirc; <br>
stat(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connection peers may ensure they
are communicating securely with each other (enjoying
confidentiality and integrity in the face of active network
attackers) by confirming that <br>
the tcpcrypt session ids derived at each end are identical.
For example, they may bind the session id together with a
shared secret such as a password, sign it with public keys,
<br>
use a voice connection to speak a fingerprint of it, or
simply record it for later confirmation.</p>
