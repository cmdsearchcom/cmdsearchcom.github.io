<p>ETTERCAP-PLUGINS(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ETTERCAP-PLUGINS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ettercap-plugins - A collection of plugins for ettercap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ettercap(8) supports loadable modules at runtime. They are
called plugins and they come within the source tarball. They
are automatically compiled if your system supports them or
<br>
until you specify -DENABLE_PLUGINS=OFF option to the cmake
configure script. <br>
Some of older ettercap plugins (roper, banshee, and so on)
have not been ported in the new version. By the way, you can
achieve the same results by using new filtering engine. <br>
If you use interactive mode, most plugins need to
&quot;Start Sniff&quot; before using them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To have a list of plugins
installed in your system do that command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -P list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is a list of
available plugins:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arp_cop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It reports suspicious ARP
activity by passively monitoring ARP requests/replies. It
can report ARP posioning attempts, or simple IP-conflicts or
IP-changes. If you build <br>
the initial host list the plugin will run more
accurately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQP arp_cop //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoadd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will automatically add new
victims to the ARP poisoning mitm attack when they come up.
It looks for ARP requests on the lan and when detected it
will add the host to <br>
the victims list if it was specified in the TARGET. The host
is added when an arp request is seen form it, since
communicating hosts are alive :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chk_poison</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It performs a check to see if
the arp poisoning module of ettercap was successful. It
sends spoofed ICMP echo packets to all the victims of the
poisoning pretending to be <br>
each of the other targets. If we can catch an ICMP reply
with our MAC address as destination it means that the
poisoning between those two targets is successful. It checks
<br>
both ways of each communication. This plugin makes sense
only where poisoning makes sense. The test fails if you
specify only one target in silent mode. You can&rsquo;t run
<br>
this plugin from command line because the poisoning process
is not started yet. You have to launch it from the proper
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dns_spoof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin intercepts DNS query
and reply with a spoofed answer. You can chose to which
address the plugin has to reply by modifying the etter.dns
file. The plugin inter&acirc; <br>
cepts A, AAAA, PTR, MX, WINS, SRV and TXT request. If it was
an A request, the name is searched in the file and the IP
address is returned (you can use wildcards in the <br>
name). <br>
The same applies if it was a AAAA request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it was a PTR request, the IP
address is searched in the file and the name is returned
(except for those name containing a wildcard). For PTR
requests, IPv4 or IPv6 <br>
addresses are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of MX request a special
reply is crafted. The host is resolved with a fake host
&rsquo;mail.host&rsquo; and the additional record contains
the IP address of &rsquo;mail.host&rsquo;. The <br>
first address that matches is returned, so be careful with
the order. The IP address for MX requests can be a IPv4 or a
IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the request was a WINS
request, the name is searched in the file and the IP address
is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of SRV request, a
special reply is crafted. The host is resolved with a fake
host &rsquo;srv.host&rsquo; and the additional record
contains the IP address of &rsquo;srv.host&rsquo;. The <br>
IP address for SRV requests can be a IPv4 or a IPv6
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of a TXT request, the
string defined is being returned. The string has to be
wrapped in double quotes. Wildcards for the requested name
can also be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special reply can be spoofed
for A or AAAA requests, if the &rsquo;undefined
address&rsquo; is specified as the IP address in the file.
Then the client gets a response which stops <br>
resolution processing imediately. This way one can control
which address family is being used to access a dual-stacked
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of an ANY request,
all matching results of type A, AAAA, MX and TXT are
returned in the reply. If the &rsquo;undefined
address&rsquo; for A or AAAA records is defined, <br>
nothing is returned for these types whether or not the name
matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdns_spoof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin does the same as the
dns_spoof plugin described above, despite that it listens
for mDNS (Multicast DNS) queries on UDP port 5353. To choose
to which address <br>
the plugin shall reply, you have to modify a diffent file
called etter.mdns. Due to the nature of mDNS, the plugin
intercepts only A, AAAA, PTR and SRV requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way the mdns_spoof plugin
interprets the etter.mdns file and the rules that apply are
the same as with the dns_spoof plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dos_attack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin runs a d.o.s. attack
against a victim IP address. It first &quot;scans&quot; the
victim to find open ports, then starts to flood these ports
with SYN packets, using a <br>
&quot;phantom&quot; address as source IP. Then it uses fake
ARP replies to intercept packets for the phantom host. When
it receives SYN-ACK from the victim, it replies with an ACK
<br>
packet creating an ESTABLISHED connection. You have to use a
free IP address in your subnet to create the
&quot;phantom&quot; host (you can use find_ip for this
purpose). You <br>
can&rsquo;t run this plugin in unoffensive mode. <br>
This plugin is based on the original Naptha DoS attack
(http://razor.bindview.com/publish/advisories/adv_NAPTHA.html)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQP dos_attack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dummy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only a template to demonstrate
how to write a plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find_conn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Very simple plugin that listens
for ARP requests to show you all the targets an host wants
to talk to. It can also help you finding addresses in an
unknown LAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQzP find_conn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQu -i eth0 -P
find_conn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find_ettercap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to identify ettercap packets
sent on the LAN. It could be useful to detect if someone is
using ettercap. Do not rely on it 100% since the tests are
only on particular <br>
sequence/identification numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find_ip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find the first unused IP address
in the range specified by the user in the target list. Some
other plugins (such as gre_relay) need an unused IP address
of the LAN to cre&acirc; <br>
ate a &quot;fake&quot; host. It can also be useful to obtain
an IP address in an unknown LAN where there is no dhcp
server. You can use find_conn to determine the IP addressing
of <br>
the LAN, and then find_ip. You have to build host list to
use this plugin so you can&rsquo;t use it in unoffensive
mode. If you don&rsquo;t have an IP address for your
interface, <br>
give it a bogus one (e.g. if the LAN is 192.168.0.0/24, use
10.0.0.1 to avoid conflicting IP), then launch this plugin
specifying the subnet range. You can run it either <br>
from the command line or from the proper menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQP find_ip //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQP find_ip
/192.168.0.1-254/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uses the passive fingerprint
capabilities to fingerprint a remote host. It does a
connect() to the remote host to force the kernel to reply to
the SYN with a SYN+ACK <br>
packet. The reply will be collected and the fingerprint is
displayed. The connect() obey to the connect_timeout
parameter in etter.conf(5). You can specify a target on <br>
command-line or let the plugin ask the target host to be
fingerprinted. You can also specify multiple target with the
usual multi-target specification (see ettercap(8)). <br>
if you specify multiple ports, all the ports will be tested
on all the IPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TzP finger
/192.168.0.1/22 <br>
ettercap -TzP finger /192.168.0.1-50/22,23,25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finger_submit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this plugin to submit a
fingerprint to the ettercap website. If you found an unknown
fingerprint, but you know for sure the operating system of
the target, you can <br>
submit it so it will be inserted in the database in the next
ettercap release. We need your help to increase the passive
fingerprint database. Thank you very much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TzP finger_submit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fraggle_attack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin performs a DoS
attack because it sends a large amount of UDP echo and
chargen traffic to all hosts in target2 with a fake source
ip address (victim).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example (192.168.0.5 is the
victim):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -i eth1 -Tq
/192.168.0.5/ // -P fraggle_attack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gre_relay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin can be used to sniff
GRE-redirected remote traffic. The basic idea is to create a
GRE tunnel that sends all the traffic on a router interface
to the ettercap <br>
machine. The plugin will send back the GRE packets to the
router, after ettercap &quot;manipulation&quot; (you can use
&quot;active&quot; plugins such as smb_down, ssh decryption,
filters, <br>
etc... on redirected traffic) It needs a &quot;fake&quot;
host where the traffic has to be redirected to (to avoid
kernel&rsquo;s responses). The &quot;fake&quot; IP will be
the tunnel endpoint. <br>
Gre_relay plugin will impersonate the &quot;fake&quot; host.
To find an unused IP address for the &quot;fake&quot; host
you can use find_ip plugin. Based on the original Tunnelx
technique <br>
by Anthony C. Zboralski.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gw_discover</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin try to discover the
gateway of the lan by sending TCP SYN packets to a remote
host. The packet has the destination IP of a remote host and
the destination mac <br>
address of a local host. If ettercap receives the SYN+ACK
packet, the host which own the source mac address of the
reply is the gatway. This operation is repeated for <br>
each host in the &rsquo;host list&rsquo;, so you need to
have a valid host list before launching this plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TP gw_discover
/192.168.0.1-50/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isolate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The isolate plugin will isolate
an host form the LAN. It will poison the victim&rsquo;s arp
cache with its own mac address associated with all the host
it tries to contact. This <br>
way the host will not be able to contact other hosts because
the packet will never reach the wire. <br>
You can specify all the host or only a group. the targets
specification work this way: the target1 is the victim and
must be a single host, the target2 can be a range of <br>
addresses and represent the hosts that will be blocked to
the victim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">examples :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TzqP isolate
/192.168.0.1/ // <br>
ettercap -TP isolate /192.168.0.1/ /192.168.0.2-30/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link_type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It performs a check of the link
type (hub or switch) by sending a spoofed ARP request and
listening for replies. It needs at least one entry in the
host list to perform <br>
the check. With two or more hosts the test will be more
accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQP link_type
/192.168.0.1/ <br>
ettercap -TQP link_type //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pptp_chapms1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It forces the pptp tunnel to
negotiate MS-CHAPv1 authentication instead of MS-CHAPv2,
that is usually easier to crack (for example with LC4). You
have to be in the &quot;mid&acirc; <br>
dle&quot; of the connection to use it successfully. It hooks
the ppp dissector, so you have to keep them active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pptp_clear</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forces no compression/encryption
for pptp tunnels during negotiation. It could fail if client
(or the server) is configured to hang off the tunnel if no
encryption is <br>
negotiated. You have to be in the &quot;middle&quot; of the
connection to use it successfully. It hooks the ppp
dissector, so you have to keep them active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pptp_pap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It forces the pptp tunnel to
negotiate PAP (cleartext) authentication. It could fail if
PAP is not supported, if pap_secret file is missing, or in
case windows is config&acirc; <br>
ured with &quot;authomatic use of domain account&quot;. (It
could fail for many other reasons too). You have to be in
the &quot;middle&quot; of the connection to use it
successfully. It <br>
hooks the ppp dissector, so you have to keep them
active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pptp_reneg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forces re-negotiation on an
existing pptp tunnel. You can force re-negotiation for
grabbing passwords already sent. Furthermore you can launch
it to use pptp_pap, <br>
pptp_chapms1 or pptp_clear on existing tunnels (those
plugins work only during negotiation phase). You have to be
in the &quot;middle&quot; of the connection to use it
success&acirc; <br>
fully. It hooks the ppp dissector, so you have to keep them
active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rand_flood</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floods the LAN with random MAC
addresses. Some switches will fail open in repeating mode,
facilitating sniffing. The delay between each packet is
based on the <br>
port_steal_send_delay value in etter.conf. <br>
It is useful only on ethernet switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TP rand_flood</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote_browser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It sends to the browser the URLs
sniffed thru HTTP sessions. So you are able to see the
webpages in real time. The command executed is configurable
in the etter.conf(5) <br>
file. It sends to the browser only the GET requests and only
for webpages, ignoring single request to images or other
amenities. Don&rsquo;t use it to view your own connection
<br>
:)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reply_arp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple arp responder. When it
intercepts an arp request for a host in the targets&rsquo;
lists, it replies with attacker&rsquo;s MAC address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQzP reply_arp
/192.168.0.1/ <br>
ettercap -TQzP reply_arp //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repoison_arp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It solicits poisoning packets
after broadcast ARP requests (or replies) from a posioned
host. For example: we are poisoning Group1 impersonating
Host2. If Host2 makes a <br>
broadcast ARP request for Host3, it is possible that Group1
caches the right MAC address for Host2 contained in the ARP
packet. This plugin re-poisons Group1 cache immedi&acirc;
<br>
ately after a legal broadcast ARP request (or reply). <br>
This plugin is effective only during an arp-posioning
session. <br>
In conjunction with the reply_arp plugin, repoison_arp is a
good support for the standard arp-poisoning mitm method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -T -M arp:remote -P
repoison_arp /192.168.0.10-20/ /192.168.0.1/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan_poisoner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check if someone is poisoning
between some host in the list and us. First of all it checks
if two hosts in the list have the same mac address. It could
mean that one of <br>
those is poisoning us pretending to be the other. It could
generate many false-positives in a proxy-arp environment.
You have to build hosts list to perform this check. <br>
After that, it sends icmp echo packets to each host in the
list and checks if the source mac address of the reply
differs from the address we have stored in the list for <br>
that ip. It could mean that someone is poisoning that host
pretending to have our ip address and forwards intercepted
packets to us. You can&rsquo;t perform this active test <br>
in unoffensive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQP scan_poisoner
//</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search_promisc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It tries to find if anyone is
sniffing in promisc mode. It sends two different kinds of
malformed arp request to each target in the host list and
waits for replies. If a <br>
reply arrives from the target host, it&rsquo;s more or less
probable that this target has the NIC in promisc mode. It
could generate false-positives. You can launch it either
<br>
from the command line or from the plugin menu. Since it
listens for arp replies it is better that you don&rsquo;t
use it while sending arp request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TQP search_promisc
/192.168.0.1/ <br>
ettercap -TQP search_promisc //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smb_clear</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It forces the client to send smb
password in clear-text by mangling protocol negotiation. You
have to be in the &quot;middle&quot; of the connection to
successfully use it. It hooks <br>
the smb dissector, so you have to keep it active. If you use
it against a windows client it will probably result in a
failure. Try it against a *nix smbclient :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smb_down</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It forces the client to not to
use NTLM2 password exchange during smb authentication. This
way, obtained hashes can be easily cracked by LC4. You have
to be in the &quot;mid&acirc; <br>
dle&quot; of the connection to successfully use it. It hooks
the smb dissector, so you have to keep it active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smurf_attack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Smurf Attack is a DoS attack
in which huge numbers of ICMP packets with the intended
victim(s) IP(s) in target1 are sent to the hosts in target2.
This causes all hosts <br>
on the target2 to reply to the ICMP request, causing
significant traffic to the victim&rsquo;s computer(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example (192.168.0.5 is the
victim):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -i eth1 -Tq
/192.168.0.5/ // -P fraggle_attack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sslstrip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While performing the SSL mitm
attack, ettercap substitutes the real ssl certificate with
its own. The fake certificate is created on the fly and all
the fields are filled <br>
according to the real cert presented by the server. Only the
issuer is modified and signed with the private key contained
in the &rsquo;etter.ssl.crt&rsquo; file. If you want to <br>
use a different private key you have to regenerate this
file. To regenerate the cert file use the following
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openssl genrsa -out
etter.ssl.crt 1024 <br>
openssl req -new -key etter.ssl.crt -out tmp.csr <br>
openssl x509 -req -days 1825 -in tmp.csr -signkey
etter.ssl.crt -out tmp.new <br>
cat tmp.new &gt;&gt; etter.ssl.crt <br>
rm -f tmp.new tmp.csr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: SSL mitm is not available
(for now) in bridged mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: You can use the
--certificate/--private-key long options if you want to
specify a different file rather than the etter.ssl.crt
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stp_mangler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It sends spanning tree BPDUs
pretending to be a switch with the highest priority. Once in
the &quot;root&quot; of the spanning tree, ettercap can
receive all the &quot;unmanaged&quot; network <br>
traffic. <br>
It is useful only against a group of switches running STP.
<br>
If there is another switch with the highest priority, try to
manually decrease your MAC address before running it.</p>
