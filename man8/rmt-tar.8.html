<p>RMT(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual RMT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rmt &acirc; remote magtape protocol module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rmt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rmt is a program used by tar, cpio, mt, and the remote dump
and restore programs in manipulating a magnetic tape drive
through an interprocess communication connection. Rmt is
<br>
normally started up with an rexec(3) or rcmd(3) call or the
rsh(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmt program accepts requests
specific to the manipulation of magnetic tapes, performs the
commands, then responds with a status indication. All
responses are in ASCII and in <br>
one of two forms. Successful commands have responses of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anumber</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number is an ASCII
representation of a decimal number. Unsuccessful commands
are responded to with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eerror-number0rror-message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error-number is one of the
possible error numbers described in intro(2) and
error-message is the corresponding error string as printed
from a call to perror(3). The protocol is <br>
comprised of the following commands, which are sent as
indicated - no spaces are supplied between the command and
its arguments, or between its arguments, and &acirc;0
indicates that a <br>
newline should be supplied:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Odevice0ode <br>
Open the specified deviceusing the indicated mode.Deviceis a
full pathname and modeis an ASCIIrepresentation of a decimal
number suitable for passing to open(2).If a device <br>
had already been opened, it is closed before a new open is
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cdevice <br>
Close the currently open device. The devicespecified is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loffset0hence <br>
Perform an lseek(2) operation using the specified
parameters. The response value is that returned from the
lseek call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcount <br>
Write data onto the open device. Rmt reads count bytes from
the connection, aborting if a premature end-of-file is
encountered. The response value is that returned from <br>
the write(2) call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rcount <br>
Read count bytes of data from the open device. If count
exceeds the size of the data buffer (10 kilobytes), it is
truncated to the data buffer size. rmt then performs the
<br>
requested read(2) and responds with Acount-readif the read
was successful; otherwise an error in the standard format is
returned. If the read was successful, the data <br>
read is then sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ioperation0ount <br>
Perform a MTIOCOP ioctl(2) command using the specified
parameters. The parameters are interpreted as the ASCII
representations of the decimal values to place in the mt_op
<br>
and mt_count fields of the structure used in the ioctl call.
The return value is the count parameter when the operation
is successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Return the status of the open
device, as obtained with a MTIOCGET ioctl call. If the
operation was successful, an &lsquo;&lsquo;ack&rsquo;&rsquo;
is sent with the size of the status buffer, then <br>
the status buffer is sent (in binary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other command causes rmt to
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All responses are of the form described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
tar(1), cpio(1), mt(1), rsh(1), rcmd(3), rexec(3), mtio(4),
rdump(8), rrestore(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
People should be discouraged from using this for a remote
file access protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The rmt command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
