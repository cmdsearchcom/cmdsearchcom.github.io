<p>SG_RBUF(8) SG3_UTILS SG_RBUF(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_rbuf - reads data using SCSI READ BUFFER command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_rbuf [--buffer=EACH] [--dio] [--help] [--mmap] [--quick]
[--size=OVERALL] [--test] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_rbuf [-b=EACH_KIB] [-d] [-m]
[-q] [-s=OVERALL_MIB] [-t] [-v] [-V] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This command reads data with the SCSI READ BUFFER command
and then discards it. Typically the data being read is from
a disk&rsquo;s memory cache. It is assumed that the data is
<br>
sourced quickly (although this is not guaranteed by the SCSI
standards) so that it is faster than reading data from the
media. This command is designed for timing transfer <br>
speeds across a SCSI transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To fetch the data with a SCSI
READ BUFFER command and optionally decode it see the
sg_read_buffer utility. There is also a sg_write_buffer
utility useful for downloading firmware <br>
amongst other things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility supports two
command line syntaxes, the preferred one is shown first in
the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section
on the old command line syntax <br>
outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --buffer=EACH <br>
where EACH is the number of bytes to be transferred by each
READ BUFFER command. The default is the actual available
buffer size returned by the READ BUFFER (descriptor) <br>
command. The maximum is the same as the default, hence this
argument can only be used to reduce the size of each
transfer to less than the device&rsquo;s actual available
buffer <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dio <br>
use direct IO if available. This option is only available if
the DEVICE is a sg driver device node (e.g. /dev/sg1). In
this case the sg driver will attempt to configure <br>
the DMA from the SCSI adapter to transfer directly into user
memory. This will eliminate the copy via kernel buffers. If
not available then this will be reported and indi&acirc;
<br>
rect IO will be done instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mmap <br>
use memory mapped IO if available. This option is only
available if the DEVICE is a sg driver device node (e.g.
/dev/sg1). In this case the sg driver will attempt to
con&acirc; <br>
figure the DMA from the SCSI adapter to transfer directly
into user memory. This will eliminate the copy via kernel
buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --old <br>
switch to older style options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quick <br>
only transfer the data into kernel buffers (typically by DMA
from the SCSI adapter card) and do not move it into the user
space. This option is only available if the <br>
DEVICE is a sg driver device node (e.g. /dev/sg1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --size=OVERALL <br>
where OVERALL is the size of total transfer in bytes. The
default is 200 MiB (200*1024*1024 bytes). The actual number
of bytes transferred may be slightly less than <br>
requested since all transfers are the same size (and an
integer division is involved rounding towards zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --time <br>
times the bulk data transfer component of this command. The
elapsed time is printed out plus a MB/sec calculation. In
this case &quot;MB&quot; is 1,000,000 bytes. The
gettimeofday() <br>
system call is used internally for the time calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print out version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This command is typically used on modern SCSI disks which
have a RAM cache in their drive electronics. If no IO to the
magnetic media, or slower devices like flash RAM, is <br>
involved then the disk may be able to source data fast
enough to saturate the bandwidth of the SCSI transport. The
bottleneck may then be the DMA element in the HBA, the Linux
<br>
drivers or the host machine&rsquo;s hardware (e.g. speed of
RAM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various numeric arguments (e.g.
OVERALL) may include multiplicative suffixes or be given in
hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section
in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
On the test system /dev/sg0 corresponds to a fast disk on a
U2W SCSI bus (max 80 MB/sec). The disk specifications state
that its cache is 4 MB. <br>
$ time ./sg_rbuf /dev/sg0 <br>
READ BUFFER reports: buffer capacity=3434944, <br>
offset boundary=6 <br>
Read 200 MiB (actual 199 MiB, 209531584 bytes), <br>
buffer size=3354 KiB <br>
real 0m5.072s, user 0m0.000s, sys 0m2.280s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So that is approximately 40
MB/sec at 40 % utilization. Now with the addition of the
&quot;-q&quot; option this throughput improves and the
utilization drops to 0%. <br>
$ time ./sg_rbuf -q /dev/sg0 <br>
READ BUFFER reports: buffer capacity=3434944, <br>
offset boundary=6 <br>
Read 200 MiB (actual 199 MiB, 209531584 bytes), <br>
buffer size=3354 KiB <br>
real 0m2.784s, user 0m0.000s, sys 0m0.000s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_rbuf is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The options in this section were the only ones available
prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23
and later these older options can be selected by either
set&acirc; <br>
ting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
&rsquo;--old&rsquo; (or &rsquo;-O) as the first option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b=EACH_KIB <br>
where EACH_KIB is the number of Kilobytes (i.e. 1024 byte
units) to be transferred by each READ BUFFER command.
Similar to the --buffer=EACH option in the main description
<br>
but the units are different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d use direct IO if available.
Equivalent to the --dio option in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m use memory mapped IO if
available. Equivalent to the --mmap option in the main
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N switch to the newer style
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q only transfer the data into
kernel buffers (typically by DMA from the SCSI adapter card)
and do not move it into the user space. Equivalent to the
--quick option in the <br>
main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s=OVERALL_MIB <br>
where OVERALL_MIB is the size of total transfer in Megabytes
(1048576 bytes). Similar to the --size=OVERALL option in the
main description but the units are different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t times the bulk data transfer
component of this command. Equivalent to the --time option
in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v increase level of verbosity.
Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print out version string then
exit.</p>
