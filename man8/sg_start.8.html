[--noflush] [--pc=PC] [-r] [--start] [--stop] [-v] [-V]
[0|1] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sg_start sends a SCSI START STOP UNIT command to the DEVICE
with the selected options. The most used options are --stop
to spin down a disk and --start to spin up a disk. Using
<br>
--start on a disk that is already spinning is harmless.
There is also finer grain control with &quot;power
condition&quot;: active, idle or standby. This is set with
the --pc=PC option. In <br>
some contexts the &quot;stop&quot; state can be considered
an additional power condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devices that contain removable
media such as cd/dvds can use the --loej option to load the
medium when used in conjunction with --start (i.e. load
medium then spin up). Alterna&acirc; <br>
tively --loej may be used to eject the medium when used in
conjunction with --stop (i.e. spin down then eject medium).
More simply, the loading or ejecting of a removable medium
<br>
can be requested with the --load or --eject&rsquo;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no option or argument is
given then a --start is assumed; as the utility&rsquo;s name
suggests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility supports two
command line syntaxes, the preferred one is shown first in
the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section
on the old command line syntax <br>
outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 same action as --stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 same action as --start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --eject <br>
stop the medium and eject it from the drive. Only
appropriate for a device with removable medium. Might be
ignored (prevented), see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print out the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fl=FL <br>
sets the format layer number for the disc to
&quot;jump&quot; to (defined in MMC-5). Values of FL can be
0 to 3. When this option is chosen, the FL, LoEj and Start
bits are set in <br>
the cdb as required by MMC-5; thus the user does not need to
set the --start and/or --load options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --immed <br>
sets the IMM bit on the START STOP UNIT command so this
utility will return immediately and not wait for the media
to complete the requested action. The default is to wait
<br>
until the media to complete the requested action before
returning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --load <br>
load the medium in the drive and start it. Only appropriate
for a removable medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --loej <br>
sets the LOEJ bit on the START STOP UNIT command. This loads
the media when the unit is started or eject it when the unit
is stopped (i.e. works in conjunction with START <br>
bit in cdb). This option is ignored if &rsquo;pc &gt;
0&rsquo;. Default is off (i.e. don&rsquo;t attempt to load
or eject media). If a start/start indication is not given
(i.e. neither <br>
--start nor --stop) and this option is given then a load and
start action is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mod=PC_MOD <br>
where PC_MOD is the &rsquo;power condition modifier&rsquo;
value. 0 to 15 (inclusive) are valid and 0 is the default.
This &rsquo;power condition modifier&rsquo; field in the cdb
was added after <br>
sbc3r13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --noflush <br>
do not perform a flush to media (e.g. like SYNCHRONIZE CACHE
does) before a variant of this utility that limits access to
the media. Using the --stop option is an example <br>
of something that limits access to the media. This
&rsquo;noflush&rsquo; field in the cdb was added after
sbc3r13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --old <br>
switch to older style options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pc=PC <br>
where PC is the &rsquo;power conditions&rsquo; value. 0 to
15 (inclusive) are valid. Default value is 0. When
&rsquo;--pc=0&rsquo; then --eject, --load, --loej, --start
and --stop are active. <br>
Some common values are 1 for the &quot;active&quot; power
condition (SBC); 2 for the idle power condition; 3 for the
standby power condition; 5 for sleep power condition (MMC);
7 <br>
for LU_CONTROL (SBC), 0xa (decimal 10) for FORCE_IDLE_0
(SBC) and 0xb (decimal 11) for FORCE_STANDBY_0 (SBC). See
recent SBC-3, MMC-5 and SAS drafts at www.t10.org for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --readonly <br>
open the DEVICE in read-only mode. Maybe required in Linux
to stop a nuisance spin-up if the DEVICE is an ATA disk. The
nuisance spin-up may occur at the end of this com&acirc;
<br>
mand negating the effect of the --stop option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --start <br>
start (spin-up) the DEVICE. This sets the START bit in the
cdb. Using this option on an already started device is
harmless. In the absence of other options, this option <br>
defaults (i.e. set the START cdb bit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --stop <br>
stop (spin-down) the DEVICE. This clears the START bit in
the cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity. Can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print out version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
To avoid confusion, only one of 0, 1 --eject, --load,
--start and --stop should be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an associated
&quot;power condition&quot; mode page (0x1a) in which timer
values can be set for transitioning to either idle or
standby state after a period of inactivity. The <br>
sdparm utility can be used to view the power condition mode
page and if required change it. If a DEVICE is in either
idle or standby power condition state then a REQUEST SENSE
<br>
command (see the sg_requests utility) should yield a sense
key of &quot;no sense&quot; and an additional sense code of
&quot;Low power condition on&quot; on recent SCSI
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ejection of removable media
(e.g. &rsquo;sg_start --eject /dev/hdd&rsquo; where the
DEVICE is an ATAPI cd/dvd drive) may be prevented by a prior
SCSI PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL command <br>
(see sg_prevent). In this case this utility should fail with
an error generated by the device: illegal request / medium
removal prevented. This can be overridden using sg_prevent
<br>
or, for example, &rsquo;sdparm --command=unlock
/dev/hdd&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SCSI TEST UNIT READY command
can be used to find out whether a DEVICE is ready to
transfer data. If rotating media is stopped or still coming
up to speed, then the TEST UNIT <br>
READY command will yield a &quot;not ready&quot; sense key
and an more informative additional sense code. See the
sg_turs utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 2.4 series of Linux
kernels the DEVICE must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In
the 2.6 series block devices (e.g. SCSI disks and DVD
drives) can also be specified. For <br>
example &quot;sg_start 0 /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Linux 2.6 series,
especially with ATA disks, using this utility to stop (spin
down) a disk may not be sufficient and other mechanisms will
start the disk again some time <br>
later. The user might additionally mark the disk as
&quot;offline&quot; with &rsquo;echo offline &gt;
/sys/block/sda/device/state&rsquo; where sda is the block
name of the disk. To restart the disk &quot;off&acirc; <br>
line&quot; can be replaced with &quot;running&quot;. Note
that once the &rsquo;state&rsquo; is set to offline, no SCSI
commands can be sent to the device until it is set back to
running. Also stopping a <br>
disk via a pass-through interface (e.g. /dev/sg1 or
/dev/bsg/1:0:0:0) may reduce unwanted side effects (such as
restarting it again when this utility completes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_start is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The options in this section were the only ones available
prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23
and later these older options can be selected by either
set&acirc; <br>
ting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
&rsquo;--old&rsquo; (or &rsquo;-O) as the first option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the action of --loej
is slightly different in the older interface: when neither
--start nor --stop (nor proxies for them) are given, --loej
performs an eject operation. <br>
In the same situation the newer interface will perform a
load operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of sg_start had
a &rsquo;-s&rsquo; option to perform a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE
command before the START STOP UNIT command was issued.
According to recent SBC-2 drafts this is done <br>
implicitly if required. Hence the &rsquo;-s&rsquo; option
has been dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options, other than
&rsquo;-v&rsquo; and &rsquo;-V&rsquo;, can be given with a
single &quot;-&quot;. For example: &quot;sg_start -stop
/dev/sda&quot; and &quot;sg_start --stop /dev/sda&quot; are
equivalent. The single &quot;-&quot; form <br>
is for backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 stop (spin-down) DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 start (spin-up) DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--eject <br>
stop the medium and eject it from the drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fl=FL <br>
sets the format layer number for the disc to
&quot;jump&quot; to (defined in MMC-5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i sets the IMM bit on the START
STOP UNIT command so this utility will return immediately
and not wait for the media to spin down. Same effect as
&rsquo;--imm=1&rsquo;. The default <br>
action (without this option or a &rsquo;--imm=1&rsquo;
option) is to wait until the media spins down before
returning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--imm=0|1 <br>
when the immediate bit is 1 then this utility returns
immediately after the DEVICE has received the command. When
this option is 0 (the default) then the utility returns <br>
once the command has completed its action (i.e. it waits
until the device is started or stopped).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--load load the medium in the
drive and start it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loej sets the LOEJ bit in the
START STOP UNIT cdb. When a &quot;start&quot; operation is
indicated, then a load and start is performed. When a
&quot;stop&quot; operation is indicated, then a stop <br>
and eject is performed. When neither a &quot;start&quot; or
&quot;stop&quot; operation is indicated does a stop and
eject. [Note that the last action differs from the new
interface in which <br>
the option of this name defaults to load and start.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N switch to the newer style
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mod=PC_MOD <br>
where PC_MOD is the &rsquo;power condition modifier&rsquo;
value. 0 to 15 (inclusive) are valid and 0 is the default.
This field was added after sbc3r13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noflush <br>
do not perform a flush to media (e.g. like SYNCHRONIZE CACHE
does) before a variant of this utility that limits access to
the media. Using the --stop option is an example <br>
of something that limits access to the media. This field was
added after sbc3r13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pc=PC <br>
where PC is the &rsquo;power condition&rsquo; value (in
hex). 0 to f (inclusive) are valid. Default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r see the --readonly option
above. May be useful for ATA disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start <br>
start (spin-up) DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stop stop (spin-down) DEVICE.
Same meaning as &quot;0&quot; argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose: outputs SCSI command
in hex to console before with executing it.
&rsquo;-vv&rsquo; and &rsquo;-vvv&rsquo; are also accepted
yielding greater verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print out version string then
exit.</p>
