<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ap-config - configure and monitor Atmel and NWN based
APs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ap-config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ap-config to config and get stats from Atmel-chipset based
AP with ATMEL Private MIB support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU <br>
Info/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SysInfo <br>
Get info about AP hardware and software</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ethernet <br>
This option displays the Ethernet statistics for your
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wireless <br>
This option displays the wireless statistics for your
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stations (atmel) <br>
Under this menu the user will be able to see the Associated
Stations that are currently associated with the Access
Point. For each associated station the user will be able
<br>
to see the MAC Address. From version 0.7.3-pre1 you may save
mac addresses list to file ~/&lt;util_name&gt;.stations.
Stations on NWN AP: For each associated station the user
<br>
will be able to see the MAC Address, Link Quality, RSSI and
Idle time. <br>
* Mac address: If the association is pending (that is, the
Client is scanning, authenticating or associating),
assocAddress contains the MAC address of that Client with
<br>
the group bit set to indicate that the Access Point is aware
of the presence of that Client. The other objects of the
entry will be updated based on the information <br>
extracted from the received Probe Requests. <br>
* Link Quality: An indicator for the quality of the Client.
If the association is still pending, the quality is
calculated over the received Probe Requests from the <br>
Client. If the Client is associated, the quality derived
from any activity with the Client. The actual quality source
depends on the selected quality indicator. The seman&acirc;
<br>
tics of the indicator is &rsquo;low is good quality&rsquo;
and &rsquo;high is bad quality&rsquo;. <br>
* IdleTime: An indicator (in seconds) for the age of the
information on the Client. The age is reset to 0 if any
activity of this Client is detected. <br>
* RSSI: An indicator for the RSSI of the Client. If the
association is still pending, the RSSI is calculated over
the received Probe Requests from the Client. If the <br>
Client is associated, the RSSI derived from any activity
with the Client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KnownAP <br>
By using option APs from info menu you may see all Access
Points thats visible by your AP. <br>
* Link Quality: An indicator for the quality of the Client.
If the association is still pending, the quality is
calculated over the received Probe Requests from <br>
the Client. If the Client is associated, the quality derived
from any activity with the Client. The actual quality source
depends on the selected quality indica&acirc; <br>
tor. The semantics of the indicator is &rsquo;low is good
quality&rsquo; and &rsquo;high is bad quality&rsquo;. <br>
* RSSI: An indicator for the RSSI in dBm of the Client. If
the association is still pending, the RSSI is calculated
over the received Probe Requests from the <br>
Client. If the Client is associated, the RSSI derived from
any activity with the Client. <br>
* WARNING! By reports this option my be dangerously - in
some cases you may lost you AP configuration and on SMC2655W
the one way to fix it - only restore factory <br>
defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Config/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bridging <br>
IP configuration - If the server site supports DHCP function
and the DHCP Enable box is ticked; the IP address of an
access point will be automatically displayed and <br>
assigned; otherwise, you need to key in an IP address now.
The primary port provides a wired or wireless method to
change the access point setting. If the Ethernet <br>
option is ticked, the setting of an access point can be done
through Ethernet. If the Wireless option is ticked, the
access point function can be set through a wireless <br>
station. Wireless station means a laptop PC or a desktop PC
equipped with an IEEE802.11b PCMCIA card or USB dongle.
Enable SNMP Traps enables the SNMP trap function. <br>
You can view the records by using ap-trapd utility. You are
allowed to set your access point to be used as Access point,
Access point client, or Wireless bridge. <br>
* Access Point - An internetworking device that seamlessly
connects wired and wireless networks together. <br>
* Wireless bridge Point to point - The point-to-point
wireless bridge configuration uses two Wireless Bridge units
to connect two separate LANs. You must to fill in the <br>
Remote MAC Address before your bridge-function-enable access
point can work with it. <br>
* Point to multipoint - When connecting three to more
separate LANs, each LAN located building requires a wireless
bridge. This is called Multipoint wireless bridge and <br>
again requires one Master bridge unit and two or more Slave
bridge units as required. If the point-to-multipoint option
is selected, your bridge-function-enable access <br>
point will designate as a Mater and to work with it, others
bridges need to be set as a point-to-point bridge and enter
the MAC address of the mater access point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wireless <br>
You can give your access point a name and give it an ESSID
(Extended Service Station ID), which can allow other
wireless stations, which knows the ESSID, to link with
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Privacy <br>
The Privacy options allow you to enable 64-bit or 128-bit
WEP (wired equivalent privacy) encryption. If an encryption
function is not needed, you can just simply tick on <br>
the Disable box to disable it. If the 64-bit or 128-bit
encryption function is enabled, there are four sets of key
need to be filled into the blanket boxes. For the <br>
64-bit encryption, each key is required to enter 5 Hex
digits. For example: 11 22 33 44 55. The 128-bit encryption
requires each key to enter 13 Hex digits. For example: <br>
12 34 56 78 9A BC DE F0 11 22 33 44 55. <br>
NOTE! The WEP keys you enter are really accepted and written
to the AP, permanently if you do an Upload from the Commands
menu after setting them. However, the new key <br>
values are not echoed to the user when you return to the
Privacy settings under the Config menu. This is a security
feature of SNMP implementation in this hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authorized MAC address <br>
For security or management purpose, you can edit a list of
authorized MAC addresses, which are allowed to view or
modify the setting of an access point. Authorization
Ta&acirc; <br>
ble Enable option allows you to enable or disable this
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Community <br>
The Community configuration allow you to set a phrase for
administrator and manufacturer community and a phrase for
user community. If a user knows the phrase of adminis&acirc;
<br>
trator, he/she is authorized to change the setting of an
access point. If a user only knows about the phrase of a
user community; he/she is allowed to view the setting of
<br>
an access point but is not allowed to change the
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radio Under the Radio user will
be able to set or get the Transmitting Powervalues, for the
Control Register 31 of the Baseband, for each channel. Reg
CR31: Under this <br>
option user defines a value for the transmitted power (Value
for the Control register 31 of the baseband) and it must be
in the range 128 (max) to 255 (min) in Decimal <br>
form. Starting from version 0.6 of Access Point SNMP Config
utility it&rsquo;s possible to set power output level for
your AP. You may set signal power output in range from 0mw
<br>
to 100mw by setting value for corresponding channel from 0
to 255 (0xFF). The scale is as follows: <br>
Value: 00----------128--------255 <br>
Power: 0mw--------100mw-------0mw <br>
So to get maximum power output from your AP set value for
corresponding channel to 128 (0x80). But sometimes better
solution - experimentally choose values for best <br>
link quality, sometimes not max. More info you can get from:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advanced</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StationDBTimeout: This object
specifies a timeout on entries and their state information
in the Station database. For Clients the Station database is
mapped on the roamTable. For <br>
Access Points, the Station database is mapped on the
assocTable. The timeout is in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACKWindow: The ACK frame time
out defined in number of slottimes. This can be used to
optimize long range links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upload After you ve changed any
value or setting of an access point through the SNMP config
utility. You must come back to this option to make the new
changes and setting s vali&acirc; <br>
dated. Also, only an administrator and manufacturer is
allowed to do such changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults <br>
Restore factory default configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset Reset AP. All changed and
not uploaded settings will be lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TestMode/ <br>
When user selects the Tests option a form will appear
indicating a number of parameter needed to be set by the
user in order to perform the Radio test. <br>
Antenna: Under this option we specify the antenna to be
tested (A, B). <br>
Tx Filter: Under this option user needs to select the
Baseband transmitting Filter to be used. There are two
options (US, JPN) available since the bandwidth for <br>
Europe - USA is 11MHz and for, Japan is 14MHz. <br>
Rate: Under this option user needs to specify the rate to be
used among the following options 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5Mbps and
11Mbps. <br>
Channel: Under this option user needs to select the channel
to be used. There are 14 channels available. After setting
the parameters there are three com&acirc; <br>
mands available: Continuous Tx (with modulation), Continuous
Tx (without modulation) and Continuous Rx: <br>
* Continuous Tx (with modulation): Using this command the
MAC sets the transmitter in continuous mode with modulation.
We can measure the output power of the radio. <br>
* Continuous Tx (without modulation): Using this command we
can measure the frequency accuracy of the radio. The MAC
sets the baseband Processor in test mode and turns <br>
off the spreading and scrambling codes. <br>
* Continuous Rx: With this command user can set the device
in a receiving mode. <br>
Note: In order to perform the above test user needs to have
a Spectrum Analyzer connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect/ <br>
In order to make a connection with Access Point user needs
to set two parameters. The IP Address of the Access Point
and the Community name (default &rsquo;public&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search/ <br>
Find connected Access Points. Search for WNW APs only works
if community set to right AP community. It&rsquo;s useful if
you know community but dont know what ip your AP got <br>
from DHCP server. You must have support for multicasting
enabled in kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About/ About function shows the
Wireless Access Point Configurator for Unix version and
short info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell/ Run subshell. To return
type &rsquo;exit&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAVIGATION KEYS <br>
In case you unable to use cursor keys to menu navigate - try
to use &quot;h&quot; to go left, &quot;j&quot; to go down,
&quot;k&quot; to go up, &quot;l&quot; to go right, like vi
editor.</p>
