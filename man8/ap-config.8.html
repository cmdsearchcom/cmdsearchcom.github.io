      it must be in the range 128 (max) to 255 (min) in Decimal form. Starting
      from version 0.6 of Access Point SNMP Config utility it's possible to set
      power output level for your AP. You may set signal power output in range
      from 0mw to 100mw by setting value for corresponding channel from 0 to 255
      (0xFF). The scale is as follows:
    <br/>

    	So to get maximum power output from your AP set value for corresponding

      choose values for best link quality, sometimes not max. More info you can

     Antenna: Under this option we specify the antenna to be tested (A, B).
    <br/>
     Tx Filter: Under this option user needs to select the Baseband transmitting
      Filter to be used. There are two options (US, JPN) available since the
      bandwidth for Europe - USA is 11MHz and for, Japan is 14MHz.

     Rate: Under this option user needs to specify the rate to be used among the
      following options 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5Mbps and 11Mbps.
    <br/>
     Channel: Under this option user needs to select the channel to be used.
      There are 14 channels available. 	After setting the parameters there are
      three commands available: Continuous Tx (with modulation), Continuous Tx
      (without modulation) and Continuous Rx:
    <br/>
     * Continuous Tx (with modulation): Using this command the MAC sets the
      transmitter in continuous mode with modulation. We can measure the output
      power of the radio.
    <br/>
     * Continuous Tx (without modulation): Using this command we can measure the
      frequency accuracy of the radio. The MAC sets the baseband Processor in
      test mode and turns off the spreading and scrambling codes.
    <br/>
     * Continuous Rx: With this command user can set the device in a receiving
      mode.

     Note: In order to perform the above test user needs to have a Spectrum
      Analyzer connected.
