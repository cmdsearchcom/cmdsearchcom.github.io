<p>CRON(8) System Administration CRON(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
crond - daemon to execute scheduled commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
crond [-c | -h | -i | -n | -p | -P | -s |
-m&lt;mailcommand&gt;] <br>
crond -x [ext,sch,proc,pars,load,misc,test,bit]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cron is started from /etc/rc.d/init.d or /etc/init.d when
classical sysvinit scripts are used. In case systemd is
enabled, then unit file is installed into
/lib/systemd/sys&acirc; <br>
tem/crond.service and daemon is started by systemctl start
crond.service command. It returns immediately, thus, there
is no need to need to start it with the &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cron searches /var/spool/cron
for crontab files which are named after accounts in
/etc/passwd; The found crontabs are loaded into the memory.
Cron also searches for <br>
/etc/anacrontab and any files in the /etc/cron.d directory,
which have a different format (see crontab(5)). Cron
examines all stored crontabs and checks each job to see if
it <br>
needs to be run in the current minute. When executing
commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab
(or to the user specified in the MAILTO environment variable
in <br>
the crontab, if such exists). Any job output can also be
sent to syslog by using the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways how changes
in crontables are checked. The first method is checking the
modtime of a file. The second method is using the inotify
support. Using of inotify <br>
is logged in the /var/log/cron log after the daemon is
started. The inotify support checks for changes in all
crontables and accesses the hard disk only when a change is
<br>
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the modtime option,
Cron checks its crontables&rsquo; modtimes every minute to
check for any changes and reloads the crontables which have
changed. There is no need to <br>
restart Cron after some of the crontables were modified. The
modtime option is also used when inotify can not be
initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cron checks these files and
directories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/crontab <br>
system crontab. Nowadays the file is empty by default.
Originally it was usually used to run daily, weekly, monthly
jobs. By default these jobs are now run through <br>
anacron which reads /etc/anacrontab configuration file. See
anacrontab(5) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/cron.d/ <br>
directory that contains system cronjobs stored for different
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/cron <br>
directory that contains user crontables created by the
crontab command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the crontab(1) command
updates the modtime of the spool directory whenever it
changes a crontab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daylight Saving Time and other
time changes <br>
Local time changes of less than three hours, such as those
caused by the Daylight Saving Time changes, are handled in a
special way. This only applies to jobs that run at a
spe&acirc; <br>
cific time and jobs that run with a granularity greater than
one hour. Jobs that run more frequently are scheduled
normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If time was adjusted one hour
forward, those jobs that would have run in the interval that
has been skipped will be run immediately. Conversely, if
time was adjusted backward, <br>
running the same job twice is avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time changes of more than 3
hours are considered to be corrections to the clock or the
timezone, and the new time is used immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to use different
time zones for crontables. See crontab(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM Access Control <br>
Cron supports access control with PAM if the system has PAM
installed. For more information, see pam(8). A PAM
configuration file for crond is installed in
/etc/pam.d/crond. <br>
The daemon loads the PAM environment from the pam_env
module. This can be overridden by defining specific settings
in the appropriate crontab file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Prints a help message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Disables inotify support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m This option allows you to
specify a shell command to use for sending Cron mail output
instead of using sendmail(8) This command must accept a
fully formatted mail message <br>
(with headers) on standard input and send it as a mail
message to the recipients specified in the mail headers.
Specifying the string off (i.e., crond -m off) will
dis&acirc; <br>
able the sending of mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Tells the daemon to run in
the foreground. This can be useful when starting it out of
init. With this option is needed to change pam setting.
/etc/pam.d/crond must not <br>
enable pam_loginuid.so module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Allows Cron to accept any
user set crontables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Don&rsquo;t set PATH. PATH is
instead inherited from the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c This option enables
clustering support, as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s This option will direct Cron
to send the job output to the system log using syslog(3).
This is useful if your system does not have sendmail(8),
installed or if mail is <br>
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x This option allows you to set
debug flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
When the SIGHUP is received, the Cron daemon will close and
reopen its log file. This proves to be useful in scripts
which rotate and age log files. Naturally, this is not
rel&acirc; <br>
evant if Cron was built to use syslog(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLUSTERING SUPPORT <br>
In this version of Cron it is possible to use a
network-mounted shared /var/spool/cron across a cluster of
hosts and specify that only one of the hosts should run the
crontab <br>
jobs in this directory at any one time. This is done by
starting Cron with the -c option, and have the
/var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname file contain just one line,
which repre&acirc; <br>
sents the hostname of whichever host in the cluster should
run the jobs. If this file does not exist, or the hostname
in it does not match that returned by gethostname(2), then
<br>
all crontab files in this directory are ignored. This has no
effect on cron jobs specified in the /etc/crontab file or on
files in the /etc/cron.d directory. These files are <br>
always run and considered host-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rather than editing
/var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname directly, use the -n option
of crontab(1) to specify the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should ensure that all hosts
in a cluster, and the file server from which they mount the
shared crontab directory, have closely synchronised clocks,
e.g., using ntpd(8), oth&acirc; <br>
erwise the results will be very unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using cluster sharing
automatically disables inotify support, because inotify
cannot be relied on with network-mounted shared file
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
All crontab files have to be regular files or symlinks to
regular files, they must not be executable or writable for
anyone else but the owner. This requirement can be
overrid&acirc; <br>
den by using the -p option on the crond command line. If
inotify support is in use, changes in the symlinked crontabs
are not automatically noticed by the cron daemon. The cron
<br>
daemon must receive a SIGHUP signal to reload the crontabs.
This is a limitation of the inotify API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syslog output will be used
instead of mail, when sendmail is not installed.</p>
