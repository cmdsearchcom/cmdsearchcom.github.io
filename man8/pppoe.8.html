<p>PPPOE(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual PPPOE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pppoe - user-space PPPoE client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pppd pty &rsquo;pppoe [pppoe_options]&rsquo;
[pppd_options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pppoe -A [pppoe_options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pppoe is a user-space client for PPPoE (Point-to-Point
Protocol over Ethernet) for Linux and other UNIX systems.
pppoe works in concert with the pppd PPP daemon to provide a
PPP <br>
connection over Ethernet, as is used by many DSL service
providers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-I interface <br>
The -I option specifies the Ethernet interface to use. Under
Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1. The interface should be
&quot;up&quot; before you start pppoe, but should not be
<br>
configured to have an IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T timeout <br>
The -T option causes pppoe to exit if no session traffic is
detected for timeout seconds. I recommend that you use this
option as an extra safety measure, but if you do, <br>
you should make sure that PPP generates enough traffic so
the timeout will normally not be triggered. The best way to
do this is to use the lcp-echo-interval option to <br>
pppd. You should set the PPPoE timeout to be about four
times the LCP echo interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D file_name <br>
The -D option causes every packet to be dumped to the
specified file_name. This is intended for debugging only; it
produces huge amounts of output and greatly reduces <br>
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V The -V option causes pppoe to
print its version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A The -A option causes pppoe to
send a PADI packet and then print the names of access
concentrators in each PADO packet it receives. Do not use
this option in conjunction <br>
with pppd; the -A option is meant to be used interactively
to give interesting information about the access
concentrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S service_name <br>
Specifies the desired service name. pppoe will only initiate
sessions with access concentrators which can provide the
specified service. In most cases, you should not <br>
specify this option. Use it only if you know that there are
multiple access concentrators or know that you need a
specific service name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C ac_name <br>
Specifies the desired access concentrator name. pppoe will
only initiate sessions with the specified access
concentrator. In most cases, you should not specify this
<br>
option. Use it only if you know that there are multiple
access concentrators. If both the -S and -C options are
specified, they must both match for pppoe to initiate a <br>
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Causes pppoe to use the
Host-Uniq tag in its discovery packets. This lets you run
multiple pppoe daemons without having their discovery
packets interfere with one <br>
another. You must supply this option to all pppoe daemons if
you intend to run multiple daemons simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Causes pppoe to use
synchronous PPP encapsulation. If you use this option, then
you must use the sync option with pppd. You are encouraged
to use this option if it <br>
works, because it greatly reduces the CPU overhead of pppoe.
However, it MAY be unreliable on slow machines -- there is a
race condition between pppd writing data and <br>
pppoe reading it. For this reason, the default setting is
asynchronous. If you encounter bugs or crashes with
Synchronous PPP, turn it off -- don&rsquo;t e-mail me for
sup&acirc; <br>
port!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSS Causes pppoe to clamp the
TCP maximum segment size at the specified value. Because of
PPPoE overhead, the maximum segment size for PPPoE is
smaller than for normal Ether&acirc; <br>
net encapsulation. This could cause problems for machines on
a LAN behind a gateway using PPPoE. If you have a LAN behind
a gateway, and the gateway connects to the <br>
Internet using PPPoE, you are strongly recommended to use a
-m 1412 option. This avoids having to set the MTU on all the
hosts on the LAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file <br>
Causes pppoe to write its process-ID to the specified file.
This can be used to locate and kill pppoe processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e sess:mac <br>
Causes pppoe to skip the discovery phase and move directly
to the session phase. The session is given by sess and the
MAC address of the peer by mac. This mode is not <br>
meant for normal use; it is designed only for
pppoe-server(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Causes pppoe not to open a
discovery socket. This mode is not meant for normal use; it
is designed only for pppoe-server(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Causes pppoe to terminate an
existing session by sending a PADT frame, and then exit. You
must use the -e option in conjunction with this option to
specify the session to <br>
kill. This may be useful for killing sessions when a buggy
peer does not realize the session has ended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Causes pppoe to perform
discovery and then exit, after printing session information
to standard output. The session information is printed in
exactly the format expected <br>
by the -e option. This option lets you initiate a PPPoE
discovery, perform some other work, and then start the
actual PPP session. Be careful; if you use this option in
<br>
a loop, you can create many sessions, which may annoy your
peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f disc:sess <br>
The -f option sets the Ethernet frame types for PPPoE
discovery and session frames. The types are specified as
hexadecimal numbers separated by a colon. Standard PPPoE
<br>
uses frame types 8863:8864. You should not use this option
unless you are absolutely sure the peer you are dealing with
uses non-standard frame types. If your ISP uses <br>
non-standard frame types, complain!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h The -h option causes pppoe to
print usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PPPOE BACKGROUND <br>
PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is described
in RFC 2516 and is a protocol which allows the session
abstraction to be maintained over bridged Ethernet
networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PPPoE works by encapsulating PPP
frames in Ethernet frames. The protocol has two distinct
stages: The discovery and the session stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the discovery stage, the host
broadcasts a special PADI (PPPoE Active Discovery
Initiation) frame to discover any access concentrators. The
access concentrators (typically, <br>
only one access concentrator) reply with PADO (PPPoE Active
Discovery Offer) packets, announcing their presence and the
services they offer. The host picks one of the access <br>
concentrators and transmits a PADR (PPPoE Active Discovery
Request) packet, asking for a session. The access
concentrator replies with a PADS (PPPoE Active Discovery
Session- <br>
Confirmation) packet. The protocol then moves to the session
stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the session stage, the host
and access concentrator exchange PPP frames embedded in
Ethernet frames. The normal Ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes, but
the PPPoE overhead plus two <br>
bytes of overhead for the encapsulated PPP frame mean that
the MTU of the PPP interface is at most 1492 bytes. This
causes all kinds of problems if you are using a Linux
machine <br>
as a firewall and interfaces behind the firewall have an MTU
greater than 1492. In fact, to be safe, I recommend setting
the MTU of machines behind the firewall to 1412, to <br>
allow for worst-case TCP and IP options in their respective
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, PPP uses the Link
Control Protocol (LCP) to shut down a PPP link. However, the
PPPoE specification allows the link to be shut down with a
special PADT (PPPoE Active <br>
Discovery Terminate) packet. This client recognizes this
packet and will correctly terminate if a terminate request
is received for the PPP session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESIGN GOALS <br>
My design goals for this PPPoE client were as follows, in
descending order of importance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o It must work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o It must be a user-space
program and not a kernel patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The code must be easy to read
and maintain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o It must be fully compliant
with RFC 2516, the proposed PPPoE standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o It must never hang up forever
-- if the connection is broken, it must detect this and
exit, allowing a wrapper script to restart the
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o It must be fairly
efficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I believe I have achieved all of
these goals, but (of course) am open to suggestions, patches
and ideas. See my home page, http://www.roaringpenguin.com,
for contact informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
For best results, you must give pppd an mtu option of 1492.
I have observed problems with excessively-large frames
unless I set this option. Also, if pppoe is running on a
<br>
firewall machine, all machines behind the firewall should
have MTU&rsquo;s of 1412.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have problems, check your
system logs. pppoe logs interesting things to syslog. You
may have to turn on logging of debug-level messages for
complete diagnosis.</p>
