<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
sg3_utils is a package of utilities that send SCSI commands to the given
  <i>DEVICE</i> via a SCSI pass through interface provided by the host operating
  system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The names of all utilities start with &quot;sg&quot; and most start with
  &quot;sg_&quot; often followed by the name, or a shortening of the name, of
  the SCSI command that they send. For example the &quot;sg_verify&quot; utility
  sends the SCSI VERIFY command. A mapping between SCSI commands and the
  sg3_utils utilities that issue them is shown in the COVERAGE file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SCSI draft standards can be found at http://www.t10.org . The standards
  themselves can be purchased from ANSI and other standards organizations. A
  good overview of various SCSI standards can be seen in
  http://www.t10.org/scsi-3.htm with the SCSI command sets in the upper part of
  the diagram. SCSI commands in common with all device types can be found in SPC
  of which SPC-4 is the latest major version. Block device specific commands
  (e.g. as used by disks) are in SBC, those for tape drives in SSC and those for
  CD/DVD/BD drives in MMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is becoming more common to control ATA disks with the SCSI command set. This
  involves the translation of SCSI commands to their corresponding ATA
  equivalents (and that is an imperfect mapping in some cases). The relevant
  standard is called SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT and SAT-2 are now standards at
  INCITS(ANSI) and ISO while SAT-3 is at the draft stage). The logic to perform
  the command translation is often called a SAT Layer or SATL and may be within
  an operating system, in host bus adapter firmware or in an external device
  (e.g. associated with a SAS expander). See http://www.t10.org for more
  information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is some support for SCSI tape devices but not for their basic commands.
  The reader is referred to the &quot;mt&quot; utility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two generations of command line option usage. The newer utilities
  (written since July 2004) use the getopt_long() function to parse command line
  options. With that function, each option has two representations: a short form
  (e.g. '-v') and a longer form (e.g. '--verbose'). If an argument is required
  then it follows a space (optionally) in the short form and a &quot;=&quot; in
  the longer form (e.g. in the sg_verify utility '-l 2a6h' and '--lba=2a6h' are
  equivalent). Note that with getopt_long(), short form options can be elided,
  for example: '-all' is equivalent to '-a -l -l'. The <i>DEVICE</i> argument
  may appear after, between or prior to any options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The older utilities, such as sg_inq, had individual command line processing code
  typically based on a single &quot;-&quot; followed by one or more characters.
  If an argument is needed then it follows a &quot;=&quot; (e.g. '-p=1f' in
  sg_modes with its older interface). Various options can be elided as long as
  it is not ambiguous (e.g. '-vv' to increase the verbosity).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Over time the command line interface of these older utilities became messy and
  overloaded with options. So in sg3_utils version 1.23 the command line
  interface of these older utilities was altered to have both a cleaner
  getopt_long() interface and their older interface for backward compatibility.
  By default these older utilities use their getopt_long() based interface. That
  can be overridden by defining the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or
  using '-O' or '--old' as the first command line option. The man pages of the
  older utilities documents the details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several sg3_utils utilities are based on the Unix dd command (e.g. sg_dd) and
  permit copying data at the level of SCSI READ and WRITE commands. sg_dd is
  tightly bound to Linux and hence is not ported to other OSes. A more generic
  utility (than sg_dd) called ddpt in a package of the same name has been ported
  to other OSes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LINUX_DEVICE_NAMING"><a class="selflink" href="#LINUX_DEVICE_NAMING">LINUX
  DEVICE NAMING</a></h1>
Normal disk block devices have names like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc.
  SCSI disks in Linux have always had names like that but in recent Linux
  kernels (e.g. lk 2.6 series) it is becoming more common for almost all disks
  to be named like that. Partitions within a disk are specified by a number
  appended to the device name, starting at 1 (e.g. /dev/sda1 ).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tape drives are named /dev/st&lt;num&gt; or /dev/nst&lt;num&gt; where
  &lt;num&gt; starts at zero. Additionally one letter from this list:
  &quot;lma&quot; may be appended to the name. CD, DVD and BD readers (and
  writers) are named /dev/sr&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; start at zero. There
  are less used SCSI device type names, the dmesg and the lsscsi commands may
  help to find if any are attached to a running system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also a SCSI device driver which offers alternate generic access to SCSI
  devices. It uses names of the form /dev/sg&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; starts
  at zero. The &quot;lsscsi -g&quot; command may be useful in finding these and
  which generic name corresponds to a device type name (e.g. /dev/sg2 may
  correspond to /dev/sda). In the lk 2.6 series a block SCSI generic driver was
  introduced and its names are of the form /dev/bsg/&lt;h:c:t:l&gt; where h, c,
  t and l are numbers. Again see the lsscsi command to find the correspondence
  between that SCSI tuple (i.e. &lt;h:c:t:l&gt;) and alternate device names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prior to the Linux kernel 2.6 series these utilities could only use generic
  device names (e.g. /dev/sg1 ). In almost all cases in the Linux kernel 2.6
  series, any device name can be used by these utilities.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WINDOWS_DEVICE_NAMING"><a class="selflink" href="#WINDOWS_DEVICE_NAMING">WINDOWS
  DEVICE NAMING</a></h1>
Storage and related devices can have several device names in Windows. Probably
  the most common in the volume name (e.g. &quot;D:&quot;). There are also a
  &quot;class&quot; device names such as &quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot;,
  &quot;CDROM&lt;n&gt;&quot; and &quot;TAPE&lt;n&gt;&quot;. &lt;n&gt; is an
  integer starting at 0 allocated in ascending order as devices are discovered
  (and sometimes rediscovered).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some storage devices have a SCSI lower level device name which starts with a
  SCSI (pseudo) adapter name of the form &quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&quot;. To this is
  added sub-addressing in the form of a &quot;bus&quot; number, a
  &quot;target&quot; identifier and a LUN (Logical Unit Number). The
  &quot;bus&quot; number is also known as a &quot;PathId&quot;. These are
  assembled to form a device name of the form:
  &quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&lt;bus&gt;,&lt;target&gt;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot;. The trailing
  &quot;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot; may be omitted in which case a LUN of zero is
  assumed. This lower level device name cannot often be used directly since
  Windows blocks attempts to use it if a class driver has &quot;claimed&quot;
  the device. There are SCSI device types (e.g. Automation/Drive interface type)
  for which there is no class driver. At least two transports (&quot;bus
  types&quot; in Windows jargon): USB and IEEE 1394 do not have a
  &quot;scsi&quot; device names of this form.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In keeping with DOS file system conventions, the various device names can be
  given in upper, lower or mixed case. Since &quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot;
  is tedious to write, a shortened form of &quot;PD&lt;n&gt;&quot; is permitted
  by all utilities in this package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A single device (e.g. a disk) can have many device names. For example:
  &quot;PD0&quot; can also be &quot;C:&quot;, &quot;D:&quot; and
  &quot;SCSI0:0,1,0&quot;. The two volume names reflect that the disk has two
  partitions on it. Disk partitions that are not recognized by Windows are not
  usually given a volume name. However Vista does show a volume name for a disk
  which has no partitions recognized by it and when selected invites the user to
  format it (which may be rather unfriendly to other OSes).
<div class="Pp"></div>
These utilities assume a given device name is in the Win32 device namespace. To
  make that explicit &quot;\\.\&quot; can be prepended to the device names
  mentioned in this section. Beware that backslash is an escape character in
  Unix like shells and the C programming language. In a shell like Msys (from
  MinGW) each backslash may need to be typed twice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sg_scan utility within this package lists out Windows device names in a form
  that is suitable for other utilities in this package to use.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FREEBSD_DEVICE_NAMING"><a class="selflink" href="#FREEBSD_DEVICE_NAMING">FREEBSD
  DEVICE NAMING</a></h1>
SCSI disks have block names of the form /dev/da&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; is
  an integer starting at zero. The &quot;da&quot; is replaced by &quot;sa&quot;
  for SCSI tape drives and &quot;cd&quot; for SCSI CD/DVD/BD drives. Each SCSI
  device has a corresponding pass-through device name of the form
  /dev/pass&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; is an integer starting at zero. The
  &quot;camcontrol devlist&quot; command may be useful for finding out which
  SCSI device names are available and the correspondence between class and
  pass-through names.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOLARIS_DEVICE_NAMING"><a class="selflink" href="#SOLARIS_DEVICE_NAMING">SOLARIS
  DEVICE NAMING</a></h1>
SCSI device names below the /dev directory have a form like: c5t4d3s2 where the
  number following &quot;c&quot; is the controller (HBA) number, the number
  following &quot;t&quot; is the target number (from the SCSI parallel interface
  days) and the number following &quot;d&quot; is the LUN. Following the
  &quot;s&quot; is the slice number which is related to a partition and by
  convention &quot;s2&quot; is the whole disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OpenSolaris also has a c5t4d3p2 form where the number following the
  &quot;p&quot; is the partition number apart from &quot;p0&quot; which is the
  whole disk. So a whole disk may be referred to as either c5t4d3, c5t4d3s2 or
  c5t4d3p0 .
<div class="Pp"></div>
And these device names are duplicated in the /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk directories.
  The former is the block device name and the latter is for &quot;raw&quot; (or
  char device) access which is what sg3_utils needs. So in OpenSolaris something
  of the form 'sg_inq /dev/rdsk/c5t4d3p0' should work. If it doesn't work then
  add a '-vvv' option for more debug information. Trying this form 'sg_inq
  /dev/dsk/c5t4d3p0' (note &quot;rdsk&quot; changed to &quot;dsk&quot;) will
  result in an &quot;inappropriate ioctl for device&quot; error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The device names within the /dev directory are typically symbolic links to much
  longer topological names in the /device directory. In Solaris cd/dvd/bd drives
  seem to be treated as disks and so are found in the /dev/rdsk directory. Tape
  drives appear in the /dev/rmt directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also a sgen (SCSI generic) driver which by default does not attach to
  any device. See the /kernel/drv/sgen.conf file to control what is attached.
  Any attached device will have a device name of the form /dev/scsi/c5t4d3 .
<div class="Pp"></div>
Listing available SCSI devices in Solaris seems to be a challenge. &quot;Use the
  'format' command&quot; advice works but seems a very dangerous way to list
  devices. [It does prompt again before doing any damage.] 'devfsadm -Cv' cleans
  out the clutter in the /dev/rdsk directory, only leaving what is
  &quot;live&quot;. The &quot;cfgadm -v&quot; command looks promising.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
To aid scripts that call these utilities, the exit status is set to indicate
  success (0) or failure (1 or more). Note that some of the lower values
  correspond to the SCSI sense key values. The exit status values are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMON_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMON_OPTIONS">COMMON
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well. In the short
  form an argument to an option uses zero or more spaces as a separator (i.e.
  the short form does not use &quot;=&quot; as a separator).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an option takes a numeric argument then that argument is assumed to be
  decimal unless otherwise indicated (e.g. with a leading &quot;0x&quot;, a
  trailing &quot;h&quot; or as noted in the usage message).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some options are used uniformly in most of the utilities in this package. Those
  options are listed below. Note that there are some exceptions.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">output the usage message then exit. In a few older
      utilities the '-h' option requests hexadecimal output. In these cases the
      '-?' option will output the usage message then exit.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">several important SCSI commands (e.g. INQUIRY and MODE

      some of which these utilities take into account. The maximum response
      length is typically specified in the 'allocation length' field of the cdb.
      In the absence of this option, several utilities use a default allocation
      length (sometimes recommended in the SCSI draft standards) or a
      &quot;double fetch&quot; strategy. See sg_logs(8) for its description of a
      &quot;double fetch&quot; strategy. These techniques are imperfect and in
      the presence of faulty SCSI targets can cause problems (e.g. some USB mass
      storage devices freeze if they receive an INQUIRY allocation length other
      than 36). Also use of this option disables any &quot;double fetch&quot;

  ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
Many utilities have command line options that take numeric arguments. These
  numeric arguments can be large values (e.g. a logical block address (LBA) on a
  disk) and can be inconvenient to enter in the default decimal representation.
  So various other representations are permitted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiplicative suffixes are accepted. They are one, two or three letter strings
  appended directly after the number to which they apply:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 c C *1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 w W *2
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 b B *512
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 k K KiB *1024
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 KB *1000

<br/>
 p P PiB *(2^50)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 PB *(10^15)
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example is &quot;2k&quot; for 2048. The large tera and peta suffixes are only
  available for numeric arguments that might require 64 bits to represent
  internally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A suffix of the form &quot;x&lt;n&gt;&quot; multiplies the leading number by
  &lt;n&gt;. An example is &quot;2x33&quot; for &quot;66&quot;. The leading
  number cannot be &quot;0&quot; (zero) as that would be interpreted as a
  hexadecimal number (see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
These multiplicative suffixes are compatible with GNU's dd command (since 2002)
  which claims compliance with SI and with IEC 60027-2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively numerical arguments can be given in hexadecimal. There are two
  syntaxes. The number can be preceded by either &quot;0x&quot; or
  &quot;0X&quot; as found in the C programming language. The second hexadecimal
  representation is a trailing &quot;h&quot; or &quot;H&quot; as found in
  (storage) standards. When hex numbers are given, multipliers cannot be used.
  For example the decimal value &quot;256&quot; can be given as
  &quot;0x100&quot; or &quot;100h&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCRIPTS,_EXAMPLES_and_UTILS"><a class="selflink" href="#SCRIPTS,_EXAMPLES_and_UTILS">SCRIPTS,
  EXAMPLES and UTILS</a></h1>
There are several bash shell scripts in the 'scripts' subdirectory that invoke
  compiled utilities (e.g. sg_readcap). The scripts start with 'scsi_' rather
  than 'sg_'. One purpose of these scripts is to call the same utility (e.g.
  sg_readcap) on multiple disks. Most of the basic compiled utilities only allow
  one device as an argument. Some distributions install these scripts in a
  visible directory (e.g. /usr/src/bin). Some of these scripts have man page
  entries. See the README file in the 'scripts' subdirectory.

There is some example C code plus examples of complex invocations in the
  'examples' subdirectory. There is also a README file. The example C may be a
  simpler example of how to use a SCSI pass-through in Linux than the main
  utilities (found in the 'src' subdirectory). This is due to the fewer
  abstraction layers (e.g. they don't worry the MinGW in Windows may open a file
  in text rather than binary mode).
