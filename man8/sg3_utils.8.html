<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg3_utils - a package of utilities for sending SCSI
commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_* [--help] [--hex] [--maxlen=LEN] [--raw] [--verbose]
[--version] [OTHER_OPTIONS] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sg3_utils is a package of utilities that send SCSI commands
to the given DEVICE via a SCSI pass through interface
provided by the host operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of all utilities start
with &quot;sg&quot; and most start with &quot;sg_&quot;
often followed by the name, or a shortening of the name, of
the SCSI command that they send. For example the <br>
&quot;sg_verify&quot; utility sends the SCSI VERIFY command.
A mapping between SCSI commands and the sg3_utils utilities
that issue them is shown in the COVERAGE file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCSI draft standards can be
found at http://www.t10.org . The standards themselves can
be purchased from ANSI and other standards organizations. A
good overview of various SCSI <br>
standards can be seen in http://www.t10.org/scsi-3.htm with
the SCSI command sets in the upper part of the diagram. SCSI
commands in common with all device types can be found in
<br>
SPC of which SPC-4 is the latest major version. Block device
specific commands (e.g. as used by disks) are in SBC, those
for tape drives in SSC and those for CD/DVD/BD drives in
<br>
MMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is becoming more common to
control ATA disks with the SCSI command set. This involves
the translation of SCSI commands to their corresponding ATA
equivalents (and that is an <br>
imperfect mapping in some cases). The relevant standard is
called SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT and SAT-2 are now
standards at INCITS(ANSI) and ISO while SAT-3 is at the
draft <br>
stage). The logic to perform the command translation is
often called a SAT Layer or SATL and may be within an
operating system, in host bus adapter firmware or in an
external <br>
device (e.g. associated with a SAS expander). See
http://www.t10.org for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is some support for SCSI
tape devices but not for their basic commands. The reader is
referred to the &quot;mt&quot; utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two generations of
command line option usage. The newer utilities (written
since July 2004) use the getopt_long() function to parse
command line options. With that <br>
function, each option has two representations: a short form
(e.g. &rsquo;-v&rsquo;) and a longer form (e.g.
&rsquo;--verbose&rsquo;). If an argument is required then it
follows a space (optionally) in <br>
the short form and a &quot;=&quot; in the longer form (e.g.
in the sg_verify utility &rsquo;-l 2a6h&rsquo; and
&rsquo;--lba=2a6h&rsquo; are equivalent). Note that with
getopt_long(), short form options can be <br>
elided, for example: &rsquo;-all&rsquo; is equivalent to
&rsquo;-a -l -l&rsquo;. The DEVICE argument may appear
after, between or prior to any options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The older utilities, such as
sg_inq, had individual command line processing code
typically based on a single &quot;-&quot; followed by one or
more characters. If an argument is needed then <br>
it follows a &quot;=&quot; (e.g. &rsquo;-p=1f&rsquo; in
sg_modes with its older interface). Various options can be
elided as long as it is not ambiguous (e.g.
&rsquo;-vv&rsquo; to increase the verbosity).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Over time the command line
interface of these older utilities became messy and
overloaded with options. So in sg3_utils version 1.23 the
command line interface of these older <br>
utilities was altered to have both a cleaner getopt_long()
interface and their older interface for backward
compatibility. By default these older utilities use their
<br>
getopt_long() based interface. That can be overridden by
defining the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or
using &rsquo;-O&rsquo; or &rsquo;--old&rsquo; as the first
command line option. The man <br>
pages of the older utilities documents the details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several sg3_utils utilities are
based on the Unix dd command (e.g. sg_dd) and permit copying
data at the level of SCSI READ and WRITE commands. sg_dd is
tightly bound to Linux <br>
and hence is not ported to other OSes. A more generic
utility (than sg_dd) called ddpt in a package of the same
name has been ported to other OSes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINUX DEVICE NAMING <br>
Normal disk block devices have names like /dev/sda,
/dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc. SCSI disks in Linux have always had
names like that but in recent Linux kernels (e.g. lk 2.6
series) <br>
it is becoming more common for almost all disks to be named
like that. Partitions within a disk are specified by a
number appended to the device name, starting at 1 (e.g. <br>
/dev/sda1 ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tape drives are named
/dev/st&lt;num&gt; or /dev/nst&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt;
starts at zero. Additionally one letter from this list:
&quot;lma&quot; may be appended to the name. CD, DVD and BD
readers <br>
(and writers) are named /dev/sr&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt;
start at zero. There are less used SCSI device type names,
the dmesg and the lsscsi commands may help to find if any
are attached <br>
to a running system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a SCSI device
driver which offers alternate generic access to SCSI
devices. It uses names of the form /dev/sg&lt;num&gt; where
&lt;num&gt; starts at zero. The &quot;lsscsi -g&quot;
com&acirc; <br>
mand may be useful in finding these and which generic name
corresponds to a device type name (e.g. /dev/sg2 may
correspond to /dev/sda). In the lk 2.6 series a block SCSI
generic <br>
driver was introduced and its names are of the form
/dev/bsg/&lt;h:c:t:l&gt; where h, c, t and l are numbers.
Again see the lsscsi command to find the correspondence
between that SCSI <br>
tuple (i.e. &lt;h:c:t:l&gt;) and alternate device names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to the Linux kernel 2.6
series these utilities could only use generic device names
(e.g. /dev/sg1 ). In almost all cases in the Linux kernel
2.6 series, any device name can <br>
be used by these utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS DEVICE NAMING <br>
Storage and related devices can have several device names in
Windows. Probably the most common in the volume name (e.g.
&quot;D:&quot;). There are also a &quot;class&quot; device
names such as <br>
&quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot;,
&quot;CDROM&lt;n&gt;&quot; and &quot;TAPE&lt;n&gt;&quot;.
&lt;n&gt; is an integer starting at 0 allocated in ascending
order as devices are discovered (and sometimes
rediscovered).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some storage devices have a SCSI
lower level device name which starts with a SCSI (pseudo)
adapter name of the form &quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&quot;. To this
is added sub-addressing in the form of a <br>
&quot;bus&quot; number, a &quot;target&quot; identifier and
a LUN (Logical Unit Number). The &quot;bus&quot; number is
also known as a &quot;PathId&quot;. These are assembled to
form a device name of the form: <br>

&quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&lt;bus&gt;,&lt;target&gt;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot;.
The trailing &quot;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot; may be omitted in
which case a LUN of zero is assumed. This lower level device
name cannot often be used directly since Win&acirc; <br>
dows blocks attempts to use it if a class driver has
&quot;claimed&quot; the device. There are SCSI device types
(e.g. Automation/Drive interface type) for which there is no
class driver. <br>
At least two transports (&quot;bus types&quot; in Windows
jargon): USB and IEEE 1394 do not have a &quot;scsi&quot;
device names of this form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In keeping with DOS file system
conventions, the various device names can be given in upper,
lower or mixed case. Since
&quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot; is tedious to write, a
shortened form <br>
of &quot;PD&lt;n&gt;&quot; is permitted by all utilities in
this package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single device (e.g. a disk)
can have many device names. For example: &quot;PD0&quot; can
also be &quot;C:&quot;, &quot;D:&quot; and
&quot;SCSI0:0,1,0&quot;. The two volume names reflect that
the disk has two parti&acirc; <br>
tions on it. Disk partitions that are not recognized by
Windows are not usually given a volume name. However Vista
does show a volume name for a disk which has no partitions
rec&acirc; <br>
ognized by it and when selected invites the user to format
it (which may be rather unfriendly to other OSes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These utilities assume a given
device name is in the Win32 device namespace. To make that
explicit &quot;\. <br>
that backslash is an escape character in Unix like shells
and the C programming language. In a shell like Msys (from
MinGW) each backslash may need to be typed twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sg_scan utility within this
package lists out Windows device names in a form that is
suitable for other utilities in this package to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FREEBSD DEVICE NAMING <br>
SCSI disks have block names of the form /dev/da&lt;num&gt;
where &lt;num&gt; is an integer starting at zero. The
&quot;da&quot; is replaced by &quot;sa&quot; for SCSI tape
drives and &quot;cd&quot; for SCSI CD/DVD/BD <br>
drives. Each SCSI device has a corresponding pass-through
device name of the form /dev/pass&lt;num&gt; where
&lt;num&gt; is an integer starting at zero. The
&quot;camcontrol devlist&quot; command may <br>
be useful for finding out which SCSI device names are
available and the correspondence between class and
pass-through names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOLARIS DEVICE NAMING <br>
SCSI device names below the /dev directory have a form like:
c5t4d3s2 where the number following &quot;c&quot; is the
controller (HBA) number, the number following &quot;t&quot;
is the target number <br>
(from the SCSI parallel interface days) and the number
following &quot;d&quot; is the LUN. Following the
&quot;s&quot; is the slice number which is related to a
partition and by convention &quot;s2&quot; is <br>
the whole disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenSolaris also has a c5t4d3p2
form where the number following the &quot;p&quot; is the
partition number apart from &quot;p0&quot; which is the
whole disk. So a whole disk may be referred to as <br>
either c5t4d3, c5t4d3s2 or c5t4d3p0 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And these device names are
duplicated in the /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk directories. The
former is the block device name and the latter is for
&quot;raw&quot; (or char device) access which is <br>
what sg3_utils needs. So in OpenSolaris something of the
form &rsquo;sg_inq /dev/rdsk/c5t4d3p0&rsquo; should work. If
it doesn&rsquo;t work then add a &rsquo;-vvv&rsquo; option
for more debug information. <br>
Trying this form &rsquo;sg_inq /dev/dsk/c5t4d3p0&rsquo;
(note &quot;rdsk&quot; changed to &quot;dsk&quot;) will
result in an &quot;inappropriate ioctl for device&quot;
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device names within the /dev
directory are typically symbolic links to much longer
topological names in the /device directory. In Solaris
cd/dvd/bd drives seem to be treated <br>
as disks and so are found in the /dev/rdsk directory. Tape
drives appear in the /dev/rmt directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a sgen (SCSI
generic) driver which by default does not attach to any
device. See the /kernel/drv/sgen.conf file to control what
is attached. Any attached device <br>
will have a device name of the form /dev/scsi/c5t4d3 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listing available SCSI devices
in Solaris seems to be a challenge. &quot;Use the
&rsquo;format&rsquo; command&quot; advice works but seems a
very dangerous way to list devices. [It does prompt again
<br>
before doing any damage.] &rsquo;devfsadm -Cv&rsquo; cleans
out the clutter in the /dev/rdsk directory, only leaving
what is &quot;live&quot;. The &quot;cfgadm -v&quot; command
looks promising.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
To aid scripts that call these utilities, the exit status is
set to indicate success (0) or failure (1 or more). Note
that some of the lower values correspond to the SCSI sense
<br>
key values. The exit status values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 success</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 syntax error. Either illegal
command line options, options with bad arguments or a
combination of options that is not permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 the DEVICE reports that it is
not ready for the operation requested. The device may be in
the process of becoming ready (e.g. spinning up but not at
speed) so the utility <br>
may work after a wait.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 the DEVICE reports a medium or
hardware error (or a blank check). For example an attempt to
read a corrupted block on a disk will yield this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 the DEVICE reports an
&quot;illegal request&quot; with an additional sense code
other than &quot;invalid command operation code&quot;. This
is often a supported command with a field set <br>
requesting an unsupported capability. For commands that
require a &quot;service action&quot; field this value can
indicate that the command with that service action value is
not <br>
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 the DEVICE reports a
&quot;unit attention&quot; condition. This usually indicates
that something unrelated to the requested command has
occurred (e.g. a device reset) potentially <br>
before the current SCSI command was sent. The requested
command has not been executed by the device. Note that unit
attention conditions are usually only reported once by <br>
a device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 the DEVICE reports an illegal
request with an additional sense code of &quot;invalid
command operation code&quot; which means that it
doesn&rsquo;t support the requested command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 the DEVICE reports an aborted
command. In some cases aborted commands can be retried
immediately (e.g. if the transport aborted the command due
to congestion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14 the DEVICE reports a
miscompare sense key. VERIFY and COMPARE AND WRITE commands
may report this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15 the utility is unable to
open, close or use the given DEVICE. The given file name
could be incorrect or there may be permission problems.
Adding the &rsquo;-v&rsquo; option may give <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">20 the DEVICE reports it has a
check condition but &quot;no sense&quot; and non-zero
information in its additional sense codes. Some polling
commands (e.g. REQUEST SENSE) can receive <br>
this response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">21 the DEVICE reports a
&quot;recovered error&quot;. The requested command was
successful. Most likely a utility will report a recovered
error to stderr and continue, probably leaving <br>
the utility with an exit status of 0 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">33 the command sent to DEVICE
has timed out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">97 a SCSI command response
failed sanity checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">98 the DEVICE reports it has a
check condition but the error doesn&rsquo;t fit into any of
the above categories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">99 any errors that can&rsquo;t
be categorized into values 1 to 98 may yield this value.
This includes transport and operating system errors after
the command has been sent to the <br>
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 the utility was found but
could not be executed. That might occur if the executable
does not have execute permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 This is the exit status for
utility not found. That might occur when a script calls a
utility in this package but the PATH environment variable
has not been properly set <br>
up, so the script cannot find the executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">128 + &lt;signum&gt; <br>
If a signal kills a utility then the exit status is 128 plus
the signal number. For example if a segmentation fault
occurs then a utility is typically killed by SIGSEGV <br>
which according to &rsquo;man 7 signal&rsquo; has an
associated signal number of 11; so the exit status will be
139 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">255 the utility tried to yield
an exit status of 255 or larger. That should not happen;
given here for completeness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the error conditions
reported above will be repeatable (an example of one that is
not is &quot;unit attention&quot;) so the utility can be run
again with the &rsquo;-v&rsquo; option (or sev&acirc; <br>
eral) to obtain more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. In the short form an argument to an option uses zero
or more spaces as a separator (i.e. the short form does <br>
not use &quot;=&quot; as a separator).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an option takes a numeric
argument then that argument is assumed to be decimal unless
otherwise indicated (e.g. with a leading &quot;0x&quot;, a
trailing &quot;h&quot; or as noted in the usage <br>
message).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options are used uniformly
in most of the utilities in this package. Those options are
listed below. Note that there are some exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -?, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit. In a few older utilities
the &rsquo;-h&rsquo; option requests hexadecimal output. In
these cases the &rsquo;-?&rsquo; option will output the
usage message then <br>
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
for SCSI commands that yield a non-trivial response, print
out that response in ASCII hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --maxlen=LEN <br>
several important SCSI commands (e.g. INQUIRY and MODE
SENSE) have response lengths that vary depending on many
factors, only some of which these utilities take into <br>
account. The maximum response length is typically specified
in the &rsquo;allocation length&rsquo; field of the cdb. In
the absence of this option, several utilities use a default
<br>
allocation length (sometimes recommended in the SCSI draft
standards) or a &quot;double fetch&quot; strategy. See
sg_logs(8) for its description of a &quot;double fetch&quot;
strategy. These <br>
techniques are imperfect and in the presence of faulty SCSI
targets can cause problems (e.g. some USB mass storage
devices freeze if they receive an INQUIRY allocation <br>
length other than 36). Also use of this option disables any
&quot;double fetch&quot; strategy that may have otherwise
been used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
for SCSI commands that yield a non-trivial response, output
that response in binary to stdout. If any error messages or
warning are produced they are usually sent to <br>
stderr. Some utilities that consume data to send to the
device along with the SCSI command, use this option to
provide that data or indicate that it can be read from <br>
stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output). Can be
used multiple times to further increase verbosity. The
additional output is usually sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit. Each utility has its
own version number and date of last code change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUMERIC ARGUMENTS <br>
Many utilities have command line options that take numeric
arguments. These numeric arguments can be large values (e.g.
a logical block address (LBA) on a disk) and can be
incon&acirc; <br>
venient to enter in the default decimal representation. So
various other representations are permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiplicative suffixes are
accepted. They are one, two or three letter strings appended
directly after the number to which they apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c C *1 <br>
w W *2 <br>
b B *512 <br>
k K KiB *1024 <br>
KB *1000 <br>
m M MiB *1048576 <br>
MB *1000000 <br>
g G GiB *(2^30) <br>
GB *(10^9) <br>
t T TiB *(2^40) <br>
TB *(10^12) <br>
p P PiB *(2^50) <br>
PB *(10^15)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example is &quot;2k&quot; for
2048. The large tera and peta suffixes are only available
for numeric arguments that might require 64 bits to
represent internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A suffix of the form
&quot;x&lt;n&gt;&quot; multiplies the leading number by
&lt;n&gt;. An example is &quot;2x33&quot; for
&quot;66&quot;. The leading number cannot be &quot;0&quot;
(zero) as that would be interpreted as a hexa&acirc; <br>
decimal number (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These multiplicative suffixes
are compatible with GNU&rsquo;s dd command (since 2002)
which claims compliance with SI and with IEC 60027-2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively numerical
arguments can be given in hexadecimal. There are two
syntaxes. The number can be preceded by either
&quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot; as found in the C
programming language. <br>
The second hexadecimal representation is a trailing
&quot;h&quot; or &quot;H&quot; as found in (storage)
standards. When hex numbers are given, multipliers cannot be
used. For example the decimal <br>
value &quot;256&quot; can be given as &quot;0x100&quot; or
&quot;100h&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPTS, EXAMPLES and UTILS <br>
There are several bash shell scripts in the
&rsquo;scripts&rsquo; subdirectory that invoke compiled
utilities (e.g. sg_readcap). The scripts start with
&rsquo;scsi_&rsquo; rather than &rsquo;sg_&rsquo;. One
purpose <br>
of these scripts is to call the same utility (e.g.
sg_readcap) on multiple disks. Most of the basic compiled
utilities only allow one device as an argument. Some
distributions <br>
install these scripts in a visible directory (e.g.
/usr/src/bin). Some of these scripts have man page entries.
See the README file in the &rsquo;scripts&rsquo;
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is some example C code
plus examples of complex invocations in the
&rsquo;examples&rsquo; subdirectory. There is also a README
file. The example C may be a simpler example of how to <br>
use a SCSI pass-through in Linux than the main utilities
(found in the &rsquo;src&rsquo; subdirectory). This is due
to the fewer abstraction layers (e.g. they don&rsquo;t worry
the MinGW in Win&acirc; <br>
dows may open a file in text rather than binary mode).</p>

has found useful have been placed in the &rsquo;utils&rsquo;
subdirectory.</p>
