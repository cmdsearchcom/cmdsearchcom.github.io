<p>APCCONTROL(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
APCCONTROL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apccontrol &acirc; apcupsd(8) event handler script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apccontrol { &lt;event&gt; &lt;ups-name&gt;
&lt;connected&gt; &lt;powered&gt; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When apcupsd(8) detects anomalies from the UPS being
monitored, it triggers an event which usually results in one
or more calls to the apccontrol shell script. Each event
causes <br>
apccontrol to take a particular action. These actions
default to sane behaviour for all the events that apcupsd is
likely to encounter. However, you can change the behaviour
of <br>
every single action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When apcupsd detects an event,
it calls the apccontrol script with the following four
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">event This is the event that
occurred. Refer to the list of possible events below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups-name This is the name of the
UPS as specified in the /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
configuration file - not the name in the EEPROM of a smart
UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connected This is 1 if apcupsd
is connected to the UPS via a serial or USB port. In the
case of a slave machine where apcupsd is not directly
connected to the UPS, this value <br>
will be 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">powered This is 1 if the
computer on which apcupsd is running is powered by the UPS
and 0 if not. This is not currently implemented and always
defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Events are sent to the system
log and, optionally, to the temporary events file
(/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events), and they also generate a call
to apccontrol which in turn will call <br>
any scripts you have placed in the /etc/apcupsd
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST OF EVENTS AND DEFAULT
ACTIONS <br>
annoyme apcupsd generates this event when a shutdown is
scheduled, and the time specified by the ANNOYME
configuration directive in the /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
file has <br>
expired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Power problems please logoff.&quot; to wall(1) and
then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battattach apcupsd generates
this event when it detects that the UPS battery has been
reconnected after a battdetach event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action: does
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battdetach apcupsd generates
this event when it detects that the UPS battery has been
disconnected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action: does
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changeme apcupsd generates this
event when it detects that the utility power is on, but the
battery is not functioning correctly. This is repeated every
9 hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Emergency! UPS batteries have failed Change them
NOW&quot; to wall and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commfailure apcupsd generates
this event each time it loses communication with the
monitored UPS. This event is not detected on simple
signalling UPSes like the Back-UPS 650.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Communications with UPS lost.&quot; to wall and then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commok apcupsd generates this
event after a commfailure event when communication with the
UPS is re-established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Communications with UPS restored.&quot; to wall and
then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doreboot This event is
deprecated and should not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Beginning Reboot Sequence&quot; to wall and then calls
shutdown(8) with the &quot;-r now&quot; command line
arguments to reboot the computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doshutdown apcupsd generates
this event to shutdown the computer when the UPS is running
on battery power and one of the limits (time, run, load) is
reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Beginning Shutdown Sequence&quot; to wall and then
calls shutdown(8) with the command line arguments &quot;-h
now&quot; to shutdown the computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emergency apcupsd generates this
event when the UPS is on battery power, the battery is low
and the utility power is on: a sure sign of battery
failure!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Emergency Shutdown. Possible UPS battery
failure.&quot; to wall. Immediately after this, apcupsd
generates a doshutdown event to shutdown the sys&acirc; <br>
tem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failing apcupsd generates this
event when the UPS is running on batteries and the UPS sets
the low battery signal indicating that battery power is
nearly exhausted. After this <br>
event, apcupsd will immediately generate a doshutdown
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;UPS battery power exhausted. Doing shutdown.&quot; to
wall and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">killpower apcupsd does not
normally generate this event. Instead, it is invoked
directly from the system halt script as &rsquo;apccontrol
killpower&rsquo; because the killpower event needs <br>
to be performed as late in system shutdown as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;UPS now committed to shut down&quot; to wall, waits
for 10 seconds and then issues the command &quot;apcupsd
--killpower&quot; to put the UPS into hibernate <br>
mode and shut off power to the connected equipment. In the
case of a smart UPS, the UPS will then wait for the expiry
of any configured shutdown time delay specified <br>
by the SLEEP configuration directive. In hibernate mode, the
UPS will restore utility power to the connected equipment
subject to the values specified for the RETURN&acirc; <br>
CHARGE and WAKEUP configuration directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadlimit apcupsd generates this
event when the battery discharge limit specified by the
BATTERYLEVEL configuration directive has been reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;UPS battery discharge limit reached. Doing
shutdown&quot; to wall and then exits. After this event,
apcupsd will immediately generate a doshutdown <br>
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mainsback apcupsd generates this
event when the utility power returns after a powerout event.
The doshutdown event may or may not have been generated
depending on the parameters <br>
you have defined and the length of the power outage.
Attempting cancellation of a doshutdown event should never
be tried as it is very unlikely to succeed and will <br>
almost certainly leave your computer in an indeterminate
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- if the file
/var/run/powerfail exists, sends &quot;Continuing with
shutdown.&quot; to wall and then exits. Otherwise, does
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onbattery apcupsd generates this
event if a power failure has been detected and the UPS is
still on battery power at the expiry of the delay specified
by the ONBATTERYDELAY con&acirc; <br>
figuration directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;Power failure. Running on UPS batteries.&quot; to wall
and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offbattery apcupsd generates
this event when the utility power returns if, and only if,
the onbattery event has been generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default -- sends
&quot;&quot;Power has returned...&quot; to wall and then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">powerout apcupsd generates this
event as soon as apcupsd detects that the UPS has switched
to battery power and it is not a self-test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- does
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remotedown apcupsd generates
this event on a slave machine when it detects either (1)
that the master has shutdown, or (2) that an onbattery event
has occurred and communication <br>
with the master has been lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action: sends
&quot;Remote Shutdown. Beginning Shutdown Sequence.&quot; to
wall and exits. Immediately after this, apcupsd generates a
doshutdown event to shutdown the <br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runlimit apcupsd generates this
event when the remaining runtime limit specified by the
MINUTES configuration directive expires while the UPS is on
battery power as the result <br>
of a utility power outage. The remaining runtime is
internally calculated by the UPS and monitored by
apcuspd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- sends
&quot;UPS battery runtime percent reached. Doing
shutdown.&quot; to wall and then exits. After this event,
apcupsd will immediately generate a doshut&acirc; <br>
down event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout apcupsd generates this
event when the time specified by the TIMEOUT configuration
directive expires while the UPS is on battery power as the
result of a utility power <br>
outage. This configuration directive is not normally used
with smart UPSes which would instead rely on the more
reliable remaining runtime (MINUTES) or the battery <br>
level (BATTERYLEVEL) configuration directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action -- send &quot;UPS
battery runtime limit exceeded. Doing shutdown.&quot; to
wall and then exits. After this event, apcupsd will
immediately generate a doshutdown <br>
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startselftest apcupsd generates
this event when it detects the start of a UPS self test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action: does
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endselftest apcupsd generates
this event when it detects the end of a UPS self test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action: does
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOMISING EVENT ACTIONS <br>
Do not modify apccontrol directly as it will be overwritten
the next time you upgrade to a new release of apcupsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recommended way to customise
an event action is simply to create an executable program or
script file with the same name as the event and put that
file in the /etc/apcupsd <br>
directory. Now, when the selected event occurs, apccontrol
will execute your program or script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want apccontrol to also
execute its default action for the selected event, your
program or script should exit with an exit status of 0
(zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not want apccontrol to
also execute its default action for the selected event, your
program or script must exit with an exit status of 99. Be
aware that if you completely <br>
override the default action, you must ensure the proper
shutdown of your computer if this is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some sample scripts (changeme,
commfailure, commok, offbattery and onbattery) that email
messages to root instead of broadcasting messages to all
logged-in users may be found in <br>
/etc/apcupsd after an installation and also in the
platforms/etc directory of the apcupsd source code.</p>
