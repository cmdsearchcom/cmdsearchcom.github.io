When <a class="Xr" title="Xr">apcupsd(8)</a> detects anomalies from the UPS
  being monitored, it triggers an event which usually results in one or more
  calls to the <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> shell script. Each event
  causes <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> to take a particular action.
  These actions default to sane behaviour for all the events that apcupsd is
  likely to encounter. However, you can change the behaviour of every single
  action.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When apcupsd detects an event, it calls the
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> script with the following four
  arguments:
<dl class="Bl-hang">
  <dt class="It-hang">event</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 15.00ex;">This is the event that
      occurred. Refer to the list of possible events below.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">ups-name</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 15.00ex;">This is the name of the UPS
      as specified in the <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</i>
      configuration file - not the name in the EEPROM of a smart UPS.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">connected</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 15.00ex;">This is 1 if apcupsd is
      connected to the UPS via a serial or USB port. In the case of a slave
      machine where apcupsd is not directly connected to the UPS, this value
      will be 0.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">powered</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 15.00ex;">This is 1 if the computer on
      which apcupsd is running is powered by the UPS and 0 if not. This is not
      currently implemented and always defaults to 0.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Events are sent to the system log and, optionally, to the temporary events file
  (<i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</i>), and they also
  generate a call to <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> which in turn will
  call any scripts you have placed in the
  <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/apcupsd</i> directory.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="LIST_OF_EVENTS_AND_DEFAULT_ACTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIST_OF_EVENTS_AND_DEFAULT_ACTIONS">LIST
  OF EVENTS AND DEFAULT ACTIONS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-hang">
  <dt class="It-hang">annoyme</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when a shutdown is scheduled, and the time specified by the ANNOYME
      configuration directive in the
      <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</i> file has expired.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Power problems please logoff.&quot; to
      <a class="Xr" title="Xr">wall(1)</a> and then exits.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">battattach</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when it detects that the UPS battery has been reconnected after a
      battdetach event.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action: does nothing.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">battdetach</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when it detects that the UPS battery has been disconnected.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action: does nothing.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">changeme</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when it detects that the utility power is on, but the battery is not
      functioning correctly. This is repeated every 9 hours.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Emergency! UPS batteries have failed Change
      them NOW&quot; to wall and then exits.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">commfailure</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      each time it loses communication with the monitored UPS. This event is not
      detected on simple signalling UPSes like the Back-UPS 650.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Communications with UPS lost.&quot; to wall
      and then exits.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">commok</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      after a commfailure event when communication with the UPS is
      re-established.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Communications with UPS restored.&quot; to
      wall and then exits.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">doreboot</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">This event is deprecated and
      should not be used.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Beginning Reboot Sequence&quot; to wall and
      then calls <a class="Xr" title="Xr">shutdown(8)</a> with the &quot;-r
      now&quot; command line arguments to reboot the computer.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">doshutdown</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      to shutdown the computer when the UPS is running on battery power and one
      of the limits (time, run, load) is reached.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Beginning Shutdown Sequence&quot; to wall and
      then calls <a class="Xr" title="Xr">shutdown(8)</a> with the command line
      arguments &quot;-h now&quot; to shutdown the computer.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">emergency</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when the UPS is on battery power, the battery is low and the utility power
      is on: a sure sign of battery failure!
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Emergency Shutdown. Possible UPS battery
      failure.&quot; to wall. Immediately after this, apcupsd generates a
      doshutdown event to shutdown the system.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">failing</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when the UPS is running on batteries and the UPS sets the low battery
      signal indicating that battery power is nearly exhausted. After this
      event, apcupsd will immediately generate a doshutdown event.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;UPS battery power exhausted. Doing
      shutdown.&quot; to wall and then exits.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">killpower</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd does not normally
      generate this event. Instead, it is invoked directly from the system halt
      script as 'apccontrol killpower' because the killpower event needs to be
      performed as late in system shutdown as possible.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;UPS now committed to shut down&quot; to wall,
      waits for 10 seconds and then issues the command &quot;apcupsd
      --killpower&quot; to put the UPS into hibernate mode and shut off power to
      the connected equipment. In the case of a smart UPS, the UPS will then
      wait for the expiry of any configured shutdown time delay specified by the
      SLEEP configuration directive. In hibernate mode, the UPS will restore
      utility power to the connected equipment subject to the values specified
      for the RETURNCHARGE and WAKEUP configuration directives.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">loadlimit</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when the battery discharge limit specified by the BATTERYLEVEL
      configuration directive has been reached.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;UPS battery discharge limit reached. Doing
      shutdown&quot; to wall and then exits. After this event, apcupsd will
      immediately generate a doshutdown event.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">mainsback</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when the utility power returns after a powerout event. The doshutdown
      event may or may not have been generated depending on the parameters you
      have defined and the length of the power outage. Attempting cancellation
      of a doshutdown event should never be tried as it is very unlikely to
      succeed and will almost certainly leave your computer in an indeterminate
      state.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- if the file
      <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/var/run/powerfail</i> exists, sends
      &quot;Continuing with shutdown.&quot; to wall and then exits. Otherwise,
      does nothing.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">onbattery</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      if a power failure has been detected and the UPS is still on battery power
      at the expiry of the delay specified by the ONBATTERYDELAY configuration
      directive.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;Power failure. Running on UPS batteries.&quot;
      to wall and then exits.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">offbattery</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when the utility power returns if, and only if, the onbattery event has
      been generated.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default -- sends &quot;&quot;Power has returned...&quot; to wall and then
      exits.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">powerout</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      as soon as apcupsd detects that the UPS has switched to battery power and
      it is not a self-test.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- does nothing.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">remotedown</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      on a slave machine when it detects either (1) that the master has
      shutdown, or (2) that an onbattery event has occurred and communication
      with the master has been lost.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action: sends &quot;Remote Shutdown. Beginning Shutdown
      Sequence.&quot; to wall and exits. Immediately after this, apcupsd
      generates a doshutdown event to shutdown the system.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">runlimit</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when the remaining runtime limit specified by the MINUTES configuration
      directive expires while the UPS is on battery power as the result of a
      utility power outage. The remaining runtime is internally calculated by
      the UPS and monitored by apcuspd.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- sends &quot;UPS battery runtime percent reached. Doing
      shutdown.&quot; to wall and then exits. After this event, apcupsd will
      immediately generate a doshutdown event.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">timeout</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when the time specified by the TIMEOUT configuration directive expires
      while the UPS is on battery power as the result of a utility power outage.
      This configuration directive is not normally used with smart UPSes which
      would instead rely on the more reliable remaining runtime (MINUTES) or the
      battery level (BATTERYLEVEL) configuration directives.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action -- send &quot;UPS battery runtime limit exceeded. Doing
      shutdown.&quot; to wall and then exits. After this event, apcupsd will
      immediately generate a doshutdown event.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">startselftest</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when it detects the start of a UPS self test.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action: does nothing.</dd>
  <dt class="It-hang">endselftest</dt>
  <dd class="It-hang" style="margin-left: 16.20ex;">apcupsd generates this event
      when it detects the end of a UPS self test.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Default action: does nothing.</dd>

  EVENT ACTIONS</a></h2>
Do <i class="Em" title="Em">not</i> modify
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> directly as it will be overwritten the
  next time you upgrade to a new release of apcupsd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The recommended way to customise an event action is simply to create an
  executable program or script file with the same name as the event and put that
  file in the <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/apcupsd</i> directory. Now, when the
  selected event occurs, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> will execute
  your program or script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> to also execute its default
  action for the selected event, your program or script should exit with an exit
  status of 0 (zero).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do <i class="Em" title="Em">not</i> want
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">apccontrol</b> to also execute its default action for
  the selected event, your program or script must exit with an exit status of
  99. Be aware that if you completely override the default action, you must
  ensure the proper shutdown of your computer if this is necessary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
