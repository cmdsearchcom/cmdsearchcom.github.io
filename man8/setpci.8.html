<p>setpci(8) The PCI Utilities setpci(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
setpci - configure PCI devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
setpci [options] devices operations...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
setpci is a utility for querying and configuring PCI
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All numbers are entered in
hexadecimal notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Root privileges are necessary
for almost all operations, excluding reads of the standard
header of the configuration space on some operating systems.
Please see lspci(8) for <br>
details on access rights.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
General options <br>
-v Tells setpci to be verbose and display detailed
information about configuration space accesses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Tells setpci not to complain
when there&rsquo;s nothing to do (when no devices are
selected). This option is intended for use in
widely-distributed configuration scripts where <br>
it&rsquo;s uncertain whether the device in question is
present in the machine or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D &lsquo;Demo mode&rsquo; --
don&rsquo;t write anything to the configuration registers.
It&rsquo;s useful to try setpci -vD to verify that your
complex sequence of setpci operations does what you <br>
think it should do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show setpci version. This option should be used
stand-alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show detailed help on
available options. This option should be used
stand-alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dumpregs <br>
Show a list of all known PCI registers and capabilities.
This option should be used stand-alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCI access options <br>
The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices
(see pcilib(7) for details). You can use the following
options to influence its behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A &lt;method&gt; <br>
The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI
hardware. By default, it uses the first access method
available, but you can use this option to override this <br>
decision. See -A help for a list of available methods and
their descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O &lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<br>
The behavior of the library is controlled by several named
parameters. This option allows to set the value of any of
the parameters. Use -O help for a list of known <br>
parameters and their default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H1 Use direct hardware access
via Intel configuration mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand
for -A intel-conf1.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H2 Use direct hardware access
via Intel configuration mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand
for -A intel-conf2.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Increase debug level of the
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE SELECTION <br>
Before each sequence of operations you need to select which
devices you wish that operation to affect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s
[[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;slot&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]
<br>
Consider only devices in the specified domain (in case your
machine has several host bridges, they can either share a
common bus number space or each of them can address a <br>
PCI domain of its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff),
bus (0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7). Each
component of the device address can be omitted or <br>
set to &quot;*&quot;, both meaning &quot;any value&quot;.
All numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., &quot;0:&quot; means all
devices on bus 0, &quot;0&quot; means all functions of
device 0 on any bus, &quot;0.3&quot; selects <br>
third function of device 0 on all buses and &quot;.4&quot;
matches only the fourth function of each device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d
[&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;] <br>
Select devices with specified vendor and device ID. Both
ID&rsquo;s are given in hexadecimal and may be omitted or
given as &quot;*&quot;, both meaning &quot;any
value&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -s and -d are combined,
only devices that match both criteria are selected. When
multiple options of the same kind are specified, the
rightmost one overrides the others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATIONS <br>
There are two kinds of operations: reads and writes. To read
a register, just specify its name. Writes have the form
name=value,value... where each value is either a hexadecimal
<br>
number or an expression of type data:mask where both data
and mask are hexadecimal numbers. In the latter case, only
the bits corresponding to binary ones in the mask are
changed <br>
(technically, this is a read-modify-write operation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways how to
identity a register:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tell its address
in hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Spell its name.
Setpci knows the names of all registers in the standard
configuration headers. Use &lsquo;setpci --dumpregs&rsquo;
to get the complete list. See PCI bus specifica&acirc; <br>
tions for the precise meaning of these registers or consult
header.h or /usr/include/pci/pci.h for a brief sketch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the register
is a part of a PCI capability, you can specify the name of
the capability to get the address of its first register. See
the names starting with &lsquo;CAP_&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;ECAP_&rsquo; in the --dumpregs output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the name of
the capability is not known to setpci, you can refer to it
by its number in the form CAPid or ECAPid, where id is the
numeric identifier of the capability <br>
in hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Each of the
previous formats can be followed by +offset to add an offset
(a hex number) to the address. This feature can be useful
for addressing of registers living <br>
within a capability, or to modify parts of standard
registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Finally, you
should append a width specifier .B, .W, or .L to choose how
many bytes (1, 2, or 4) should be transferred. The width can
be omitted if you are referring to a <br>
register by its name and the width of the register is well
known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All names of registers and width
specifiers are case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
COMMAND <br>
asks for the word-sized command register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4.w is a numeric address of the
same register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND.l <br>
asks for a 32-bit word starting at the location of the
command register, i.e., the command and status registers
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VENDOR_ID+1.b <br>
specifies the upper byte of the vendor ID register
(remember, PCI is little-endian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAP_PM+2.w <br>
corresponds to the second word of the power management
capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECAP108.l <br>
asks for the first 32-bit word of the extended capability
with ID 0x108.</p>
