device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reiserfsck searches for a Reiserfs filesystem on a device,
replays any necessary transactions, and either checks or
repairs the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">device is the special file
corresponding to a device or to a partition (e.g /dev/hdXX
for an IDE disk partition or /dev/sdXX for a SCSI disk
partition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--rebuild-sb <br>
This option recovers the superblock on a Reiserfs partition.
Normally you only need this option if mount reports
&quot;read_super_block: can&rsquo;t find a reiserfs file
system&quot; and <br>
you are sure that a Reiserfs file system is there. But
remember that if you have used some partition editor program
and now you cannot find a filesystem, probably some&acirc;
<br>
thing has gone wrong while repartitioning and the start of
the partition has been changed. If so, instead of rebuilding
the super block on a wrong place you should find <br>
the correct start of the partition first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check <br>
This default action checks filesystem consistency and
reports, but does not repair any corruption that it finds.
This option may be used on a read-only file system
mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fix-fixable <br>
This option recovers certain kinds of corruption that do not
require rebuilding the entire file system tree
(--rebuild-tree). Normally you only need this option if the
<br>
--check option reports &quot;corruption that can be fixed
with --fix-fixable&quot;. This includes: zeroing invalid
data-block pointers, correcting st_size and st_blocks for
directo&acirc; <br>
ries, and deleting invalid directory entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rebuild-tree <br>
This option rebuilds the entire filesystem tree using leaf
nodes found on the device. Normally you only need this
option if the reiserfsck --check reports &quot;Running with
<br>
--rebuild-tree is required&quot;. You are strongly
encouraged to make a backup copy of the whole partition
before attempting the --rebuild-tree option. Once reiserfsck
<br>
--rebuild-tree is started it must finish its work (and you
should not interrupt it), otherwise the filesystem will be
left in the unmountable state to avoid subsequent <br>
data corruptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clean-attributes <br>
This option cleans reserved fields of Stat-Data items. There
were days when there were no extended attributes in
reiserfs. When they were implemented old partitions needed
<br>
to be cleaned first -- reiserfs code in the kernel did not
care about not used fields in its strutures. Thus if you
have used one of the old (pre-attrbutes) kernels with a <br>
ReiserFS filesystem and you want to use extented attribues
there, you should clean the filesystem first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--journal device , -j device
<br>
This option supplies the device name of the current file
system journal. This option is required when the journal
resides on a separate device from the main data device <br>
(although it can be avoided with the expert option
--no-journal-available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--adjust-size, -z <br>
This option causes reiserfsck to correct file sizes that are
larger than the offset of the last discovered byte. This
implies that holes at the end of a file will be <br>
removed. File sizes that are smaller than the offset of the
last discovered byte are corrected by --fix-fixable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--badblocks file, -B file <br>
This option sets the badblock list to be the list of blocks
specified in the given &lsquo;file&lsquo;. The filesystem
badblock list is cleared before the new list is added. It
can be <br>
used with --fix-fixable to fix the list of badblocks (see
debugreiserfs -B). If the device has bad blocks, every time
it must be given with the --rebuild-tree option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logfile file, -l file <br>
This option causes reiserfsck to report any corruption it
finds to the specified log file rather than to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nolog, -n <br>
This option prevents reiserfsck from reporting any kinds of
corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet, -q <br>
This option prevents reiserfsck from reporting its rate of
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yes, -y <br>
This option inhibits reiserfsck from asking you for
confirmation after telling you what it is going to do. It
will assuem you confirm. For safety, it does not work with
<br>
the --rebuild-tree option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, -p These options are usually
passed by fsck -A during the automatic checking of those
partitions listed in /etc/fstab. These options cause
reiserfsck to print some informa&acirc; <br>
tion about the specified filesystem, to check if error flags
in the superblock are set and to do some light-weight
checks. If these checks reveal a corruption or the flag <br>
indicating a (possibly fixable) corruption is found set in
the superblock, then reiserfsck switches to the fix-fixable
mode. If the flag indicating a fatal corruption is <br>
found set in the superblock, then reiserfsck finishes with
an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force, -f <br>
Force checking even if the file system seems clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V This option prints the
reiserfsprogs version and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r This option does nothing at
all; it is provided only for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPERT OPTIONS <br>
DO NOT USE THESE OPTIONS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU LOSE DATA AS A RESULT OF THESE
OPTIONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-journal-available <br>
This option allows reiserfsck to proceed when the journal
device is not available. This option has no effect when the
journal is located on the main data device. NOTE: <br>
after this operation you must use reiserfstune to specify a
new journal device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scan-whole-partition, -S <br>
This option causes --rebuild-tree to scan the whole
partition but not only the used space on the partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AN EXAMPLE OF USING reiserfsck
<br>
1. You think something may be wrong with a reiserfs
partition on /dev/hda1 or you would just like to perform a
periodic disk check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Run reiserfsck --check
--logfile check.log /dev/hda1. If reiserfsck --check exits
with status 0 it means no errors were discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If reiserfsck --check exits
with status 1 (and reports about fixable corruptions) it
means that you should run reiserfsck --fix-fixable --logfile
fixable.log /dev/hda1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If reiserfsck --check exits
with status 2 (and reports about fatal corruptions) it means
that you need to run reiserfsck --rebuild-tree. If
reiserfsck --check fails in some <br>
way you should also run reiserfsck --rebuild-tree, but we
also encourage you to submit this as a bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Before running reiserfsck
--rebuild-tree, please make a backup of the whole partition
before proceeding. Then run reiserfsck --rebuild-tree
--logfile rebuild.log /dev/hda1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. If the reiserfsck
--rebuild-tree step fails or does not recover what you
expected, please submit this as a bug report. Try to provide
as much information as possible including <br>
your platform and Linux kernel version. We will try to help
solve the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
reiserfsck uses the following exit codes: <br>
0 - No errors. <br>
1 - File system errors corrected. <br>
2 - Reboot is needed. <br>
4 - File system fatal errors left uncorrected, <br>
reiserfsck --rebuild-tree needs to be launched. <br>
6 - File system fixable errors left uncorrected, <br>
reiserfsck --fix-fixable needs to be launched. <br>
8 - Operational error. <br>
16 - Usage or syntax error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report bugs to the ReiserFS developers
&lt;reiserfs-devel@vger.kernel.org&gt;, providing as much
information as possible--your hardware, kernel, patches,
settings, all printed <br>
messages, the logfile; check the syslog file for any related
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
Faster recovering, signal handling.</p>
