<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ovn-sbctl - utility for querying and configuring
OVN_Southbound database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ovn-sbctl [options] -- [options] command [args] [--
[options] command [args]]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ovn-sbctl program configures the OVN_Southbound database
by providing a high-level interface to its configuration
database. See ovn-sb(5) for comprehensive documentation of
<br>
the database schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-sbctl connects to an
ovsdb-server process that maintains an OVN_Southbound
configuration database. Using this connection, it queries
and possibly applies changes to the <br>
database, depending on the supplied commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-sbctl can perform any number
of commands in a single run, implemented as a single atomic
transaction against the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ovn-sbctl command line
begins with global options (see OPTIONS below for details).
The global options are followed by one or more commands.
Each command should begin with <br>
-- by itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from
the following commands. (The -- before the first command is
optional.) The command itself starts with command-spe&acirc;
<br>
cific options, if any, followed by the command name and any
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options affect the behavior of ovn-sbctl as a
whole. Some individual commands also accept their own
options, which are given just before the command name. If
the <br>
first command on the command line has options, then those
options must be separated from the global options by --.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--db=server <br>
The OVSDB database remote to contact. If the OVN_SB_DB
environment variable is set, its value is used as the
default. Otherwise, the default is unix:/var/run/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/db.sock, but this default is unlikely to be useful
outside of single-machine OVN test environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server must take one of the
following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl:ip:port <br>
The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4
or IPv6 address format. If ip is an IPv6 <br>
address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
ssl:[::1]:6640. The --private-key, --certificate, and
--ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp:ip:port <br>
Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4 or
IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with
square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:file <br>
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a local
named pipe that is represented by a file created in the path
file to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssl:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given SSL port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but specifying ip limits connections to those
from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If ip is an
IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack&acirc; <br>
ets, e.g.: pssl:6640:[::1]. The --private-key,
--certificate, and --ca-cert options are mandatory when this
form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptcp:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given TCP port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but ip may be specified to listen only for
connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If
ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square <br>
brackets, e.g.: ptcp:6640:[::1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punix:file <br>
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named file
for a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, listen on a local
named pipe. A file is created in the path file to mimic the
behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-syslog <br>
By default, ovn-sbctl logs its arguments and the details of
any changes that it makes to the system log. This option
disables this logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
--verbose=sbctl:syslog:warn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oneline <br>
Modifies the output format so that the output for each
command is printed on a single line. New-line characters
that would otherwise separate lines are printed as 0 and
<br>
any instances of &nbsp;that would otherwise appear in the
output are doubled. Prints a blank line for each command
that has no output. This option does not affect the
for&acirc; <br>
matting of output from the list or find commands; see Table
Formatting Options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run <br>
Prevents ovn-sbctl from actually modifying the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t secs <br>
--timeout=secs <br>
By default, or with a secs of 0, ovn-sbctl waits forever for
a response from the database. This option limits runtime to
approximately secs seconds. If the timeout <br>
expires, ovn-sbctl will exit with a SIGALRM signal. (A
timeout would normally happen only if the database cannot be
contacted, or if the system is overloaded.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[spec] <br>
--verbose=[spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively. (If
--detach is specified, ovn-sbctl <br>
closes its standard file descriptors, so logging to the
console will have no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be fil&acirc; <br>
tered out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8)
for a definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
--log-file is also specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
--verbose=dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vPATTERN:destination:pattern
<br>
--verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vFACILITY:facility <br>
--verbose=FACILITY:facility <br>
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can
be one of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, <br>
local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
local7. If this option is not specified, daemon is used as
the default for the local system syslog and local0 is <br>
used while sending a message to the target provided via the
--syslog-target option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file[=file] <br>
Enables logging to a file. If file is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
file name used if file is omitted is /var/log/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/ovn-sbctl.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-target=host:port <br>
Send syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the
system syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-method=method <br>
Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog
daemon. Following forms are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libc, use libc
syslog() function. This is the default behavior. Downside of
using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actu&acirc; <br>
ally sent to the syslog daemon over /dev/log UNIX domain
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file, use
UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify
arbitrary message format with this option. However, rsyslogd
8.9 and older versions use hard <br>
coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket
use. If you want to use arbitrary message format with older
rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to <br>
localhost IP address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; udp:ip:port, use
UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary
message format also with older rsyslogd. When sending syslog
messages over UDP <br>
socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for
example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
the specified UDP port, accidental iptables <br>
rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and
there are some security considerations that apply to UDP
sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints version information to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table Formatting Options <br>
These options control the format of output from the list and
find commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f format <br>
--format=format <br>
Sets the type of table formatting. The following types of
format are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">table 2-D text tables with
aligned columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list (default) <br>
A list with one column per line and rows separated by a
blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">html HTML tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csv Comma-separated values as
defined in RFC 4180.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">json JSON format as defined in
RFC 4627. The output is a sequence of JSON objects, each of
which corresponds to one table. Each JSON object has the
following members <br>
with the noted values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caption <br>
The table&rsquo;s caption. This member is omitted if the
table has no caption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headings <br>
An array with one element per table column. Each array
element is a string giving the corresponding column&rsquo;s
heading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data An array with one element
per table row. Each element is also an array with one
element per table column. The elements of this second-level
array are the <br>
cells that constitute the table. Cells that represent OVSDB
data or data types are expressed in the format described in
the OVSDB specification; other cells <br>
are simply expressed as text strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d format <br>
--data=format <br>
Sets the formatting for cells within output tables. The
following types of format are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string (default) <br>
The simple format described in the Database Values section
of ovs-vsctl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bare The simple format with
punctuation stripped off: [] and {} are omitted around sets,
maps, and empty columns, items within sets and maps are
space-separated, and <br>
strings are never quoted. This format may be easier for
scripts to parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">json JSON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The json output format always
outputs cells in JSON format, ignoring this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-heading <br>
This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise
appears in the first row of table output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pretty <br>
By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as
possible. This option causes JSON in output to be printed in
a more readable fashion. Members of objects and ele&acirc;
<br>
ments of arrays are printed one per line, with
indentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not affect JSON
in tables, which is always printed compactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bare Equivalent to
--format=list --data=bare --no-headings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public Key Infrastructure
Options <br>
-p privkey.pem <br>
--private-key=privkey.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
ovn-sbctl&rsquo;s identity for outgoing SSL connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cert.pem <br>
--certificate=cert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies
the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the <br>
certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections
will use to verify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cacert.pem <br>
--ca-cert=cacert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
ovn-sbctl should use to verify certificates presented to it
by SSL peers. (This may be the same certificate that <br>
SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on -c or
--certificate, or it may be a different one, depending on
the PKI design in use.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C none <br>
--ca-cert=none <br>
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
peers. This introduces a security risk, because it means
that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
<br>
trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
<br>
When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as
-C or --ca-cert. If it does not exist, then ovn-sbctl will
attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL <br>
peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named
PEM file. If it is successful, it will immediately drop the
connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL <br>
connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by
the CA certificate thus obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option exposes the SSL
connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the
initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for
bootstrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only useful if
the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as part of the SSL
certificate chain. The SSL protocol does not require the
server to send the CA cer&acirc; <br>
tificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mutually
exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--peer-ca-cert=peer-cacert.pem
<br>
Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more additional
certificates to send to SSL peers. peer-cacert.pem should be
the CA certificate used to sign ovn-sbctl&rsquo;s own <br>
certificate, that is, the certificate specified on -c or
--certificate. If ovn-sbctl&rsquo;s certificate is
self-signed, then --certificate and --peer-ca-cert should
specify <br>
the same file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not useful in
normal operation, because the SSL peer must already have the
CA certificate for the peer to have any confidence in
ovn-sbctl&rsquo;s identity. How&acirc; <br>
ever, this offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap
the CA certificate on its first SSL connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The commands implemented by ovn-sbctl are described in the
sections below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVN_Southbound Commands <br>
These commands work with an OVN_Southbound database as a
whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init Initializes the database,
if it is empty. If the database has already been
initialized, this command has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show Prints a brief overview of
the database contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chassis Commands <br>
These commands manipulate OVN_Southbound chassis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--may-exist] chassis-add
chassis encap-type encap-ip <br>
Creates a new chassis named chassis. encap-type is a
comma-separated list of tunnel types. The chassis will have
one encap entry for each specified tunnel type with <br>
encap-ip as the destination IP for each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --may-exist, attempting
to create a chassis that exists is an error. With
--may-exist, this command does nothing if chassis already
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] chassis-del
chassis <br>
Deletes chassis and its encaps and gateway_ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, attempting
to delete a chassis that does not exist is an error. With
--if-exists, attempting to delete a chassis that does not
exist has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Port binding Commands <br>
These commands manipulate OVN_Southbound port bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--may-exist] lsp-bind
logical-port chassis <br>
Binds the logical port named logical-port to chassis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --may-exist, attempting
to bind a logical port that has already been bound is an
error. With --may-exist, this command does nothing if
logical-port has already <br>
been bound to a chassis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] lsp-unbind
logical-port <br>
Resets the binding of logical-port to NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, attempting
to unbind a logical port that is not bound is an error. With
--if-exists, attempting to unbind logical port that is not
bound has no <br>
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical Flow Commands <br>
[--uuid] lflow-list [logical-datapath] [lflow...] <br>
List logical flows. If logical-datapath is specified, only
list flows for that logical datapath. The logical-datapath
may be given as a UUID or as a datapath name <br>
(reporting an error if multiple datapaths have the same
name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If at least one lflow is given,
only matching logical flows, if any, are listed. Each lflow
may be specified as a UUID or the first few characters of a
UUID, optionally <br>
prefixed by 0x. (Because ovn-controller sets OpenFlow flow
cookies to the first 32 bits of the corresponding logical
flow&rsquo;s UUID, this makes it easy to look up the
logi&acirc; <br>
cal flow that generated a particular OpenFlow flow.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --uuid is specified, the
output includes the first 32 bits of each logical
flow&rsquo;s UUID. This makes it easier to find the OpenFlow
flows that correspond to a given log&acirc; <br>
ical flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--uuid] dump-flows
[logical-datapath] <br>
Alias for lflow-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote Connectivity Commands
<br>
These commands manipulate the connections column in the
SB_Global table and rows in the Connection table. When
ovsdb-server is configured to use the connections column for
OVSDB <br>
connections, this allows the administrator to use ovn-sbctl
to configure database connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-connection <br>
Prints the configured connection(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-connection <br>
Deletes the configured connection(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-connection
[access-specifier] target... <br>
Sets the configured manager target or targets. Each target
may be preceded by an optional access-specifier (read-only
or read-write) and may use any of the following <br>
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl:ip:port <br>
The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4
or IPv6 address format. If ip is an IPv6 <br>
address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
ssl:[::1]:6640. The --private-key, --certificate, and
--ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp:ip:port <br>
Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4 or
IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with
square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:file <br>
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a local
named pipe that is represented by a file created in the path
file to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssl:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given SSL port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but specifying ip limits connections to those
from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If ip is an
IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack&acirc; <br>
ets, e.g.: pssl:6640:[::1]. The --private-key,
--certificate, and --ca-cert options are mandatory when this
form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptcp:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given TCP port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but ip may be specified to listen only for
connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If
ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square <br>
brackets, e.g.: ptcp:6640:[::1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punix:file <br>
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named file
for a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, listen on a local
named pipe. A file is created in the path file to mimic the
behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If provided, the effect of the
access specifier persists for subsequent targets until
changed by another access specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL Configuration <br>
When ovsdb-server is configured to connect using SSL, the
following parameters are required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">private-key <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used for SSL
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">certificate <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the
certificate authority (CA) used by the connection peers,
that certifies the private key, identifying a trust&acirc;
<br>
worthy peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ca-cert <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to
verify that the connection peers are trustworthy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These SSL settings apply to all
SSL connections made by the southbound database server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-ssl <br>
Prints the SSL configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-ssl <br>
Deletes the current SSL configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--bootstrap] set-ssl
private-key certificate ca-cert <br>
Sets the SSL configuration. The --bootstrap option is
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CA Certificate Bootstrap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, all of the files
named in the SSL configuration must exist before SSL
connectivity can be used. However, if the ca-cert file does
not exist and the --bootstrap <br>
option is given, then ovsdb-server will attempt to obtain
the CA certificate from the target on its first SSL
connection and save it to the named PEM file. If it is
successful, <br>
it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and
from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a
certificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option exposes the SSL
connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the
initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for
bootstrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only useful if
the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as part of the SSL
certificate chain. The SSL protocol does not require the
controller to send the CA cer&acirc; <br>
tificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database Values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each column in the database
accepts a fixed type of data. The currently defined basic
types, and their representations, are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integer <br>
A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1,
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">real A floating-point
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean <br>
True or false, written true or false, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string An arbitrary Unicode
string, except that null bytes are not allowed. Quotes are
optional for most strings that begin with an English letter
or underscore and consist only <br>
of letters, underscores, hyphens, and periods. However, true
and false and strings that match the syntax of UUIDs (see
below) must be enclosed in double quotes to distin&acirc;
<br>
guish them from other basic types. When double quotes are
used, the syntax is that of strings in JSON, e.g.
backslashes may be used to escape special characters. The
<br>
empty string must be represented as a pair of double quotes
(&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUID Either a universally unique
identifier in the style of RFC 4122, e.g.
f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6, or an @name defined by
a get or create command within the same <br>
ovn-sbctl invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple values in a single
column may be separated by spaces or a single comma. When
multiple values are present, duplicates are not allowed, and
order is not important. Con&acirc; <br>
versely, some database columns can have an empty set of
values, represented as [], and square brackets may
optionally enclose other non-empty sets or single values as
well. For a <br>
column accepting a set of integers, database commands accept
a range. A range is represented by two integers separated by
-. A range is inclusive. A range has a maximum size of <br>
4096 elements. If more elements are needed, they can be
specified in seperate ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few database columns are
&lsquo;&lsquo;maps&rsquo;&rsquo; of key-value pairs, where
the key and the value are each some fixed database type.
These are specified in the form key=value, where key and
<br>
value follow the syntax for the column&rsquo;s key type and
value type, respectively. When multiple pairs are present
(separated by spaces or a comma), duplicate keys are not
allowed, <br>
and again the order is not important. Duplicate values are
allowed. An empty map is represented as {}. Curly braces may
optionally enclose non-empty maps as well (but use <br>
quotes to prevent the shell from expanding
other-config={0=x,1=y} into other-config=0=x
other-config=1=y, which may not have the desired
effect).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database Command Syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists]
[--columns=column[,column]...] list table [record]... <br>
Lists the data in each specified record. If no records are
specified, lists all the records in table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --columns is specified, only
the requested columns are listed, in the specified order.
Otherwise, all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by
column name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if any specified record does not exist. With
--if-exists, the command ignores any record that does not
exist, without producing any <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--columns=column[,column]...]
find table [column[:key]=value]... <br>
Lists the data in each record in table whose column equals
value or, if key is specified, whose column contains a key
with the specified value. The following operators <br>
may be used where = is written in the syntax summary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= <br>
Selects records in which column[:key] equals, does not
equal, is less than, is greater than, is less than or equal
to, or is greater than or equal to value, respec&acirc; <br>
tively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider column[:key] and value
as sets of elements. Identical sets are considered equal.
Otherwise, if the sets have different numbers of elements,
then the set <br>
with more elements is considered to be larger. Otherwise,
consider a element from each set pairwise, in increasing
order within each set. The first pair that dif&acirc; <br>
fers determines the result. (For a column that contains
key-value pairs, first all the keys are compared, and values
are considered only if the two sets contain <br>
identical keys.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{=} {!=} <br>
Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&lt;=} Selects records in which
column[:key] is a subset of value. For example,
flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2 selects records in which the
flood-vlans column is the empty set or <br>
contains 1 or 2 or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&lt;} Selects records in which
column[:key] is a proper subset of value. For example,
flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2 selects records in which the
flood-vlans column is the empty set <br>
or contains 1 or 2 but not both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&gt;=} {&gt;} <br>
Same as {&lt;=} and {&lt;}, respectively, except that the
relationship is reversed. For example, flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2
selects records in which the flood-vlans column con&acirc;
<br>
tains both 1 and 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For arithmetic operators (= !=
&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=), when key is specified but a
particular record&rsquo;s column does not contain key, the
record is always omitted from the results. <br>
Thus, the condition other-config:mtu!=1500 matches records
that have a mtu key whose value is not 1500, but not those
that lack an mtu key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the set operators, when key
is specified but a particular record&rsquo;s column does not
contain key, the comparison is done against an empty set.
Thus, the condition <br>
other-config:mtu{!=}1500 matches records that have a mtu key
whose value is not 1500 and those that lack an mtu key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t forget to escape
&lt; or &gt; from interpretation by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --columns is specified, only
the requested columns are listed, in the specified order.
Otherwise all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by
column name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UUIDs shown for rows created
in the same ovn-sbctl invocation will be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] [--id=@name] get
table record [column[:key]]... <br>
Prints the value of each specified column in the given
record in table. For map columns, a key may optionally be
specified, in which case the value associated with key in
<br>
the column is printed, instead of the entire map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist or key is specified, if key
does not exist in record. With --if-exists, a missing record
yields no output and <br>
a missing key prints a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If @name is specified, then the
UUID for record may be referred to by that name later in the
same ovn-sbctl invocation in contexts where a UUID is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both --id and the column
arguments are optional, but usually at least one or the
other should be specified. If both are omitted, then get has
no effect except to verify <br>
that record exists in table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--id and --if-exists cannot be
used together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] set table record
column[:key]=value... <br>
Sets the value of each specified column in the given record
in table to value. For map columns, a key may optionally be
specified, in which case the value associated with <br>
key in that column is changed (or added, if none exists),
instead of the entire map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist. With --if-exists, this
command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] add table record
column [key=]value... <br>
Adds the specified value or key-value pair to column in
record in table. If column is a map, then key is required,
otherwise it is prohibited. If key already exists in a <br>
map column, then the current value is not replaced (use the
set command to replace an existing value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist. With --if-exists, this
command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] remove table
record column value... <br>
[--if-exists] remove table record column key... <br>
[--if-exists] remove table record column key=value... <br>
Removes the specified values or key-value pairs from column
in record in table. The first form applies to columns that
are not maps: each specified value is removed from <br>
the column. The second and third forms apply to map columns:
if only a key is specified, then any key-value pair with the
given key is removed, regardless of its value; <br>
if a value is given then a pair is removed only if both key
and value match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not an error if the column
does not contain the specified key or value or pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an

command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] clear table record
column... <br>
Sets each column in record in table to the empty set or
empty map, as appropriate. This command applies only to
columns that are allowed to be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --if-exists, it is an
error if record does not exist. With --if-exists, this
command does nothing if record does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--id=@name] create table
column[:key]=value... <br>
Creates a new record in table and sets the initial values of
each column. Columns not explicitly set will receive their
default values. Outputs the UUID of the new row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If @name is specified, then the
UUID for the new row may be referred to by that name
elsewhere in the same ovn-sbctl invocation in contexts where
a UUID is expected. Such <br>
references may precede or follow the create command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution (ovs-vsctl as exmaple)
<br>
Records in the Open vSwitch database are significant only
when they can be reached directly or indirectly from the
Open_vSwitch table. Except for records in the <br>
QoS or Queue tables, records that are not reachable from the
Open_vSwitch table are automatically deleted from the
database. This deletion happens immediately, <br>
without waiting for additional ovs-vsctl commands or other
database activity. Thus, a create command must generally be
accompanied by additional commands within <br>
the same ovs-vsctl invocation to add a chain of references
to the newly created record from the top-level Open_vSwitch
record. The EXAMPLES section gives some <br>
examples that show how to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--if-exists] destroy table
record... <br>
Deletes each specified record from table. Unless --if-exists
is specified, each records must exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all destroy table <br>
Deletes all records from the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution (ovs-vsctl as exmaple)
<br>
The destroy command is only useful for records in the QoS or
Queue tables. Records in other tables are automatically
deleted from the database when they become <br>
unreachable from the Open_vSwitch table. This means that
deleting the last reference to a record is sufficient for
deleting the record itself. For records in <br>
these tables, destroy is silently ignored. See the EXAMPLES
section below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait-until table record
[column[:key]=value]... <br>
Waits until table contains a record named record whose
column equals value or, if key is specified, whose column
contains a key with the specified value. Any of the
oper&acirc; <br>
ators !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, or &gt;= may be substituted for
= to test for inequality, less than, greater than, less than
or equal to, or greater than or equal to, respectively. <br>
(Don&rsquo;t forget to escape &lt; or &gt; from
interpretation by the shell.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no column[:key]=value
arguments are given, this command waits only until record
exists. If more than one such argument is given, the command
waits until all of them <br>
are satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution (ovs-vsctl as exmaple)
<br>
Usually wait-until should be placed at the beginning of a
set of ovs-vsctl commands. For example, wait-until bridge
br0 -- get bridge br0 datapath_id waits until a <br>
bridge named br0 is created, then prints its datapath_id
column, whereas get bridge br0 datapath_id -- wait-until
bridge br0 will abort if no bridge named br0 <br>
exists when ovs-vsctl initially connects to the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider specifying --timeout=0
along with --wait-until, to prevent ovn-sbctl from
terminating after waiting only at most 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment [arg]... <br>
This command has no effect on behavior, but any database log
record created by the command will include the command and
its arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
