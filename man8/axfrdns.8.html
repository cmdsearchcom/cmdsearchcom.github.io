<p>axfrdns(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual axfrdns(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
axfrdns - a DNS zone-transfer server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
axfrdns reads a zone-transfer request in DNS-over-TCP format
from its standard input, and responds with locally
configured information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration <br>
Normally axfrdns is set up by the axfrdns-conf(8)
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">axfrdns runs chrooted in the
directory specified by the $ROOT environment variable, under
the uid and gid specified by the $UID and $GID environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally axfrdns runs under
tcpserver(1) to handle TCP connections on port 53 of a local
IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpserver(1) is responsible for
rejecting connections from hosts not authorized to perform
zone transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">axfrdns can also run under
secure connection tools offering an UCSPI-compliant
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">axfrdns looks up zone-transfer
results in data.cdb, a binary file created by
tinydns-data(8). It also responds to normal client queries,
such as SOA queries, which usually pre&acirc; <br>
cede zone-transfer requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">axfrdns allows zone transfers
for any zone listed in the $AXFR environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$AXFR is a slash-separated list
of domain names. If $AXFR is not set, axfrdns allows zone
transfers for all zones available in data.cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">axfrdns aborts if it runs out of
memory, or has trouble reading data.cdb, or receives a
request larger than 512 bytes, or receives a truncated
request, or receives a zone-trans&acirc; <br>
fer request disallowed by $AXFR, or receives a request not
answered by data.cdb, or waits 60 seconds with nothing
happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further notes on zone transfers
<br>
axfrdns provides every record it can find inside the target
domain. This may include records in child zones. Some of
these records (such as glue inside a child zone) are
essen&acirc; <br>
tial; others are not. It is up to the client to decide which
out-of-zone records to keep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">axfrdns does not provide glue
records outside the target domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The zone-transfer protocol does
not support timestamps. If a record is scheduled to be
created in the future, axfrdns does not send it; after the
starting time, the zone-trans&acirc; <br>
fer client will continue claiming that the record
doesn&rsquo;t exist, until it contacts axfrdns again.
Similarly, if a record is scheduled to die in the future,
axfrdns sends it <br>
(with a 2-second TTL); after the ending time, the
zone-transfer client will continue providing the old record,
until it contacts axfrdns again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zone-transfer clients rely on
zone serial numbers changing for every zone
modification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tinydns-data(8) uses the
modification time of the data file as its serial number for
all zones. Do not make more than one modification per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BIND&rsquo;s zone-transfer
client, named-xfer, converts zone-transfer data to zone-file
format. Beware that zone-file format has no generic
mechanism to express records of arbitrary <br>
types;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">named-xfer chokes if it does not
recognize a record type used in data.cdb.</p>
