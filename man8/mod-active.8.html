MOD-ACTIVE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mod-active - Batch processing of newsgroups creation and
removal commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mod-active [ctlinnd-command-file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mod-active is a Perl script that updates the active file
based on its input lines of ctlinnd &quot;newgroup&quot;,
&quot;rmgroup&quot; and &quot;changegroup&quot; commands. It
pauses the server briefly while <br>
the existing active file is read and rewritten, which not
only keeps innd from updating the active file but also locks
against other instances of mod-active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script must be run as the
news user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input to mod-active can come
either from one or more ctlinnd-command-file files named on
the command line, or from the standard input. Typically its
input is the output from <br>
the docheckgroups or actsync commands. Every line which
contains the string &quot;ctlinnd newgroup&quot;,
&quot;ctlinnd rmgroup&quot;, or &quot;ctlinnd
changegroup&quot;, optionally preceded by whitespace <br>
and/or the path to ctlinnd, is noted for the update.
Redundant commands, such as a newgroup directive for a group
that already exists, are silently ignored. All other lines
in <br>
the input are also silently ignored. After the new active
file has been generated, the existing one is renamed to
active.old and the new one is moved into place. The script
<br>
then displays the differences between the two files. Any
groups that were added to the active file are also added to
the active.times file with the string
&quot;checkgroups-update&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that no syntax
checking is performed on group names by mod-active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Though innd is paused while mod-active works, it is not
inconceivable that there could be a conflict if something
else tries to update the active file during the relatively
short <br>
time that mod-active is working. The two most realistic ways
for this to happen are either by an administrator
concurrently doing a manual ctlinnd command, or by innd
receiving <br>
a control message, then mod-active pausing the server, then
the control message handler script that innd forked running
its own ctlinnd command while mod-active is working. Note
<br>
that such scenarios are very unlikely to happen.</p>
