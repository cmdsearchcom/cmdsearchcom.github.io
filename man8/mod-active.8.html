mod-active - Batch processing of newsgroups creation and removal commands

<b>mod-active</b> [<i>ctlinnd-command-file</i> ...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>mod-active</b> is a Perl script that updates the <i>active</i> file based on
  its input lines of <b>ctlinnd</b> &quot;newgroup&quot;, &quot;rmgroup&quot;
  and &quot;changegroup&quot; commands. It pauses the server briefly while the
  existing <i>active</i> file is read and rewritten, which not only keeps
  <b>innd</b> from updating the <i>active</i> file but also locks against other
  instances of <b>mod-active</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The script must be run as the news user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input to <b>mod-active</b> can come either from one or more
  <i>ctlinnd-command-file</i> files named on the command line, or from the
  standard input. Typically its input is the output from the
  <b>docheckgroups</b> or <b>actsync</b> commands. Every line which contains the
  string &quot;ctlinnd newgroup&quot;, &quot;ctlinnd rmgroup&quot;, or
  &quot;ctlinnd changegroup&quot;, optionally preceded by whitespace and/or the
  path to <b>ctlinnd</b>, is noted for the update. Redundant commands, such as a
  newgroup directive for a group that already exists, are silently ignored. All
  other lines in the input are also silently ignored. After the new
  <i>active</i> file has been generated, the existing one is renamed to
  <i>active.old</i> and the new one is moved into place. The script then
  displays the differences between the two files. Any groups that were added to
  the <i>active</i> file are also added to the <i>active.times</i> file with the
  string &quot;checkgroups-update&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that no syntax checking is performed on group names by
  <b>mod-active</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Though <b>innd</b> is paused while <b>mod-active</b> works, it is not
  inconceivable that there could be a conflict if something else tries to update
  the <i>active</i> file during the relatively short time that <b>mod-active</b>
  is working. The two most realistic ways for this to happen are either by an
  administrator concurrently doing a manual <b>ctlinnd</b> command, or by
  <b>innd</b> receiving a control message, then <b>mod-active</b> pausing the
  server, then the control message handler script that <b>innd</b> forked
  running its own <b>ctlinnd</b> command while <b>mod-active</b> is working.
  Note that such scenarios are <i>very</i> unlikely to happen.
