<p>rpc.gssd(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
rpc.gssd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rpc.gssd - RPCSEC_GSS daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rpc.gssd [-DfMnlvr] [-k keytab] [-p pipefsdir] [-d
ccachedir] [-t timeout] [-R realm]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
The RPCSEC_GSS protocol, defined in RFC 5403, is used to
provide strong security for RPC-based protocols such as
NFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before exchanging RPC requests
using RPCSEC_GSS, an RPC client must establish a GSS
security context. A security context is shared state on each
end of a network transport that <br>
enables GSS-API security services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security contexts are
established using security credentials. A credential grants
temporary access to a secure network service, much as a
railway ticket grants temporary access <br>
to use a rail service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user typically obtains a
credential by providing a password to the kinit(1) command,
or via a PAM library at login time. A credential acquired
with a user principal is known <br>
as a user credential (see kerberos(1) for more on
principals).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For certain operations, a
credential is required which represents no user, is
otherwise unprivileged, and is always available. This is
referred to as a machine credential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine credentials are
typically established using a service principal, whose
encrypted password, called its key, is stored in a file,
called a keytab, to avoid requiring a user <br>
prompt. A machine credential effectively does not expire
because the system can renew it as needed without user
intervention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once obtained, credentials are
typically stored in local temporary files with well-known
pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
To establish GSS security contexts using these credential
files, the Linux kernel RPC client depends on a userspace
daemon called rpc.gssd. The rpc.gssd daemon uses the <br>
rpc_pipefs filesystem to communicate with the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Credentials <br>
When a user authenticates using a command such as kinit(1),
the resulting credential is stored in a file with a
well-known name constructed using the user&rsquo;s UID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To interact with an NFS server
on behalf of a particular Kerberos-authenticated user, the
Linux kernel RPC client requests that rpc.gssd initialize a
security context with the <br>
credential in that user&rsquo;s credential file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically, credential files are
placed in /tmp. However, rpc.gssd can search for credential
files in more than one directory. See the description of the
-d option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine Credentials <br>
A user credential is established by a user and is then
shared with the kernel and rpc.gssd. A machine credential is
established by rpc.gssd for the kernel when there is no
user. <br>
Therefore rpc.gssd must already have the materials on hand
to establish this credential without requiring user
intervention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpc.gssd searches the local
system&rsquo;s keytab for a principal and key to use to
establish the machine credential. By default, rpc.gssd
assumes the file /etc/krb5.keytab contains <br>
principals and keys that can be used to obtain machine
credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpc.gssd searches in the
following order for a principal to use. The first matching
credential is used. For the search, &lt;hostname&gt; and
&lt;REALM&gt; are replaced with the local sys&acirc; <br>
tem&rsquo;s hostname and Kerberos realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;$@&lt;REALM&gt;
<br>
root/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt; <br>
nfs/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt; <br>
host/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt; <br>
root/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt; <br>
nfs/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt; <br>
host/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;anyname&gt; entries
match on the service name and realm, but ignore the
hostname. These can be used if a principal matching the
local host&rsquo;s name is not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the first principal in
the search order is a user principal that enables Kerberized
NFS when the local system is joined to an Active Directory
domain using Samba. A <br>
password for this principal must be provided in the local
system&rsquo;s keytab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify another keytab
by using the -k option if /etc/krb5.keytab does not exist or
does not provide one of these principals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Credentials for UID 0 <br>
UID 0 is a special case. By default rpc.gssd uses the
system&rsquo;s machine credentials for UID 0 accesses that
require GSS authentication. This limits the privileges of
the root <br>
user when accessing network resources that require
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the -n option when
starting rpc.gssd if you&rsquo;d like to force the root user
to obtain a user credential rather than use the local
system&rsquo;s machine credential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -n is specified, the kernel
continues to request a GSS context established with a
machine credential for NFSv4 operations, such as SETCLIENTID
or RENEW, that manage state. <br>
If rpc.gssd cannot obtain a machine credential (say, the
local system has no keytab), NFSv4 operations that require
machine credentials will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encryption types <br>
A realm administrator can choose to add keys encoded in a
number of different encryption types to the local
system&rsquo;s keytab. For instance, a host/ principal might
have keys for <br>
the aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96, aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96,
des3-cbc-sha1, and arcfour-hmac encryption types. This
permits rpc.gssd to choose an appropriate encryption type
that the <br>
target NFS server supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These encryption types are
stronger than legacy single-DES encryption types. To
interoperate in environments where servers support only weak
encryption types, you can restrict <br>
your client to use only single-DES encryption types by
specifying the -l option when starting rpc.gssd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-D The server name passed to GSSAPI for authentication is
normally the name exactly as requested. e.g. for NFS it is
the server name in the &quot;servername:/path&quot; mount
request. <br>
Only if this servername appears to be an IP address (IPv4 or
IPv6) or an unqualified name (no dots) will a reverse DNS
lookup will be performed to get the canoncial server <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -D is present, a reverse DNS
lookup will always be used, even if the server name looks
like a canonical name. So it is needed if partially
qualified, or non canonical <br>
names are regularly used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using -D can introduce a
security vulnerability, so it is recommended that -D not be
used, and that canonical names always be used when
requesting services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Runs rpc.gssd in the
foreground and sends output to stderr (as opposed to
syslogd)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n When specified, UID 0 is
forced to obtain user credentials which are used instead of
the local system&rsquo;s machine credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keytab <br>
Tells rpc.gssd to use the keys found in keytab to obtain
machine credentials. The default value is
/etc/krb5.keytab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l When specified, restricts
rpc.gssd to sessions to weak encryption types such as
des-cbc-crc. This option is available only when the local
system&rsquo;s Kerberos library sup&acirc; <br>
ports settable encryption types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p path <br>
Tells rpc.gssd where to look for the rpc_pipefs filesystem.
The default value is /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d search-path <br>
This option specifies a colon separated list of directories
that rpc.gssd searches for credential files. The default
value is /tmp:/run/user/%U. The literal sequence <br>
&quot;%U&quot; can be specified to substitue the UID of the
user for whom credentials are being searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M By default, machine
credentials are stored in files in the first directory in
the credential directory search path (see the -d option).
When -M is set, rpc.gssd stores <br>
machine credentials in memory instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increases the verbosity of
the output (can be specified multiple times).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r If the RPCSEC_GSS library
supports setting debug level, increases the verbosity of the
output (can be specified multiple times).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R realm <br>
Kerberos tickets from this realm will be preferred when
scanning available credentials cache files to be used to
create a context. By default, the default realm, as
con&acirc; <br>
figured in the Kerberos configuration file, is
preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Timeout, in seconds, for kernel GSS contexts. This option
allows you to force new kernel contexts to be negotiated
after timeout seconds, which allows changing Kerberos <br>
tickets and identities frequently. The default is no
explicit timeout, which means the kernel context will live
the lifetime of the Kerberos service ticket used in its <br>
creation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T timeout <br>
Timeout, in seconds, to create an RPC connection with a
server while establishing an authenticated gss context for a
user. The default timeout is set to 5 seconds. If <br>
you get messages like &quot;WARNING: can&rsquo;t create tcp
rpc_clnt to server %servername% for user with uid %uid%:
RPC: Remote system error - Connection timed out&quot;, you
should con&acirc; <br>
sider an increase of this timeout.</p>
