<p>acpid(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual acpid(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
acpid - Advanced Configuration and Power Interface event
daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
acpid [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
acpid is designed to notify user-space programs of ACPI
events. acpid should be started during the system boot, and
will run as a background process, by default. It will open
<br>
an events file (/proc/acpi/event by default) and attempt to
read whole lines which represent ACPI events. If the events
file does not exist, acpid will attempt to connect to the
<br>
Linux kernel via the input layer and netlink. When an ACPI
event is received from one of these sources, acpid will
examine a list of rules, and execute the rules that match
the <br>
event. acpid will ignore all incoming ACPI events if a lock
file exists (/var/lock/acpid by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rules are defined by simple
configuration files. acpid will look in a configuration
directory (/etc/acpi/events by default), and parse all
regular files with names that consist <br>
entirely of upper and lower case letters, digits,
underscores, and hyphens (similar to run-parts(8)). Each
file must define two things: an event and an action. Any
blank lines, <br>
or lines where the first character is a hash
(&rsquo;#&rsquo;) are ignored. Extraneous lines are flagged
as warnings, but are not fatal. Each line has three tokens:
the key, a literal <br>
equal sign, and the value. The key can be up to 63
characters, and is case-insensitive (but whitespace
matters). The value can be up to 511 characters, and is case
and white&acirc; <br>
space sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The event value is a regular
expression (see regcomp(3)), against which events are
matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action value is a
commandline, which will be invoked via /bin/sh whenever an
event matching the rule in question occurs. The commandline
may include shell-special charac&acirc; <br>
ters, and they will be preserved. The only special
characters in an action value are &quot;%&quot; escaped. The
string &quot;%e&quot; will be replaced by the literal text
of the event for which <br>
the action was invoked. This string may contain spaces, so
the commandline must take care to quote the &quot;%e&quot;
if it wants a single token. The string &quot;%%&quot; will
be replaced by a <br>
literal &quot;%&quot;. All other &quot;%&quot; escapes are
reserved, and will cause a rule to not load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature allows multiple
rules to be defined for the same event (though no ordering
is guaranteed), as well as one rule to be defined for
multiple events. To force acpid to <br>
reload the rule configuration, send it a SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to rule files, acpid
also accepts connections on a UNIX domain socket
(/var/run/acpid.socket by default). Any application may
connect to this socket. Once con&acirc; <br>
nected, acpid will send the text of all ACPI events to the
client. The client has the responsibility of filtering for
messages about which it cares. acpid will not close the <br>
client socket except in the case of a SIGHUP or acpid
exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For faster startup, this socket
can be passed in as stdin so that acpid need not create the
socket. In addition, if a socket is passed in as stdin,
acpid will not daemonize. It <br>
will be run in foreground. This behavior is provided to
support systemd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acpid will log all of its
activities, as well as the stdout and stderr of any actions,
to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the default files and
directories can be changed with commandline options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When troubleshooting acpid, it
is important to be aware that other parts of a system might
be handling ACPI events. systemd(1) is capable of handling
the power switch and vari&acirc; <br>
ous other events that are commonly handled by acpid. See the
description of HandlePowerKey in logind.conf(5) for more.
Some window managers also take over acpid&rsquo;s normal
han&acirc; <br>
dling of the power button and other events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --confdir directory <br>
This option changes the directory in which acpid looks for
rule configuration files. Default is /etc/acpi/events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --clientmax number <br>
This option changes the maximum number of non-root socket
connections which can be made to the acpid socket. Default
is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug This option
increases the acpid debug level by one. If the debug level
is non-zero, acpid will run in the foreground, and will log
to stderr, in addition to the reg&acirc; <br>
ular syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --eventfile filename <br>
This option changes the event file from which acpid reads
events. Default is /proc/acpi/event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --netlink <br>
This option forces acpid to use the Linux kernel input layer
and netlink interface for ACPI events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
This option keeps acpid in the foreground by not forking at
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --logevents <br>
This option tells acpid to log information about all events
and actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --lockfile filename <br>
This option changes the lock file used to stop event
processing. Default is /var/lock/acpid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --socketgroup groupname <br>
This option changes the group ownership of the UNIX domain
socket to which acpid publishes events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --socketmode mode <br>
This option changes the permissions of the UNIX domain
socket to which acpid publishes events. Default is 0666.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --socketfile filename <br>
This option changes the name of the UNIX domain socket which
acpid opens. Default is /var/run/acpid.socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --nosocket filename <br>
This option tells acpid not to open a UNIX domain socket.
This overrides the -s option, and negates all other socket
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pidfile filename <br>
This option tells acpid to use the specified file as its
pidfile. If the file exists, it will be removed and
over-written. Default is /var/run/acpid.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help Show help and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
This example will shut down your system if you press the
power button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a file named
/etc/acpi/events/power that contains the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">event=button/power <br>
action=/etc/acpi/power.sh &quot;%e&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then create a file named
/etc/acpi/power.sh that contains the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/sbin/shutdown -h now
&quot;Power button pressed&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, when acpid is running, a
press of the power button will cause the rule in
/etc/acpi/events/power to trigger the script in
/etc/acpi/power.sh. The script will then shut down <br>
the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPENDENCIES <br>
acpid should work on any linux kernel released since
2003.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc/acpi/event <br>
/dev/input/event* <br>
/etc/acpi/ <br>
/var/run/acpid.socket <br>
/var/run/acpid.pid <br>
/var/lock/acpid</p>
