<p>DEBFOSTER(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
DEBFOSTER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debfoster &acirc; weed unnecessary Debian packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debfoster [-acdefhiknopqrstvV] [--verbose] [--version]
[--help] [--quiet] [--force] [--mark-only] [--upgrade]
[--config file] [--keeperfile file] [--no-keeperfile] <br>
[--ignore-default-rules] [--show-keepers] [--show-orphans]
[--show-depends package] [--show-dependents package]
[--show-providers package] [--show-related package] <br>
[--use-tasks] [--option opt=val] [package1 ...] [package2-
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debfoster maintains a list of installed packages that were
explicitly requested rather than installed as a dependency.
Arguments are entirely optional, debfoster can be invoked
<br>
per se after each run of dpkg and/or apt-get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you can use
debfoster to install and remove packages by specifying the
packages on the command line. Packages suffixed with a - are
removed while packages without a <br>
suffix are installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a new package is encountered
or if debfoster notices that a package that used to be a
dependency is now an orphan, it will ask you what to do with
it. If you decide to keep it, <br>
debfoster will just take note and continue. If you decide
that this package is not interesting enough it will be
removed as soon as debfoster is done asking questions. If
your <br>
choices cause other packages to become orphaned more
questions will ensue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever debfoster asks you
about a package, any of the following responses can be
given:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;y&acirc; Yes, keep the
package. This is the default response. <br>
&acirc;n&acirc; No, delete the package. <br>
&acirc;p&acirc; Prune the package. This tells debfoster to
also delete all packages that are only installed because
this package depends on them. A list of such packages, if
any, is <br>
shown above the prompt. <br>
&acirc;s&acirc; Skip this question. The next time you run
debfoster it will ask you again about this package. <br>
&acirc;h&acirc; Print a help message. <br>
&acirc;i&acirc; or &acirc;?&acirc; Show information about
the package. <br>
&acirc;u&acirc; Undo last response. <br>
&acirc;q&acirc; Exit without removing packages. All changes
will be lost. <br>
&acirc;x&acirc; Save changes to debfoster database, remove
unwanted packages, and exit without asking further
questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options <br>
-v, --verbose <br>
debfoster will show which packages have disappeared, have
become dependencies or (if Quiet is enabled) have become
orphans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display version and copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a concise summary of the available options and
argument syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Don&rsquo;t ask anything and assume &acirc;no&acirc; as the
answer to all questions. It also installs any packages that
seem to be missing, thus forcing your system to comply with
the <br>
debfoster database. Can have &acirc;interesting&acirc;
results if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Don&rsquo;t ask anything and assume &acirc;yes&acirc; as the
answer to all questions. Useful to create an initial
/var/lib/debfoster/keepers file or to recreate it after
changing the con&acirc; <br>
figuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mark-only <br>
Instructs debfoster to make changes to the keeper file but
not to actually install or delete any packages. This can be
used to &acirc;edit&acirc; a keeper file by invoking
debfoster <br>
one or more times in a row. The changes can then be
committed by invoking debfoster with the --force option,
which will delete/install any necessary packages. This is
<br>
mainly useful for scripts and frontends, but may be useful
from the command line as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --upgrade <br>
If used as &acirc;debfoster -u package&acirc; it will
install or upgrade the packages specified on the command
line and try to upgrade all packages that it relies on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config file <br>
Specify a different configuration file to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keeperfile file <br>
Specify a different debfoster database to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-keeperfile <br>
Don&rsquo;t read the debfoster database and start with an
empty list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-default-rules <br>
This will instruct debfoster to ignore the UseHold,
UseEssential, MaxPriority, KeepSections, and NokeepSections
settings in the config file (i.e., assume that any package
<br>
can be an orphan). This is a good option for those who
really want to make sure their system is squeaky clean.
It&rsquo;s also useful when sharing or transferring a keeper
file <br>
between multiple machines where different config files can
cause some confusion. Properly used, -i eliminates that
uncertainty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --show-keepers <br>
Lists the contents of the debfoster database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --show-orphans <br>
List all orphaned packages that are not mentioned in the
debfoster database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --show-depends package <br>
List all packages that this package depends on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --show-dependents package
<br>
List all packages in the debfoster database that depend on
this package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --show-providers package
<br>
List all packages that provide the dependency target
specified by package (e.g. &quot;debfoster -p
x-terminal-emulator&quot; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --show-related package <br>
List all packages that are only installed because this
package depends on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --use-tasks <br>
Make tasks visible as packages. This will make tasks that
are selectable using tasksel(1) appear as packages named
task-&lt;label&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --option opt=val <br>
Override any configuration option specified in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Some aspects of the behaviour of debfoster can be configured
in the configuration file, /etc/debfoster.conf. Options are
specified as <br>
Option = Value <br>
Option names are case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InstallCmd <br>
Default: apt-get install <br>
Command invoked with a number of packages on the command
line. The command is not passed to /bin/sh but invoked like
xargs(1) with a number of packages as extra options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RemoveCmd <br>
Default: apt-get --purge remove <br>
Like InstallCmd but for removing packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InfoCmd <br>
Default: dpkg -s <br>
Like InstallCmd but called with a single package as an
argument to display information on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeeperFile <br>
Default: /var/lib/debfoster/keepers <br>
The file where the list of orphans is stored. You can use
this file for reference when installing a machine or even to
make identical Debian installs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DpkgStatus <br>
Default: /var/lib/dpkg/status <br>
The file where dpkg(8) stores its information about which
packages are more or less installed. This value can usually
be left untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DpkgAvailable <br>
Default: /var/lib/dpkg/available <br>
The file where dpkg(8) stores its information about which
packages are available. This value can usually be left
untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxPriority <br>
Default: standard <br>
Any packages with a priority greater than this value will be
considered too basic to ask questions about. The default
value means that questions will be asked about pack&acirc;
<br>
ages with priority &quot;standard&quot;,
&quot;optional&quot; and &quot;extra&quot;. With the special
value &acirc;ANY&acirc; you can indicate that all known
priorities should be considered too important to ask <br>
questions about. These priority values are known to
debfoster (taken from the debian-policy package): <br>
required <br>
important <br>
standard <br>
optional <br>
extra</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseHold <br>
Default: yes <br>
Use the hold attribute from the Status: line. Packages with
this attribute won&rsquo;t ever be upgraded by apt, so
it&rsquo;s safe to assume that you want to keep it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseEssential <br>
Default: yes <br>
Use the Essential: line from dpkg(8) &rsquo;s status file.
Most packages which are marked essential shouldn&rsquo;t be
removed anyway, so if you don&rsquo;t want to be bothered
with it, <br>
enable this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UsePreDepends <br>
Default: yes <br>
A package that pre-depends on another package requires the
latter during installation. This option will make debfoster
count these pre-dependencies as ordinary dependen&acirc;
<br>
cies. If you frequently update your packages you may want to
keep an eye out for pre-depended packages that have become
obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseRecommends <br>
Default: yes <br>
Recommended packages would be installed together with the
package that recommends them in all usual setups. This
option will make debfoster count these recommendations as
<br>
real dependencies. Enabling this option will enable you to
better manage packages which were installed because another
package recommended them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseSuggests <br>
Default: no <br>
Packages suggested by another package usually enhance the
function of the latter or have a related function which may
be useful in combination with the package that sug&acirc;
<br>
gested them. This option will make debfoster count these
suggestions as real dependencies. Using this option will
result in even fewer questions being asked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseTasks <br>
Default: no <br>
Make tasks visible as packages. This will make tasks that
are selectable using tasksel(1) appear as packages named
task-&lt;label&gt;. debfoster will treat them as if they
were <br>
normal packages. Tasks cannot be removed but marking a task
for removal will stop debfoster asking questions about
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeepSections <br>
Default: <br>
You may find that you are always interested in keeping (for
example) documentation. With this option you can indicate
that packages from a certain section should always be <br>
kept. You can specify a comma separated lists of
&acirc;precious&acirc; sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NokeepSections <br>
Default: <br>
List the sections you are never interested in. For example,
&acirc;libs&acirc; is a good candidate, as most libraries
debfoster asks about are leftovers from old packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GuessDepends <br>
Default: <br>
List name extensions for packages that you want to group
with their base packages. Applications are often separated
into multiple packages with names like &quot;app&quot;,
&quot;app-doc&quot;, <br>
&quot;app-dev&quot;. If you don&rsquo;t want to answer
questions about &quot;app-doc&quot;, you can add the
&quot;doc&quot; extension to the GuessDepends list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NegativeKeepers <br>
Default: yes <br>
Remember explicit removals of packages. If a package is
installed that has been explicitly removed before, remove it
again without asking. Set this to no if you want to <br>
be asked anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose <br>
Default: no <br>
Using this option has the same result as having -v on the
command line. It will make debfoster show which packages
have disappeared or have become a dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Force Default: no <br>
This option has the same meaning as the -f command line
option. All orphaned packages are scheduled for removal
without asking any question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quiet Default: no <br>
Having this option (which has the same meaning as the -q
command line argument) in your configuration file more or
less defeats the purpose of debfoster although the <br>
KeeperFile is still kept up-to-date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Send reports to the Debian bug tracking system: <br>
http://bugs.debian.org/debfoster <br>
with as much information as you can gather (error messages,
configuration files, versions of dpkg/apt, whatever might be
relevant). A tool such as reportbug might come in handy.</p>
