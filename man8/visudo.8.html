<p>VISUDO(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
VISUDO(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
visudo &acirc; edit the sudoers file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
visudo [-chqsV] [-f sudoers]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous
to vipw(8). visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple
simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks
<br>
for parse errors. If the sudoers file is currently being
edited you will receive a message to try again later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a hard-coded list of
one or more editors that visudo will use set at compile-time
that may be overridden via the editor sudoers Default
variable. This list defaults to <br>
/usr/local/bin/vi. Normally, visudo does not honor the
VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables unless they contain
an editor in the aforementioned editors list. However, if
visudo <br>
is configured with the --with-env-editor option or the
env_editor Default variable is set in sudoers, visudo will
use any the editor defines by VISUAL or EDITOR. Note that
this <br>
can be a security hole since it allows the user to execute
any program they wish simply by setting VISUAL or
EDITOR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visudo parses the sudoers file
after the edit and will not save the changes if there is a
syntax error. Upon finding an error, visudo will print a
message stating the line num&acirc; <br>
ber(s) where the error occurred and the user will receive
the &acirc;What now?&acirc; prompt. At this point the user
may enter &acirc;e&acirc; to re-edit the sudoers file,
&acirc;x&acirc; to exit without saving the <br>
changes, or &acirc;Q&acirc; to quit and save changes. The
&acirc;Q&acirc; option should be used with extreme care
because if visudo believes there to be a parse error, so
will sudo and no one will be <br>
able to sudo again until the error is fixed. If
&acirc;e&acirc; is typed to edit the sudoers file after a
parse error has been detected, the cursor will be placed on
the line where the error <br>
occurred (if the editor supports this feature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Enable check-only mode. The
existing sudoers file will be checked for syntax errors,
owner and mode. A message will be printed to the standard
output describing the <br>
status of sudoers unless the -q option was specified. If the
check completes successfully, visudo will exit with a value
of 0. If an error is encountered, visudo will <br>
exit with a value of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f sudoers Specify and alternate
sudoers file location. With this option visudo will edit (or
check) the sudoers file of your choice, instead of the
default, /etc/sudoers. The <br>
lock file used is the specified sudoers file with
&acirc;.tmp&acirc; appended to it. In check-only mode only,
the argument to -f may be &acirc;-&acirc;, indicating that
sudoers will be read <br>
from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h The -h (help) option causes
visudo to print a short help message to the standard output
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Enable quiet mode. In this
mode details about syntax errors are not printed. This
option is only useful when combined with the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Enable strict checking of the
sudoers file. If an alias is used before it is defined,
visudo will consider this a parse error. Note that it is not
possible to differ&acirc; <br>
entiate between an alias and a host name or user name that
consists solely of uppercase letters, digits, and the
underscore (&acirc;_&acirc;) character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V The -V (version) option
causes visudo to print its version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables may be consulted
depending on the value of the editor and env_editor sudoers
settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VISUAL Invoked by visudo as the
editor to use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR Used by visudo if VISUAL
is not set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/sudoers List of who can run what</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/sudoers.tmp Lock file for
visudo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
sudoers file busy, try again later. <br>
Someone else is currently editing the sudoers file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/sudoers.tmp: Permission
denied <br>
You didn&rsquo;t run visudo as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find you in the
passwd database <br>
Your user ID does not appear in the system passwd file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning:
{User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias referenced but not defined <br>
Either you are trying to use an undeclared
{User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias or you have a user or host name
listed that consists solely of uppercase letters, digits,
and the <br>
underscore (&acirc;_&acirc;) character. In the latter case,
you can ignore the warnings (sudo will not complain). In -s
(strict) mode these are errors, not warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: unused
{User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias <br>
The specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias was defined but
never used. You may wish to comment out or remove the unused
alias. In -s (strict) mode this is an error, not a <br>
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: cycle in
{User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias <br>
The specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias includes a
reference to itself, either directly or through an alias it
includes. This is only a warning by default as sudo will
<br>
ignore cycles when parsing the sudoers file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>

shell if the editor used by visudo allows shell escapes.</p>
