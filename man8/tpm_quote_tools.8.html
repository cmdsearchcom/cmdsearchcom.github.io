TPM Quote Tools is a collection of programs that provide support for TPM based
  attestation using the TPM quote operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A TPM contains a set of Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). In a well
  configured machine, some of these registers are set to known values during the
  boot up process or at other times. For example, a PCR might contain the hash
  of a boot loader in memory before it is run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The TPM quote operation is used to authoritatively verify the contents of a
  TPM's Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). During provisioning, a
  composite hash of a selected set of PCRs is computed. The TPM quote operation
  produces a composite hash that can be compared with the one computed while
  provisioning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use the TPM quote operation, keys must be generated. During provisioning, an
  Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is generated for each TPM, and the public part
  of the key is made available to entities that validate quotes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The TPM quote operation returns signed data and a signature. The data that is
  signed contains the PCRs selected for the operation, the composite hash for
  the selected PCRs, and a nonce provided as input, and used to prevent replay
  attacks. At provisioning time, the data that is signed is stored, not just the
  composite hash. The signature is discarded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An entity that wishes to evaluate a machine generates a nonce, and sends it
  along with the set of PCR used to generate the composite PCR hash at
  provisioning time. For this use of the TPM quote operation, the signed data is
  ignored, and the signature returned is used to validate the state of the TPM's
  PCRs. Given the signature, the evaluating entity replaces the nonce in the
  signed data generated at provisioning time, and checks to see if the signature
  is valid for the data. If so, this check ensures the selected PCRs contain
  values that match the ones measured during provisioning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A typical scenario for an enterprise using these tools follows. The tools expect
  AIKs to be referenced via one enterprise-wide Universally Unique Identifier
  (UUID). The program <b>tpm_mkuuid</b> creates one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each machine being checked, an AIK is created using <b>tpm_mkaik.</b> The
  key blob produced is bound to the UUID on its machine using
  <b>tpm_loadkey.</b> The public key associated with the AIK is sent to the
  entities that verify quotes. Finally, the expected PCR composite hash is
  obtained using <b>tpm_getpcrhash.</b> When the expected PCR values change, a
  new hash can be generated with <b>tpm_updatepcrhash.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program to obtain a quote, and thus measure the current state of the PCRs is
  <b>tpm_getquote.</b> The program that verifies the quote describes the same
  PCR composite hash as was measured initially is <b>tpm_verifyquote.</b>
