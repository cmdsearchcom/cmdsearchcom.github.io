<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
TPM Quote Tools is a collection of programs that provide
support for TPM based attestation using the TPM quote
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A TPM contains a set of Platform
Configuration Registers (PCRs). In a well configured
machine, some of these registers are set to known values
during the boot up process or at <br>
other times. For example, a PCR might contain the hash of a
boot loader in memory before it is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TPM quote operation is used
to authoritatively verify the contents of a TPM&rsquo;s
Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). During
provisioning, a composite hash of a selected <br>
set of PCRs is computed. The TPM quote operation produces a
composite hash that can be compared with the one computed
while provisioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the TPM quote operation,
keys must be generated. During provisioning, an Attestation
Identity Key (AIK) is generated for each TPM, and the public
part of the key is made <br>
available to entities that validate quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TPM quote operation returns
signed data and a signature. The data that is signed
contains the PCRs selected for the operation, the composite
hash for the selected PCRs, and <br>
a nonce provided as input, and used to prevent replay
attacks. At provisioning time, the data that is signed is
stored, not just the composite hash. The signature is
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An entity that wishes to
evaluate a machine generates a nonce, and sends it along
with the set of PCR used to generate the composite PCR hash
at provisioning time. For this use <br>
of the TPM quote operation, the signed data is ignored, and
the signature returned is used to validate the state of the
TPM&rsquo;s PCRs. Given the signature, the evaluating entity
<br>
replaces the nonce in the signed data generated at
provisioning time, and checks to see if the signature is
valid for the data. If so, this check ensures the selected
PCRs con&acirc; <br>
tain values that match the ones measured during
provisioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical scenario for an
enterprise using these tools follows. The tools expect AIKs
to be referenced via one enterprise-wide Universally Unique
Identifier (UUID). The program <br>
tpm_mkuuid creates one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each machine being checked,
an AIK is created using tpm_mkaik. The key blob produced is
bound to the UUID on its machine using tpm_loadkey. The
public key associated with <br>
the AIK is sent to the entities that verify quotes. Finally,
the expected PCR composite hash is obtained using
tpm_getpcrhash. When the expected PCR values change, a new
hash <br>
can be generated with tpm_updatepcrhash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program to obtain a quote,
and thus measure the current state of the PCRs is
tpm_getquote. The program that verifies the quote describes
the same PCR composite hash as was <br>
measured initially is tpm_verifyquote.</p>
