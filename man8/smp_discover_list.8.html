<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smp_discover_list - invoke DISCOVER LIST SMP function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
smp_discover_list [--adn] [--brief] [--cap]
[--descriptor=TY] [--filter=FI] [--help] [--hex] [--ignore]
[--interface=PARAMS] [--num=NUM] [--one] [--phy=ID] [--raw]
<br>
[--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--summary] [--verbose] [--version]
[--zpi=FN] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sends one or more SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP)
DISCOVER LIST function requests to an SMP target and decodes
or outputs the responses. The SMP target is identified by
the <br>
SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the
SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt
interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP
initiator) <br>
and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between HBAs if
there are multiple present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --phy=ID option is not
given then --summary is assumed. When --summary is given or
assumed, this utility shows the disposition of each active
expander phy in table form. <br>
One row is shown for each phy and is described in the SINGLE
LINE PER PHY FORMAT section below. For this purpose disabled
expander phys and those with errors are considered <br>
&quot;active&quot; and can be suppressed from the output by
adding the --brief option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DISCOVER LIST response may
contain up to 8 descriptors when the &quot;descriptor
type&quot; field in the request is set to 0 (e.g.
--descriptor=0). The DISCOVER LIST response may con&acirc;
<br>
tain up to 40 descriptors when the &quot;descriptor
type&quot; field in the request is set to 1 (e.g.
--descriptor=1). Multiple DISCOVER LIST requests will be
made if more descriptors are <br>
requested (e.g. --summary requests 254) and the previous
response indicates that more descriptors may be
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
options as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --adn <br>
causes the &quot;attached device name&quot; field to be
output when the --one or --summary option is also given. See
the section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT. Note the
<br>
&quot;attached device name&quot; field is not available in
the short format (e.g. --descriptor=1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --brief <br>
reduce the decoded response output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cap <br>
decode and print phy capabilities bits fields (see SNW-3 in
draft). Each expander phy has three of these fields:
programmed, current and attached. By default these fields
<br>
are only printed out in hex, or not at all if the --brief
option is given or implied. Of the three the attached phy
capability field is probably the most interesting. If <br>
the --verbose option is given, then the various
&quot;G&quot; identifiers are expanded (e.g. instead of
&quot;G4:&quot; it prints &quot;G4 (12 Gbps):&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --descriptor=TY <br>
set the &quot;descriptor type&quot; field in the request.
When TY is 0 then the 120 byte response defined by the
DISCOVER function response (less its CRC field) is placed in
the <br>
descriptors of this function&rsquo;s response. When TY is 1
the short format (i.e. 24 byte per descriptor) information
is placed in the descriptors of this function&rsquo;s
response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --filter=FI <br>
set the filter field in the request. When FI is 0 (default)
fetch descriptors for all phys. When FI is 1 only fetch
descriptors for phys attached to (other) expanders. <br>
When FI is 2 only fetch descriptors for phys attached to
expanders, SAS or SATA devices. When FI is 1 or 2, expander
phys that would yield &quot;phy vacant&quot; (indicating
they <br>
are hidden by zoning) are filtered out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore <br>
sets the Ignore Zone Group bit in the SMP Discover list
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --interface=PARAMS <br>
interface specific parameters. In this case
&quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through the
operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man
page for more informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --num=NUM <br>
maximum number of descriptors fetch. If any descriptors are
in the response the first phy id will be greater than or
equal to the argument of --phy=ID. Note that maximum <br>
SMP frame size is 1032 bytes (including a trailing 4 byte
CRC) which may limit the number of descriptors that can be
fetched by a single DISCOVER LIST function (especially <br>
when &rsquo;--descriptor=0&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --one <br>
use one line (summarized) format for each descriptor in the
response. The default action when this option is not given
is to output multiple indented lines for each <br>
descriptor in the response. See the section below on SINGLE
LINE PER PHY FORMAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --phy=ID <br>
phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and 254. This is the
starting (lowest numbered) phy id to fetch in the response.
Note that due to the filter field setting, the <br>
first phy id in the response may be greater than the
argument to this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary.
All error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR <br>
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device.
Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed
if the SMP_DEVICE has the target&rsquo;s SAS address within
it. <br>
The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are shown
in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either
prefix it with &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or put a trailing
&rsquo;h&rsquo; on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --summary <br>
output a multi line summary, with one line per active phy.
Checks up to 254 phys starting at phy identifier ID (which
defaults to 0). Equivalent to &rsquo;-o -d 1 -n 254
-b&rsquo; <br>
unless the --adn option was also given, in which case it is
equivalent to &rsquo;-o -d 0 -n 254 -b&rsquo; . See the
section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --zpi=FN <br>
FN is a file that will be created or truncated then have
zone phy information written to it in a format suitable for
input to the smp_conf_zone_phy_info utility&rsquo;s <br>
--pconf=FN option. If --num=NUM is not given it is set to
254. The output will start from phy_id 0 unless --phy=ID is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT <br>
The --summary (or --one) option causes SMP DISCOVER LIST
descriptors to be compressed to one line per phy. To save
space SAS addresses are shown in hex without a
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; prefix or <br>
&rsquo;h&rsquo; suffix. The header section outputs
information found in the DISCOVER LIST response&rsquo;s
header section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each descriptor in the
DISCOVER LIST response, one line is output starting with
&quot; phy &lt;n&gt;:&quot; where &lt;n&gt; is the phy
identifier (and they are origin zero). That is followed by
<br>
the routing attribute represented by a single letter which
is either &quot;D&quot; for direct routing, &quot;S&quot;
for subtractive routing, &quot;T&quot; or &quot;U&quot;.
Both &quot;T&quot; and &quot;U&quot; imply table routing,
the <br>
difference is that if REPORT GENERAL indicates &quot;table
to table supported&quot; then &quot;U&quot; is output to
indicate that phy can be part of an enclosure universal
port; otherwise &quot;T&quot; is <br>
used. Next comes the negotiated physical link rate which is
either &quot;disabled&quot;, &quot;reset problem&quot; or
&quot;spinup hold&quot;. Other states are mapped to
&quot;attached&quot;. This includes enabled phys <br>
with nothing connected which appear as
&quot;attached:[0000000000000000:00]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information shown between the
brackets is for the attached device. Phys that are connected
display something like: &quot;attached:[5000c50000520a2a:01
&quot; where the first number is the <br>
attached SAS address (in hex) and the second number is the
attached device&rsquo;s phy identifier. If the attached
device type is other than an SAS or SATA device then one of
these <br>
abbreviations is output: &quot;exp&quot; (for expander),
&quot;fex&quot; (for fanout expander) or &quot;res&quot;
(for unknown attached device type). If a phy is flagged as
&quot;virtual&quot; then the letter &quot;V&quot; <br>
appears next. Next are the protocols supported by the
attached device which are shown as
&quot;i(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for initiator protocols and/or
&quot;t(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for target protocols. The
&lt;list&gt; <br>
is made up of &quot;PORT_SEL&quot;, &quot;SSP&quot;,
&quot;STP&quot;, &quot;SMP&quot; and &quot;SATA&quot; with
&quot;+&quot; used as a separator. For example a SAS host
adapter will most likely appear as:
&quot;i(SSP+STP+SMP)&quot;. This com&acirc; <br>
pletes the information about the attached phy, hence the
closing right bracket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If appropriate, the negotiated
physical link rate is shown in gigabits per second. Here is
an example of a line for expander phy identifier 11
connected to a SATA target (or SATA <br>
&quot;device&quot; to use the t13.org term):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phy
11:T:attached:[500605b000000afb:00 t(SATA)] 1.5 Gbps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the expander has zoning
enabled (i.e. REPORT GENERAL response bit for &rsquo;zoning
enabled&rsquo; is set) and a phy&rsquo;s zone group is other
than zg 1 then the phy&rsquo;s zone group is shown <br>
(e.g. &quot;ZG:2&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --adn option is given
then after the attached SAS address and the attached
device&rsquo;s phy identifier are output an extra field is
inserted containing the &quot;attached device <br>
name&quot; field. For a SAS disk this should be its target
device name (in NAA-5 format) and for a SATA disk its WWN
(if provided, also in NAA-5 format). Also when the --adn
option is <br>
given the phy speed and zone group are not output in order
to keep the line length reasonable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
In SAS-2 and later both the DISCOVER and DISCOVER LIST
functions are available. The DISCOVER LIST function should
be favoured for several reasons: its response can hold up to
40 <br>
descriptors each describing the state of one expander phy.
The vast majority of expander chips on the market support 36
phys or less so one DISCOVER LIST response will summarize
<br>
the states of all its phys. With the DISCOVER function only
one expander phy&rsquo;s state is returned in its response.
Other advantages of the DISCOVER LIST function are its
&quot;phy fil&acirc; <br>
ter&quot; and &quot;descriptor type&quot; function request
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFORMING TO <br>
