<p>SUBMIT(8) Double Precision, Inc. SUBMIT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
submit - Submit a new message to the Courier mail server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/bin/submit [-expn=address] [-vrfy=address]
[-vhost=address] [-bcc] [-delay=n] {module} {&quot;type;
hostid&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The submit program submits messages to the Courier mail
server for processing. The submit program is not intended to
be invoked by the end user. It is used by the Courier mail
<br>
server input modules only. The submit program&rsquo;s global
read and execute permissions are turned off, so that it can
only be executed by a process that&rsquo;s a member of the
courier <br>
group. submit is installed in the /usr/lib/courier/courier
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submit always takes two command
line arguments after any options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">module <br>
This argument identifies the module that&rsquo;s running the
submit command. It must be one of the module names that the
Courier mail server knows about, such as local, or esmtp.
<br>
This argument determines address rewriting rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;type; hostid&quot; <br>
This single argument identifies the source of the message,
and must be suitable for the Remote-MTA: header in delivery
status notifications, as specified by RFC 1894. For <br>
messages that are received via ESMTP, this argument is
typically &quot;dns; helohost (hostname
[ip.address])&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The submit program takes the
following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-expn=address <br>
Do not accept a message, instead &quot;expand&quot; the
given address. If the specified address matches a
locally-defined alias, submit prints the addresses this
address expands to. If <br>
the specified address does not match a locally-defined
alias, the address is displayed by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vrfy=address <br>
Do not accept a message, instead verify the given address.
submit prints a suitable message and sets the exit code to
indicate whether the specified address is valid, or <br>
not. If the address matches a local alias, submit will
indicate a valid address, and exit. If the address does not
match a local alias, submit checks if this address is <br>
deliverable by any output protocol module. If so, submit
will indicate a valid address, and exit. Otherwise, submit
prints a &quot;User unknown&quot; error message, and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bcc <br>
If no recipients are given, obtain the list of recipients
from Bcc: headers only. Normally, if no recipients are
specified, submit reads the list of recipients from the To:,
<br>
Cc: and Bcc: headers (Bcc: headers are always removed). The
-bcc option ignores To: and Cc: headers for this purpose.
This option is ignored if an explicit recipient list is <br>
specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delay=n <br>
Wait n seconds before delivering the message. If not
specified, delivery begins after waiting the amount of time
specified by the /etc/courier/submitdelay configuration time
<br>
(default: 0 seconds -- immediate delivery).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vhost=address <br>
Append &acirc;.address&acirc; to names of all configuration
files Courier reads while processing this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESPONSES FROM SUBMIT <br>
All replies from submit follow the format of SMTP responses,
as defined in RFC822.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To summarize: the responses are
one or more lines long. Every line in the response instead
of the last one consists of a three-digit numerical code, a
dash, then arbitrary text. <br>
The last line (or the only line of the response) starts with
a three-digit numerical code, a single space, and arbitrary
text. The first digit of the numerical code indicates <br>
whether the response indicates success, or failure. If the
first digit is 5, the response indicates a permanent
failure. If the first digit is 4, the response indicates a
<br>
temporary failure (the message or the address should be
resubmitted later). If the first digit is not 4 or 5, the
response indicates success, or acceptance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MESSAGE SUBMISSION <br>
Unless either -expn or -vrfy option is specified, submit
reads the message envelope and contents from standard input,
as follows. All input and output to submit consists of <br>
newline-terminated (NOT carriage return/newline terminated)
lines of text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submit reads the first line of
text, which specifies the envelope sender address. The line
is formatted as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">address&lt;tab&gt;format&lt;tab&gt;envid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;tab&gt; is the ASCII tab
character. The address may be an empty string, optionally
followed by tab, then &quot;format&quot;, another tab, then
&quot;envid&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format is one or more chatacters
that specify delivery status notification processing, and
other message options. The &rsquo;F&rsquo; character
specifies that delivery status notifications <br>
should include the entire message, &rsquo;H&rsquo; specifies
just the headers of the message should be included. Absence
of either &rsquo;F&rsquo; or &rsquo;H&rsquo; specifies no
preference. &quot;S{keyword}&quot; specifies <br>
the optional SECURITY extension keyword for this message.
The &rsquo;V&rsquo; character in format sets the VERP
extension flag for this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">envid is the original message
envelope ID, that will be shown on any delivery status
notifications. NOTE: envid must be specified using xtext
encoding (see the relevant RFCs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After reading the first line of
text, submit prints a response (see &quot;RESPONSES FROM
SUBMIT&quot;, above). If the response is a failure, submit
terminates immediately. Otherwise, <br>
submit then reads one or more envelope recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each envelope recipient is read
as a single non-empty line of text, formatted as
follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">address&lt;tab&gt;dsn&lt;tab&gt;orecipient</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address is a non-empty recipient
E-mail address, optionally followed by the tab character,
then zero or more characters specifying dsn, then a tab
character, then the orecipient <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsn is zero or more of the
following characters: S - send a delivery status
notification upon a successful delivery to this address, F -
send a DSN upon a failed delivery, D - <br>
send a DSN upon a mail delay, N - never send a DSN.
orecipient is the &quot;Original Recipient&quot;, as
specified in RFC1894, using xtext encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submit will print a response to
each recipient (see &quot;RESPONSES FROM SUBMIT&quot;,
above). If at least one recipient address has been
succesfully specified, a blank line is read to <br>
specify end of recipient list, which is followed by the
entire message, headers and body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single blank line terminates
the list of recipients. That is followed by the message
itself, until end of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The blank line can be present
before even a the first recipient is specified. If so,
submit obtains the list of recipient from the
message&rsquo;s headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submit reads the message headers
and body until end-of-file. Then, submit prints a response
(see above), indicating whether or not the message was
accepted for delivery, and <br>
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDRESS REWRITING <br>
Each recipient address (whether specified explicitly, or
obtained from the message headers), will be rewritten
according to the rewriting rules specified by the input
module. <br>
Each address in the headers of the message will also be
rewritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After rewriting each recipient
address, submit will search the aliases.dat file for this
address, to see if it represents a locally defined alias.
Submit searches <br>
/usr/lib/courier/courier/modules/module/aliases.dat and
/etc/courier/aliases.dat (actual locations may be changed by
the system administrator). If the address is found, the <br>
recipient address will be replaced by the addresses defined
in the aliases.dat file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
submit also reads the following environment variables to
further specify how the message is to be processed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCK <br>
If this variable is set to a non-empty value, submit will
reject every recipient (in effect, rejecting the message).
The contents of the environment variable will be used as
<br>
the error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSNENVID <br>
If envid is not specified, or is blank, and this environment
variable is defined, the contents of this variable is used
as the original envelope id field for DSNs. Note that <br>
DSNENVID is copied verbatim into the Original-Envelope-Id
field (if the message is relayed to another MTA, the Courier
mail server automatically xtext-encodes it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSNNOTIFY <br>
If the dsn field for a recipient is empty, the contents of
this environment variable is used in its place. Also, if the
recipient list is read from the headers, the contents <br>
of this environment variable are used to set the dsn
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSNRET <br>
If the format field for this message is empty, the contents
of this environment variable is used in its place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOADDDATE <br>
Normally the Courier mail server adds a Date: header to the
message, if it does not have one. If this environment
variable is set, the Courier mail server will not add a <br>
Date: header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOADDMSGID <br>
Normally the Courier mail server adds a Message-Id: header
to the message, if it does not have it. If this environment
variable is set, the Courier mail server will not add a <br>
Message-Id: header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOADDRREWRITE <br>
Normally the Courier mail server rewrites addresses in the
From:, To:, and Cc: header fields. If this environment
variable is set to 1, the Courier mail server will not <br>
rewrite them. If it is set to a higher value, the Courier
mail server will only rewrite it if no DKIM-Signature:
header field was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME <br>
Normally the Courier mail server adds any missing RFC2045
headers to the message. The MIME environment variable can be
set to the following values: none - do not do any <br>
RFC2045 processing whatsoever; 7bit - if the message
contains any 8-bit text, convert it to quoted-printable
encoding; 8bit -if the message contains any quoted-printable
<br>
encoded text that can be representing as 8bit-encoded text,
then convert it to 8bit encoding.</p>
