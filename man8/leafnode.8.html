leafnode - NNTP server for small (dialup) sites
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>leafnode</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Leafnode</b> is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are
  few users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
  desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The design of <b>leafnode</b> is intended to self-repair after problems, and to
  require no manual maintenance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>leafnode</b> program itself is the NNTP server. It is run from
  <b>inetd</b>(8), <b>xinetd</b>(8) or <b>tcpserver</b> when someone wants to
  read news. The other parts of the package, <b>fetchnews</b> and
  <b>texpire,</b> are responsible for fetching new news from another server, and
  for deleting old news.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACCESS_CONTROL"><a class="selflink" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL">ACCESS
  CONTROL</a></h1>
No authentication or access control is supported. This is a deliberate omission:
  Implementing this is a job which should not be redone for each and every
  service.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>It is mandatory that you use external access control mechanisms like</b>
  <b>tcpd, inetd/xinetd compiled with libwrap support, tcpserver with -x</b>
  <b>option and the like and that these are in effect.</b> tcpd and libwrap are
  components of Wietse Venema's fine <b>tcp_wrappers</b> package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a very rough last line of defense against abuse, leafnode will drop
  connections from outside your LANs by default. You can configure leafnode to
  let go of this restriction (look for the allowstrangers option), but don't do
  that unless tight access control is in place. Someone will abuse your computer
  sooner or later. Promised.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I recommend that either firewalling or tcpd be used for access control.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
All these files and directories <i>must</i> be readable by the user
  &quot;news&quot;. It is recommended that, unless otherwise stated, that the
  user &quot;news&quot; be the only user in the group &quot;news&quot; and these
  files belong to &quot;root:news&quot; (user:group) so leafnode cannot modify
  your configuration or filter files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/etc/news/leafnode</i> should not be writable by the user &quot;news&quot;,
  but it must be executable for at least any of the group that the user
  &quot;news&quot; is in. <i>/etc/news/leafnode/config</i> contains the
  configuration parameters for <b>leafnode.</b> It <b>must not</b> be writable
  by the user &quot;news&quot;. Set this to owner root:news and mode 640. For
  details, see CONFIGURATION below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/var/spool/news</i> must also be readable and writable by the user
  &quot;news&quot;. It contains the news articles; e.g.
  <i>/var/spool/news/alt/fan/agulbra</i> contains the articles in the
  <i>alt.fan.agulbra</i> group. Each directory contains articles in numbered
  files (decimal numbers, monotonically increasing), and a special file called
  <i>.overview</i> which contains the &quot;Subject&quot;, &quot;From&quot;,
  &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Message-ID&quot;, &quot;References&quot;,
  &quot;Bytes&quot; and &quot;Lines&quot; headers for each article in the group.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several subdirectories are special:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/var/spool/news/leaf.node</i> contains the files that leafnode creates during
  operation, for example the <b>groupinfo</b> file which contains information
  about each USENET newsgroup. This file is built by <b>fetchnews</b> (8). You
  can force a complete rebuild of the groupinfo file by calling <b>fetchnews</b>
  with the parameter -f (see <b>fetchnews</b> (8)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/var/spool/news/out.going</i> contains local postings that
  <b>fetchnews</b>(8) is to pass to the upstream NNTP server. After a posting
  has been successfully written to disk, its u+r permission flag is set. This
  flag is interpreted by <b>fetchnews(8)</b> as &quot;you may post this
  article&quot;. This prevents fetchnews from posting articles that are still
  being received from newsreaders. (Note: versions 1.9.23 to 1.9.32 inclusively
  used u+x instead, which caused some &quot;stuck post&quot; problems with
  articles in the spool when a prior leafnode version was updated to one of
  these 10 versions. Updating to leafnode 1.9.33 or later fixes the problem.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/var/spool/news/failed.postings</i> contains local postings that the upstream
  server rejected. <b>fetchnews</b>(8) will create files in this directory, but
  none of the <b>leafnode</b> programs will delete anything in it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/var/spool/news/message.id</i> contains hard links to each message; this is
  used in place of the <b>dbz</b> database typically used by bigger servers. (A
  directory such as this is probably more efficient for the small servers
  <b>leafnode</b> is designed for but scales very badly.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/var/spool/news/interesting.groups</i> contains one file for each group an
  NNTP client has asked to read. <b>leafnode</b> will update the <b>ctime</b>
  (ls&#x00A0;-l usually shows the <b>mtime</b>, try ls&#x00A0;-lc) of the
  relevant file when a LISTGROUP, XOVER, XHDR, STAT, HEAD, BODY or ARTICLE
  command is issued, when a GROUP or LIST ACTIVE command (the latter only with a
  single group, not with patterns) is issued for an interesting group (to avoid
  unsubscribing low-traffic groups that are still read) and <b>fetchnews</b>(8)
  will retrieve all new articles in all groups whose files have been either
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">- touched during the past two days, or</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">- touched more than once, and at least once within the past
      week.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The timeout is configurable through the <i>config</i> file variables
  <b>timeout_short</b> and <b>timeout_long</b>. See also <b>fetchnews</b>(8) for
  the <b>-n</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/etc/inetd.conf</i> or <i>/etc/xinetd.conf</i> contains the configuration
  which starts <b>leafnode.</b> It is strongly recommended to start
  <b>leafnode</b> as user news.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>

  </dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
All configuration is done using the file <i>/etc/news/leafnode/config</i>, which
  may include a filter description file, filterfile for short, as described
  below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the purposes of this section, whitespace shall be defined as an arbitrary
  sequence consisting of one or more SPACE or HTAB characters, ASCII positions
  32 and 9, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration file is strictly line-oriented with LF or CRLF as line
  terminator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Empty lines and lines consisting of only whitespace, possibly followed by a
  comment (introduced by a hash mark (#) and extending through the end of the
  line), are skipped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All other lines have exactly three mandatory fields, a plain text parameter, an
  assignment character (=) optionally surrounded by whitespace and a value. The
  value is either plain text or - new since leafnode v1.11 - a string in double
  quotes with trivial backslash escape (see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Plain text starts at the first non-whitespace character and extends through the
  last non-whitespace character on the line that is not a comment. A trailing
  comment on a line is skipped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Quoted strings are enclosed in double quote characters (&quot;). The backslash
  character (\) is skipped, but it copies the immediately following character
  verbatim, so that you can specify the backslash itself by doubling it (\\) or
  a double quote character as part of the string by preceding it with a
  backslash (\&quot;); the hash mark has no special meaning as command
  introducer inside quoted strings. Text after the end of the string is silently
  ignored (this may change in future versions). Comments after quoted strings
  are ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>MANDATORY PARAMETERS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These parameters must be specified for leafnode to work.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">server = news02.example.com</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;server&quot; is used by <b>fetchnews</b> (8) to
      select what NNTP server(s) to retrieve news from and to post your articles
      to. You can specify more than one news server; in that case, the servers
      will be queried from the top down. If you want to post articles, at least
      one of your servers should allow you to post. In the example above,
      news02.example.com is the news server.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This parameter can be given more than once. Each <b>server</b> starts with a
      fresh set of default configuration options, no inheritance takes place
      from the previous server definition. Only options explicitly marked
      &quot;server-specific&quot; can be set on a per server basis,
      &quot;general&quot; options are set for all servers at the same time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">expire = 5</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;expire&quot; is the number of days an article should
      be kept around. In the example, five days after the article has last been
      read, it is deleted by <b>texpire</b> (8). This value MUST be at least 1.
      This parameter is global, see the introductory paragraph of the following
      <b>GENERAL OPTION PARAMETERS</b> section to find out what this means.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>GENERAL OPTIONAL PARAMETERS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These options can only be configured once in the configuration file, and take
  effect for leafnode as a whole. It does not matter where these are specified
  relative to server= options, but for clarity, you are encouraged to place
  these before the first server= line. Specifying each of the global options
  more than once lets the last copy take effect, but may cause errors in the
  future.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">hostname = host.domain.country</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, leafnode tries hard to figure the host name of
      your computer, skipping inadequate (non-unique) names if possible. It will
      look up your computer's host name with gethostname(3) and then try to
      qualify the name with gethostbyname(3) if necessary. Common sources for
      the full name therefore are /etc/hosts, NIS and DNS, but consult your
      system documentation for details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If leafnode fails to determine the host name, this is usually a hint that
      your system is not configured properly, or it has a hostname that is
      unsuitable for the domain part of a Message-ID, for example,
      &quot;localhost.localdomain&quot;, and you should fix the name service
      configuration. Adding a unique fully-qualified host name to /etc/hosts is
      usually sufficient. Please see <i>README-FQDN</i> for more details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can configure the unique fully-qualified host name here as well, but
      this is not recommended and discouraged.</dd>

Here are the NNTP commands supported by this server:
<div class="Pp"></div>
ARTICLE, BODY, DATE, GROUP, HDR, HEAD, HELP, LAST, LIST, LIST ACTIVE, LIST
  ACTIVE.TIMES, LIST EXTENSIONS, LIST NEWSGROUPS, LIST OVERVIEW.FMT, LISTGROUP,
  MODE, NEWGROUPS, NEXT, POST, OVER, SLAVE, STAT, XHDR, XOVER. These commands
  follow RFC-977 and RFC-2980, except HDR and OVER which are recognized in
  anticipation of current NNTP drafts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the syntax of HDR and OVER may change.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Leafnode is totally unaware of UTF-8 and will reject a client that posts UTF-8
  characters in the header. Current Usefor drafts claim all article headers
  UTF-8 encoded Unicode. Leafnode still expects RFC-2047 instead which may
  eventually be phased out in favour of UTF-8.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Leafnode stops reading a line at the first NUL character.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Leafnode may not cope well with crosspostings that cross hierarchies if you have
  multiple upstream feeds and use the only_groups_pcre configuration option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Leafnode will only bother to determine the time zone offset for generated Date:
  headers for posts that lack them on systems that offer the tm_gmtoff member in
  struct tm (commonly BSD and GNU systems).
