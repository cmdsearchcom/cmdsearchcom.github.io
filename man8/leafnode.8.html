<p>leafnode(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
leafnode(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
leafnode - NNTP server for small (dialup) sites</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
leafnode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Leafnode is a USENET package intended for small sites, where
there are few users and little disk space, but where a large
number of groups is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The design of leafnode is
intended to self-repair after problems, and to require no
manual maintenance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The leafnode program itself is
the NNTP server. It is run from inetd(8), xinetd(8) or
tcpserver when someone wants to read news. The other parts
of the package, fetchnews and <br>
texpire, are responsible for fetching new news from another
server, and for deleting old news.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL <br>
No authentication or access control is supported. This is a
deliberate omission: Implementing this is a job which should
not be redone for each and every service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is mandatory that you use
external access control mechanisms like tcpd, inetd/xinetd
compiled with libwrap support, tcpserver with -x option and
the like and that these are in <br>
effect. tcpd and libwrap are components of Wietse
Venema&rsquo;s fine tcp_wrappers package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a very rough last line of
defense against abuse, leafnode will drop connections from
outside your LANs by default. You can configure leafnode to
let go of this restriction <br>
(look for the allowstrangers option), but don&rsquo;t do
that unless tight access control is in place. Someone will
abuse your computer sooner or later. Promised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I recommend that either
firewalling or tcpd be used for access control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
All these files and directories must be readable by the user
&quot;news&quot;. It is recommended that, unless otherwise
stated, that the user &quot;news&quot; be the only user in
the group &quot;news&quot; <br>
and these files belong to &quot;root:news&quot; (user:group)
so leafnode cannot modify your configuration or filter
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/news/leafnode should not be
writable by the user &quot;news&quot;, but it must be
executable for at least any of the group that the user
&quot;news&quot; is in. /etc/news/leafnode/config con&acirc;
<br>
tains the configuration parameters for leafnode. It must not
be writable by the user &quot;news&quot;. Set this to owner
root:news and mode 640. For details, see CONFIGURATION
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/news must also be
readable and writable by the user &quot;news&quot;. It
contains the news articles; e.g.
/var/spool/news/alt/fan/agulbra contains the articles in the
<br>
alt.fan.agulbra group. Each directory contains articles in
numbered files (decimal numbers, monotonically increasing),
and a special file called .overview which contains the <br>
&quot;Subject&quot;, &quot;From&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;,
&quot;Message-ID&quot;, &quot;References&quot;,
&quot;Bytes&quot; and &quot;Lines&quot; headers for each
article in the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several subdirectories are
special:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/news/leaf.node
contains the files that leafnode creates during operation,
for example the groupinfo file which contains information
about each USENET newsgroup. This <br>
file is built by fetchnews (8). You can force a complete
rebuild of the groupinfo file by calling fetchnews with the
parameter -f (see fetchnews (8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/news/out.going
contains local postings that fetchnews(8) is to pass to the
upstream NNTP server. After a posting has been successfully
written to disk, its u+r permis&acirc; <br>
sion flag is set. This flag is interpreted by fetchnews(8)
as &quot;you may post this article&quot;. This prevents
fetchnews from posting articles that are still being
received from news&acirc; <br>
readers. (Note: versions 1.9.23 to 1.9.32 inclusively used
u+x instead, which caused some &quot;stuck post&quot;
problems with articles in the spool when a prior leafnode
version was <br>
updated to one of these 10 versions. Updating to leafnode
1.9.33 or later fixes the problem.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/news/failed.postings
contains local postings that the upstream server rejected.
fetchnews(8) will create files in this directory, but none
of the leafnode programs <br>
will delete anything in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/news/message.id
contains hard links to each message; this is used in place
of the dbz database typically used by bigger servers. (A
directory such as this is probably <br>
more efficient for the small servers leafnode is designed
for but scales very badly.)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/news/interesting.groups
contains one file for each group an NNTP client has asked to
read. leafnode will update the ctime (ls -l usually shows
the mtime, try ls -lc) <br>
of the relevant file when a LISTGROUP, XOVER, XHDR, STAT,
HEAD, BODY or ARTICLE command is issued, when a GROUP or
LIST ACTIVE command (the latter only with a single group,
not <br>
with patterns) is issued for an interesting group (to avoid
unsubscribing low-traffic groups that are still read) and
fetchnews(8) will retrieve all new articles in all groups
<br>
whose files have been either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- touched during the past two
days, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- touched more than once, and at
least once within the past week.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timeout is configurable
through the config file variables timeout_short and
timeout_long. See also fetchnews(8) for the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/inetd.conf or
/etc/xinetd.conf contains the configuration which starts
leafnode. It is strongly recommended to start leafnode as
user news.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LN_REJECT_POST_PRE <br>
If this variable exists, all POST commands are rejected with
a 400 code. Use only for debugging clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LN_REJECT_POST_POST <br>
If this variable exists, the POST command is rejected with a
400 code after the article and CRLF.CRLF has been received.
Use only for debugging clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
All configuration is done using the file
/etc/news/leafnode/config, which may include a filter
description file, filterfile for short, as described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the purposes of this
section, whitespace shall be defined as an arbitrary
sequence consisting of one or more SPACE or HTAB characters,
ASCII positions 32 and 9, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file is
strictly line-oriented with LF or CRLF as line
terminator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty lines and lines consisting
of only whitespace, possibly followed by a comment
(introduced by a hash mark (#) and extending through the end
of the line), are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other lines have exactly
three mandatory fields, a plain text parameter, an
assignment character (=) optionally surrounded by whitespace
and a value. The value is either <br>
plain text or - new since leafnode v1.11 - a string in
double quotes with trivial backslash escape (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plain text starts at the first
non-whitespace character and extends through the last
non-whitespace character on the line that is not a comment.
A trailing comment on a line is <br>
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoted strings are enclosed in
double quote characters (&quot;). The backslash character (
is skipped, but it copies the immediately following
character verbatim, so that you can <br>
specify the backslash itself by doubling it (\) or a double
quote character as part of the string by preceding it with a
backslash ( <br>
command introducer inside quoted strings. Text after the end
of the string is silently ignored (this may change in future
versions). Comments after quoted strings are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANDATORY PARAMETERS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These parameters must be
specified for leafnode to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server = news02.example.com <br>
&quot;server&quot; is used by fetchnews (8) to select what
NNTP server(s) to retrieve news from and to post your
articles to. You can specify more than one news server; in
that <br>
case, the servers will be queried from the top down. If you
want to post articles, at least one of your servers should
allow you to post. In the example above, <br>
news02.example.com is the news server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter can be given more
than once. Each server starts with a fresh set of default
configuration options, no inheritance takes place from the
previous server defi&acirc; <br>
nition. Only options explicitly marked
&quot;server-specific&quot; can be set on a per server
basis, &quot;general&quot; options are set for all servers
at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expire = 5 <br>
&quot;expire&quot; is the number of days an article should
be kept around. In the example, five days after the article
has last been read, it is deleted by texpire (8). This value
<br>
MUST be at least 1. This parameter is global, see the
introductory paragraph of the following GENERAL OPTION
PARAMETERS section to find out what this means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONAL PARAMETERS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options can only be
configured once in the configuration file, and take effect
for leafnode as a whole. It does not matter where these are
specified relative to server= <br>
options, but for clarity, you are encouraged to place these
before the first server= line. Specifying each of the global
options more than once lets the last copy take effect, <br>
but may cause errors in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname = host.domain.country
<br>
By default, leafnode tries hard to figure the host name of
your computer, skipping inadequate (non-unique) names if
possible. It will look up your computer&rsquo;s host name
<br>
with gethostname(3) and then try to qualify the name with
gethostbyname(3) if necessary. Common sources for the full
name therefore are /etc/hosts, NIS and DNS, but con&acirc;
<br>
sult your system documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If leafnode fails to determine
the host name, this is usually a hint that your system is
not configured properly, or it has a hostname that is
unsuitable for the domain <br>
part of a Message-ID, for example,
&quot;localhost.localdomain&quot;, and you should fix the
name service configuration. Adding a unique fully-qualified
host name to /etc/hosts is <br>
usually sufficient. Please see README-FQDN for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can configure the unique
fully-qualified host name here as well, but this is not
recommended and discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create_all_links = 1 <br>
Normally, fetchnews will store articles only in the
newsgroups which it considers interesting. With this option
set, fetchnews will create hardlinks for all newsgroups in
<br>
the Newsgroups: header that it knows about. This may be of
interest if you want to apply a score- or killfile to the
local Xref: line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxfetch = 1000 <br>
&quot;maxfetch&quot; specifies the maximum number of
articles fetchnews (8) should fetch from the upstream server
in each group. Its use is not advised, because if you use it
you <br>
will not see all the traffic in a group. By default there is
no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialfetch = 1 <br>
&quot;initialfetch&quot; defines how many articles from a
newly subscribed group should be fetched. The default is to
fetch all old articles, which can get quite time-consuming
when <br>
subscribing to a very busy group. This is equivalent to
setting initialfetch to zero. If you want to get no old
articles when subscribing to a new group, you should set
<br>
initialfetch to one, as in the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groupexpire very.crowded.group =
1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groupexpire
very.crowded.hierarchy.* = 1 <br>
&quot;groupexpire&quot; makes it possible to adjust expiry
times for individual groups. Expiry times are given in days.
0 means &quot;use the default&quot;, negative values prevent
the expire <br>
process for this group altogether (you can consider this an
archive mode). This value is used by texpire (8). You can
specify as many groupexpire lines as you like. It is <br>
possible to specify glob (7)-like wildcard expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxage = 10 <br>
If an article turns up on your upstream news server which is
older than &quot;maxage&quot; days it will not been fetched
even if you don&rsquo;t have it yet. This is useful if your
<br>
upstream server gets occasional &quot;hiccups&quot;. The
default is set to 10. If you want to switch this feature
off, set maxage to some very large value, such as 20000
(this is <br>
equivalent to roughly 54 years).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxold = 10 <br>
Is synonymous to maxage, see above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxlines = 2000 <br>
If you want to avoid receiving very large articles, you may
set the &quot;maxlines&quot; parameter to the maximal number
of lines an article should have. By default, this feature is
<br>
switched off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minlines = 2 <br>
Sometimes newsgroups are spammed with empty postings. To
reject these postings, you can set the &quot;minlines&quot;
parameter. Setting minlines to a value larger 4 is probably
not <br>
a good idea since you will also start to kill
&quot;real&quot; postings then. By default, this feature is
switched off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxbytes = 100000 <br>
If you want to avoid receiving very large articles, instead
of using the &quot;maxlines&quot; parameter you can also use
the &quot;maxbytes&quot; parameter. By default, this feature
is <br>
switched off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxcrosspost = 5 <br>
If you want to combat spam, you can filter out all postings
that are posted to more than a certain number of newsgroups.
The number is defined by setting &quot;maxcrosspost&quot;.
<br>
Setting this parameter to very low values is probably a bad
idea. This feature is switched off by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxgroups = 5 <br>
Synonymous for maxcrosspost. See above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filterfile =
/etc/news/leafnode/filters <br>
Leafnode can filter the input headers for arbitrary regular
expressions. These are stored in a file designated
&quot;filterfile&quot;. The format of &quot;filterfile&quot;
is very simple: <br>
one perl-compatible regular expression per line. If one of
the regular expressions fits to a header to be downloaded,
the body of that article will be rejected. This fea&acirc;
<br>
ture is switched off by default. The format of the regular
expressions is described in pcre(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_short = 2 <br>
By default, a group that has been accidentally touched is
being fetched for two days. You can change this time by
changing timeout_short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_long = 7 <br>
By default, a group that has not been read at all is being
fetched for seven days before being unsubscribed. This
interval can be changed by setting timeout_long to a
dif&acirc; <br>
ferent value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_active = 90 <br>
By default, active files from the upstream servers are
re-read every 90 days. This interval can be changed by
setting timeout_active to a different value. Be aware that
<br>
reading an active file transfers about one MB of information
if the server that you are using carries a reasonable number
of groups (i. e. around 20,000).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_client = 900 (since
v1.9.23) <br>
By default, leafnode will drop the connection 900 seconds
(15 minutes) after seeing the last command from the client.
You can change the timeout here. Setting it too low <br>
(like below 5 minutes) will annoy your users and consume
more system resources for re-reading all the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_fetchnews = 300 (since
v1.9.52) <br>
Fetchnews will, since v1.9.52, assume the upstream server
has become wedged after waiting for a reply for 300 seconds.
You can change the timeout here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_lock = 5 (since v1.9.54)
<br>
Configure how many seconds the leafnode programs
(applyfilter, checkgroups, fetchnews, texpire) will wait for
the lock file before aborting. Setting this to 0 means to
<br>
wait indefinitely. NOTE: you can override this by setting
the environment variable LN_LOCK_TIMEOUT (note it is not
LN_TIMEOUT_LOCK). The default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delaybody = 1 <br>
With this option set, fetchnews (8) fetches only the headers
of an article for visual inspection. Only when the headers
have been read, the bodies of the articles will be <br>
retrieved the next time fetchnews (8) is called. This can
save a huge amount of download time and disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delaybody_in_situ = 1 (since
v1.9.41) <br>
This is only applicable with delaybody=1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, leafnode will give
the full downloaded article a new article number so they
appear as new in your newsreader. This does not work for all
newsreaders. With this <br>
option set, leafnode will retain the original article
number. You&rsquo;ll have to figure out how to tell your
newsreader to show old articles. This option defaults to 0.
It is <br>
highly recommended to leave it unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debugmode = 1 <br>
With this option set, fetchnews (8), texpire (8) and
leafnode (8) will start to log lots of debugging output via
syslog (8) at facility news and priority debug. Use it for
<br>
tracking down problems with your feed. debugmode should be
left at 0 for regular use because it can log enormous
amounts of data. The higher the number, the more will be
<br>
logged. Choosing a figure greater than 3 will not make a
difference at the moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_8bit_headers = 1 (since
v1.9.25) <br>
By default, leafnode rejects local posts that have 8-bit
characters in their headers, because they violate relevant
standards, particularly RFC-2822 (which RFC-1036 is <br>
based on) that demands that Usenet news headers (as mail
headers) must be pure 7-bit US-ASCII, with only whitespace
allowed from the control characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, as UTF-8 is to come,
and some national hierarchies, particularly the Norwegian
and Danish (no.*, dk.*) seem to have agreed on preferring
just-send-eight over <br>
RFC-2047, you can set this option to allow 8-bit data in
headers. Leafnode will however add a warning header if 8-bit
data is present, stating that the site administrator <br>
allowed this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to make leafnode
accept non-whitespace control characters in headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowSTRANGERS = MAGIC (since
v1.9.23) <br>
By default, leafnode refuses connections from outside your
LANs. Check config.example for how to use this parameter to
let strangers connect to your leafnode. Instead of <br>
MAGIC, you have to write a number as mentioned in
config.example. Note that capitalization matters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linebuffer = 1 <br>
By default, stdout and sometimes stderr of applications are
set to &quot;fully buffered&quot; unless connected to
terminals. Use this option to explicitly request line
buffered mode <br>
for stdout and stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clamp_maxage = 0 <br>
By default, leafnode will derive a &quot;maxage&quot;
argument from the expire time that is applicable to the
group (groupexpire if set, expire otherwise), to prevent
fetching arti&acirc; <br>
cles again that were once there and then cleared by
texpire(8). Set clamp_maxage=0 to get rid of this
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">article_despite_filter = 1
(since v1.9.33) <br>
By default, fetchnews will request HEAD and BODY separately
if a filter file is defined and delaybody is off. For high
latency, high throughput links (such as interleaved <br>
DSL or satellite links), it may be faster to request head
and body together with an ARTICLE command and ignore the
body if the filters apply (though it may not be cheaper <br>
if you pay per MByte), enabling this option will force
leafnode to use the ARTICLE command in spite of filters
being defined. (Note that in delaybody mode, HEAD and BODY
<br>
will ALWAYS be requested separately.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newsadmin =
news@leafnode.example.org (since v1.9.47) <br>
This option sets the From: address for the placeholder
article, it should be the news administrator&rsquo;s mail
address. It defaults to news@HOSTNAME, where HOSTNAME is
leafn&acirc; <br>
ode&rsquo;s hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER-SPECIFIC OPTIONAL
PARAMETERS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options can only be placed
after the server= line of the server to which you would like
these to apply, and they always pertain to the preceding
server= line. Specifying <br>
them before the first server= line is an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">username = myname <br>
If any of your news servers requires authentication, you can
enter your username on that server here. This field may
occur multiple times, once after each server defini&acirc;
<br>
tion. See the introduction of this CONFIGURATION section for
information on how to quote myname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password = mypassword <br>
If any of your news servers requires authentication, you can
enter your password on that server here. This field may
occur multiple times, once after each server defini&acirc;
<br>
tion. Since the password is available in clear text, it is
recommended that you set the rights on the config file as
restrictive as possible, otherwise other users of <br>
your computer will be able to get your password(s) from that
file. See the introduction of this CONFIGURATION section for
information on how to quote mypassword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port = 8000 <br>
By default, fetchnews tries to connect to its upstream news
servers on the NNTP port (119). If your servers run on a
different port, you can specify those here. This field <br>
may occur multiple times, once after each server
definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: to modify the port your
own leafnode servers listens on, change the inetd.conf,
xinetd.conf configuration file or the tcpsvd/tcpserver
command line. leafnode does <br>
not set up its listen port itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout = 30 <br>
By default, leafnode tries to connect for 10 seconds to a
server and then gives up. If you have a slow server, you can
try for a longer time by setting the timeout higher <br>
(in this example, 30 seconds). The timeout can be tuned
individually for each server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noactive = ANYTHING (v1.9.25 ...
v1.11.4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noactive = 1 (since v1.11.5)
<br>
If this parameter is set, the active file is never
downloaded from this server. Use this for very slow servers
unless they carry groups that other servers don&rsquo;t
offer. <br>
Leafnode versions 1.9.25 to 1.11.4 would always assume that
&quot;ANYTHING&quot; had been 1. &quot;noactive = 0&quot; is
supported since v1.11.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodesc = ANYTHING (until
v1.11.4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodesc = 1 (since v1.11.5) <br>
Some servers do not deliver news groups descriptions
correctly because they cannot parse the XGTITLE and LIST
NEWSGROUPS commands. In that case, put this line after the
<br>
&quot;server&quot; line. Leafnode versions up to v1.11.4
would always assume that &quot;ANYTHING&quot; had been 1.
&quot;nodesc = 0&quot; is supported since v1.11.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nopost = 1 (since v1.9.23) <br>
Prevent posting to this server. You can use this if the
upstream won&rsquo;t let you post but still greet leafnode
with 200 or if the upstream doesn&rsquo;t forward your
postings <br>
reliably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noread = 1 (since v1.9.33) <br>
Prevent fetching news articles or active files from this
server. You can use this if the upstream is good to post,
but too slow to fetch news from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noxover = 1 (since v1.9.47) <br>
Prevent the use of XOVER on the current server. Fetchnews
will use XHDR instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only_groups_match_all = 1 (since
v1.9.52) <br>
Usually, when cross-posting an article, fetchnews will post
the article if ANY group listed in the Newsgroups: header is
matched by the PCRE. With this option on, ALL <br>
groups listed in the Newsgroups: header must match. This can
be used to avoid &quot;poison&quot; groups when you have
multiple upstream servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only_groups_pcre = PCRE (since
v1.9.28) <br>
This parameter lists the Perl-compatible regular expression
of groups that are fetched or posted to this server. The
PCRE is automatically anchored at the left hand side, <br>
so you can omit the leading ^. Remember to escape dots, as
in: <br>
de.comp.|de.comm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this parameter is omitted,
all groups are fetched from and posted to this server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: you must run fetchnews
with the -f option after changing, adding or removing any
only_groups_pcre option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: you can use something like
this to check your only_groups_pcre settings: <br>
cut -f1 -d&quot; &quot; @spooldir@/leaf.node/groupinfo |
pcregrep &rsquo;PATTERN&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post_anygroup = 1 (since
v1.9.37) <br>
This parameter makes leafnode post on this server without
checking if it carries the group an article is posted to.
The default is post_anygroup = 0, which means that <br>
leafnode will check with a &quot;GROUP&quot; command if the
server carries the group the articles is posted into. Use
this on post-only servers that don&rsquo;t allow the
&quot;GROUP&quot; command. <br>
Note: inconsiderate use of this parameter may cause articles
to end up in the failed.postings directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBSOLETE PARAMETERS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supplement <br>
is synonymous to server. Don&rsquo;t use it on new
installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fqdn is synonymous to hostname.
Don&rsquo;t use it on new installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL <br>
Here are the NNTP commands supported by this server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTICLE, BODY, DATE, GROUP, HDR,
HEAD, HELP, LAST, LIST, LIST ACTIVE, LIST ACTIVE.TIMES, LIST
EXTENSIONS, LIST NEWSGROUPS, LIST OVERVIEW.FMT, LISTGROUP,
MODE, NEWGROUPS, NEXT, <br>
POST, OVER, SLAVE, STAT, XHDR, XOVER. These commands follow
RFC-977 and RFC-2980, except HDR and OVER which are
recognized in anticipation of current NNTP drafts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the syntax of HDR and
OVER may change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Leafnode is totally unaware of UTF-8 and will reject a
client that posts UTF-8 characters in the header. Current
Usefor drafts claim all article headers UTF-8 encoded
Unicode. <br>
Leafnode still expects RFC-2047 instead which may eventually
be phased out in favour of UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leafnode stops reading a line at
the first NUL character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leafnode may not cope well with
crosspostings that cross hierarchies if you have multiple
upstream feeds and use the only_groups_pcre configuration
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leafnode will only bother to
determine the time zone offset for generated Date: headers
for posts that lack them on systems that offer the tm_gmtoff
member in struct tm (commonly <br>
BSD and GNU systems).</p>
