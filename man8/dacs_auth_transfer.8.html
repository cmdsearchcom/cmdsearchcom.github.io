DACS_AUTH_TRANSFER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dacs_auth_transfer - transfer credentials between
federations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dacs_auth_transfer [dacsoptions[1]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This web service is part of the DACS suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dacs_auth_transfer service
securely exports credentials (which represent an identity)
from one DACS federation to another (or from DACS to a
different identity management <br>
system), or securely imports an identity from one DACS
federation to another (or from a different identity
management system to DACS). This ability to transfer
credentials (i.e., <br>
import or export them) lets a DACS federation federate with
another system, creating a &quot;super federation&quot; with
single sign-on capability. DACS calls such federations
affiliated <br>
federations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A DACS federation can use
dacs_auth_transfer to leverage authentication mechanisms not
available to it, other systems can use it to leverage DACS,
and users can potentially <br>
access any access-controlled resource located in any of the
cooperating federations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a Nutshell <br>
For two DACS federations, here is how the service is
typically used. One or more jurisdictions in Federation A
provide links labelled &quot;Transfer Login To Federation
B&quot; (or <br>
similar). Following any of these links will initiate the
mechanism to export the user&rsquo;s identity to Federation
B. Alternatively, or additionally, one or more jurisdictions
in <br>
Federation B provide links labelled &quot;Transfer Login
From Federation A&quot;. Following any of these links will
initiate the mechanism to import the user&rsquo;s identity
from Federation <br>
A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user authenticates in
Federation A, obtaining credentials understood only in that
federation. When the user decides to access resources in
Federation B, he follows one of <br>
the links. Assuming all access control constraints are
satisfied, new credentials will be returned to him that are
understood in Federation B. His existing Federation A <br>
credentials continue to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user is now recognized by
both federations. If the user is known as FedA::J1:bobo in
Federation A, then he will also be known by that name in
Federation B. If Federation <br>
B happens to have a jurisdiction named J1 and a user at that
jurisdiction named bobo, that user (FedB::J1:bobo) is
separate and distinct as far as DACS is concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, in general, it is not
correct in the scenario above for Federation B to
automatically initiate a credential transfer if an
unauthenticated user (with respect to <br>
Federation B) is denied access. This is because Federation B
cannot tell with which federation it should be initiated (if
there is more than one) or even if this is something <br>
that the user wants done (perhaps the user needs to
authenticate in the usual way at Federation A). Therefore,
except perhaps in special circumstances, explicit user <br>
interaction is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For DACS, the complete protocol
is implemented by one program, dacs_auth_transfer. It
provides the importing, exporting, and server-to-server
stages of the protocol and it can <br>
also optionally assist middleware with the initial
presentation stage of the protocol. The protocol is
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an identity needs to be
imported to a non-DACS system, that system must implement
the identity transfer protocol described here, or a subset
of it. If a non-DACS system only <br>
needs to export an identity to a DACS federation, it may
only need a small amount of middleware to initiate the
transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
1. A small degree of cooperation is required between DACS
administrators at two affiliated federations so that they
each know how to configure the feature. The two <br>
federations remain autonomous, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Transferring credentials to a
DACS federation (exporting) neither creates a new account
nor creates a new identity. It merely converts credentials
that were obtained in <br>
one federation into DACS credentials that are recognized
within another federation. Because a DACS user identity
includes a federation name, among federated DACS systems
<br>
a user&rsquo;s identity is unique. After transfer to a
different federation, the original credentials continue to
exist and are unaltered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Exporting credentials to
another federation and later transferring them back to the
initial DACS federation (or exporting credentials within a
federation) will replace <br>
the initial credentials with new ones for the same identity.
The two sets of credentials will not be identical, however,
and the imported ones may be less complete and <br>
therefore &quot;weaker&quot; than the original credentials
with respect to authorization processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. System administrators should
ensure that dacs_auth_transfer is configured so that it is
impossible to import credentials to a federation from which
they were exported, <br>
otherwise it may be possible for users to defeat the expiry
of credentials by repeatedly regenerating them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The identity transfer
protocol includes a server-to-server operation that must use
SSL/TLS. The identity of the server issuing the request must
be verified, either <br>
through its X.509 (SSL) client certificate, DACS
credentials, or perhaps its IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. As an additional security
measure, a jurisdiction will only accept credentials for an
identity outside of its federation if enabled by
ACCEPT_ALIEN_CREDENTIALS[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. While this document talks in
terms of a DACS federation importing credentials,
importation actually takes place at a DACS jurisdiction,
just as authentication does. That <br>
target jurisdiction is similarly responsible for the
resulting credentials and is identified within the new
credentials for access control testing and audit
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Any appropriately configured
jurisdiction is capable of exporting or importing
credentials. Some federations might choose to create
&quot;administrative jurisdictions&quot; solely <br>
for this purpose (e.g., export.example.com and
import.example.com), however, just as a federation might be
structured to limit authentication services to a designated
<br>
jurisdiction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Identity Transfer Protocol
<br>
The ability to transfer credentials from one identity
management system to another is a feature that can be
beneficial to both users and system administrators. For
users, it can <br>
provide the convenience of single sign-on; a user need only
be authenticated by one federation to be able to access
resources within a different federated system. For a system
<br>
administrator, it means that fewer user identities need to
be created and managed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview <br>
The systems being federated might exist within a single
organization or be associated with different, autonomous
organizations that have a trust relationship, very much as
<br>
DACS jurisdictions do. The transfer of credentials need not
be reciprocal; that is, Federation A may allow identities to
be imported from Federation B but not vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The architecture of the transfer
mechanism is primarily constrained by the typical
browser-oriented usage of DACS, where credentials are
encapsulated within an HTTP cookie, <br>
thereby dictating how credentials are set in an
off-the-shelf browser and when credentials will be sent by
the browser. The approach is complicated somewhat because a
DACS <br>
user may have multiple concurrent credentials or may be
unauthenticated. Also, a DACS federation may wish to
federate with more than one foreign federation. Therefore,
<br>
interaction with the user will sometimes be necessary so
that she can select the particular identity to be
transferred and a target federation to which that identity
is to be <br>
transferred. A jurisdiction or federation must be able to
customize this interaction for appropriate web site
integration (i.e., look and feel), but a bare-bones
capability <br>
must still be provided by dacs_auth_transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The design tries to balance
security, usability, performance, availability,
configuration complexity, implementation effort,
administrative needs, generality, and <br>
extensibility, all within the constraints of the DACS
architecture and requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Though it is assumed that
SSL/TLS is used to secure all network communication and
identify the communicating hosts where necessary, some major
potential threats against a <br>
transfer capability must be addressed by the design:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Replay: the system must
prevent the malicious or accidental use of expired
credentials, reuse of authentication material by a different
browser user (such as through <br>
browser history or a bookmark), use of authentication
material discovered in a log file, and so on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Forgery and Tampering: the
system must prevent a malicious user from changing
authentication material to get different or
&quot;better&quot; credentials using the transfer
protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replay is addressed in the
transfer protocol by restricting the exposure of
authentication and protocol material and by limiting its
validity period. Injection of copied <br>
material is also made difficult. Forgery and tampering are
addressed through cryptographic means; using
well-established techniques, it is thought to be practically
<br>
impossible to create forged authentication material or
modify it undetectably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Importation of identities has federation-wide ramifications
but it is the responsibility of each jurisdiction to decide
whether it will allow its dacs_auth_transfer <br>
service to import an identity or its rules to honour an
identity imported by another jurisdiction within the
federation. A jurisdiction may independently allow
identities <br>
to be imported from an external system, just as it may
unilaterally decide whether it will authenticate users and
how it will do so. On the other hand, a jurisdiction is <br>
free to reject imported identities, just as it is free to
reject an identity vouched for by another jurisdiction in
its federation. Federation members may wish to <br>
establish guidelines and procedures for importing
identities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protocol Operation <br>
The purpose of the protocol is to transfer an identity
understood by the initial federation to the target
federation. The initial federation exports an identity; the
target <br>
federation imports the identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The four stages (operations) of
the protocol are now described, in the order in which they
are used. In all cases, &quot;the user&quot; can be a
browser or middleware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The PRESENTATION operation,
which is performed in the initial federation and is
optional, is used for prompting the user to select the
credentials to be transferred and <br>
identify the target federation. The purpose of the
PRESENTATION operation is simply to make it easier for a
user or middleware to invoke the EXPORT operation; the
EXPORT <br>
operation can be invoked directly without engaging in this
step of the protocol, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The EXPORT operation is
invoked at the initial federation by a user to request that
the initial federation initiate the transfer of credentials
representing a given <br>
identity to a given federation. After receiving and
validating its arguments, the EXPORT operation invokes the
TOKEN operation at the target federation. If the target <br>
federation tentatively approves the importation of the
identity, it returns a URL to which the EXPORT stage
redirects the user. If the target federation rejects the
<br>
request (or the request fails), the EXPORT stage returns an
error indication that should be reflected back to the user
and terminates the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The TOKEN operation is the
heart of the protocol. By invoking it at the target
federation, the initial federation vouches for the identity
to be transferred and requests <br>
that the target federation honour the user&rsquo;s request
for credentials valid within the target federation; the
latter is free to reject the request for any reason. To <br>
accomplish the transfer, the initial federation requests a
token from the target federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A token is cryptographically
protected, opaque information encapsulated within a URL as
its query component; the token is meaningful only to the
target federation (i.e., <br>
its meaning is unspecified by the protocol). It could
contain a database key for the transaction, a nonce, or a
self-contained description of the transaction. All that is
<br>
required by the protocol is that it be kept secret among the
communicating parties for as long as it is valid, that its
validity period be no longer than what is required <br>
to complete the last stage of identity transfer, that it be
difficult to forge, and that it be tamper-resistant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the request for a token is
granted, the target federation returns a URL that
encapsulates it, otherwise an error indication is returned
to the initial federation which <br>
in turn returns an error indication to the user and
terminates the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The IMPORT request is sent by
the user to the target federation. A complete URL containing
the IMPORT request will typically be created by the target
federation, returned <br>
to the initial federation, and forwarded to the user as a
browser redirect by the EXPORT stage. Upon successfully
validating the request, which includes an examination of
<br>
the token and checking for revocation of the identity (see
dacs.acls(5)[3] for a description of how
authentication/access revocation works), the target
federation returns <br>
credentials (as an HTTP cookie) that are returned to the
user in the final step of the IMPORT operation - this is the
end-goal of the protocol - and the user is <br>
redirected by the target federation to an appropriate
&quot;success&quot; URL as a convenience to the user. If the
transfer fails, no new credentials are returned and the user
is <br>
redirected to an appropriate &quot;failure&quot; URL by the
target federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementation <br>
The dacs_auth_transfer service implements all of the stages
as separate operations of a single web service; a different
implementation might create separate services for each <br>
stage or operation, or implement a subset of the
functionality (e.g., it might only support exporting
identities).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the federating systems
must be assigned a unique name (for DACS, through the
FEDERATION_NAME directive) so that identities can be
globally unique. The federating <br>
systems need not share a common domain name suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
In the current implementation of dacs_auth_transfer,
configuration information associated with target federations
is not automatically distributed by DACS to a <br>
federation&rsquo;s jurisdictions. This means that only those
jurisdictions that have been specifically configured to
import identities will be able to do so; a jurisdiction <br>
will not automatically understand how to interact with a
given target federation that is configured at a different
jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction&rsquo;s administrator
wanting <br>
to provide this service must configure his site&rsquo;s
dacs_auth_transfer service appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Details of the
dacs_auth_transfer implementation and configuration
requirements are now presented. A different implementation
of the protocol could look very different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRESENTATION <br>
dacs_auth_transfer can emit an HTML document to prompt the
user (by default, using the style sheet
dacs_auth_transfer.css[4]). The user selects an identity and
target <br>
federation and submits a form. Alternatively, the
information necessary to construct prompts can be returned
within an XML document that conforms to <br>
dacs_auth_transfer.dtd[5]. A site is also free to implement
its own presentation stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of known target
federation names from which a user can select is obtained
from mappings that have been configured at this jurisdiction
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When emitting HTML, the web page
generated by dacs_auth_transfer can be customized through
the auth_transfer VFS item type. The following items are
emitted if they exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; header: Initial
HTML to emit instead of the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; prologue: HTML
to emit immediately after the header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; instructions:
HTML to emit immediately after the prologue and before the
form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; form: Additional
HTML to emit within the form. A likely use of this is to
specify a hidden TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; epilogue: HTML
to emit immediately after the form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; trailer: Final
HTML to emit instead of the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, consider the
configuration directive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VFS
&quot;[auth_transfer]dacs-fs:${Conf::DACS_HOME}/auth_transfer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If files named header and
trailer exist in the directory
${Conf::DACS_HOME}/auth_transfer, they are expected to
contain the initial and final HTML content, respectively.
<br>
Note that these files consist of text and HTML markup but
are not complete HTML documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customization of the HTML form
is possible using configuration variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
transfer_export_uri: the URL of the program to which the
form should be submitted. By default, the URL is created
from the one used to invoke the presentation stage, <br>
which will usually be that of dacs_auth_transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
transfer_submit_label: the text label to put in the
form&rsquo;s submit button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
transfer_submit_method: the HTTP method to use to submit the
form (GET is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the submit
button&rsquo;s text can be specified using the
directive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVAL
${Conf::transfer_submit_label} = &quot;Execute the
transfer!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPORT <br>
The identity to be transferred and the name of the target
federation are submitted to dacs_auth_transfer as arguments
of the EXPORT operation. The request must be <br>
accompanied by DACS credentials that match this identity and
the target federation must be recognized by the receiving
jurisdiction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, this URL asks the
jurisdiction associated with example.com to export the
identity EXAMPLE:bobo to the target federation DSS:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://example.com/dacs/dacs_auth_transfer?OPERATION=EXPORT
&amp;TARGET_FEDERATION=DSS
&amp;DACS_IDENTITY=EXAMPLE:bobo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the request to succeed,
credentials for EXAMPLE:bobo must be sent with the request,
permission must be granted (by example.com) to export the
identity, example.com <br>
must be configured with an appropriate mapping, described
below, such that it knows how to submit a TOKEN request to a
service associated with federation DSS, and that <br>
service must allow importation of the identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mappings of federation
identifiers to URLs for export purposes are provided through
the AUTH_TRANSFER_EXPORT[6] directive. That is, these
mappings indicate which <br>
target federations have been configured at this jurisdiction
and associate a target federation identifier (a short,
descriptive keyword) with a URL of a web service that <br>
implements the TOKEN operation for the target federation. It
is from these mappings that the list of selectable target
federations is obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Unless jurisdictions coordinate mappings with each other,
the same jurisdiction must perform both the PRESENTATION and
EXPORT operations. <br>
For example, dacs.conf might include the directive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTH_TRANSFER_EXPORT &quot;DSS
https://dacs.dss.ca/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_auth_transfer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directive specifies one
target federation, identified by the name DSS, and
associates it with the URL of a service implementing the
TOKEN operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
The TOKEN operation must be performed over a secure
communication channel, typically using SSL/TLS. URLs
appearing in these mappings should therefore specify https.
<br>
The issuer of the TOKEN operation may identify itself using
an SSL client certificate; if SSL_PROG_CLIENT_CRT[7] is
configured, that certificate will automatically be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the issuer of the TOKEN
operation possesses DACS credentials obtained offline from
the target federation (e.g., using dacscookie(1)[8]), it can
specify that they <br>
be sent with the request by putting them in an object named
FEDNAME.cookies relative to the auth_transfer item type.
directory ${Conf::DACS_HOME}/auth_transfer, one <br>
cookie per line. The FEDNAME filename suffix is the
federation identifier for the importing federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, given the
AUTH_TRANSFER_EXPORT directive and the VFS directive for
auth_transfer above, all cookies found in a file named <br>
/usr/local/dacs/auth_transfer/DSS.cookies would be sent with
the TOKEN operation to identify the initial federation.
These cookies would have been obtained from <br>
federation DSS over a secure communication channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOKEN <br>
The syntax and semantics of a token are meaningful only to
the target federation and can be changed without affecting
any initial federation. In the current <br>
implementation, the token is comprised of information such
as the identity to be transferred, the current date at the
transfer federation, the client&rsquo;s IP address, and <br>
(optionally) the client&rsquo;s role string, which is
encrypted using the target federation&rsquo;s
federation-wide key and base-64 encoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The identity to be transferred must be a syntactically valid
DACS username. <br>
The period during which a token is valid is determined
solely by the target federation. Its lifetime will
ordinarily be just a few seconds, after which it will be
treated <br>
as invalid by the IMPORT stage. The
AUTH_TRANSFER_TOKEN_LIFETIME_SECS[9] directive specifies
this value for dacs_auth_transfer; if not given, a
compile-time default is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A jurisdiction within the target
federation that provides identity importation must must
configure at least one Transfer clause. The transfer
directives are largely <br>
analogous to the authentication and roles directives. Each
Transfer element must have an id attribute. Its value is
merely a label (an alphabetic followed by zero or more <br>
alphanumerics, hyphens, and underscores) that allows the
clause to be referenced. The id attribute values must be
unique (case-sensitively) within the clause&rsquo;s <br>
Jurisdiction section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
&Acirc;&middot; An access control rule must be in place to
ensure that this operation can only be executed by a
legitimate server belonging to a recognized initial
federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The caller may
not have supplied DACS credentials to identify itself and
therefore the user()[10] function may not be of use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transfer Clause Directives
Index:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. CREDENTIALS_LIFETIME_SECS

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. ERROR_URL (Optional1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. EXIT* (Optional1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. REFEDERATE (Optional1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. ROLES* (Optional1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. SUCCESS_URL (Optional1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORT_FROM (Required) <br>
This directive, which may be repeated, names an initial
federation, as identified by the INITIAL_FEDERATION
argument, to which this clause applies. It must be a <br>
syntactically valid federation name. These names are
case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFEDERATE (Optional1) <br>
If &quot;yes&quot; (case insensitive), the federation and
jurisdiction of the imported identity (i.e., the
DACS_IDENTITY argument) are changed to that of the target
<br>
jurisdiction. If this directive is unspecified or has
another value, the original identity is retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if the TOKEN
operation at jurisdiction ALPHA of federation FED2 is passed
DACS_IDENTITY with a value of FED1::BETA:bobo and REFEDERATE
is enabled, then <br>
the imported identity will be FED2::ALPHA:bobo .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
This directive is useful in certain circumstances in that it
can prevent a particular individual from being known by
multiple names, which may complicate access <br>
control rules. It must be used with care, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say Bobo is naturally known as
ALPHA:bobo within federation FED2. If she authenticates as
FED1::BETA:bobo and uses dacs_auth_transfer to obtain
credentials in <br>
FED2, then by default her new credentials will be for the
name FED1::BETA:bobo; i.e., her DACS identity is
retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access control rules in FED2 may
need to handle both names, however, which can lead to
problems. Some DACS administrators in FED2 may not even be
aware of FED1, <br>
and so access to FED1::BETA:bobo may be denied while access
to the same resource may be granted to FED2::ALPHA:bobo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no two distinct identities in
FED1 can be mapped to the same identity in FED2 (i.e., the
same username component is not associated with more than one
<br>
jurisdiction that can export the identity to FED2), then the
administrator at the initial federation can advise the
administrator at the target federation that <br>
the REFEDERATE directive should be enabled. Transferred
identities will then be modified to appear to have been
authenticated by FED2::ALPHA. When this feature is <br>
configured, although Bobo authenticates as FED1::BETA:bobo,
her imported identity will be FED2::ALPHA:bobo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If enabling this directive would
cause two or more distinct identities to be mapped to the
same DACS identity, the directive should not be used because
different <br>
individuals may be assigned the same DACS name in the target
federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREDICATE (Optional1) <br>
The value of this directive is an expression. If the
expression does not evaluate to True, importation will not
be permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREDENTIALS_LIFETIME_SECS
(Optional1) <br>
This directive is used to override the value of the
AUTH_CREDENTIALS_DEFAULT_LIFETIME_SECS[11] directive or the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORT_ROLES (Optional1) <br>
If &quot;yes&quot; (case insensitive), any roles in the
existing credentials will be copied to the new credentials.
The roles must be syntactically valid at the target <br>
jurisdiction. Within the context of the clause, the variable
${Auth::IMPORTED_ROLES} is assigned the roles string. The
default is &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORT_URL (Optional1) <br>
This is the URL of the IMPORT stage of the protocol. By
default, this is the same as that of the TOKEN stage, which
is correct for dacs_auth_transfer since it <br>
implements all stages of the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUCCESS_URL (Optional1) <br>
If the transfer is successful and the user has not specified
another URL via the TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL argument, the user
will be redirected to SUCCESS_URL. This <br>
directive is used by dacs_auth_transfer in the IMPORT
stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR_URL (Optional1) <br>
If the transfer fails and the user has not specified another
URL via the TRANSFER_ERROR_URL argument, the user will be
redirected to ERROR_URL. This directive is used <br>
by dacs_auth_transfer in the IMPORT stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROLES* (Optional1) <br>
The value of this directive is an expression that is
evaluated at run-time. Provided an error does not occur, the
resulting string becomes the role string for the new <br>
credentials. The new role string must be syntactically valid
at the target jurisdiction. The variable
${Auth::IMPORTED_ROLES} is initialized to the role string
(if <br>
any - see IMPORT_ROLES) from the existing credentials and is
assigned the value of the expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to add fed1 to
those found in the existing credentials:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORT_ROLES &quot;yes&quot;
<br>
ROLES* &rsquo;${Auth::IMPORTED_ROLES} .
&quot;,fed1&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT* (Optional1) <br>
The value of this directive is an expression that is
evaluated at run-time. Provided an error does not occur,
side effects from the evaluation may alter the final <br>
result of the clause. The variable ${Auth::IMPORTED_ROLES}
is initialized to the role string (if any - see
IMPORT_ROLES) from the existing credentials and <br>
${Auth::IMPORTED_USERNAME} is assigned the (tentative)
imported username component from the imported credentials.
Either variable may be modified by the expression. <br>
The new role string must be syntactically valid at the
target jurisdiction. The new username must be syntactically
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directive maps all imported
usernames to guest, relative to the target jurisdiction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT*
&rsquo;${Auth::IMPORTED_USERNAME} =
&quot;guest&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORT <br>
An IMPORT request is validated before being accepted, which
includes examining the token and checking for revocation of
the identity. There is no guarantee that if the <br>
TOKEN operation succeeds the IMPORT operation will also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS credentials imported by
dacs_auth_transfer are marked as being alien and imported,
the jurisdiction that executed the importation is recorded,
and the IP address <br>
associated with the user&rsquo;s initial credentials are
associated with the new credentials; these characteristics
can be tested using the dacs.exprs(5)[10] function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
An access control rule must be in place to ensure that this
operation can only be executed by appropriate users. Access
might well be granted to any user but might <br>
reasonably be restricted based on IP address, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To recap, assuming
dacs_auth_transfer is used to transfer credentials between
two DACS federations (which we will call Federation A and
Federation B) and no errors occur, the <br>
flow of control will typically be as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The user follows a link that
invokes dacs_auth_transfer at some jurisdiction within
Federation A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. dacs_auth_transfer generates
an HTML document that is displayed on the user&rsquo;s
browser. The user selects a target federation (Federation B)
and credentials to transfer <br>
from those presented within an HTML form and submits it,
invoking dacs_auth_transfer at Federation A again, but this
time to perform the EXPORT operation. The list of <br>
credentials from which the user can choose depends on the
user&rsquo;s current credentials in Federation A. The list
of target federations depends on those known to the <br>
jurisdiction that processes the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The dacs_auth_transfer at
Federation A processes the EXPORT operation and invokes the
TOKEN operation at Federation B. This action is transparent
to the user. The <br>
response from Federation B is a URL that represents a
complete IMPORT operation directed at Federation B. The
EXPORT operation redirects the user&rsquo;s browser to that
URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Upon receiving the redirect,
the user&rsquo;s browser invokes the IMPORT operation at
Federation B. Federation B returns new credentials and
redirects the user&rsquo;s browser to a <br>
configured or requested URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To interoperate with
dacs_auth_transfer to import DACS credentials, a program
must implement the TOKEN operation. It must also provide
functionality similar to that of the <br>
IMPORT operation. Because the TOKEN operation returns a URL
encapsulating an IMPORT request to which the client is
redirected, however, the IMPORT operation can be <br>
implementation-dependent and does need to interoperate with
dacs_auth_transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To interoperate with
dacs_auth_transfer to export credentials to a DACS
federation, a program must be capable of invoking
dacs_auth_transfer with the TOKEN operation and its <br>
arguments, and redirect the client to the URL provided by
dacs_auth_transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Web Service Arguments <br>
In addition to the standard CGI arguments[12],
dacs_auth_agent understands a variety of arguments that
depend on the operation being requested. The descriptions of
the arguments <br>
that follow are therefore grouped by operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The additional arguments
accepted by dacs_auth_transfer follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presentation <br>
For this stage, the value of the OPERATION argument is
PRESENTATION (case insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FORMAT argument (see
dacs(1)[13]) determines the type of output, with the default
being HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REDIRECT_DEFAULT <br>
If &quot;yes&quot; and there is exactly one set of
credentials and one target federation (i.e., there is
nothing for the client to select), then automatically
redirect the client <br>
to a URL representing the EXPORT stage of the protocol.
Though the client will not be required to submit a form, he
will not have the opportunity to see which identity is <br>
being transferred or the name of the target federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Export <br>
For this stage, the value of the OPERATION argument is
EXPORT (case insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS_IDENTITY <br>
This is the identity corresponding to the credentials to be
exported, expressed as a full DACS user identity (see
dacs(1)[14]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGET_FEDERATION <br>
This is the jurisdiction&rsquo;s identifier for the
federation to which the selected credentials are to be
transferred. The user will typically select this identifier
from a <br>
list produced by the same jurisdiction that performs the
PRESENTATION operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL <br>
If the transfer operation is successful, the user will be
redirected to this URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFER_ERROR_URL <br>
If the transfer operation fails, the user will be redirected
to this URL. If unspecified, the AUTH_TRANSFER_ERROR_URL
will be used if configured, otherwise a message will <br>
be emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS_DEBUG <br>
If &quot;yes&quot;, operate in a debugging mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Token <br>
For this stage, the value of the OPERATION argument is TOKEN
(case insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS_IDENTITY <br>
The value of this argument is identical to the argument of
the same name that is passed to the EXPORT stage. If the
transfer succeeds, this is the identity for which new <br>
credentials will be issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIAL_FEDERATION <br>
This is the identifier for the federation that received the
EXPORT request. The target federation must have a mapping
for this identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT_ADDR <br>
The IP address from which the EXPORT request was issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL <br>
If the transfer operation is successful, the user wants to
be redirected to this URL. If unspecified, a default URL
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFER_ERROR_URL <br>
If the transfer operation fails, the user will be redirected
to this URL. If unspecified, a default URL will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS_DEBUG <br>
If &quot;yes&quot;, operate in a debugging mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import <br>
For this stage, the value of the OPERATION argument is
IMPORT (case insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOKEN <br>
This is the value of the token returned by a previous call
to the TOKEN stage of the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL <br>
If the transfer operation is successful, the user wants to
be redirected to this URL. If unspecified, a default URL
configured at the target federation using the <br>
AUTH_TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL[15] directive will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFER_ERROR_URL <br>
If the transfer operation fails, the user wants to be
redirected to this URL. If unspecified, a default URL
configured at the target federation using the <br>
AUTH_TRANSFER_ERROR_URL[16] will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS_DEBUG <br>
If &quot;yes&quot;, operate in a debugging mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following example describes step-by-step how to
configure two DACS federations, FED_EX1 (example.com) and
FED_EX2 (example.net), to enable credentials to be
transferred from <br>
FED_EX1 to FED_EX2. For FED_EX1, the jurisdiction J1
(j1.example.com) will be configured to export credentials
and for FED_EX2, J2 (j2.example.net) will be configured to
import <br>
credentials. The example assumes that these two
jurisdictions have already installed and configured DACS and
that it is possible to authenticate (obtain credentials)
somewhere <br>
within FED_EX1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This example will not actually work without changing the
domain names, URLs, and identities that it uses for
demonstration purposes to those configured for your
federations <br>
and jurisdictions. Having successfully reproduced this
example functionality on your systems, it should be apparent
how to extend it for additional jurisdictions and <br>
federations, and how to make credential transfer
bidirectional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. At J1, add a
jurisdiction-specific access control rule that allows
dacs_auth_transfer to be used to export an identity:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;acl_rule
status=&quot;enabled&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;services&gt; <br>
&lt;service
url_expr=&rsquo;&quot;${Conf::dacs_cgi_bin_prefix}/dacs_auth_transfer&quot;&rsquo;/&gt;
<br>
&lt;/services&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;rule
order=&quot;allow,deny&quot;
pass_credentials=&quot;all&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;allow&gt; <br>
user(&quot;auth&quot;) and (${Args::OPERATION} eq
&quot;PRESENTATION&quot; <br>
or ${Args::OPERATION} eq &quot;EXPORT&quot;) <br>
&lt;/allow&gt; <br>
&lt;/rule&gt; <br>
&lt;/acl_rule&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At J2, add a
jurisdiction-specific access control rule that allows
dacs_auth_transfer to be used to import an identity:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;acl_rule
status=&quot;enabled&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;services&gt; <br>
&lt;service
url_expr=&rsquo;&quot;${Conf::dacs_cgi_bin_prefix}/dacs_auth_transfer&quot;&rsquo;/&gt;
<br>
&lt;/services&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;rule
order=&quot;allow,deny&quot;
pass_credentials=&quot;all&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;allow&gt; <br>
(from(&quot;j1.example.com&quot;) and ${Args::OPERATION} eq
&quot;TOKEN&quot;) <br>
or ${Args::OPERATION} eq &quot;IMPORT&quot; <br>
&lt;/allow&gt; <br>
&lt;/rule&gt; <br>
&lt;/acl_rule&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
In particular, the rule at the target federation must
restrict access based on the identity, or possibly the IP
address, associated with the request. If the cookie-based
<br>
authentication method is used, the rule would test for that
specific identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. At J1, configure
dacs_auth_transfer to know how to invoke the TOKEN operation
so that it can export credentials to FED_EX2. Add this
directive to dacs.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTH_TRANSFER_EXPORT
&quot;FED_EX2
https://j2.example.net/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_auth_transfer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is the only
required additional configuration at J1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. At J2, configure
dacs_auth_transfer so that it will import credentials from
FED_EX1. Add a Transfer clause to dacs.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCEPT_ALIEN_CREDENTIALS
&quot;yes&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;Transfer
id=&quot;fed_ex1&quot;&gt; <br>
IMPORT_FROM &quot;FED_EX1&quot; <br>
SUCCESS_URL
&quot;https://j2.example.net/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_current_credentials&quot;
<br>
&lt;/Transfer&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This configuration allows
credentials to be imported from federation FED_EX1. As the
default, after successful importation users will be
redirected to a page that lists their <br>
identities in federation FED_EX2. In practice this might
point to the site&rsquo;s home page, for example. The
jurisdiction must be told to recognize credentials imported
from <br>
FED_EX2 using the ACCEPT_ALIEN_CREDENTIALS directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The configuration can now be
tested. First, authenticate somewhere within FED_EX1 using
your browser. Let&rsquo;s assume that you authenticated as
the identity FED_EX1::J1:bob so <br>
that this example can refer to a specific name. Invoke this
URL from the browser:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://j1.example.com/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_auth_transfer?OPERATION=PRESENTATION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be presented with a
web page that displays the identity FED_EX1::J1:bob (and any
others that happen to be in effect) and the target
federation name FED_EX2 (and <br>
any other federations specified by a AUTH_TRANSFER_EXPORT
directive). It might be instructive to view the source for
the HTML page if you are still not clear about what the <br>
PRESENTATION operation does. Click on the Transfer button
(if necessary, first selecting an identity and target
federation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can bypass the PRESENTATION
operation by directly invoking the URL:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://j1.example.com/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_auth_transfer?
OPERATION=EXPORT&amp;DACS_IDENTITY=FED_EX1::J1:bob</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the transfer is successful,
your browser should now possess the original credentials for
the identity FED_EX1::J1:bob, valid within FED_EX1, and
credentials for the <br>
identity FED_EX1::J1:bob that are valid within FED_EX2;
dacs_current_credentials, where your browser should be
redirected to in this example, should display the latter.
Note <br>
that though issued by different sites, the two cookies have
the same cookie name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example
illustrates how an identity might be transferred from a
non-DACS federation (SOME_FED) to a DACS federation (again,
FED_EX2 via its jurisdiction J2). We <br>
will assume that an appropriate access control rule has been
configured at J2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As in the previous example, at
J2, configure dacs_auth_transfer so that it will import
credentials from SOME_FED by adding a Transfer clause to
dacs.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCEPT_ALIEN_CREDENTIALS
&quot;yes&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;Transfer
id=&quot;some_fed&quot;&gt; <br>
IMPORT_FROM &quot;SOME_FED&quot; <br>
REFEDERATE &quot;YES&quot; <br>
IMPORT_ROLES &quot;NO&quot; <br>
&lt;/Transfer&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This configuration allows
credentials to be imported from federation SOME_FED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A system administrator must
write a small program, run somewhere within SOME_FED, that
will invoke dacs_auth_transfer at J2 with appropriate
arguments. The program might be run <br>
automatically as part of the login procedure at SOME_FED or
explicitly by providing a link that a user can follow (e.g.,
labelled &quot;Transfer Login To FED_EX2&quot;, or similar).
The <br>
program simply invokes the TOKEN operation at J2 and, if
successful, redirects the user to the URL that is returned
to it by dacs_auth_transfer (which represents an IMPORT <br>
operation). If the IMPORT operation succeeds, the user will
be issued an HTTP cookie bearing the DACS credentials. If
desired, the URL that the user should visit after a <br>
successful transfer can be specified through the
TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program might initiate the
transfer by constructing and invoking a URL (via the POST
method) much like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import_url=&lsquo;http -p
INITIAL_FEDERATION &quot;SOME_FED&quot; -p DACS_IDENTITY
&quot;FED_EX2::J2:bobo&quot; -p CLIENT_ADDR 127.0.0.1 -p
TRANSFER_SUCCESS_URL
&quot;https://j2.example.net/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_current_credentials&quot;
-p OPERATION TOKEN
&rsquo;https://j2.example.net/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_auth_transfer&rsquo;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, the requested DACS
identity is FED_EX2::J2:bobo. If the response looks like a
URL, then the TOKEN operation succeeded; to continue the
transfer, the program must redirect <br>
the user to the URL. In this example, if credentials are
returned to the user, the user will be redirected to
dacs_current_credentials by DACS (which is useful for
testing but <br>
unlikely in actual use).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
dacs_auth_transfer.css[4]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The program exits 0 if everything was fine, 1 if an error
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
dacs_authenticate(8)[17], dacs_auth_agent(8)[18],
dacs.conf(5)[19]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The jurisdictional meta information should be extended to
identify importing and exporting jurisdictions (e.g., as
reported by dacs_list_jurisdictions(8)[20]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be possible to
optionally perform comparative checks on the IP address from
which the EXPORT request was issued and the IP address from
which the IMPORT request was <br>
issued. At present, if they are not identical a warning
message is logged but importation is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current implementation is
stateless on the server side. By including a nonce in the
token, the possibility of replay could be further
reduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A mechanism for mapping imported
names may be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the credential&rsquo;s
DACS role string is passed to the target federation, a
flexible mechanism for optionally including them in the
imported credentials should be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol should be improved
with respect to peer identification for the TOKEN
operation.</p>
