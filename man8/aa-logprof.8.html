aa-logprof - utility for updating AppArmor security profiles
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>aa-logprof [</b><b><i>-d /path/to/profiles</i></b><b>] [</b><b><i>-f
  /path/to/logfile</i></b> <b>] [</b><b><i>-m &lt;mark in
  logfile&gt;</i></b><b>]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-d --dir /path/to/profiles</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   Specifies where to look for the AppArmor security profile set.
   Defaults to /etc/apparmor.d.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-f --file /path/to/logfile</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Specifies the location of logfile that contains AppArmor security events.
        Default locations are read from F&lt;/etc/apparmor/logprof.conf&gt;.
        Typical defaults are:
                 /var/log/audit/audit.log
                 /var/log/syslog
                 /var/log/messages
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b> -m --logmark &quot;mark&quot;</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   aa-logprof will ignore all events in the system log before the
   specified mark is seen.  If the mark contains spaces, it must 
   be surrounded with quotes to work correctly.
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>aa-logprof</b> is an interactive tool used to review AppArmor generated
  messages and update AppArmor security profiles.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Running aa-logprof will scan the log file and if there are new AppArmor events
  that are not covered by the existing profile set, the user will be prompted
  with suggested modifications to augment the profile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When aa-logprof exits profile changes are saved to disk. If AppArmor is running,
  the updated profiles are reloaded and if any processes that generated AppArmor
  events are still running in the null-complain-profile, those processes are set
  to run under their proper profiles.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Responding_to_AppArmor_Events"><a class="selflink" href="#Responding_to_AppArmor_Events">Responding
  to AppArmor Events</a></h2>
<b>aa-logprof</b> will generate a list of suggested profile changes that the
  user can choose from, or they can create their own, to modifiy the permission
  set of the profile so that the generated access violation will not re-occur.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user is then presented with info about the access including profile, path,
  old mode if there was a previous entry in the profile for this path, new mode,
  the suggestion list, and given these options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   (A)llow, (D)eny, (I)gnore, (N)ew, (G)lob last piece, (Q)uit
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the AppArmor profile was in complain mode when the event was generated, the
  default for this option is (A)llow, otherwise, it's (D)eny.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The (D)eny option adds a &quot;deny&quot; rule to the AppArmor profile, which
  silences logging.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The (I)gnore option allows user to ignore the event, without making any changes
  to the AppArmor profile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The suggestion list is presented as a numbered list with includes at the top,
  the literal path in the middle, and the suggested globs at the bottom. If any
  globs are being suggested, the shortest glob is the selected option,
  otherwise, the literal path is selected. Picking includes from the list must
  be done manually.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hitting a numbered key will change the selected option to the corresponding
  numbered entry in the list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the user selects (N)ew, they'll be prompted to enter their own globbed entry
  to match the path. If the user-entered glob does not match the path for this
  event, they'll be informed and have the option to fix it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the user selects (G)lob last piece then, taking the currently selected
  option, aa-logprof will remove the last path element and replace it with /*.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the last path element already was /*, aa-logprof will go up a directory level
  and replace it with /**.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This new globbed entry is then added to the suggestion list and marked as the
  selected option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So /usr/share/themes/foo/bar/baz.gif can be turned into /usr/share/themes/** by
  hitting &quot;g&quot; three times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the user selects (A)llow, aa-logprof will take the current selection and add
  it to the profile, deleting other entries in the profile that are matched by
  the new entry.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adding r access to /usr/share/themes/** would delete an entry for r access to
  /usr/share/themes/foo/*.gif if it exists in the profile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If (Q)uit is selected at this point, aa-logprof will ignore all new pending
  accesses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After all of the accesses have been handled, logrof will write all updated
  profiles to the disk and reload them if AppArmor is running.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_Process_(Execution)_Events"><a class="selflink" href="#New_Process_(Execution)_Events">New
  Process (Execution) Events</a></h2>
If there are unhandled x accesses generated by the <i>execve</i>(2) of a new
  process, aa-logprof will display the parent profile and the target program
  that's being executed and prompt the user to select an execute modifier. These
  modifiers will allow a choice for the target to: have it's own profile (px),
  inherit the parent's profile (ix), run unconstrained (ux), or deny access for
  the target. See <i>apparmor.d</i>(5) for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is a corresponding entry for the target in the qualifiers section of
  /etc/apparmor/logprof.conf, the presented list will contain only the allowed
  modes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default option for this question is selected using this logic--
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  # if px mode is allowed and profile exists for the target
  #   px is default.
  # else if ix mode is allowed
  #   ix is default
  # else
  #   deny is default
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
aa-logprof will never suggest &quot;ux&quot; as the default.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ChangeHat_Events"><a class="selflink" href="#ChangeHat_Events">ChangeHat
  Events</a></h2>
If unknown <i>aa_change_hat</i>(2) events are found, the user is prompted to add
  a new hat, if the events should go into the default hat for this profile based
  on the corresponding entry in the defaulthat section of logprof.conf, or if
  the following events that run under that hat should be denied altogether.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Capability_Events"><a class="selflink" href="#Capability_Events">Capability
  Events</a></h2>
If there are capability accesses, the user is shown each capability access and
  asked if the capability should be allowed, denied, or if the user wants to
  quit. See <i>capability</i>(7) for details.
