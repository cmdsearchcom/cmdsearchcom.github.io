<i>xfsdump</i> backs up files and their attributes in a filesystem. The files
  are dumped to storage media, a regular file, or standard output. Options allow
  the operator to have all files dumped, just files that have changed since a
  previous dump, or just files contained in a list of pathnames.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>xfsrestore</i>(8) utility re-populates a filesystem with the contents of
  the dump.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each invocation of <i>xfsdump</i> dumps just one filesystem. That invocation is
  termed a dump session. The dump session splits the filesystem into one or more
  dump streams, one per destination. The split is done in filesystem inode
  number (ino) order, at boundaries selected to equalize the size of each
  stream. Furthermore, the breakpoints between streams may be in the middle of
  very large files (at extent boundaries) if necessary to achieve reasonable
  stream size equalization. Each dump stream can span several media objects, and
  a single media object can contain several dump streams. The typical media
  object is a tape cartridge. The media object records the dump stream as one or
  more media files. A media file is a self-contained partial dump, intended to
  minimize the impact of media dropouts on the entire dump stream at the expense
  of increasing the time required to complete the dump. By default only one
  media file is written unless a media file size is specified using the
  <b>-d</b> option. Other techniques, such as making a second copy of the dump
  image, provide more protection against media failures than multiple media
  files will.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>xfsdump</i> maintains an online dump inventory in
  <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>. The <b>-I</b> option displays the inventory
  contents hierarchically. The levels of the hierarchy are: filesystem, dump
  session, stream, and media file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options to <i>xfsdump</i> are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies that files for which the Data Migration Facility
      (DMF) has complete offline copies (dual-state files) be treated as if they
      were offline (OFL). This means that the file data will not be dumped by
      xfsdump, resulting in a smaller dump file. If the file is later restored
      the file data is still accessible through DMF. If both '-a option' and '-z
      option' are specified, the '-a option' takes precedence (see '-z option'
      below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b> <i>blocksize</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be used for the dump.
      The same blocksize must be specified to restore the tape. If the <b>-m</b>
      option is not used, then <b>-b</b> does not need to be specified. Instead,
      a default blocksize of 1Mb will be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b> <i>progname</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the specified program to alert the operator when a
      media change is required. The alert program is typically a script to send
      a mail or flash a window to draw the operator's attention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b> <i>filesize</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the size, in megabytes, of dump media files. If
      not specified, xfsdump will dump data to tape using a single media file
      per media object. The specified media file size may need to be adjusted
      if, for example, xfsdump cannot fit a media file onto a single tape.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Allow files to be excluded from the dump. This will cause
      xfsdump to skip files which have the &quot;no dump&quot; file attribute
      set. See the &quot;Excluding individual files&quot; section below for
      details on setting this file attribute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b> <i>dest</i> [ <b>-f</b> <i>dest</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies a dump destination. A dump destination can be the
      pathname of a device (such as a tape drive), a regular file or a remote
      tape drive (see <i>rmt</i>(8)). This option must be omitted if the
      standard output option (a lone <b>-</b> preceding the source filesystem
      specification) is specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b> <i>level</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies a dump level of 0 to 9. The dump level determines
      the base dump to which this dump is relative. The base dump is the most
      recent dump at a lesser level. A level 0 dump is absolute - all files are
      dumped. A dump level where 1 &lt;= <i>level</i> &lt;= 9 is referred to as
      an incremental dump. Only files that have been changed since the base dump
      are dumped. Subtree dumps (see the <b>-s</b> option below) cannot be used
      as the base for incremental dumps.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the minimal tape protocol for non-scsi tape
      destinations or remote tape destinations which are not scsi Linux tape
      drives nor IRIX tape drives. This option cannot be used without specifying
      a blocksize to be used (see <b>-b</b> option above).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Overwrite the tape. With this option, <i>xfsdump</i> does
      not read the tape first to check the contents. This option may be used if
      <i>xfsdump</i> is unable to determine the block size of a tape .</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b> <i>interval</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes progress reports to be printed at the specified
      interval. <i>interval</i> is given in seconds. The progress report
      indicates how many files have been dumped, the total number of files to
      dump, the percentage of data dumped, and the elapsed time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Destination tape drive is a QIC tape. QIC tapes only use a
      512 byte blocksize, for which <i>xfsdump</i> must make special
    allowances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b> <i>pathname</i> [ <b>-s</b> <i>pathname</i> ...
    ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Restricts the dump to files contained in the specified
      pathnames (subtrees). A <i>pathname</i> must be relative to the mount
      point of the filesystem. For example, if a filesystem is mounted at
      <i>/d2</i>, the <i>pathname</i> argument for the directory
      <i>/d2/users</i> is ``users''. A <i>pathname</i> can be a file or a
      directory; if it is a directory, the entire hierarchy of files and
      subdirectories rooted at that directory is dumped. Subtree dumps cannot be
      used as the base for incremental dumps (see the <b>-l</b> option
    above).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b> <i>file</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the dump time to the modification time of <i>file</i>
      rather than using the current time. <i>xfsdump</i> uses the dump time to
      determine what files need to be backed up during an incremental dump. This
      option should be used when dumping snapshots so that the dump time matches
      the time the snapshot was taken. Otherwise files modified after a snapshot
      is taken may be skipped in the next incremental dump.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b> <i>verbosity</i></dt>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b>
    <i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>[,<i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>,...]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed
      during the course of the dump. The <i>verbosity</i> argument can be passed
      as either a string or an integer. If passed as a string the following
      values may be used: <b>silent</b>, <b>verbose</b>, <b>trace</b>,
      <b>debug</b>, or <b>nitty</b>. If passed as an integer, values from 0-5
      may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to the strings already listed. The
      value 5 can be used to produce even more verbose debug output.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first form of this option activates message logging across all dump
      subsystems. The second form allows the message logging level to be
      controlled on a per-subsystem basis. The two forms can be combined (see
      the example below). The argument <i>subsys</i> can take one of the
      following values: <b>general</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>drive</b>, <b>media</b>,
      <b>inventory</b>, <b>inomap</b> and <b>excluded_files</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, to dump the root filesystem with tracing activated for all
      subsystems:
    <br/>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
# xfsdump -v trace -f /dev/tape /
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
    To enable debug-level tracing for drive and media operations:
    <br/>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
# xfsdump -v drive=debug,media=debug -f /dev/tape /
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
    To enable tracing for all subsystems, and debug level tracing for drive
      operations only:
    <br/>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
# xfsdump -v trace,drive=debug -f /dev/tape /
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
    To list files that will be excluded from the dump:
    <br/>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
# xfsdump -e -v excluded_files=debug -f /dev/tape /
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-z</b> <i>size</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the maximum size, in kilobytes, of files to be
      included in the dump. Files over this size, will be excluded from the
      dump, except for DMF dual-state files when '-a option' is specified (see
      '-a option' above). When specified, '-a option' takes precedence over '-z
      option'. The size is an estimate based on the number of disk blocks
      actually used by the file, and so does not include holes. In other words,
      size refers to the amount of space the file would take in the resulting
      dump. On an interactive restore, the skipped file is visible with
      xfsrestore's 'ls' and while you can use the 'add' and 'extract' commands,
      nothing will be restored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-A</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not dump extended file attributes. When dumping a
      filesystem managed within a DMF environment this option should not be
      used. DMF stores file migration status within extended attributes
      associated with each file. If these attributes are not preserved when the
      filesystem is restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be
      recallable by DMF. Note that dumps containing extended file attributes
      cannot be restored with older versions of <i>xfsrestore</i>(8).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-B</b> <i>session_id</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the ID of the dump session upon which this dump
      session is to be based. If this option is specified, the <b>-l</b> (level)
      and <b>-R</b> (resume) options are not allowed. Instead, <b>xfsdump</b>
      determines if the current dump session should be incremental and/or
      resumed, by looking at the base session's level and interrupted
      attributes. If the base session was interrupted, the current dump session
      is a resumption of that base at the same level. Otherwise, the current
      dump session is an incremental dump with a level one greater than that of
      the base session. This option allows incremental and resumed dumps to be
      based on any previous dump, rather than just the most recent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Controls which directories are backed up during an
      incremental dump. By default unchanged directories are dumped if files or
      directories beneath them have changed. This results in a self-contained
      dump -- if a base dump is lost, or you know the file(s) you wish to
      restore is in an incremental dump, you can restore just that dump without
      loading the base dump(s) first. However, this method requires a
      potentially expensive traversal through the filesystem.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <b>-D</b> is specified, unchanged directories are not dumped. This
      results in a faster dump, but files will end up in the

<div class="Pp"></div>
The filesystem, <i>filesystem</i>, can be specified either as a mount point or
  as a special device file (for example, <i>/dev/dsk/dks0d1s0</i>). The
  filesystem must be mounted to be dumped.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Dump_Interruption"><a class="selflink" href="#Dump_Interruption">Dump
  Interruption</a></h2>
A dump can be interrupted at any time and later resumed. To interrupt, type
  control-C (or the current terminal interrupt character). The operator is
  prompted to select one of several operations, including dump interruption.
  After the operator selects dump interruption, the dump continues until a
  convenient break point is encountered (typically the end of the current file).
  Very large files are broken into smaller subfiles, so the wait for the end of
  the current file is brief.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Dump_Resumption"><a class="selflink" href="#Dump_Resumption">Dump
  Resumption</a></h2>
A previously interrupted dump can be resumed by specifying the <b>-R</b> option.
  If the most recent dump at the specified level was interrupted, the new dump
  does not include files already dumped, unless they have changed since the
  interrupted dump.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Media_Management"><a class="selflink" href="#Media_Management">Media
  Management</a></h2>
A single media object can contain many dump streams. Conversely, a single dump
  stream can span multiple media objects. If a dump stream is sent to a media
  object already containing one or more dumps, <i>xfsdump</i> appends the new
  dump stream after the last dump stream. Media files are never overwritten. If
  end-of-media is encountered during the course of a dump, the operator is
  prompted to insert a new media object into the drive. The dump stream
  continuation is appended after the last media file on the new media object.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Inventory"><a class="selflink" href="#Inventory">Inventory</a></h2>
Each dump session updates an inventory database in
  <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>. <i>xfsdump</i> uses the inventory to
  determine the base of incremental and resumed dumps.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This database can be displayed by invoking <i>xfsdump</i> with the <b>-I</b>
  option. The display uses tabbed indentation to present the inventory
  hierarchically. The first level is filesystem. The second level is session.
  The third level is media stream (currently only one stream is supported). The
  fourth level lists the media files sequentially composing the stream.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following suboptions are available to filter the display.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I depth=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(where <i>n</i> is 1, 2, or 3) limits the hierarchical
      depth of the display. When <i>n</i> is 1, only the filesystem information
      from the inventory is displayed. When <i>n</i> is 2, only filesystem and
      session information are displayed. When <i>n</i> is 3, only filesystem,
      session and stream information are displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I level=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(where <i>n</i> is the dump level) limits the display to
      dumps of that particular dump level.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The display may be restricted to media files contained in a specific media
  object.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I mobjid=</b><i>value</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(where <i>value</i> is a media ID) specifies the media
      object by its media ID.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I mobjlabel=</b><i>value</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(where <i>value</i> is a media label) specifies the media
      object by its media label.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, the display can be restricted to a specific filesystem.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I mnt=</b><i>mount_point</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(that is, [hostname:]pathname), identifies the filesystem
      by mountpoint. Specifying the hostname is optional, but may be useful in a
      clustered environment where more than one host can be responsible for
      dumping a filesystem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I fsid=</b><i>filesystem_id</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">identifies the filesystem by filesystem ID.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I dev=</b><i>device_pathname</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(that is, [hostname:]device_pathname) identifies the
      filesystem by device. As with the <b>mnt</b> filter, specifying the
      hostname is optional.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
More than one of these suboptions, separated by commas, may be specified at the
  same time to limit the display of the inventory to those dumps of interest.
  However, at most four suboptions can be specified at once: one to constrain
  the display hierarchy depth, one to constrain the dump level, one to constrain
  the media object, and one to constrain the filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, <b>-I depth=1,mobjlabel=&quot;tape 1&quot;,mnt=host1:/test_mnt</b>
  would display only the filesystem information (depth=1) for those filesystems
  that were mounted on <i>host1:/test_mnt</i> at the time of the dump, and only
  those filesystems dumped to the media object labeled &quot;tape 1&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dump records may be removed (pruned) from the inventory using the
  <i>xfsinvutil</i> program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An additional media file is placed at the end of each dump stream. This media
  file contains the inventory information for the current dump session. Its
  contents may be merged back into the online inventory database at a later time
  using <i>xfsrestore</i>(1M).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The inventory files stored in <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> are not included in the
  dump, even if that directory is contained within the filesystem being dumped.
  Including the inventory in the dump may lead to loss or corruption of data,
  should an older version be restored overwriting the current version. To backup
  the <i>xfsdump</i> inventory, the contents of <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> should
  be copied to another location which may then be safely dumped. Upon
  restoration, those files may be copied back into <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i>,
  overwriting whatever files may be there, or <i>xfsinvutil</i>(1M) may be used
  to selectively merge parts of the restored inventory back into the current
  inventory. Prior to version 1.1.8, <i>xfsdump</i> would include the
  <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> directory in the dump. Care should be taken not to
  overwrite the <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> directory when restoring an old dump, by
  either restoring the filesystem to another location or by copying the current
  contents of <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> to a safe place prior to running
  <i>xfsrestore</i>(1M).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Labels"><a class="selflink" href="#Labels">Labels</a></h2>
The operator can specify a label to identify the dump session and a label to
  identify a media object. The session label is placed in every media file
  produced in the course of the dump, and is recorded in the inventory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The media label is used to identify media objects, and is independent of the
  session label. Each media file on the media object contains a copy of the
  media label. An error is returned if the operator specifies a media label that
  does not match the media label on a media object containing valid media files.
  Media labels are recorded in the inventory.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="UUIDs"><a class="selflink" href="#UUIDs">UUIDs</a></h2>
UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are used in three places: to identify the
  filesystem being dumped (using the filesystem UUID, see <i>xfs</i>(5) for more
  details), to identify the dump session, and to identify each media object. The
  inventory display ( <b>-I</b>) includes all of these.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Dump_Level_Usage"><a class="selflink" href="#Dump_Level_Usage">Dump
  Level Usage</a></h2>
The dump level mechanism provides a structured form of incremental dumps. A dump
  of level <i>level</i> includes only files that have changed since the most
  recent dump at a level less than <i>level</i>. For example, the operator can
  establish a dump schedule that involves a full dump every Friday and a daily
  incremental dump containing only files that have changed since the previous
  dump. In this case Friday's dump would be at level 0, Saturday's at level 1,
  Sunday's at level 2, and so on, up to the Thursday dump at level 6.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above schedule results in a very tedious restore procedure to fully
  reconstruct the Thursday version of the filesystem; <i>xfsrestore</i> would
  need to be fed all 7 dumps in sequence. A compromise schedule is to use level
  1 on Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday, and level 2 on Sunday, Tuesday, and
  Thursday. The Monday and Wednesday dumps would take longer, but the worst case
  restore requires the accumulation of just three dumps, one each at level 0,
  level 1, and level 2.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Quotas"><a class="selflink" href="#Quotas">Quotas</a></h2>
If the filesystem being dumped contains user quotas, <i>xfsdump</i> will use
  <i>xfs_quota</i>(8) to store the quotas in a file called <i>xfsdump_quotas</i>
  in the root of the filesystem to be dumped. This file will then be included in
  the dump. Upon restoration, <i>xfs_quota (8)</i> can be used to reactivate the
  quotas for the filesystem. Note, however, that the <i>xfsdump_quotas</i> file
  will probably require modification to change the filesystem or UIDs if the
  filesystem has been restored to a different partition or system. Group and
  project quotas will be handled in a similar fashion and saved in files called
  <i>xfsdump_quotas_group</i> and <i>xfsdump_quotas_proj ,</i> respectively.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Excluding_individual_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Excluding_individual_files">Excluding
  individual files</a></h2>
It may be desirable to exclude particular files or directories from the dump.
  The <b>-s</b> option can be used to limit the dump to a specified directory,
  and the <b>-z</b> option can be used to exclude files over a particular size.
  Additionally, when <i>xfsdump</i> is run with the <b>-e</b> option, files that
  are tagged with the &quot;no dump&quot; file attribute will not be included in
  the dump. The <i>chattr</i>(1) command can be used to set this attribute on
  individual files or entire subtrees.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To tag an individual file for exclusion from the dump:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
$ chattr +d file
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
To tag all files in a subtree for exclusion from the dump:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
$ chattr -R +d directory
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
Note that any new files or directories created in a directory which has the
  &quot;no dump&quot; attribute set will automatically inherit this attribute.
  Also note that <i>xfsdump</i> does not check directories for the &quot;no
  dump&quot; attribute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Care should be taken to note which files have been tagged. Under normal
  operation, <i>xfsdump</i> will only report the number of files it will skip.
  The <b>-v excluded_files=debug</b> option, however, will cause <i>xfsdump</i>
  to list the inode numbers of the individual files affected.

To perform a level 0, single stream dump of the root filesystem to a locally
  mounted tape drive, prompting for session and media labels when required:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
# xfsdump -f /dev/tape /
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
To specify session and media labels explicitly:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
# xfsdump -L session_1 -M tape_0 -f /dev/tape /
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
To perform a dump to a remote tape using the minimal rmt protocol and a set
  blocksize of 64k:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
# xfsdump -m -b 65536 -f otherhost:/dev/tape /
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
To perform a level 0, multi-stream dump to two locally mounted tape drives:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
# xfsdump -L session_2 -f /dev/rmt/tps4d6v -M tape_1 \
          -f /dev/rmt/tps5d6v -M tape_2 /
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
To perform a level 1 dump relative to the last level 0 dump recorded in the
  inventory:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
# xfsdump -l 1 -f /dev/tape /
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
To copy the contents of a filesystem to another directory (see
  <i>xfsrestore</i>(8)):
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
# xfsdump -J - / | xfsrestore -J - /new

The exit code is 0 on normal completion, non-zero if an error occurs or the dump
  is terminated by the operator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For all verbosity levels greater than 0 ( <b>silent</b>) the final line of the
  output shows the exit status of the dump. It is of the form:
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
xfsdump: Dump Status:  <i>code</i>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
Where <i>code</i> takes one of the following values: <b>SUCCESS</b> (normal
  completion), <b>INTERRUPT</b> (interrupted), <b>QUIT</b> (media no longer
  usable), <b>INCOMPLETE</b> (dump incomplete), <b>FAULT</b> (software error),
  and <b>ERROR</b> (resource error). Every attempt will be made to keep both the
  syntax and the semantics of this log message unchanged in future versions of
  xfsdump. However, it may be necessary to refine or expand the set of exit
  codes, or their interpretation at some point in the future.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The message ``xfsdump: WARNING: unable to open directory: ino N: Invalid
  argument'' can occur with filesystems which are actively being modified while
  <i>xfsdump</i> is running. This can happen to either directory or regular file
  inodes - affected files will not end up in the dump, files below affected
  directories will be placed in the <i>orphanage</i> directory by
  <i>xfsrestore</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<i>xfsdump</i> does not dump unmounted filesystems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The dump frequency field of <i>/etc/fstab</i> is not supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>xfsdump</i> uses the alert program only when a media change is required.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>xfsdump</i> requires root privilege (except for inventory display).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>xfsdump</i> can only dump XFS filesystems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The media format used by <i>xfsdump</i> can only be understood by
  <i>xfsrestore</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>xfsdump</i> does not know how to manage CD-ROM or other removable disk
  drives.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>xfsdump</i> can become confused when doing incremental or resumed dumps if on
  the same machine you dump two XFS filesystems and both filesystems have the
  same filesystem identifier (UUID). Since <i>xfsdump</i> uses the filesystem
  identifier to identify filesystems, <i>xfsdump</i> maintains one combined set
  of dump inventories for both filesystems instead of two sets of dump
  inventories. This scenario can happen only if <i>dd</i> or some other
  block-by-block copy program was used to make a copy of an XFS filesystem. See
  <i>xfs_copy</i>(8) and <i>xfs</i>(5) for more details.</div>
