<p>xfsdump(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual xfsdump(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfsdump - XFS filesystem incremental dump utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfsdump -h <br>
xfsdump [ options ] -f dest [ -f dest ... ] filesystem <br>
xfsdump [ options ] - filesystem <br>
xfsdump -I [ subopt=value ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfsdump backs up files and their attributes in a filesystem.
The files are dumped to storage media, a regular file, or
standard output. Options allow the operator to have all <br>
files dumped, just files that have changed since a previous
dump, or just files contained in a list of pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xfsrestore(8) utility
re-populates a filesystem with the contents of the dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each invocation of xfsdump dumps
just one filesystem. That invocation is termed a dump
session. The dump session splits the filesystem into one or
more dump streams, one per <br>
destination. The split is done in filesystem inode number
(ino) order, at boundaries selected to equalize the size of
each stream. Furthermore, the breakpoints between streams
<br>
may be in the middle of very large files (at extent
boundaries) if necessary to achieve reasonable stream size
equalization. Each dump stream can span several media
objects, and <br>
a single media object can contain several dump streams. The
typical media object is a tape cartridge. The media object
records the dump stream as one or more media files. A <br>
media file is a self-contained partial dump, intended to
minimize the impact of media dropouts on the entire dump
stream at the expense of increasing the time required to
com&acirc; <br>
plete the dump. By default only one media file is written
unless a media file size is specified using the -d option.
Other techniques, such as making a second copy of the dump
<br>
image, provide more protection against media failures than
multiple media files will.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump maintains an online dump
inventory in /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory. The -I option
displays the inventory contents hierarchically. The levels
of the hierarchy are: <br>
filesystem, dump session, stream, and media file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options to xfsdump are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Specifies that files for
which the Data Migration Facility (DMF) has complete offline
copies (dual-state files) be treated as if they were offline
(OFL). This means that <br>
the file data will not be dumped by xfsdump, resulting in a
smaller dump file. If the file is later restored the file
data is still accessible through DMF. If both &rsquo;-a <br>
option&rsquo; and &rsquo;-z option&rsquo; are specified, the
&rsquo;-a option&rsquo; takes precedence (see &rsquo;-z
option&rsquo; below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be used for the dump.
The same blocksize must be specified to restore the tape. If
the -m option is not used, then -b does not need <br>
to be specified. Instead, a default blocksize of 1Mb will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c progname <br>
Use the specified program to alert the operator when a media
change is required. The alert program is typically a script
to send a mail or flash a window to draw the opera&acirc;
<br>
tor&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d filesize <br>
Specifies the size, in megabytes, of dump media files. If
not specified, xfsdump will dump data to tape using a single
media file per media object. The specified media <br>
file size may need to be adjusted if, for example, xfsdump
cannot fit a media file onto a single tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Allow files to be excluded
from the dump. This will cause xfsdump to skip files which
have the &quot;no dump&quot; file attribute set. See the
&quot;Excluding individual files&quot; section <br>
below for details on setting this file attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f dest [ -f dest ... ] <br>
Specifies a dump destination. A dump destination can be the
pathname of a device (such as a tape drive), a regular file
or a remote tape drive (see rmt(8)). This option <br>
must be omitted if the standard output option (a lone -
preceding the source filesystem specification) is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l level <br>
Specifies a dump level of 0 to 9. The dump level determines
the base dump to which this dump is relative. The base dump
is the most recent dump at a lesser level. A level <br>
0 dump is absolute - all files are dumped. A dump level
where 1 &lt;= level &lt;= 9 is referred to as an incremental
dump. Only files that have been changed since the base dump
<br>
are dumped. Subtree dumps (see the -s option below) cannot
be used as the base for incremental dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Use the minimal tape protocol
for non-scsi tape destinations or remote tape destinations
which are not scsi Linux tape drives nor IRIX tape drives.
This option cannot be <br>
used without specifying a blocksize to be used (see -b
option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Overwrite the tape. With this
option, xfsdump does not read the tape first to check the
contents. This option may be used if xfsdump is unable to
determine the block size of <br>
a tape .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p interval <br>
Causes progress reports to be printed at the specified
interval. interval is given in seconds. The progress report
indicates how many files have been dumped, the total <br>
number of files to dump, the percentage of data dumped, and
the elapsed time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Destination tape drive is a
QIC tape. QIC tapes only use a 512 byte blocksize, for which
xfsdump must make special allowances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s pathname [ -s pathname ... ]
<br>
Restricts the dump to files contained in the specified
pathnames (subtrees). A pathname must be relative to the
mount point of the filesystem. For example, if a filesystem
<br>
is mounted at /d2, the pathname argument for the directory
/d2/users is &lsquo;&lsquo;users&rsquo;&rsquo;. A pathname
can be a file or a directory; if it is a directory, the
entire hierarchy of <br>
files and subdirectories rooted at that directory is dumped.
Subtree dumps cannot be used as the base for incremental
dumps (see the -l option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t file <br>
Sets the dump time to the modification time of file rather
than using the current time. xfsdump uses the dump time to
determine what files need to be backed up during an <br>
incremental dump. This option should be used when dumping
snapshots so that the dump time matches the time the
snapshot was taken. Otherwise files modified after a
snapshot <br>
is taken may be skipped in the next incremental dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbosity <br>
-v subsys=verbosity[,subsys=verbosity,...] <br>
Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed
during the course of the dump. The verbosity argument can be
passed as either a string or an integer. If passed as <br>
a string the following values may be used: silent, verbose,
trace, debug, or nitty. If passed as an integer, values from
0-5 may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to the <br>
strings already listed. The value 5 can be used to produce
even more verbose debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form of this option
activates message logging across all dump subsystems. The
second form allows the message logging level to be
controlled on a per-subsystem <br>
basis. The two forms can be combined (see the example
below). The argument subsys can take one of the following
values: general, proc, drive, media, inventory, inomap and
<br>
excluded_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to dump the root
filesystem with tracing activated for all subsystems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -v trace -f /dev/tape
/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable debug-level tracing
for drive and media operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -v
drive=debug,media=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable tracing for all
subsystems, and debug level tracing for drive operations
only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -v trace,drive=debug
-f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list files that will be
excluded from the dump:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -e -v
excluded_files=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z size <br>
Specifies the maximum size, in kilobytes, of files to be
included in the dump. Files over this size, will be excluded
from the dump, except for DMF dual-state files when <br>
&rsquo;-a option&rsquo; is specified (see &rsquo;-a
option&rsquo; above). When specified, &rsquo;-a
option&rsquo; takes precedence over &rsquo;-z option&rsquo;.
The size is an estimate based on the number of disk blocks
<br>
actually used by the file, and so does not include holes. In
other words, size refers to the amount of space the file
would take in the resulting dump. On an interactive <br>
restore, the skipped file is visible with xfsrestore&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ls&rsquo; and while you can use the &rsquo;add&rsquo;
and &rsquo;extract&rsquo; commands, nothing will be
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Do not dump extended file
attributes. When dumping a filesystem managed within a DMF
environment this option should not be used. DMF stores file
migration status within <br>
extended attributes associated with each file. If these
attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be
<br>
recallable by DMF. Note that dumps containing extended file
attributes cannot be restored with older versions of
xfsrestore(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B session_id <br>
Specifies the ID of the dump session upon which this dump
session is to be based. If this option is specified, the -l
(level) and -R (resume) options are not allowed. <br>
Instead, xfsdump determines if the current dump session
should be incremental and/or resumed, by looking at the base
session&rsquo;s level and interrupted attributes. If the
base <br>
session was interrupted, the current dump session is a
resumption of that base at the same level. Otherwise, the
current dump session is an incremental dump with a level
<br>
one greater than that of the base session. This option
allows incremental and resumed dumps to be based on any
previous dump, rather than just the most recent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Controls which directories
are backed up during an incremental dump. By default
unchanged directories are dumped if files or directories
beneath them have changed. This <br>
results in a self-contained dump -- if a base dump is lost,
or you know the file(s) you wish to restore is in an
incremental dump, you can restore just that dump without
<br>
loading the base dump(s) first. However, this method
requires a potentially expensive traversal through the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -D is specified, unchanged
directories are not dumped. This results in a faster dump,
but files will end up in the xfsrestore(8) orphanage
directory unless the base <br>
dump(s) is loaded first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Pre-erase media. If this
option is specified, media is erased prior to use. The
operator is prompted for confirmation, unless the -F option
is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Don&rsquo;t prompt the
operator. When xfsdump encounters a media object containing
non-xfsdump data, xfsdump normally asks the operator for
permission to overwrite. With this <br>
option the overwrite is performed, no questions asked. When
xfsdump encounters end-of-media during a dump, xfsdump
normally asks the operator if another media object will <br>
be provided. With this option the dump is instead
interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Displays the xfsdump
inventory (no dump is performed). xfsdump records each dump
session in an online inventory in
/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory. xfsdump uses this inventory <br>
to determine the base for incremental dumps. It is also
useful for manually identifying a dump session to be
restored. Suboptions to filter the inventory display are
<br>
described later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Inhibits the normal update of
the inventory. This is useful when the media being dumped to
will be discarded or overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Generate a format 2 dump
instead of the current format. This is useful if the dump
will be restored on a system with an older xfsrestore which
does not understand the cur&acirc; <br>
rent dump format. Use of this option is otherwise not
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L session_label <br>
Specifies a label for the dump session. It can be any
arbitrary string up to 255 characters long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M label [ -M label ... ] <br>
Specifies a label for the first media object (for example,
tape cartridge) written on the corresponding destination
during the session. It can be any arbitrary string up to
<br>
255 characters long. Multiple media object labels can be
specified, one for each destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O options_file <br>
Insert the options contained in options_file into the
beginning of the command line. The options are specified
just as they would appear if typed into the command line. In
<br>
addition, newline characters (0 can be used as whitespace.
The options are placed before all options actually given on
the command line, just after the command name. <br>
Only one -O option can be used. Recursive use is ignored.
The source filesystem cannot be specified in
options_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Resumes a previously
interrupted dump session. If the most recent dump at this
dump&rsquo;s level (-l option) was interrupted, this dump
contains only files not in the inter&acirc; <br>
rupted dump and consistent with the incremental level.
However, files contained in the interrupted dump that have
been subsequently modified are re-dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Inhibits interactive dialogue
timeouts. When the -F option is not specified, xfsdump
prompts the operator for labels and media changes. Each
dialogue normally times out if <br>
no response is supplied. This option prevents the
timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y length <br>
Specify I/O buffer ring length. xfsdump uses a ring of
output buffers to achieve maximum throughput when dumping to
tape drives. The default ring length is 3. However, <br>
this is not currently enabled on Linux yet, making this
option benign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A lone - causes the dump
stream to be sent to the standard output, where it can be
piped to another utility such as xfsrestore(8) or redirected
to a file. This option can&acirc; <br>
not be used with the -f option. The - must follow all other
options and precede the filesystem specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem, filesystem, can
be specified either as a mount point or as a special device
file (for example, /dev/dsk/dks0d1s0). The filesystem must
be mounted to be dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Dump Interruption <br>
A dump can be interrupted at any time and later resumed. To
interrupt, type control-C (or the current terminal interrupt
character). The operator is prompted to select one of <br>
several operations, including dump interruption. After the
operator selects dump interruption, the dump continues until
a convenient break point is encountered (typically the <br>
end of the current file). Very large files are broken into
smaller subfiles, so the wait for the end of the current
file is brief.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump Resumption <br>
A previously interrupted dump can be resumed by specifying
the -R option. If the most recent dump at the specified
level was interrupted, the new dump does not include files
<br>
already dumped, unless they have changed since the
interrupted dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media Management <br>
A single media object can contain many dump streams.
Conversely, a single dump stream can span multiple media
objects. If a dump stream is sent to a media object already
con&acirc; <br>
taining one or more dumps, xfsdump appends the new dump
stream after the last dump stream. Media files are never
overwritten. If end-of-media is encountered during the
course <br>
of a dump, the operator is prompted to insert a new media
object into the drive. The dump stream continuation is
appended after the last media file on the new media
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inventory <br>
Each dump session updates an inventory database in
/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory. xfsdump uses the inventory to
determine the base of incremental and resumed dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This database can be displayed
by invoking xfsdump with the -I option. The display uses
tabbed indentation to present the inventory hierarchically.
The first level is filesys&acirc; <br>
tem. The second level is session. The third level is media
stream (currently only one stream is supported). The fourth
level lists the media files sequentially composing the <br>
stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following suboptions are
available to filter the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I depth=n <br>
(where n is 1, 2, or 3) limits the hierarchical depth of the
display. When n is 1, only the filesystem information from
the inventory is displayed. When n is 2, only <br>
filesystem and session information are displayed. When n is
3, only filesystem, session and stream information are
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I level=n <br>
(where n is the dump level) limits the display to dumps of
that particular dump level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The display may be restricted to
media files contained in a specific media object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I mobjid=value <br>
(where value is a media ID) specifies the media object by
its media ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I mobjlabel=value <br>
(where value is a media label) specifies the media object by
its media label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the display can be
restricted to a specific filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I mnt=mount_point <br>
(that is, [hostname:]pathname), identifies the filesystem by
mountpoint. Specifying the hostname is optional, but may be
useful in a clustered environment where more than <br>
one host can be responsible for dumping a filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I fsid=filesystem_id <br>
identifies the filesystem by filesystem ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dev=device_pathname <br>
(that is, [hostname:]device_pathname) identifies the
filesystem by device. As with the mnt filter, specifying the
hostname is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More than one of these
suboptions, separated by commas, may be specified at the
same time to limit the display of the inventory to those
dumps of interest. However, at most four <br>
suboptions can be specified at once: one to constrain the
display hierarchy depth, one to constrain the dump level,
one to constrain the media object, and one to constrain the
<br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -I
depth=1,mobjlabel=&quot;tape 1&quot;,mnt=host1:/test_mnt
would display only the filesystem information (depth=1) for
those filesystems that were mounted on host1:/test_mnt <br>
at the time of the dump, and only those filesystems dumped
to the media object labeled &quot;tape 1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump records may be removed
(pruned) from the inventory using the xfsinvutil
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An additional media file is
placed at the end of each dump stream. This media file
contains the inventory information for the current dump
session. Its contents may be merged <br>
back into the online inventory database at a later time
using xfsrestore(1M).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inventory files stored in
/var/lib/xfsdump are not included in the dump, even if that
directory is contained within the filesystem being dumped.
Including the inventory in <br>
the dump may lead to loss or corruption of data, should an
older version be restored overwriting the current version.
To backup the xfsdump inventory, the contents of <br>
/var/lib/xfsdump should be copied to another location which
may then be safely dumped. Upon restoration, those files may
be copied back into /var/lib/xfsdump, overwriting
what&acirc; <br>
ever files may be there, or xfsinvutil(1M) may be used to
selectively merge parts of the restored inventory back into
the current inventory. Prior to version 1.1.8, xfsdump <br>
would include the /var/lib/xfsdump directory in the dump.
Care should be taken not to overwrite the /var/lib/xfsdump
directory when restoring an old dump, by either restoring
<br>
the filesystem to another location or by copying the current
contents of /var/lib/xfsdump to a safe place prior to
running xfsrestore(1M).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Labels <br>
The operator can specify a label to identify the dump
session and a label to identify a media object. The session
label is placed in every media file produced in the course
of <br>
the dump, and is recorded in the inventory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The media label is used to
identify media objects, and is independent of the session
label. Each media file on the media object contains a copy
of the media label. An error is <br>
returned if the operator specifies a media label that does
not match the media label on a media object containing valid
media files. Media labels are recorded in the inventory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUIDs <br>
UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are used in three
places: to identify the filesystem being dumped (using the
filesystem UUID, see xfs(5) for more details), to identify
the <br>
dump session, and to identify each media object. The
inventory display (-I) includes all of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump Level Usage <br>
The dump level mechanism provides a structured form of
incremental dumps. A dump of level level includes only files
that have changed since the most recent dump at a level less
<br>
than level. For example, the operator can establish a dump
schedule that involves a full dump every Friday and a daily
incremental dump containing only files that have changed
<br>
since the previous dump. In this case Friday&rsquo;s dump
would be at level 0, Saturday&rsquo;s at level 1,
Sunday&rsquo;s at level 2, and so on, up to the Thursday
dump at level 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above schedule results in a
very tedious restore procedure to fully reconstruct the
Thursday version of the filesystem; xfsrestore would need to
be fed all 7 dumps in <br>
sequence. A compromise schedule is to use level 1 on
Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday, and level 2 on Sunday,
Tuesday, and Thursday. The Monday and Wednesday dumps would
take <br>
longer, but the worst case restore requires the accumulation
of just three dumps, one each at level 0, level 1, and level
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quotas <br>
If the filesystem being dumped contains user quotas, xfsdump
will use xfs_quota(8) to store the quotas in a file called
xfsdump_quotas in the root of the filesystem to be dumped.
<br>
This file will then be included in the dump. Upon
restoration, xfs_quota (8) can be used to reactivate the
quotas for the filesystem. Note, however, that the
xfsdump_quotas <br>
file will probably require modification to change the
filesystem or UIDs if the filesystem has been restored to a
different partition or system. Group and project quotas will
be <br>
handled in a similar fashion and saved in files called
xfsdump_quotas_group and xfsdump_quotas_proj ,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excluding individual files <br>
It may be desirable to exclude particular files or
directories from the dump. The -s option can be used to
limit the dump to a specified directory, and the -z option
can be used <br>
to exclude files over a particular size. Additionally, when
xfsdump is run with the -e option, files that are tagged
with the &quot;no dump&quot; file attribute will not be
included in <br>
the dump. The chattr(1) command can be used to set this
attribute on individual files or entire subtrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To tag an individual file for
exclusion from the dump:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ chattr +d file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To tag all files in a subtree
for exclusion from the dump:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ chattr -R +d directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that any new files or
directories created in a directory which has the &quot;no
dump&quot; attribute set will automatically inherit this
attribute. Also note that xfsdump does not <br>
check directories for the &quot;no dump&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken to note
which files have been tagged. Under normal operation,
xfsdump will only report the number of files it will skip.
The -v excluded_files=debug <br>
option, however, will cause xfsdump to list the inode
numbers of the individual files affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To perform a level 0, single stream dump of the root
filesystem to a locally mounted tape drive, prompting for
session and media labels when required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify session and media
labels explicitly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -L session_1 -M tape_0
-f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To perform a dump to a remote
tape using the minimal rmt protocol and a set blocksize of
64k:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -m -b 65536 -f
otherhost:/dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To perform a level 0,
multi-stream dump to two locally mounted tape drives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -L session_2 -f
/dev/rmt/tps4d6v -M tape_1 -f /dev/rmt/tps5d6v -M tape_2
/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To perform a level 1 dump
relative to the last level 0 dump recorded in the
inventory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -l 1 -f /dev/tape
/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The exit code is 0 on normal completion, non-zero if an
error occurs or the dump is terminated by the operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all verbosity levels greater
than 0 (silent) the final line of the output shows the exit
status of the dump. It is of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump: Dump Status: code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where code takes one of the
following values: SUCCESS (normal completion), INTERRUPT
(interrupted), QUIT (media no longer usable), INCOMPLETE
(dump incomplete), FAULT (software <br>
error), and ERROR (resource error). Every attempt will be
made to keep both the syntax and the semantics of this log
message unchanged in future versions of xfsdump. However,
<br>
it may be necessary to refine or expand the set of exit
codes, or their interpretation at some point in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message
&lsquo;&lsquo;xfsdump: WARNING: unable to open directory:
ino N: Invalid argument&rsquo;&rsquo; can occur with
filesystems which are actively being modified while xfsdump
is running. This <br>
can happen to either directory or regular file inodes -
affected files will not end up in the dump, files below
affected directories will be placed in the orphanage
directory by <br>
xfsrestore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
xfsdump does not dump unmounted filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dump frequency field of
/etc/fstab is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump uses the alert program
only when a media change is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump requires root privilege
(except for inventory display).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump can only dump XFS
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The media format used by xfsdump
can only be understood by xfsrestore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump does not know how to
manage CD-ROM or other removable disk drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump can become confused when
doing incremental or resumed dumps if on the same machine
you dump two XFS filesystems and both filesystems have the
same filesystem identifier <br>
(UUID). Since xfsdump uses the filesystem identifier to
identify filesystems, xfsdump maintains one combined set of
dump inventories for both filesystems instead of two sets of
<br>
dump inventories. This scenario can happen only if dd or
some other block-by-block copy program was used to make a
copy of an XFS filesystem. See xfs_copy(8) and xfs(5) for
<br>
more details.</p>
