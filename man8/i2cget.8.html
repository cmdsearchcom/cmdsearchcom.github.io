<p>I2CGET(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual I2CGET(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
i2cget - read from I2C/SMBus chip registers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
i2cget [-f] [-y] i2cbus chip-address [data-address [mode]]
<br>
i2cget -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
i2cget is a small helper program to read registers visible
through the I2C bus (or SMBus).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force access to the device
even if it is already busy. By default, i2cget will refuse
to access a device which is already under the control of a
kernel driver. Using this <br>
flag is dangerous, it can seriously confuse the kernel
driver in question. It can also cause i2cget to return an
invalid value. So use at your own risk and only if you <br>
know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Disable interactive mode. By
default, i2cget will wait for a confirmation from the user
before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it
will perform the opera&acirc; <br>
tion directly. This is mainly meant to be used in scripts.
Use with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two required options
to i2cget. i2cbus indicates the number or name of the I2C
bus to be scanned. This number should correspond to one of
the busses listed by i2cde&acirc; <br>
tect -l. chip-address specifies the address of the chip on
that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and 0x77.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data-address specifies the
address on that chip to read from, and is an integer between
0x00 and 0xFF. If omitted, the currently active register
will be read (if that makes sense <br>
for the considered chip).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode parameter, if
specified, is one of the letters b, w or c, corresponding to
a read byte data, a read word data or a write byte/read byte
transaction, respectively. A p <br>
can also be appended to the mode parameter to enable PEC. If
the mode parameter is omitted, i2cget defaults to a read
byte data transaction, unless data-address is also omitted,
<br>
in which case the default (and only valid) transaction is a
single read byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
i2cget can be extremely dangerous if used improperly. I2C
and SMBus are designed in such a way that an SMBus read
transaction can be seen as a write transaction by certain
chips. <br>
This is particularly true if setting mode to cp (write
byte/read byte with PEC). Be extremely careful using this
program.</p>
