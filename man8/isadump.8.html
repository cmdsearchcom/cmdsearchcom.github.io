<p>ISADUMP(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual ISADUMP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
isadump - examine ISA registers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
isadump [-y] [-W|-L] [-k V1,V2...] addrreg datareg [bank
[bankreg]] #for I2C-like access <br>
isadump -f [-y] [-W|-L] address [range [bank [bankreg]]]
#for flat address space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
isadump is a small helper program to examine registers
visible through the ISA bus. It is intended to probe any
chip that lives on the ISA bus working with an address
register <br>
and a data register (I2C-like access) or a flat range (of up
to 256 bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f Enable flat address space mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Disable interactive mode. By
default, isadump will wait for a confirmation from the user
before messing with the ISA bus. When this flag is used, it
will perform the oper&acirc; <br>
ation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k V1,V2... <br>
Specify a comma-separated list of bytes to send as the key
sequence to enter the chip configuration mode. Most
Super-I/O chips need this. Known key sequences are: <br>
0x87,0x01,0x55,0x55 for ITE, 0x55 for SMSC, 0x87,0x87 for
Winbond and VIA, none needed for National Semiconductor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Perform 16-bit reads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Perform 32-bit reads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS (I2C-like access mode)
<br>
At least two options must be provided to isadump. addrreg
contains the ISA address of the address register for the
chip to probe; datareg contains the address of the data
regis&acirc; <br>
ter. Both addresses are integers between 0x0000 and 0x3FFF.
Usually, if the chip&rsquo;s base address is 0x0nn0, the
address register is at 0x0nn5 and the data register is at
0x0nn6. <br>
The most common base address for hardware monitoring chips
is 0x0290.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Super-I/O chips, address
register is typically at 0x2E with data register at
0x2F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bank and bankreg parameters
are useful on the Winbond chips as well as on Super-I/O
chips. bank is an integer between 0 and 31, and bankreg is
an integer between 0x00 and <br>
0xFF (default value: 0x4E for Winbond chips, 0x07 for
Super-I/O chips). The W83781D datasheet has more information
on bank selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS (flat address space
mode) <br>
In flat mode, only one parameter is mandatory. address
contains the ISA address of the chip to probe; it is an
integer between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF. If provided, range is how
many <br>
bytes should be read (must be a multiple of 16). If the
range isn&rsquo;t provided, it defaults to 256 bytes and the
address is forcibly aligned on a 256-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bank and bankreg parameters
are useful on the National Semiconductor PC87365 and PC87366
Super-I/O chips. bank is an integer between 0 and 31, and
bankreg is an integer <br>
between 0x00 and 0xFF (default value: 0x09; must fit in the
specified range). See the PC87365 datasheet for more
information on bank selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If no bank is specified, no bank change operation is
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a bank is specified, the
original value is restored before isadump exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping Super-I/O chips is
typically a two-step process. First, you will have to access
the main Super-I/O address using a command like: isadump
0x2e 0x2f 0x09. This will select <br>
logical device 9 (correct value depend on the chip). At 0x60
you will find the logical device address word, for example
&quot;ec c0&quot;. Then you can use a command like: isadump
-f <br>
0xecc0 16. This will dump the logical device registers. The
correct range depends on the chip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Poking around in ISA data space is extremely dangerous.
Running isadump with random parameters can cause system
crashes, data loss, and worse! Be extremely careful when
using <br>
this program.</p>
