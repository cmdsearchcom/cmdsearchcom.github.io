<p>MOUNT.NILFS2(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
MOUNT.NILFS2(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mount.nilfs2 - mount a NILFS2 file system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mount -t nilfs2 [-finrvw] [-o options [,...]] device dir
<br>
mount -t nilfs2 [-finrvw] [-o options [,...]] device |
dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount.nilfs2 [-fnrvw] [-o
options [,...]] device dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount.nilfs2 [-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mount.nilfs2 serves to attach a NILFS2 file system on the
specified directory dir. It is intended to be executed from
mount(8), and will invoke the garbage collector
nilfs_clean&acirc; <br>
erd(8) after an actual mount system call has succeeded.
Conversely, umount.nilfs2(8) will shutdown the garbage
collector before detaching the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard command line
interface is the first form: <br>
mount -t nilfs2 [options] device dir <br>
This tells the kernel to attach the NILFS2 file system on
device at the directory dir. With the second form, the mount
program tries to find out a missing device or dir argument
<br>
from the /etc/fstab table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form, which directly
invokes mount.nilfs2, is also usable since mount.nilfs2
maintains by itself the system mount state such as the list
of mounted file systems <br>
described in /etc/mtab. However, the first or the second
form is usually recommended because some expansive options
are not supported by the third form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The full set of options used by an invocation of mount(8) is
determined by extracting the options from the fstab table,
then applying any options specified by the -o argument, <br>
and finally applying a -r or -w option, when present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See mount(8) for the full set of
options. Commonly used options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Output version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fakes mounting the file
system, meaning that the actual system call will be skipped.
This option is used to add entries for devices that were
mounted earlier with the -n <br>
option. It can also be used for invoking nilfs_cleanerd(8)
skipped previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Don&rsquo;t call
mount.nilfs2. This disables garbage collection and handling
of pseudo mount options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Mount without writing in
/etc/mtab. This is necessary for example when /etc is on a
read-only file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Mount the file system
read-only. A synonym is &quot;-o ro&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Mount the file system
read/write. This is the default. A synonym is &quot;-o
rw&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Options are specified with a
-o flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
Some of these options are only useful when they appear in
the /etc/fstab file. For <br>
standard filesystem options, see mount(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NILFS2 SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS
<br>
The following options apply only to the NILFS2 filesystem.
They all follow the -o flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">barrier / nobarrier <br>
These options enable/disable (default is enabled) barrier
writes for the block I/O to a lower device. The barrier
write serves an important role to ensure consistency of <br>
filesystems after a system crash or power failure. NILFS2
uses this feature by default to assure the reliability. For
devices not supporting the barrier write, it will <br>
be disabled automatically and a warning will be logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp=checkpoint-number <br>
Specify the checkpoint-number of the snapshot to be mounted.
Checkpoints and snapshots are listed by lscp(1). Only the
checkpoints marked as snapshot are mountable with <br>
this option. Note that the read-only mount option must be
specified together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errors=continue /
errors=remount-ro / errors=panic <br>
Define the behaviour when an error is encountered. (Either
ignore errors and just mark the file system erroneous and
continue, or remount the file system read-only, or <br>
panic and halt the system.) The default is remount-ro. In
earlier kernels than Linux 2.6.35, continue was the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pp=protection-period <br>
Specify the protection-period for the cleaner daemon (in
seconds). nilfs_cleanerd never deletes recent checkpoints
whose elapsed time from its creation is smaller than <br>
protection-period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nogc Disable garbage collection.
The cleaner daemon will not be started. It can be be started
manually, but in that case it must also be stopped manually
before unmounting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">order=relaxed / order=strict
<br>
Specify order semantics for file data. Metadata is always
written to follow the POSIX semantics about the order of
filesystem operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relaxed <br>
Apply relaxed order semantics that allows modified data
blocks to be written to disk without making a checkpoint if
no metadata update is going. This mode is <br>
equivalent to the ordered data mode of the ext3 filesystem
except for the updates on data blocks still conserve
atomicity. This will improve synchronous write per&acirc;
<br>
formance for overwriting. This is the default mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strict Apply strict in-order
semantics that preserves sequence of all file operations
including overwriting of data blocks. That means, it is
guaranteed that no overtak&acirc; <br>
ing of events occurs in the recovered file system after a
crash. Unlike journaling filesystems, NILFS2 does not write
a same block twice to disk. So there is no <br>
significant performance degradation in comparison with the
relaxed mode except for file overwriting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norecovery <br>
Disable recovery of the filesystem on mount. This disables
every write access on the device for read-only mounts or
snapshots. This option will fail for r/w mounts on an <br>
unclean volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard / nodiscard <br>
These options enable/disable (default is disabled) the use
of discard/TRIM commands. The discard/TRIM commands are sent
to the underlying block device when blocks are <br>
freed. This is useful for SSD devices and
sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs. (since 2.6.34).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN CODES <br>
The return codes of mount.nilfs2 conform to those of
mount(8); the following codes could be returned (the bits
can be ORed):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 success</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 incorrect invocation or
permissions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 system error (out of memory,
cannot fork, no more loop devices)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 internal bug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 user interrupt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 problems writing or locking
/etc/mtab</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32 mount failure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 some mount succeeded</p>
