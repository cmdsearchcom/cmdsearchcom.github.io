<p>gfs2_grow(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
gfs2_grow(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gfs2_grow - Expand a GFS2 filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gfs2_grow [OPTION]... &lt;DEVICE|MOUNTPOINT&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gfs2_grow is used to expand a GFS2 filesystem after the
device upon which the filesystem resides has also been
expanded. By running gfs2_grow on a GFS2 filesystem, you are
<br>
requesting that any spare space between the current end of
the filesystem and the end of the device is filled with a
newly initialized GFS2 filesystem extension. When this
oper&acirc; <br>
ation is complete, the resource group index for the
filesystem is updated so that all nodes in the cluster can
use the extra storage space that has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may only run gfs2_grow on a
mounted filesystem; expansion of unmounted filesystems is
not supported. You only need to run gfs2_grow on one node in
the cluster. All the <br>
other nodes will see the expansion has occurred and
automatically start to use the newly available space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must be superuser to execute
gfs2_grow. The gfs2_grow tool tries to prevent you from
corrupting your filesystem by checking as many of the likely
problems as it can. When <br>
expanding a filesystem, only the last step of updating the
resource index affects the currently mounted filesystem and
so failure part way through the expansion process should
<br>
leave your filesystem in its original unexpanded state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run gfs2_grow with the
-T flag to get a display of the current state of a mounted
GFS2 filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gfs2_grow tool uses the
resource group (RG) size that was originally calculated when
mkfs.gfs2 was done. This allows tools like fsck.gfs2 to
better ensure the integrity of <br>
the file system. Since the new free space often does not lie
on even boundaries based on that RG size, there may be some
unused space on the device after gfs2_grow is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-D Print out debugging information about the filesystem
layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Prints out a short usage
message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet. Don&rsquo;t print
anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Test. Do all calculations,
but do not write any data to the disk and do not expand the
filesystem. This is used to discover what the tool would
have done were it run with&acirc; <br>
out this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Version. Print out version
information, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is no way to shrink a GFS2 filesystem.</p>
