<p>clamsmtpd(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
clamsmtpd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
clamsmtpd &acirc; an SMTP server for scanning viruses via
clamd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
clamsmtpd [-d level] [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] <br>
clamsmtpd -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
clamsmtpd is an SMTP filter that allows you to check for
viruses using the ClamAV anti-virus software. It accepts
SMTP connections and forwards the SMTP commands and
responses to <br>
another SMTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DATA email body is
intercepted and scanned before forwarding. By default email
with viruses are dropped silently and logged without any
additional action taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clamsmtpd aims to be lightweight
and simple rather than have a myriad of options. The options
it does have are configured by editing the clamsmtpd.conf(5)
file. See the man page <br>
for clamsmtpd.conf(5) for more info on the default location
of the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Previous versions had more options. These still work for now
but have equivalents in clamsmtpd.conf(5) and are not
documented here. The options are as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Don&rsquo;t detach from the
console and run as a daemon. In addition the level argument
specifies what level of error messages to display. 0 being
the least, 4 the most.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f configfile specifies an
alternate location for the clamsmtpd configuration file. See
clamsmtpd.conf(5) for more details on where the
configuration file is located by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pidfile specifies a location
for the a process id file to be written to. This file
contains the process id of clamsmtpd and can be used to stop
the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints the clamsmtp version
number and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
clamsmtpd logs to syslogd by default under the
&rsquo;mail&rsquo; facility. You can also output logs to the
console using the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOOPBACK FEATURE <br>
In some cases it&rsquo;s advantageous to consolidate the
virus scanning and filtering for several mail servers on one
machine. clamsmtpd allows this by providing a loopback
feature to <br>
connect back to the IP that an SMTP connection comes in
from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this feature specify only
a port number (no IP address) for the OutAddress setting in
the configuration file. This will cause clamsmtpd to pass
the email back to the said <br>
port on the incoming IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the MaxConnections
setting is set high enough to handle the mail from all the
servers without refusing connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSPARENT PROXY FEATURE <br>
A transparent proxy is a configuration on a gateway that
routes certain types of traffic through a proxy server
without any changes on the client computers. clamsmtpd has
support <br>
for transparent proxying of SMTP traffic by enabling the
TransparentProxy setting. This type of setup usually
involves firewall rules which redirect traffic to clamsmtpd
and the <br>
setup varies from OS to OS. The SMTP traffic will be
forwarded to it&rsquo;s original destination after being
scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When doing transparent proxying
for outgoing email it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to turn
on bounce notifications using the Action: bounce setting.
Also note that some features (such as <br>
SSL/TLS) will not be available when going through the
transparent proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure that the
MaxConnections setting is set high enough for your
transparent proxying. Because clamsmtpd is not being used as
a filter inside a queue, which usually throttles <br>
the amount of email going through, this setting may need to
be higher than usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIRUS ACTIONS <br>
Using the VirusAction option you can run a script or program
whenever a virus is found. This may be handy in certain
circumstances but it has several drawbacks. For one, the
per&acirc; <br>
formance of the virus filtering will take a hit, perhaps
DOS&rsquo;ing your machine under heavy load. Secondly as
with running any program there are security implications to
be consid&acirc; <br>
ered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please consider the above
carefully before implementing a virus action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script is run without its
output being logged, or return value being checked. Because
of this you should test it thoroughly. Make sure it runs
without problems under the user <br>
that clamsmtpd(8) is being run as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various environment variables
will be present when your script is run. You may need to
escape them properly before use in your favorite scripting
language. Failure to do this could <br>
lead to a REMOTE COMPROMISE of your machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT The network address of
the SMTP client connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMAIL When the Quarantine option
is enabled, this specifies the file that the virus was saved
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECIPIENTS The email addresses
of the email recipients. These are specified one per line,
in standard address format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE If clamsmtpd is being
used to filter email between SMTP servers, then this is the
IP address of the original client. In order for this
information to be present (a) the <br>
SMTP client (sending server) must an send an XFORWARD
command and (b) the SMTP server (receiving server) must
accept that XFORWARD command without error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_HELO <br>
If clamsmtpd is being used to filter email between SMTP
servers, then this is the HELO/EHLO banner of the original
client. In order for this information to be present <br>
(a) the SMTP client (sending server) must an send an
XFORWARD command and (b) the SMTP server (receiving server)
must accept that XFORWARD command without error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDER The email address for the
sender of the email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER The network address of
the SMTP server we&rsquo;re connected to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR The path to the temp
directory in use. This is the same as the TempDirectory
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIRUS The name of the virus
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
There&rsquo;s no reason to run this daemon as root. It is
meant as a filter and should listen on a high TCP port.
It&rsquo;s probably a good idea to run it using the same
user as the clamd(8) <br>
daemon. This way the temporary files it writes are
accessible to clamd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken with the
directory that clamsmtpd writes its temporary files to. In
order to be secure, it should not be a world writeable
location. Specify the directory <br>
using the TempDirectory setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the VirusAction
option make sure you understand the security issues
involved. Unescaped environment variables can lead to
execution of arbitrary shell commands on your <br>
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If running clamsmtpd on a
publicly accessible IP address or without a firewall please
be sure to understand all the possible security issues. This
is especially true if the loop&acirc; <br>
back feature is used (see above).</p>
