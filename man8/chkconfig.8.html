<p>CHKCONFIG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
CHKCONFIG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chkconfig - updates and queries runlevel information for
system services</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chkconfig [--list] [--type type] [name] <br>
chkconfig --add name <br>
chkconfig --del name <br>
chkconfig --override name <br>
chkconfig [--level levels] [--type type] [--no-redirect]
name &lt;on|off|reset|resetpriorities&gt; <br>
chkconfig [--level levels] [--type type] [--no-redirect]
name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
chkconfig provides a simple command-line tool for
maintaining the /etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy by
relieving system administrators of the task of directly
manipulating the <br>
numerous symbolic links in those directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This implementation of chkconfig
was inspired by the chkconfig command present in the IRIX
operating system. Rather than maintaining configuration
information outside of the <br>
/etc/rc[0-6].d hierarchy, however, this version directly
manages the symlinks in /etc/rc[0-6].d. This leaves all of
the configuration information regarding what services init
<br>
starts in a single location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chkconfig has five distinct
functions: adding new services for management, removing
services from management, listing the current startup
information for services, changing the <br>
startup information for services, and checking the startup
state of a particular service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When chkconfig is run with only
a service name, it checks to see if the service is
configured to be started in the current runlevel. If it is,
chkconfig returns true; otherwise <br>
it returns false. The --level option may be used to have
chkconfig query an alternative runlevel rather than the
current one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When chkconfig is run with the
--list argument, or no arguments at all, a listing is
displayed of all services and their current
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of on, off, reset, or
resetpriorities is specified after the service name,
chkconfig changes the startup information for the specified
service. The on and off flags cause <br>
the service to be started or stopped, respectively, in the
runlevels being changed. The reset flag resets the on/off
state for all runlevels for the service to whatever is
speci&acirc; <br>
fied in the init script in question, while the
resetpriorities flag resets the start/stop priorities for
the service to whatever is specified in the init script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the on and off
options affect only runlevels 2, 3, 4, and 5, while reset
and resetpriorities affects all of the runlevels. The
--level option may be used to specify <br>
which runlevels are affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that for every service,
each runlevel has either a start script or a stop script.
When switching runlevels, init will not re-start an
already-started service, and will not <br>
re-stop a service that is not running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chkconfig also can manage xinetd
scripts via the means of xinetd.d configuration files. Note
that only the on, off, and --list commands are supported for
xinetd.d services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chkconfig supports a --type
argument to limit actions to only a specific type of
services, in the case where services of either type may
share a name. Possible values for type <br>
are sysv and xinetd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--level levels <br>
Specifies the run levels an operation should pertain to. It
is given as a string of numbers from 0 to 6. For example,
--level 35 specifies runlevels 3 and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-redirect <br>
When chkconfig is run on a system that uses systemd as its
init system, chkconfig will forward commands to systemd if a
systemd service file exists for it. This switch <br>
turns off the redirection to systemd and only operates on
the symlinks in /etc/rc[0-6].d. This option is only valid
when on, off, or no command (to check enablement) is <br>
passed to a service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option adds a new service
for management by chkconfig. When a new service is added,
chkconfig ensures that the service has either a start or a
kill entry in every <br>
runlevel. If any runlevel is missing such an entry,
chkconfig creates the appropriate entry as specified by the
default values in the init script. Note that default <br>
entries in LSB-delimited &rsquo;INIT INFO&rsquo; sections
take precedence over the default runlevels in the
initscript; if any Required-Start or Required-Stop entries
are present, the <br>
start and stop priorities of the script will be adjusted to
account for these dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--del name <br>
The service is removed from chkconfig management, and any
symbolic links in /etc/rc[0-6].d which pertain to it are
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that future package
installs for this service may run chkconfig --add, which
will re-add such links. To disable a service, run chkconfig
name off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--override name <br>
If service name is configured exactly as it would be if the
--add option had been specified with no override file in
/etc/chkconfig.d/name, and if /etc/chkconfig.d/name <br>
now exists and is specified differently from the base
initscript, change the configuration for service name to
follow the overrides instead of the base configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list name <br>
This option lists all of the services which chkconfig knows
about, and whether they are stopped or started in each
runlevel. If name is specified, information in only
dis&acirc; <br>
play about service name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNLEVEL FILES <br>
Each service which should be manageable by chkconfig needs
two or more commented lines added to its init.d script. The
first line tells chkconfig what runlevels the service <br>
should be started in by default, as well as the start and
stop priority levels. If the service should not, by default,
be started in any runlevels, a - should be used in place of
<br>
the runlevels list. The second line contains a description
for the service, and may be extended across multiple lines
with backslash continuation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, random.init has
these three lines: <br>
# chkconfig: 2345 20 80 <br>
# description: Saves and restores system entropy pool for #
higher quality random number generation. <br>
This says that the random script should be started in levels
2, 3, 4, and 5, that its start priority should be 20, and
that its stop priority should be 80. You should be able to
<br>
figure out what the description says; the &nbsp;causes the
line to be continued. The extra space in front of the line
is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chkconfig also supports
LSB-style init stanzas, and will apply them in preference to
&quot;chkconfig:&quot; lines where available. A LSB stanza
looks like: <br>
### BEGIN INIT INFO <br>
# Provides: foo <br>
# Required-Start: bar <br>
# Defalt-Start: 2 3 4 5 <br>
# Default-Stop: 0 1 6 <br>
# Description: Foo init script <br>
### END INIT INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, the start priority
of &quot;foo&quot; would be changed such that it is higher
than the &quot;bar&quot; start priority, if &quot;bar&quot;
is enabled. Care must be taken when adding dependen&acirc;
<br>
cies, as they can cause vast shifts in the start and stop
priorities of many scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERRIDE FILES <br>
Files in /etc/chkconfig.d/servicename are parsed using the
same comments that chkconfig notices in init service
scripts, and override values in the init service scripts
them&acirc; <br>
selves.</p>
