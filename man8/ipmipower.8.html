<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipmipower - IPMI power control utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmipower [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ipmipower allows users to remotely power on, off, cycle,
hard reset, get a power status query, perform a pulse
diagnostic interrupt, or initiate a soft-shutdown of the OS
via <br>
ACPI through the IPMI over LAN protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a power command (--on,
--off, --cycle, --reset, --stat, --pulse, or --soft) is
specified on the command line, ipmipower will attempt to run
the power command on all host&acirc; <br>
names listed on the command line then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no power commands are
specified on the command line, ipmipower will run in
interactive mode. Interactive mode gives the user a command
line interface to enter various com&acirc; <br>
mands. Details of the interactive command line interface can
be found below under INTERACTIVE COMMANDS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are general IPMI
options, tool specific options, trouble shooting
information, workaround information, examples, and known
issues. For a general introduction to <br>
FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
The following options are general options for configuring
IPMI communication and executing general tool commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D IPMIDRIVER,
--driver-type=IPMIDRIVER <br>
Specify the driver type to use instead of doing an auto
selection. The currently available outofband drivers are LAN
and LAN_2_0, which perform IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 <br>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...,
--hostname=IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMIHOST2[:PORT],... <br>
Specify the remote host(s) to communicate with. Multiple
hostnames may be separated by comma or may be specified in a
range format; see HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below. An <br>
optional port can be specified with each host, which may be
useful in port forwarding or similar situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
<br>
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the
remote host. If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous)
username is assumed. The user must have atleast OPERATOR
<br>
privileges to run the --on, --off, --reset, --cycle,
--pulse, or --soft power control commands. The user must
have atleast USER privileges to determine the power status
of <br>
the machine through --stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<br>
Specify the password to use when authenticationg with the
remote host. If not specified, a null password is assumed.
Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for <br>
IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --password-prompt <br>
Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in
process lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k K_G, --k-g=K_G <br>
Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the
remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not specified, a null key is
assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix <br>
the string with &rsquo;0x&rsquo;. E.g., the key
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; can be entered with the either the string
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; or the string &rsquo;0x616263&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --k-g-prompt <br>
Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to
20000 milliseconds (20 seconds) if not specified.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>

fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I CIPHER-SUITE-ID,
--cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID <br>
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0
communi&acirc; <br>
cation. The authentication algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signa&acirc; <br>
tures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The following cipher suite <br>
ids are currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Authentication Algorithm =

available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-file=FILE <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W WORKAROUNDS,
--workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS <br>
Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
command line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
work&acirc; <br>
arounds (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Turn on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMIPOWER OPTIONS <br>
The following options are specific to ipmipower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --on <br>
Power on the target hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --off <br>
Power off the target hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cycle <br>
Power cycle the target hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reset <br>
Reset the target hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --stat <br>
Get power status of the target hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pulse <br>
Send power diagnostic interrupt to target hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--soft Initiate a soft-shutdown
of the OS via ACPI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--on-if-off <br>
The IPMI specification does not require the power cycle or
hard reset commands to turn on a machine that is currently
powered off. This option will force ipmipower to <br>
issue a power on command instead of a power cycle or hard
reset command if the remote machine&rsquo;s power is
currently off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wait-until-on <br>
The IPMI specification allows power on commands to return
prior to the power on actually taking place. This option
will force ipmipower to regularly query the remote BMC <br>
and return only after the machine has powered on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wait-until-off <br>
The IPMI specification allows power off commands to return
prior the power off actually taking place. This option will
force ipmipower to regularly query the remote BMC <br>
and return only after the machine has powered off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oem-power-type=OEM-POWER-TYPE
<br>
This option informs ipmipower to initiate power control
operations via an IPMI OEM specific power control extension.
The currently available POWERTYPEs are NONE and C410X. <br>
Please see OEM POWER EXTENSIONS below for additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMIPOWER ADVANCED NETWORK
OPTIONS <br>
The following options are used to change the networking
behavior of ipmipower.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retransmission-wait-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the retransmission wait timeout length in
milliseconds. The retransmission wait timeout is similar to
the retransmission timeout above, but is used specifically
<br>
for power completion verification with the --wait-until-on
and --wait-until-off options. Defaults to 500 milliseconds
(0.5 seconds).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retransmission-backoff-count=COUNT
<br>
Specify the retransmission backoff count for
retransmissions. After ever COUNT retransmissions, the
retransmission timeout length will be increased by another
factor. <br>
Defaults to 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ping-interval=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the ping interval length in milliseconds. When
running in interactive mode, RMCP (Remote Management Control
Protocol) discovery messages will be sent to all con&acirc;
<br>
figured remote hosts every MILLISECONDS to confirm their
support of IPMI. Power commands cannot be sent to a host
until it is discovered (or re-discovered if previously <br>
lost). Defaults to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds). Ping
discovery messages can be disabled by setting this valu to
0. RMCP ping discovery messages are automatically dis&acirc;
<br>
abled in non-interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ping-timeout=MILLISECONDS <br>
Specify the ping timeout length in milliseconds. When
running in interactive mode, RMCP (Remote Management Control
Protocol) messages discovery will be sent to all
config&acirc; <br>
ured remote hosts to confirm their support of IPMI. A remote
host is considered undiscovered if the host does not respond
in MILLISECONDS time. Defaults to 30000 millisec&acirc; <br>
onds (30 seconds). The ping timeout cannot be larger than
the ping interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ping-packet-count=COUNT <br>
Specify the ping packet count size. Defaults to 10. See the
--ping-percent-fR option below for more information on this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ping-percent=PERCENT <br>
Specify the ping percent value. Defaults to 50. Since IPMI
is based on UDP, it is difficult for ipmipower to
distinguish between a missing machine and a bad (or heavily
<br>
loaded) network connection in interactive mode. when running
in interactive mode. For example, suppose a link
consistently drops 80% of the packets to a particular <br>
machine. The power control operation may have difficulty
completing, although a recent pong response from RMCP makes
ipmipower believe the machine is up and functioning <br>
properly. The ping packet acount and percent options are
used to alleviate this problem. Ipmipower will monitor RMCP
ping packets in packet count chunks. If ipmipower <br>
does not receive a response to greater than ping percent of
those packets, ipmipower will assume the link to this node
is bad and will not send power control operations to <br>
that node until the connection is determined to be reliable.
This heuristic can be disabled by setting either the ping
packet count or ping percent to 0. This feature is <br>
not used if ping interval is set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ping-consec-count=COUNT <br>
Specify the ping consecutive count. This is another
heuristic used to determine if a node should be considered
discovered, undiscovered, or with a bad connection. If a
<br>
valid RMCP pong response was received for the last COUNT
ping packets, a node will be considered discovered,
regardless of other heuristics listed above. Defaults to 5.
<br>
This heuristic can be disabled by setting this value to 0.
This feature is not used if other ping features described
above are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED OPTIONS <br>
The following options manipulate hostranged output. See
HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information on
hostranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --buffer-output <br>
Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard
output until the node has completed its IPMI operation. When
specifying this option, data may appear to output <br>
slower to the user since the the entire IPMI operation must
complete before any data can be output. See HOSTRANGED
SUPPORT below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --consolidate-output <br>
Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output
from every node specified will be consolidated so that nodes
with identical output are not output twice. A <br>
header will list those nodes with the consolidated output.
When this option is specified, no output can be seen until
the IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If <br>
the user breaks out of the program early, all currently
consolidated output will be dumped. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F NUM, --fanout=NUM <br>
Specify multiple host fanout. Indicates the maximum number
of power control operations that can be executed in
parallel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --eliminate <br>
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by ipmidetect. This
attempts to remove the common issue of hostranged execution
timing out due to several nodes being removed <br>
from service in a large cluster. The ipmidetectd daemon must
be running on the node executing the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--always-prefix <br>
Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or
communicating in-band. This option is primarily useful for
scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if speci&acirc;
<br>
fied with the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS <br>
ipmipower provides the following interactive commands at the
ipmipower&gt; prompt. Before any power commands (on, off,
cycle, reset, stat, pulse, or soft) can be used, hostnames
<br>
must be configured into ipmipower, either through the
command prompt or the hostname command below. The parameters

ipmipower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OEM POWER EXTENSIONS <br>
Some motherboards include IPMI OEM extensions for alternate
power control mechanisms. For example, these power control
mechanisms may allow you to power control a sub-device <br>
within the system rather than the entire system itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By specifying an OEM power type
via --oem-power-type on the command line or
freeipmi.conf(5), you can instruct ipmipower to execute
alternate power control implementations over <br>
the standard ones. Depending on the OEM extension, some
power control commands may no longer be available. For
example, an OEM extension may allow on but not cycle.
Specific <br>
ipmipower options may not longer function either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some OEM extensions may require
additional arguments for their power control action, such as
a sub-device identifier. Additional arguments can be
provided by appending a plus <br>
sign (&rsquo;+&rsquo;) and the extra information to the end
of the hostname. This can be done on the command line or in
interactive mode. For example, the hostname mynode+18 would
indicate <br>
the power control operation should be sent to the host
mynode, and 18 is the identifier of a possible sub-device to
be power controlled. The --consolidate-output option is
com&acirc; <br>
monly disabled when using an OEM power control that requires
extra arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because OEM power control may
involve subtypes, it is possible a user may wish to power
control multiple sub-devices on the same host. For example,
you might specify the hosts <br>
mynode+1,mynode+2, indicating to power control subdevice 1
and 2 on mynode. Because many BMCs cannot handle multiple
IPMI sessions, power control operations to the same host
<br>
will be serialized internally by ipmipower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are the current
OEM power types available, along with information on the
systems they work with and the power control operations
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C410X This OEM power type
supports the power control of PCIe slots on Dell Poweredge
C410x systems. It supports on, off, and stat. The PCIe slot
number ranges from 1-16 and must <br>
always be specified when attempting to power control with
this extension. For example, the hostname mynode+2 would
inform ipmipower to operate on slot number 2 on mynode. <br>
The C410x appears to have difficulty handling new slot power
control requests until prior ones have completed. Users may
wish to strongly consider using the <br>
--wait-until-on and --wait-until-off options if multiple
slots will be power controlled in short succession.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONE This informs ipmipower that
no OEM power type extension is to be used and standard IPMI
power control is used. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED SUPPORT <br>
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma
separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the
general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt;
k, etc. The <br>
later form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19]
does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a
<br>
degenerate range: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This range syntax is meant only
as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming
convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list <br>
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of range usage
follow: <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a reminder to the reader,
some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern
matching. Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to
enclose ranged lists within <br>
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple hosts are
specified by the user, a socket will be created for each
host and polled on, effectively allowing communication to
all hosts in parallel. This will allow <br>
communication to large numbers of nodes far more quickly
than if done in serial. The -F option can configure the
number of nodes that can be communicated with in parallel at
the <br>
same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, standard output from
each node specified will be output with the hostname
prepended to each line. Although this output is readable in
many situations, it may be dif&acirc; <br>
ficult to read in other situations. For example, output from
multiple nodes may be mixed together. The -B and -C options
can be used to change this default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN problems involve a
misconfiguration of the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double
check to make sure the following are configured properly in
the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC: IP <br>
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connec&acirc; <br>
tions, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration <br>
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are many of the
common issues for error messages. For additional support,
please e-mail the &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;username invalid&quot; -
The username entered (or a NULL username if none was
entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also
be possible the remote BMC&rsquo;s username con&acirc; <br>
figuration is incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password invalid&quot; -
The password entered (or a NULL password if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the
password for the user is not correctly configured <br>
on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password verification
timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed out. A
&quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above) or a
generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. <br>
During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The
K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is
not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level
insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher user
privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may <br>
require authenticating to a different user which has a
higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level cannot be
obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege level you are
attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
allowed for this user. Please try <br>
again with a lower privilege. It may also be possible the
maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try <br>
again with an alternate authentication type or alternate
privilege level. It may also be possible the available
authentication types you can authenticate with are not
correctly <br>
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher suite id
unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may <br>
also be possible the available cipher suite ids are not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
- IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please
try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection timeout&quot; -
Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of potential
errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be <br>
resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the
network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration
and connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;session timeout&quot; -
The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect. If this
error occurs often, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are con&acirc; <br>
siderably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;internal IPMI error&quot;
- An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how
to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to
report the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMIPOWER TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
When powering on a powered off machine, the client must have
a means by which to resolve the MAC address of the remote
machine&rsquo;s ethernet card. While most modern IPMI
solutions <br>
support the ability to ARP and resolve addresses when the
machine is powered off, some older machines do not. This is
typically solved in one of two ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Enable gratuitous ARPs on the
remote machine. The remote machine will send out a
gratuitous ARP, which advertises the ethernet IP and MAC
address so that other machines on the <br>
network this information their local ARP cache. For large
clusters, this method is not recommended since gratuitous
ARPs can flood the network with unnecessary traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Permanently store the remote
machine&rsquo;s MAC address in the local ARP cache. This is
the more common approach on large clusters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other methods are listed in the
IPMI specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKAROUNDS <br>
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI
solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of
work&acirc; <br>
arounds currently available to handle discovered compliance
issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so
they will be transparent to the user. However, some will
<br>
require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardware listed below may
only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on.
Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
below. Similar machines from <br>
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds <br>
listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe your hardware has
an additional compliance issue that needs a workaround to be
implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or <br>
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authcap - This workaround flag
will skip early checks for username capabilities,
authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
authentication to succeed. It works <br>
around multiple issues in which the remote system does not
properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see <br>
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel <br>
SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochecksumcheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums <br>
due to implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise
valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes validation of packet integrity in a number of
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most
situations. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification time&acirc; <br>
out&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
&quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too.
Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F,
and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idzero - This workaround flag
will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client.
It works around IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs
to the client. Those hitting <br>
this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpectedauth - This workaround
flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked
as though they were expected. It works around an issue when
packets contain non-null <br>
authentication data when they should be null due to disabled
per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell
Pow&acirc; <br>
erEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forcepermsg - This workaround
flag will force per-message authentication to be used no
matter what is advertised by the remote system. It works
around an issue when per-message <br>
authentication is advertised as disabled on the remote
system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue <br>
observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endianseq - This workaround flag
will flip the endian of the session sequence numbers to
allow the session to continue properly. It works around IPMI
1.5 session sequence numbers <br>
that are the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noauthcodecheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command
responses. It works around systems that return <br>
invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the validity <br>
of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is
unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting this issue
may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session
timeout&quot;, or &quot;password veri&acirc; <br>
fication timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Xyratex
FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intel20 - This workaround flag
will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
password truncation if the <br>
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with <br>
Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermicro20 - This workaround
flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0
authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI
firmware. The issues covered include han&acirc; <br>
dling invalid length authentication codes. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors.
Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card.
Confirmed <br>
fixed on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sun20 - This workaround flag
will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and <br>
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround <br>
automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot;
workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opensesspriv - This workaround
flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s IPMI 2.0
connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing
algorithm used by the remote system. The privi&acirc; <br>
lege level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those
hit&acirc; <br>
ting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;,
&quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status
code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500
with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu <br>
II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and
Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is
automatically trig&acirc; <br>
gered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integritycheckvalue - This
workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check
value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity <br>
check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermi&acirc; <br>
cro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some
motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not
support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection <br>
timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be worked around by
using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
--driver-type=LAN_2_0. Issue observed on HP Proliant DL
145.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On error, exit
status is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple hosts are specified
for communication, the exit status is 0 if and only if all
targets successfully execute. Otherwise the exit status is
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in interactive
mode, the exit value will be based on the last power
operation executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
On older operating systems, if you input your username,
password, and other potentially security relevant
information on the command line, this information may be
discovered by <br>
other users when using tools like the ps(1) command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K <br>
options. Configuring security relevant information in the
FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way
to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent brute force
attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock up&quot;
after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need
to wait awhile in order to this tempo&acirc; <br>
rary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may authenticate
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI specifications do not
require BMCs to perform a power control operation before
returning a completion code to the caller. Therefore, it is
possible for ipmipower to return <br>
power status queries opposite of what you are expecting. For
example, if a &quot;power off&quot; operation is performed,
a BMC may return a successful completion code to ipmipower
before <br>
the &quot;power off&quot; operation is actually performed.
Subsequent power status queries may return &quot;on&quot;
for several seconds, until the BMC actually performs the
&quot;power off&quot; operation.</p>
