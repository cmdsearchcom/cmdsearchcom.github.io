Manager&rsquo;s Manual FEDFS-MAP-NFS4(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fedfs-map-nfs4 - generate automounter program map entries
for FedFS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fedfs-map-nfs4 domainname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for
short). FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism by
which system administrators construct a coherent namespace
<br>
across multiple file servers using file system referrals.
For further details, see fedfs(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fedfs-map-nfs4(8) command provides a FedFS program map
for the local system&rsquo;s automounter. Although it is
typically intended to be invoked by the automounter, it is
also <br>
safe to invoke directly for scripting or debugging purposes.
See autofs(5) for information about how program maps
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation <br>
The fedfs-map-nfs4(8) command locates FedFS domains by
looking for DNS SRV records that advertise file servers
exporting FedFS domain root replicas. The domainname
argument <br>
determines what FedFS domain is to be mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It retrieves and sorts the
domain root replica records according to SRV record sorting
rules outlined in RFC 2782. It then generates a sun format
map entry on stdout represent&acirc; <br>
ing the set of servers contained in the SRV record, a
standard export path to the domain root, and appropriate NFS
mount options. Error messages are output on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Globally useful names <br>
Across all FedFS-enabled file system clients, a unique file
object in a FedFS domain is always accessed via the same
pathname. Such pathnames are referred to as globally useful
<br>
names. See fedfs(7) for a full discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The top-level directory of a
globally useful name is always the networked file system
type (NFS version 4, CIFS, and so on). A fedfs-map-nfs4(8)
program map entry is used with <br>
the NFS version 4 top-level directory to provide globally
useful names via the NFS version 4 protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Typically, a fedfs-map-nfs4(8) entry in /etc/auto.master
looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/nfs4
/usr/sbin/fedfs-map-nfs4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under the /nfs4 directory on the
local system, the automounter uses fedfs-map-nfs4(8) to
convert a FedFS domain name to a set of servers and an
export path, which are then passed <br>
to mount.nfs(8). The automounter mounts this FedFS domain on
the directory /nfs4/domainname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After configuring and restarting
autofs, to access files in the example.net FedFS domain, for
instance, you can start with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cd /nfs4/example.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The automounter uses the
fedfs-map-nfs4(8) command to look up the file servers that
provide the domain root for the example.net domain. It then
mounts one of these servers on <br>
/nfs4/example.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the fedfs-map-nfs4(8) command
cannot find the requested domain, no local directory is
created and no mount operation is performed. Applications
receive an ENOENT error in <br>
this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While these mounted domains
remain active on the local system, the mounted-on
directories remain visible. After a period of inactivity,
the automounter automatically unmounts a <br>
FedFS domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local applications browsing the
top-level directory do not see all available FedFS domains.
They see only the ones that are mounted and active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount option inheritance <br>
The Linux NFS client treats an NFS referral as a
server-initiated mount request. The referring fileserver
provides only a list of server names and export paths. The
mount <br>
options for this new mount are inherited from the new mount
point&rsquo;s parent directory on the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As applications proceed deeper
into a domain&rsquo;s namespace, they can encounter both
file sets to which they have read-only access, and file sets
to which they have read-write <br>
access. To allow applications proper access to both types of
file sets, typically file-access clients mount domain root
directories in read-write mode. All submounts of the <br>
domain root are then mounted read-write as well. Write
access is controlled by fileservers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a domain root may
contain an NFS version 4 referral to an export containing
user home directories. The domain root may be exported
read-only so file-access clients <br>
cannot update it, but user home directories would not be
very useful if they could not be written to by their owners.
The fileserver continues to employ user credentials to <br>
limit access as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network file system clients
follow file system referrals as applications encounter them,
which is similar to how an automounter works. Consider the
initial mount of the domain <br>
root as if you are mounting a single whole file system, even
though underneath, additional NFS mounts come and go as
needed.</p>
