<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sginfo - access mode page information for a SCSI (or ATAPI)
device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sginfo [OPTIONS] [DEVICE] [REPLACEMENT_PARAMETERS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sginfo is a port of the Linux scsiinfo program by Eric
Youngdale. It uses SCSI generic (sg) devices; however in
some cases the high level device name (i.e. sd, sr, st,
osst, or <br>
hd) can also be used. The primary role of this program is to
access mode page information. If permitted, mode page
information can be altered. In addition information from the
<br>
INQUIRY and READ DEFECTS commands are also available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is in legacy mode,
only obvious bugs will be fixed. Options like -l (to list
devices) are broken in recent versions of Linux (e.g. 2.6
series and later); the lss&acirc; <br>
csi(8) utility can be used instead. Also mode pages are not
being updated as http://www.t10.org adds and modifies mode
page fields. Those interested in SCSI mode pages may find
<br>
the sdparm utility more up to date and easier use,
especially for changing parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Four sets of values are
maintained by a SCSI device for each mode page: current
(active), default (manufacturer&rsquo;s supplied values),
saved (values that are retained if the SCSI <br>
device is powered down), and changeable (mask indicating
those values that can be changed). By default when a mode
page is displayed the current values are shown. This can be
<br>
overridden by &quot;-M&quot; (defaults), &quot;-S&quot;
(saved) or &quot;-m&quot; (modifiable (i.e.
changeable)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many mode pages are decoded: for
disks (see SBC-2), for CD/DVDs (see MMC-2/3/4/5), for tapes
(see SSC-2) and for enclosures (see SES-2). Some mode pages
common to all SCSI <br>
peripheral device types are defined in SPC-4 (primary
commands). A decoded mode page has its field names in the
first column and the corresponding value in the second
column. A <br>
&quot;hex&quot; mode page (and subpage) has its byte
position in the first column (in hex and starting at 0x2)
and the corresponding hex value in the second column.
Decoded pages can be <br>
viewed with the &rsquo;-t&rsquo; option or with a specific
option (e.g. &rsquo;c&rsquo; for the caching mode page).
Naturally decoded pages must be supplied by the DEVICE and
recognised by this pro&acirc; <br>
gram. If supported by the device, decoded pages may be
modified. All mode pages (and subpages) that the device
supports can be viewed in hex (and potentially modified) via
the <br>
&quot;-u&quot; option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no options are given that
will cause mode page(s) or INQUIRY data to be printed out,
then a brief INQUIRY response is output. This includes the
vendor, product and revision <br>
level of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-6 Perform 6 byte MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT commands; by
default the 10 byte variants are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Display some INQUIRY data and
the unit serial number followed by all mode pages reported
by the device. It is similar to the &rsquo;-t 0x3f&rsquo;
option. If the mode page is known <br>
then it is output in decoded form otherwise it is output in
hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Display some INQUIRY data and
the unit serial number followed by all mode pages and all
mode subpages reported by the device. It is similar to the
&rsquo;-t 0x3f,0xff&rsquo; option. <br>
If a mode (sub)page is known then it is output in decoded
form otherwise it is output in hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Access information in the
Caching mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Access information in the
Control mode Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Display defect lists (default
format: index).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Access information in the
Disconnect-Reconnect mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Access information in the
Error Recovery mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Access information in the
Control Extension mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Access information in the
Format Device mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Farg Format of the defect
lists: <br>
-Flogical - logical block addresses (32 bit) <br>
-Flba64 - logical block addresses (64 bit) <br>
-Fphysical - physical blocks <br>
-Findex - defect bytes from index <br>
-Fhead - sort by head <br>
Used in conjunction with &quot;-d&quot; or &quot;-G&quot;.
If a format is not given &quot;index&quot; is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Access information in the
Rigid Disk Drive Geometry mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Display grown defect list
(default format: index).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Display the response to a
standard INQUIRY command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Access the Informational
Exceptions mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Deprecated. Only use in old
versions of Linux (e.g. 2.4 and earlier). Please use
lsscsi(8) in the Linux 2.6 series and later. List known SCSI
devices on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Access information in the
Notch and Partition mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Negate (i.e. stop) mode page
changes being placed in the &quot;saved&quot; page (by
default changes go to the current and the saved page). Only
active when used together with &rsquo;-R&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Access information in the
Power Condition mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Display all raw (or primary)
SCSI device names visible in the /dev directory. Examples
are /dev/sda, /dev/st1 and /dev/scd2. Does not list sg
device names so devices such <br>
as a SCSI enclosure which only have an sg device name are
not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Display information in the
unit serial number page which is a INQUIRY command
variant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t PN[,SPN] <br>
Display information from mode page number PN (and optionally
sub page number SPN) in decoded format (if known, otherwise
in hex form). PN is a mode page number in a deci&acirc; <br>
mal number from 0 to 63 inclusive. SPN is the mode subpage
number and is assumed to be 0 if not given. SPN is a decimal
number from 1 to 255 inclusive. A page number of <br>
63 returns all pages supported by the device in ascending
order except for page 0 which, if present, is last. Page 0
is vendor specific and not necessarily in mode page <br>
format. Alternatively hex values can be given for both PN
and SPN (both prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Trace commands to obtain more
verbose output (for debugging). When used once SCSI commands
are shown (in hex) and any errors from these SCSI commands
are spelt out (i.e. <br>
with a decoded and raw sense buffer). When used twice, the
additional data sent with mode select and the response from
mode sense are shown (in hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u PN[,SPN] <br>
Display information from mode page number PN (and optionally
SPN) in hex form. PN is a mode page number in a decimal
number from 0 to 63 inclusive. SPN is the mode subpage <br>
number and is assumed to be 0 if not given. SPN is a decimal
number from 1 to 255 inclusive. A page number of 63 returns
all pages supported by the device in ascending <br>
order except for page 0 which, if present, is last. Page 0
is vendor specific and not necessarily in mode page format.
Alternatively hex values can be given for both PN <br>
and SPN (both prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo;). For example 63
and 0x3f are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display version string then
exit. [N.B. This option increases verbosity for most other
utilities in this package as outlined in &rsquo;man 8
sg3_utils&rsquo;. This odd usage is for <br>
backward compatibility with the scsiinfo utility.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Access information in the
Verify Error Recovery mode page. [N.B. This option prints
the version string then exits in most other utilities in
this package as outlined in <br>
&rsquo;man 8 sg3_utils&rsquo;. This odd usage is for
backward compatibility with the scsiinfo utility.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z do a single fetch for mode
pages (over-estimating the expected length of the returned
response). The default action is to do a double fetch, the
first fetch is to find the <br>
response length that could be returned. Devices that closely
adhere to SCSI standards should not require this option,
some real world devices do require it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED OPTIONS <br>
Only one of the following three options can be specified.
None of these three implies the current values are
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Display modifiable fields
instead of current values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Display manufacturer&rsquo;s
defaults instead of current values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Display saved defaults
instead of current values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are advanced
options, not generally suited for most users:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Display output values in a
list. Make them suitable for editing and being given back to
the &rsquo;-R&rsquo; (replace command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&minus;R Replace parameters -
best used with -X (expert use only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGING MODE PAGE PARAMETERS
<br>
Firstly you should know what you are doing before changing
existing parameters. Taking the control page as an example,
first list it out normally (e.g. &quot;sginfo -C
/dev/sda&quot;) and <br>
decide which parameter is to be changed (note its position
relative to the other lines output). Then execute the same
sginfo command with the &quot;-X&quot; option added; this
will output <br>
the parameter values in a single row in the same relative
positions as the previous command. Now execute &quot;sginfo
-CXR /dev/sda ...&quot; with the &quot;...&quot; replaced by
the single row of <br>
values output by the previous command, with the relevant
parameter changed. Here is a simplified example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sginfo -C /dev/sda <br>
Control mode page (0xa) <br>
----------------------- <br>
TST 0 <br>
D_SENSE 0 <br>
GLTSD 1 <br>
RLEC 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Actually the Control page has
more parameters that shown above.] Next output those
parameters in single line form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sginfo -CX /dev/sda <br>
0 0 1 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let us assume that the GLTSD bit
is to be cleared. The command that will clear it is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sginfo -CXR /dev/sda 0 0 0
0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same number of parameters
output by the &quot;-CX&quot; command needs to be placed at
the end of the &quot;-CXR&quot; command line (after the
device name). Now check that the change took <br>
effect:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sginfo -C /dev/sda <br>
Control mode page (0xa) <br>
----------------------- <br>
TST 0 <br>
D_SENSE 0 <br>
GLTSD 0 <br>
RLEC 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a mode page is
&quot;replaced&quot; the default action is to change both
the current page and the saved page. [For some reason
versions of sginfo and scsiinfo prior to 2.0 did not <br>
change the &quot;saved&quot; page.] To change only the
current mode page but not the corresponding saved page use
the &quot;-N&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATING SCRIPT FILES AND HEX
PAGES <br>
The &quot;-aX&quot; or &quot;-AX&quot; option generates
output suitable for a script file. Mode pages are output in
list format (after the INQUIRY and serial number) one page
per line. To facili&acirc; <br>
tate running the output as (part of) a script file to assert
chosen mode page values, each line is prefixed by
&quot;sginfo -t PN[,SPN] -XR &quot;. When such a script file
is run, it will <br>
have the effect of re-asserting the mode page values to what
they were when the &quot;-aX&quot; generated the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All mode pages (and subpages)
supported by the device can be accessed via the -t and -u
options. To see all mode pages supported by the device use
&quot;-u 63&quot;. [To see all mode pages <br>
and all subpages use &quot;-u 63,255&quot;.] To list the
control mode page in hex (mode page index in the first
column and the corresponding byte value in the second
column) use &quot;-u 0xa&quot;. <br>
Mode pages (subpage code == 0) start at index position 2
while subpages start at index position 4. If the &quot;-Xu
...&quot; option is used then a list a hex values each value
prefixed <br>
by &quot;@&quot; is output. Mode (sub)page values can then
be modified with the &quot;-RXu ...&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
The SCSI MODE SENSE command yields block descriptors as well
as a mode page(s). This utility ignores block descriptors
and does not display them. The &quot;disable block
descriptor&quot; <br>
switch (DBD) in the MODE SENSE command is not set since some
devices yield errors when it is set. When mode page values
are being changed (the &quot;-R&quot; option), the same
block <br>
descriptor obtained by reading the mode page (i.e. via a
MODE SENSE command) is sent back when the mode page is
written (i.e. via a MODE SELECT command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
scsiinfo version 1.0 was released by Eric Youngdale on 1st
November 1993. The most recent version of scsiinfo is
version 1.7 with the last patches by Michael Weller. sginfo
is <br>
derived from scsiinfo and uses the sg interface to get
around the 4 KB buffer limit in scsiinfo that cramped the
display of defect lists especially. sginfo was written by
Douglas <br>
Gilbert with patches from Kurt Garloff. This manpage
corresponds with version 2.25 of sginfo.</p>
