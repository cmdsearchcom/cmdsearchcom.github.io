<p>EXIM_DBMBUILD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
EXIM_DBMBUILD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exim_dbmbuild - Build a DBM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
exim_dbmbuild [-nolc] [-nozero] [-noduperr] [-nowarn]
inputfile|- outputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The exim_dbmbuild program reads an input file containing
keys and data in the format used by the lsearch lookup (see
section 9.1). It writes a DBM file using the lower-cased
<br>
alias names as keys and the remainder of the information as
data. The lower-casing can be prevented by calling the
program with the -nolc option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A terminating zero is included
as part of the key string. This is expected by the dbm
lookup type. However, if the option -nozero is given,
exim_dbmbuild creates files without <br>
terminating zeroes in either the key strings or the data
strings. The dbmnz lookup type can be used with such
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program requires two
arguments: the name of the input file (which can be a single
hyphen to indicate the standard input), and the name of the
output file. It creates the <br>
output under a temporary name, and then renames it if all
went well. If the native DB interface is in use (USE_DB is
set in a compile-time configuration file - this is common in
<br>
free versions of Unix) the two file names must be different,
because in this mode the Berkeley DB functions create a
single output file using exactly the name given. For
exam&acirc; <br>
ple,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exim_dbmbuild /etc/aliases
/etc/aliases.db</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reads the system alias file and
creates a DBM version of it in /etc/aliases.db.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In systems that use the ndbm
routines (mostly proprietary versions of Unix), two files
are used, with the suffixes .dir and .pag. In this
environment, the suffixes are added to <br>
the second argument of exim_dbmbuild, so it can be the same
as the first. This is also the case when the Berkeley
functions are used in compatibility mode (though this is not
<br>
recommended), because in that case it adds a .db suffix to
the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a duplicate key is
encountered, the program outputs a warning, and when it
finishes, its return code is 1 rather than zero, unless the
-noduperr option is used. By default, <br>
only the first of a set of duplicates is used - this makes
it compatible with lsearch lookups. There is an option
-lastdup which causes it to use the data for the last
duplicate <br>
instead. There is also an option -nowarn, which stops it
listing duplicate keys to &acirc;stderr&acirc;. For other
errors, where it doesn&rsquo;t actually make a new file, the
return code is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows
better groff than us and has more experience in writing
manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.</p>
