<p>EXICYCLOG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
EXICYCLOG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exicyclog - Cycle exim&rsquo;s logfiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
eximcyclog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The exicyclog script can be used to cycle (rotate) mainlog
and rejectlog files. This is not necessary if only syslog is
being used. Some operating systems have their own
stan&acirc; <br>
dard mechanisms for log cycling, and these can be used
instead of exicyclog if preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each time exicyclog is run the
file names get &acirc;shuffled down&acirc; by one. If the
main log file name is mainlog (the default) then when
exicyclog is run mainlog becomes mainlog.01, <br>
the previous mainlog.01 becomes mainlog.02 and so on, up to
a limit which is set in the script, and which defaults to
10. Reject logs are handled similarly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no mainlog file exists, the
script does nothing. Files that &acirc;drop off&acirc; the
end are deleted. All files with numbers greater than 01 are
compressed, using a compression com&acirc; <br>
mand which is configured by the COMPRESS_COMMAND setting in
Local/Makefile. It is usual to run &acirc;exicyclog&acirc;
daily from a root &acirc;crontab&acirc; entry of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 0 * * * su exim -c
/usr/exim/bin/exicyclog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assuming you have used the name
&acirc;exim&acirc; for the Exim user. You can run exicyclog
as root if you wish, but there is no need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows
better groff than us and has more experience in writing
manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.</p>
