<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The shorewall-lite utility is used to control the Shoreline
Firewall Lite (Shorewall Lite).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The trace and debug options are used for debugging. See
http://www.shorewall.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm#Trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nolock option prevents the
command from attempting to acquire the Shorewall-lite
lockfile. It is useful if you need to include shorewall
commands in the startedextension <br>
script[1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options control the amount
of output that the command produces. They consist of a
sequence of the letters v and q. If the options are omitted,
the amount of output is <br>
determined by the setting of the VERBOSITY parameter in
shorewall.conf[2](5). Each v adds one to the effective
verbosity and each q subtracts one from the effective
VERBOSITY. <br>
Alternately, v may be followed immediately with one of
-1,0,1,2 to specify VERBOSITY. There may be no white-space
between v and the VERBOSITY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options may also include the
letter t which causes all progress messages to be
timestamped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The available commands are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add { interface[:host-list]...
zone | zone host-list } <br>
Adds a list of hosts or subnets to a dynamic zone usually
used with VPN&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interface argument names an
interface defined in the shorewall-interfaces[3](5) file. A
host-list is comma-separated list whose elements are host or
network addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution <br>
The add command is not very robust. If there are errors in
the host-list, you may see a large number of error messages
yet a subsequent shorewall-lite show zones command <br>
will indicate that all hosts were added. If this happens,
replace add by delete and run the same command again. Then
enter the correct command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow address <br>
Re-enables receipt of packets from hosts previously
blacklisted by a drop, logdrop, reject, or logreject
command. Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.10, this command can
also <br>
re-enable addresses blacklisted using the blacklist
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blacklist address [ option ... ]
<br>
Added in Shorewall 5.0.8 and requires
DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=ipset.. in shorewall.conf[4](5). Causes
packets from the given host or network address to be
dropped, based on the <br>
setting of BLACKLIST in shorewall.conf[4](5). The address
along with any options are passed to the ipset add
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the disconnect option is
specified in the DYNAMIC_BLACKLISTING setting, then the
effective VERBOSITY determines the amount of information
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the effective
verbosity is &gt; 0, then a message giving the number of
conntrack flows deleted by the command is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the effective
verbosity is &gt; 1, then the conntrack table entries
deleted by the command are also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call function [ parameter ... ]
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.10. Allows you to call a function in
one of the Shorewall libraries or in your compiled script.
function must name the shell function to be called. The <br>
listed parameters are passed to the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function is first searched
for in lib.base, lib.common and lib.cli. If it is not found,
the call command is passed to the generated script to be
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear [-f] <br>
Clear will remove all rules and chains installed by
Shorewall-lite. The firewall is then wide open and
unprotected. Existing connections are untouched. Clear is
often used to <br>
see if the firewall is causing connection problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -f is given, the command will
be processed by the compiled script that executed the last
successful start, reload, restart or refresh command if that
script exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close { open-number | source
dest [ protocol [ port ] ] } <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.5.8. This command closes a temporary
open created by the open command. In the first form, an
open-number specifies the open to be closed. Open numbers
<br>
are displayed in the num column of the output of the
shorewall-lite show opens command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the second form of the
command is used, the parameters must match those given in
the earlier open command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete {
interface[:host-list]... zone | zone host-list } <br>
The delete command reverses the effect of an earlier add
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interface argument names an
interface defined in the shorewall-interfaces[3](5) file. A
host-list is comma-separated list whose elements are a host
or network address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable { interface | provider }
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Disables the optional provider
associated with the specified interface or provider. Where
more than one provider share a single network interface,
<br>
a provider name must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drop address <br>
Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be silently
dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump [-x] [-l] [-m] [-c] <br>
Produces a verbose report about the firewall configuration
for the purpose of problem analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -x option causes actual
packet and byte counts to be displayed. Without that option,
these counts are abbreviated. The -m option causes any MAC
addresses included in <br>
Shorewall-lite log messages to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option causes the rule
number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option causes the route
cache to be dumped in addition to the other routing
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable { interface | provider }
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Enables the optional provider
associated with the specified interface or provider. Where
more than one provider share a single network interface, a
<br>
provider name must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forget [ filename ] <br>
Deletes /var/lib/shorewall-lite/filename and
/var/lib/shorewall-lite/save. If no filename is given then
the file specified by RESTOREFILE in shorewall.conf[2](5) is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Displays a syntax summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hits [-t] <br>
Generates several reports from Shorewall-lite log messages
in the current log file. If the -t option is included, the
reports are restricted to log messages generated today.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcalc { address mask |
address/vlsm } <br>
Ipcalc displays the network address, broadcast address,
network in CIDR notation and netmask corresponding to the
input[s].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iprange address1-address2 <br>
Iprange decomposes the specified range of IP addresses into
the equivalent list of network/host addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iptrace iptables match
expression <br>
This is a low-level debugging command that causes iptables
TRACE log records to be created. See iptables(8) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The iptables match expression
must be one or more matches that may appear in both the raw
table OUTPUT and raw table PREROUTING chains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trace records are written to
the kernel&rsquo;s log buffer with facility = kernel and
priority = warning, and they are routed from there by your
logging daemon (syslogd, <br>
rsyslog, syslog-ng, ...) -- Shorewall-lite has no control
over where the messages go; consult your logging
daemon&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list <br>
list is a synonym for show -- please see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logdrop address <br>
Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be logged then
discarded. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the
BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in shorewall.conf[2] (5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch [-m] [refresh-interval]
<br>
Monitors the log file specified by the LOGFILE option in
shorewall.conf[2](5) and produces an audible alarm when new
Shorewall-lite messages are logged. The -m option causes
<br>
the MAC address of each packet source to be displayed if
that information is available. The refresh-interval
specifies the time in seconds between screen refreshes. You
can <br>
enter a negative number by preceding the number with
&quot;--&quot; (e.g., shorewall-lite logwatch -- -30). In
this case, when a packet count changes, you will be prompted
to hit any <br>
key to resume screen refreshes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logreject address <br>
Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be logged then
rejected. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the
BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in shorewall.conf[2] (5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls <br>
ls is a synonym for show -- please see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noiptrace iptables match
expression <br>
This is a low-level debugging command that cancels a trace
started by a preceding iptrace command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The iptables match expression
must be one given in the iptrace command being canceled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open source dest [ protocol [
port ] ] <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.8. This command requires that the
firewall be in the started state and that
DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall.conf (5)[4]. The effect
of the command <br>
is to temporarily open the firewall for connections matching
the parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source and dest parameters
may each be specified as all if you don&rsquo;t wish to
restrict the connection source or destination respectively.
Otherwise, each must contain a <br>
host or network address or a valid DNS name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol may be specified
either as a number or as a name listed in /etc/protocols.
The port may be specified numerically or as a name listed in
/etc/services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reverse the effect of a
successful open command, use the close command with the same
parameters or simply restart the firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: To open the firewall
for SSH connections to address 192.168.1.1, the command
would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shorewall-lite open all
192.168.1.1 tcp 22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reverse that command,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shorewall-lite close all
192.168.1.1 tcp 22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reenable{ interface | provider }
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.9. This is equivalent to a disable
command followed by an enable command on the specified
interface or provider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reject address <br>
Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be silently
rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload [-n] [-p] [-C] <br>
Added in Shorewall 5.0.0, reload is similar to
shorewall-lite start except that it assumes that the
firewall is already started. Existing connections are
maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option causes
Shorewall-lite to avoid updating the routing table(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option causes the
connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack
utility must be installed to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.5. If the specified (or implicit) firewall
script is the one that generated the current running
configuration, then the running <br>
netfilter configuration will be reloaded as is so as to
preserve the iptables packet and byte counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset [chain, ...] <br>
Resets the packet and byte counters in the specified
chain(s). If no chain is specified, all the packet and byte
counters in the firewall are reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart [-n] [-p] [-C] <br>
Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.0, this command performs a true
restart. The firewall is completely stopped as if a stop
command had been issued then it is started again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option causes
Shorewall-lite to avoid updating the routing table(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option causes the
connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack
utility must be installed to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.5. If the specified (or implicit) firewall
script is the one that generated the current running
configuration, then the running <br>
netfilter configuration will be reloaded as is so as to
preserve the iptables packet and byte counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore [-n] [-p] [-C] [
filename ] <br>
Restore Shorewall-lite to a state saved using the
shorewall-lite save command. Existing connections are
maintained. The filename names a restore file in <br>
/var/lib/shorewall-lite created using shorewall-lite save;
if no filename is given then Shorewall-lite will be restored
from the file specified by the RESTOREFILE option in <br>
shorewall.conf[2](5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution <br>
If your iptables ruleset depends on variables that are
detected at run-time, either in your params file or by
Shorewall-generated code, restore will use the values that
<br>
were current when the ruleset was saved, which may be
different from the current values. <br>
The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing
table(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option, added in
Shorewall 4.6.5, causes the connection tracking table to be
flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.5. If the -C option was specified during
shorewall save, then the counters saved by that operation
will be restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run command [ parameter ... ]
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.3. Executes command in the context of
the generated script passing the supplied parameters.
Normally, the command will be a function declared in <br>
lib.private.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before executing the command,
the script will detect the configuration, setting all SW_*
variables and will run your init extension script with
$COMMAND = &rsquo;run&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save [-C] [ filename ] <br>
The dynamic blacklist is stored in
/var/lib/shorewall-lite/save. The state of the firewall is
stored in /var/lib/shorewall-lite/filename for use by the
shorewall-lite <br>
restore. If filename is not given then the state is saved in
the file specified by the RESTOREFILE option in
shorewall.conf[2](5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option, added in
Shorewall 4.6.5, causes the iptables packet and byte
counters to be saved along with the chains and rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">savesets <br>
Added in shorewall 4.6.8. Performs the same action as the
stop command with respect to saving ipsets (see the
SAVE_IPSETS option in shorewall.conf[4] (5)). This command
may <br>
be used to proactively save your ipset contents in the event
that a system failure occurs prior to issuing a stop
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show <br>
The show command can have a number of different
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bl|blacklists [-x] <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.2. Displays the dynamic chain along
with any chains produced by entries in
shorewall-blrules(5).The -x option is passed directly
through to <br>
iptables and causes actual packet and byte counts to be
displayed. Without this option, those counts are
abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-f] capabilities <br>
Displays your kernel/iptables capabilities. The -f option
causes the display to be formatted as a capabilities file
for use with compile -e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-b] [-x] [-l] [-t
{filter|mangle|nat|raw|rawpost}] [ chain... ] <br>
The rules in each chain are displayed using the iptables
-Lchain-n -v command. If no chain is given, all of the
chains in the filter table are displayed. The -x option is
<br>
passed directly through to iptables and causes actual packet
and byte counts to be displayed. Without this option, those
counts are abbreviated. The -t option specifies <br>
the Netfilter table to display. The default is filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b (&rsquo;brief&rsquo;)
option causes rules which have not been used (i.e. which
have zero packet and byte counts) to be omitted from the
output. Chains with no rules displayed <br>
are also omitted from the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option causes the rule
number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the t option and the chain
keyword are both omitted and any of the listed chains do not
exist, a usage message is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classifiers|filters <br>
Displays information about the packet classifiers defined on
the system as a result of traffic shaping configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config <br>
Displays distribution-specific defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connections [filter_parameter
...] <br>
Displays the IP connections currently being tracked by the
firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the conntrack utility is
installed, beginning with Shorewall 4.6.11 the set of
connections displayed can be limited by including conntrack
filter parameters (-p , -s, <br>
--dport, etc). See conntrack(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">event event <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.5.19. Displays the named event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">events <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.5.19. Displays all events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip <br>
Displays the system&rsquo;s IPv4 configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.17. Displays the per-IP accounting
counters (shorewall-accounting[5] (5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-m] log <br>
Displays the last 20 Shorewall-lite messages from the log
file specified by the LOGFILE option in
shorewall.conf[2](5). The -m option causes the MAC address
of each <br>
packet source to be displayed if that information is
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-x] mangle <br>
Displays the Netfilter mangle table using the command
iptables -t mangle -L -n -v. The -x option is passed
directly through to iptables and causes actual packet and
byte <br>
counts to be displayed. Without this option, those counts
are abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">marks <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Displays the various fields in
packet marks giving the min and max value (in both decimal
and hex) and the applicable mask (in hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nat <br>
Displays the Netfilter nat table using the command iptables
-t nat -L -n -v.The -x option is passed directly through to
iptables and causes actual packet and byte counts <br>
to be displayed. Without this option, those counts are
abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opens <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.5.8. Displays the iptables rules in the
&rsquo;dynamic&rsquo; chain created through use of the open
command..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policies <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.4. Displays the applicable policy
between each pair of zones. Note that implicit intrazone
ACCEPT policies are not displayed for zones associated <br>
with a single network where that network doesn&rsquo;t
specify routeback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">routing <br>
Displays the system&rsquo;s IPv4 routing configuration. The
-c option causes the route cache to be displayed in addition
to the other routing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw <br>
Displays the Netfilter raw table using the command iptables
-t raw -L -n -v.The -x option is passed directly through to
iptables and causes actual packet and byte counts <br>
to be displayed. Without this option, those counts are
abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc <br>
Displays information about queuing disciplines, classes and
filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zones <br>
Displays the current composition of the Shorewall zones on
the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start [-p] [-n] [-f] [-C] <br>
Start Shorewall Lite. Existing connections through
shorewall-lite managed interfaces are untouched. New
connections will be allowed only if they are allowed by the
firewall <br>
rules or policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option causes the
connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack
utility must be installed to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option prevents the
firewall script from modifying the current routing
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.5. If the RESTOREFILE named in
shorewall.conf[2](5) exists, is executable and is not older
than the current filewall script, then <br>
that saved configuration is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.5 and is only meaningful when the -f option is
also specified. If the previously-saved configuration is
restored, and if the -C <br>
option was also specified in the save command, then the
packet and byte counters will be restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop <br>
Stops the firewall. All existing connections, except those
listed in shorewall-routestopped[6](5) or permitted by the
ADMINISABSENTMINDED option in shorewall.conf[2](5), are <br>
taken down. The only new traffic permitted through the
firewall is from systems listed in
shorewall-routestopped[6](5) or by ADMINISABSENTMINDED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -f is given, the command will
be processed by the compiled script that executed the last
successful start, restart or refresh command if that script
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
Produces a short report about the state of the
Shorewall-configured firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.2 and causes the status of each optional or
provider interface to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Displays Shorewall&rsquo;s version. The -a option is
included for compatibility with earlier Shorewall releases
and is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
In general, when a command succeeds, status 0 is returned;
when the command fails, a non-zero status is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status command returns exit
status as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Firewall is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 - Firewall is stopped or
cleared</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 - Unknown state; usually means
that the firewall has never been started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Two environmental variables are recognized by
Shorewall-lite:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT <br>
When set to 1, causes Std out to be redirected to the file
specified in the STARTUP_LOG option in
shorewall.conf(5)[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SW_LOGGERTAG <br>
