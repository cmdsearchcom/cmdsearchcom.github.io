Three utility programs are provided for maintaining the DBM files that Exim uses
  to contain its delivery hint information. Each program requires two arguments.
  The first specifies the name of Exim's spool directory, and the second is the
  name of the database it is to operate on. These are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>retry</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the database of retry information</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>wait-&lt;transport name&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">databases of information about messages waiting for remote
      hosts</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>callout</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the callout cache</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ratelimit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the data for implementing the ratelimit ACL condition</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>misc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">other hints data (for example, for serializing ETRN
    runs)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The entire contents of a database are written to the standard output by the
  <b>exim_dumpdb</b> program, which has no options or arguments other than the
  spool and database names. For example, to dump the retry database:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>exim_dumpdb /var/spool/exim4 retry</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Two lines of output are produced for each entry:
<pre>
    T:mail.ref.example:192.168.242.242 146 77 Connection refused
  31-Oct-1995 12:00:12  02-Nov-1995 12:21:39  02-Nov-1995 20:21:39 *
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
The first item on the first line is the key of the record. It starts with one of
  the letters R, or T, depending on whether it refers to a routing or transport
  retry. For a local delivery, the next part is the local address; for a remote
  delivery it is the name of the remote host, followed by its failing IP address
  (unless &#x201C;retry_include_ip_address&#x201D; is set false on the smtp
  transport). If the remote port is not the standard one (port 25), it is added
  to the IP address. Then there follows an error code, an additional error code,
  and a textual description of the error.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The three times on the second line are the time of first failure, the time of
  the last delivery attempt, and the computed time for the next attempt. The
  line ends with an asterisk if the cutoff time for the last retry rule has been
  exceeded.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each output line from <b>exim_dumpdb</b> for the <i>wait-xxx</i> databases
  consists of a host name followed by a list of ids for messages that are or
  were waiting to be delivered to that host. If there are a very large number
  for any one host, continuation records, with a sequence number added to the
  host name, may be seen. The data in these records is often out of date,
  because a message may be routed to several alternative hosts, and Exim makes
  no effort to keep cross-references.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>exim_tidydb</b> utility program is used to tidy up the contents of a
  hints database. If run with no options, it removes all records that are more
  than 30 days old. The age is calculated from the date and time that the record
  was last updated. Note that, in the case of the retry database, it is not the
  time since the first delivery failure. Information about a host that has been
  down for more than 30 days will remain in the database, provided that the
  record is updated sufficiently often.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The cutoff date can be altered by means of the -t option, which must be followed
  by a time. For example, to remove all records older than a week from the retry
  database:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>exim_tidydb -t 7d /var/spool/exim4 retry</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Both the <i>wait-xxx</i> and <i>retry</i> databases contain items that involve
  message ids. In the former these appear as data in records keyed by host -
  they were messages that were waiting for that host - and in the latter they
  are the keys for retry information for messages that have suffered certain
  types of error. When &#x201C;exim_tidydb&#x201D; is run, a check is made to
  ensure that message ids in database records are those of messages that are
  still on the queue. Message ids for messages that no longer exist are removed
  from &#x201C;wait-&#x201D;xxx records, and if this leaves any records empty,
  they are deleted. For the &#x201C;retry&#x201D; database, records whose keys
  are non-existent message ids are removed. The <b>exim_tidydb</b> utility
  outputs comments on the standard output whenever it removes information from
  the database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Certain records are automatically removed by Exim when they are no longer
  needed, but others are not. For example, if all the MX hosts for a domain are
  down, a retry record is created for each one. If the primary MX host comes
  back first, its record is removed when Exim successfully delivers to it, but
  the records for the others remain because Exim has not tried to use those
  hosts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is important, therefore, to run &#x201C;exim_tidydb&#x201D; periodically on
  all the hints databases. You should do this at a quiet time of day, because it
  requires a database to be locked (and therefore inaccessible to Exim) while it
  does its work. Removing records from a DBM file does not normally make the
  file smaller, but all the common DBM libraries are able to re-use the space
  that is released. After an initial phase of increasing in size, the databases
  normally reach a point at which they no longer get any bigger, as long as they
  are regularly tidied.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Warning: If you never run &#x201C;exim_tidydb&#x201D;, the space used by the
  hints databases is likely to keep on increasing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>exim_fixdb</b> program is a utility for interactively modifying
  databases. Its main use is for testing Exim, but it might also be occasionally
  useful for getting round problems in a live system. It has no options, and its
  interface is somewhat crude. On entry, it prompts for input with a right
  angle-bracket. A key of a database record can then be entered, and the data
  for that record is displayed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If &#x2018;d&#x2019; is typed at the next prompt, the entire record is deleted.
  For all except the <i>retry</i> database, that is the only operation that can
  be carried out. For the <i>retry</i> database, each field is output preceded
  by a number, and data for individual fields can be changed by typing the field
  number followed by new data, for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 &gt; 4 951102:1000
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
resets the time of the next delivery attempt. Time values are given as a
  sequence of digit pairs for year, month, day, hour, and minute. Colons can be
  used as optional separators.

This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us
  and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly
  appreciated.
