<p>EXIM_DB(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual EXIM_DB(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exim_db - Exim&rsquo;s hint databases maintenance
(exim_dumpdb, exim_fixdb, exim_tidydb)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
exim_dumpdb spooldir database <br>
exim_fixdb spooldir database <br>
exim_tidydb [-f] [-t time] spooldir database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Three utility programs are provided for maintaining the DBM
files that Exim uses to contain its delivery hint
information. Each program requires two arguments. The first
speci&acirc; <br>
fies the name of Exim&rsquo;s spool directory, and the
second is the name of the database it is to operate on.
These are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retry the database of retry
information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait-&lt;transport name&gt; <br>
databases of information about messages waiting for remote
hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callout <br>
the callout cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ratelimit <br>
the data for implementing the ratelimit ACL condition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">misc other hints data (for
example, for serializing ETRN runs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entire contents of a
database are written to the standard output by the
exim_dumpdb program, which has no options or arguments other
than the spool and database names. For <br>
example, to dump the retry database:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exim_dumpdb /var/spool/exim4
retry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two lines of output are produced
for each entry: <br>
T:mail.ref.example:192.168.242.242 146 77 Connection refused
<br>
31-Oct-1995 12:00:12 02-Nov-1995 12:21:39 02-Nov-1995
20:21:39 *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first item on the first line
is the key of the record. It starts with one of the letters
R, or T, depending on whether it refers to a routing or
transport retry. For a <br>
local delivery, the next part is the local address; for a
remote delivery it is the name of the remote host, followed
by its failing IP address (unless
&acirc;retry_include_ip_address&acirc; <br>
is set false on the smtp transport). If the remote port is
not the standard one (port 25), it is added to the IP
address. Then there follows an error code, an additional
error <br>
code, and a textual description of the error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The three times on the second
line are the time of first failure, the time of the last
delivery attempt, and the computed time for the next
attempt. The line ends with an aster&acirc; <br>
isk if the cutoff time for the last retry rule has been
exceeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each output line from
exim_dumpdb for the wait-xxx databases consists of a host
name followed by a list of ids for messages that are or were
waiting to be delivered to that host. <br>
If there are a very large number for any one host,
continuation records, with a sequence number added to the
host name, may be seen. The data in these records is often
out of <br>
date, because a message may be routed to several alternative
hosts, and Exim makes no effort to keep
cross-references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exim_tidydb utility program
is used to tidy up the contents of a hints database. If run
with no options, it removes all records that are more than
30 days old. The age is <br>
calculated from the date and time that the record was last
updated. Note that, in the case of the retry database, it is
not the time since the first delivery failure.
Informa&acirc; <br>
tion about a host that has been down for more than 30 days
will remain in the database, provided that the record is
updated sufficiently often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cutoff date can be altered
by means of the -t option, which must be followed by a time.
For example, to remove all records older than a week from
the retry database:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exim_tidydb -t 7d
/var/spool/exim4 retry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the wait-xxx and retry
databases contain items that involve message ids. In the
former these appear as data in records keyed by host - they
were messages that were waiting <br>
for that host - and in the latter they are the keys for
retry information for messages that have suffered certain
types of error. When &acirc;exim_tidydb&acirc; is run, a
check is made to <br>
ensure that message ids in database records are those of
messages that are still on the queue. Message ids for
messages that no longer exist are removed from
&acirc;wait-&acirc;xxx records, <br>
and if this leaves any records empty, they are deleted. For
the &acirc;retry&acirc; database, records whose keys are
non-existent message ids are removed. The exim_tidydb
utility outputs <br>
comments on the standard output whenever it removes
information from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain records are
automatically removed by Exim when they are no longer
needed, but others are not. For example, if all the MX hosts
for a domain are down, a retry record is <br>
created for each one. If the primary MX host comes back
first, its record is removed when Exim successfully delivers
to it, but the records for the others remain because Exim
has <br>
not tried to use those hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important, therefore, to
run &acirc;exim_tidydb&acirc; periodically on all the hints
databases. You should do this at a quiet time of day,
because it requires a database to be locked <br>
(and therefore inaccessible to Exim) while it does its work.
Removing records from a DBM file does not normally make the
file smaller, but all the common DBM libraries are able <br>
to re-use the space that is released. After an initial phase
of increasing in size, the databases normally reach a point
at which they no longer get any bigger, as long as they <br>
are regularly tidied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: If you never run
&acirc;exim_tidydb&acirc;, the space used by the hints
databases is likely to keep on increasing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exim_fixdb program is a
utility for interactively modifying databases. Its main use
is for testing Exim, but it might also be occasionally
useful for getting round problems <br>
in a live system. It has no options, and its interface is
somewhat crude. On entry, it prompts for input with a right
angle-bracket. A key of a database record can then be <br>
entered, and the data for that record is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &acirc;d&acirc; is typed at
the next prompt, the entire record is deleted. For all
except the retry database, that is the only operation that
can be carried out. For the retry database, <br>
each field is output preceded by a number, and data for
individual fields can be changed by typing the field number
followed by new data, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; 4 951102:1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resets the time of the next
delivery attempt. Time values are given as a sequence of
digit pairs for year, month, day, hour, and minute. Colons
can be used as optional separa&acirc; <br>
tors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows
better groff than us and has more experience in writing
manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.</p>
