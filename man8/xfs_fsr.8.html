<p>xfs_fsr(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual xfs_fsr(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfs_fsr - filesystem reorganizer for XFS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfs_fsr [-vdg] [-t seconds] [-p passes] [-f leftoff] [-m
mtab] <br>
xfs_fsr [-vdg] [xfsdev | file] ... <br>
xfs_fsr -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfs_fsr is applicable only to XFS filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_fsr improves the
organization of mounted filesystems. The reorganization
algorithm operates on one file at a time, compacting or
otherwise improving the layout of the file <br>
extents (contiguous blocks of file data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
accepted by xfs_fsr. The -m, -t, and -f options have no
meaning if any filesystems or files are specified on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mtab Use this file for the
list of filesystems to reorganize. The default is to use
/etc/mtab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t seconds How long to
reorganize. The default is 7200 seconds (2 hours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p passes Number of passes
before terminating global re-org. The default is 10
passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f leftoff Use this file instead
of /var/tmp/.fsrlast to read the state of where to start and
as the file to store the state of where reorganization left
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose. Print cryptic
information about each file being reorganized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debug. Print even more
cryptic information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Print to syslog (default if
stdout not a tty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the version number and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked with no arguments
xfs_fsr reorganizes all regular files in all mounted
filesystems. xfs_fsr makes many cycles over /etc/mtab each
time making a single pass over <br>
each XFS filesystem. Each pass goes through and selects
files that have the largest number of extents. It attempts
to defragment the top 10% of these files on each pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It runs for up to two hours
after which it records the filesystem where it left off, so
it can start there the next time. This information is stored
in the file /var/tmp/.fsr&acirc; <br>
last_xfs. If the information found here is somehow
inconsistent or out of date it is ignored and reorganization
starts at the beginning of the first filesystem found in
<br>
/etc/mtab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_fsr can be called with one
or more arguments naming filesystems (block device name),
and files to reorganize. In this mode xfs_fsr does not read
or write /var/tmp/.fsr&acirc; <br>
last_xfs nor does it run for a fixed time interval. It makes
one pass through each specified regular file and all regular
files in each specified filesystem. A command line <br>
name referring to a symbolic link (except to a file system
device), FIFO, or UNIX domain socket generates a warning
message, but is otherwise ignored. While traversing the <br>
filesystem these types of files are silently skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/mtab contains default list of filesystems to
reorganize. <br>
/var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs <br>
records the state where reorganization left off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
xfs_fsr(8), mkfs.xfs(8), xfs_ncheck(8), xfs(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
xfs_fsr improves the layout of extents for each file by
copying the entire file to a temporary location and then
interchanging the data extents of the target and temporary
files <br>
in an atomic manner. This method requires that enough free
disk space be available to copy any given file and that the
space be less fragmented than the original file. It also
<br>
requires the owner of the file to have enough remaining
filespace quota to do the copy on systems running quotas.
xfs_fsr generates a warning message if space is not
sufficient <br>
to improve the target file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A temporary file used in
improving a file given on the command line is created in the
same parent directory of the target file and is prefixed by
the string &rsquo;.fsr&rsquo;. The tempo&acirc; <br>
rary files used in improving an entire XFS device are stored
in a directory at the root of the target device and use the
same naming scheme. The temporary files are unlinked <br>
upon creation so data will not be readable by any other
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_fsr does not operate on
files that are currently mapped in memory. A &rsquo;file
busy&rsquo; error can be seen for these files if the verbose
flag (-v) is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files marked as no-defrag will
be skipped. The xfs_io(8) chattr command with the f
attribute can be used to set or clear this flag. Files and
directories created in a directory <br>
with the no-defrag flag will inherit the attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An entry in /etc/mtab or the
file specified using the -m option must have the rw option
specified for read and write access. If this option is not
present, then xfs_fsr skips <br>
the filesystem described by that line. See the fstab(5)
reference page for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general we do not foresee the
need to run xfs_fsr on system partitions such as /, /boot
and /usr as in general these will not suffer from
fragmentation. There are also issues <br>
with defragmenting files lilo(8) uses to boot your system.
It is recommended that these files should be flagged as
no-defrag with the xfs_io(8) chattr command. Should these
files <br>
be moved by xfs_fsr then you must rerun lilo before you
reboot or you may have an unbootable system.</p>
