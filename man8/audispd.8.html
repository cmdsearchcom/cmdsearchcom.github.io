<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
audispd - an event multiplexor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
audispd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
audispd is an audit event multiplexor. It has to be started
by the audit daemon in order to get events. It takes audit
events and distributes them to child programs that want to
<br>
analyze events in realtime. When the audit daemon receives a
SIGTERM or SIGHUP, it passes that signal to the dispatcher,
too. The dispatcher in turn passes those signals to its <br>
child processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The child programs install a
configuration file in a plugins directory,
/etc/audisp/plugins.d. Filenames are not allowed to have
more than one &rsquo;.&rsquo; in the name or it will be <br>
treated as a backup copy and skipped. Options are given one
per line with an equal sign between the keyword and its
value. The available options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">active The options for this are
yes or no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direction <br>
The option is dictated by the plugin. In or out are the only
choices. You cannot make a plugin operate in a way it
wasn&rsquo;t designed just by changing this option.This <br>
option is to give a clue to the event dispatcher about which
direction events flow. NOTE: inbound events are not
supported yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path This is the absolute path
to the plugin executable. In the case of internal plugins,
it would be the name of the plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type This tells the dispatcher
how the plugin wants to be run. Choices are builtin and
always. Builtin should always be given for plugins that are
internal to the audit event <br>
dispatcher. These are af_unix and syslog. The option always
should be given for most if not all plugins. The default
setting is always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">args This allows you to pass
arguments to the child program. Generally plugins do not
take arguments and have their own config file that instructs
them how they should be con&acirc; <br>
figured. At the moment, there is a limit of 2 args.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format The valid options for
this are binary and string. Binary passes the data exactly
as the audit event dispatcher gets it from the audit daemon.
The string option tells the <br>
dispatcher to completely change the event into a string
suitable for parsing with the audit parsing library. The
default value is string.</p>
