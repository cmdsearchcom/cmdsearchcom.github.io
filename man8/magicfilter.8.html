<p>MAGICFILTER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
MAGICFILTER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
magicfilter - automatic configurable printer filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
magicfilter config-file [-c] [-n user] [-h host] [-iindent]
[--debug] [other-options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
magicfilter is an extensible and customizable automatic
printer filter. It selects an appropriate conversion
technique for the input data by seeking for magic numbers,
and then <br>
utilizing the appropriate conversion utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magicfilter is primarily
intended for use as the &lsquo;&lsquo;input
filter&rsquo;&rsquo; by the lpd print spooler. The options
accepted by magicfilter are exactly the ones passed to the
input filter <br>
by lpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Typically magicfilter will be invoked by lpd and hence
provided the right options automatically. This list is
included for reference only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only the -n and -h
options may have spaces between the option letter and the
option value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Copy the input to the output
without any conversion whatsoever (used by lpd whenever the
-l option is passed to the lpr program).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nuser, -n user <br>
The login name of the user who submitted the job. Available
to subfilters as $LPUSER. If the user has an associated
GECOS entry it will be available as $LPUSERNAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hhost, -h host <br>
The host on which the job was submitted. Available to
subfilters as $LPHOST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iindent <br>
A numeric option passed by lpd; can be set by the user by
the -i option to lpr. Although nominally used for the amount
of indentation requested, magicfilter makes it <br>
available to subfilters for any useful purpose as
$LPINDENT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Cclassname <br>
LPRng class (priority) name. Available to subfilters as
$LPCLASS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fformat <br>
Format letter (passed by LPRng only). When used as input
filter (if) this will be f, when used as other filter types
it will be the option character corresponding to this <br>
filter. Available to subfilters as $LPFORMAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jjobname <br>
The name of the printer job (passed by LPRng only).
Available to subfilters as $LPJOB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Kcopies <br>
Copy count (passed by LPRng only). Available to subfilters
as $LPCOPIES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Lbannername <br>
User name from the banner page (passed by LPRng only).
Available to subfilters as $BANNERNAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Pprinter <br>
Printer name (passed by LPRng only). Available to subfilters
as $PRINTER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Qqueuename <br>
Spool queue name (passed by LPRng only). Available to
subfilters as $LPQUEUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Raccountinfo <br>
Accounting information (passed by LPRng only). Available to
subfilters as $LPACCT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Zoptions <br>
LPRng &lsquo;&lsquo;Z-options&rsquo;&rsquo;. The LPRng lpr
program supports a -Z option, which can be used to pass
arbitrary information to the printer filters. Available to
subfilters as <br>
$ZOPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Write the name of each facility invoked (together with any
options) to standard error. This can be useful for debugging
complicated configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other options <br>
Any other options, such as the -w, -l, -x, and -y options
typically passed by lpd are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING MAGICFILTER FROM LPD
<br>
To run magicfilter from lpd it should be entered as one of
the filters in the /etc/printcap file. Typically, it will be
the input filter (if). Since most version of lpd do not <br>
accept arguments entered as part of the filter name,
typically the filter name entered into the /etc/printcap
file will simply be the name of the configuration file,
which is set <br>
executable and starts with the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! /usr/sbin/magicfilter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most UNIX kernels will then be
able to treat the configuration file itself as if it was the
actual program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For systems which do not support
the &lsquo;&lsquo;#!-hack&rsquo;&rsquo;, the filter set in
the if entry should point to magicfilter directly, and the
accounting file (af) entry should point to the con&acirc;
<br>
figuration file. This, however, is a less general, and hence
less desirable solution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of magicfilter
supports the enhanced lpd included with the LPRng package
from dickory.sdsu.edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file is used by magicfilter to redirect
various types of data to the various conversion utilities.
The configuration file is printer-specific, and often
sys&acirc; <br>
tem-specific, depending on the available conversion
programs. For example, a system which has GhostScript
installed would be able to print PostScript to a
non-PostScript <br>
printer, whereas other systems typically would not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file contains
a sequence of lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset magic facility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the offset represents the
location of the indentification string in the data format,
magic represents the identification string itself, facility
represents the type of <br>
action to take.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines and lines with a
hash mark (#) as the first nonblank character are ignored. A
line may be continued onto the next line by ending the line
in a backslash (.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The offset is a nonnegative
integer, which can be represented either in decimal form
(default), octal form (preceded by 0), or hexadecimal form
(preceded by 0x).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The magic is a string of
characters, which may include C-style &minus;escape
sequences. In addition, the sequence includes spaces, the
spaces have to be preceded by a backslash, or the entire
string must be enclosed in double quotation marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ambiguous matches, the first
match is used. Hence, the most specific match should always
be placed first in the file. In addition, the last line may
be of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default facility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which designates a default
action to be used in case no other action matches. This will
typically be the action for plain text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FACILITIES <br>
magicfilter provides the following options for the facility
field in the configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat [prefix [suffix]] <br>
Copy the input to the output without any conversion, like
the cat command. If the optional prefix and suffix strings
are specified, they are transmitted to the printer <br>
immediately before and after the data itself. The prefix and
suffix strings are specified in the same way as the magic
string (except that the wildcard sequence permitted), and
like the magic sequence can contain any control character,
including nulls ( ). To specify a suffix without a prefix,
specify an empty prefix string <br>
enclosed in double quotes (i.e. &quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text [prefix [suffix]] <br>
Copy the input to the output, but add carriage return
characters before every line feed and form feed character in
the file, and a line feed-form feed sequence at end of <br>
file. The prefix and suffix arguments are treated the same
way as for the cat facility; the suffix, if present, is
added after the final line feed-form feed sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postscript <br>
Same as the text facility, except add an ASCII EOT (Ctrl-D)
character to the end of the data. This lets a PostScript
printer know that the end of the job has been <br>
reached. This is functionally equivalent to the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text &quot;&quot; 04</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore Ignore the job; do not
provide any output whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reject message <br>
Same as the ignore facility, but attempt to send an email
message to the user who submitted the job to inform that a
job has been rejected and why.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter command <br>
Run the given command, feeding it the input data, and
sending the output data to the printer. The environment
variables LPUSER, LPHOST, and LPINDENT is set to the values
<br>
of the user, host and indent options passed to magicfilter.
Since the command is fed to /bin/sh it may contain shell
special characters, and the sequences $LPUSER, <br>
$LPHOST, and $LPINDENT can be used to access the values of
the passed environment variables. If the lpd daemon on the
system is LPRng, the following environment variables <br>
are also available, see the OPTIONS section for details:
LPCLASS, LPFORMAT, LPJOB, LPCOPIES, BANNERNAME, PRINTER,
LPQUEUE, LPACCT, and ZOPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe command <br>
Same as the filter facility, except that the output data is
fed back into magicfilter for reprocessing. This is used for
external filter programs which themselves do not <br>
produce a format that the printer can accept, but which can
be futher processed to obtain such a format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ffilter command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpipe command <br>
Same as the filter and pipe facilities, respectively, except
that the input is written to a temporary file before being
fed to the filter program given by command. This <br>
is useful for programs which require seekable input, such as
dvips, or which need to do multiple passes over an input
file, such as grog. The environment variable FILE is <br>
set to the name of the temporary file (and, like the other
ones, it can be accessed on the command line as $FILE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
Using the pipe facility together with zcat or gunzip lets
you transparently print compressed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pbmplus or netpbm
collections of image conversion utilities contain a large
number of very useful external filter programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will probably want to
examine the sample configuration files included with the
magicfilter distribution before creating your own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Some data formats cannot be easily identified by a simple
fixed-offset magic number check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Providing large offsets can
cause magicfilter to take up lots of memory. Fortunately,
large offsets for magic numbers are pretty much unheard
of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, there is no
protection against the pipe or fpipe facilities going into
an infinite loop.</p>
