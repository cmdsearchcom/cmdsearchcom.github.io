This plugin is a Acquisition Plugin and will provide the LCMAPS system with Pool
  Account information. To do this it needs to look up the Distinguished Name
  (DN) from a user's certificate in the gridmapfile. If this DN is found in the
  gridmapfile the plugin now knows to which pool of local system accounts the
  user will be mapped. The poolname (starting with a dot ('.') instead of an
  alphanumeric character) will be converted into the an account from a list of
  local accounts. This list is located in the \ gridmapdir and is made out of
  filenames. These filenames correspond to the system poolaccount names. (E.g.
  if a DN corresponds to <b>.test</b> in the gridmapfile, it will be mapped to
  <b>test001</b>, <b>test002</b>, etc., which names can be found in the
  gridmapdir.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is no pool account assigned to the user yet, the plugin will get a
  directory listing of the gridmapdir. This list will contain usernames
  corresponding to system accounts specially designated for pool accounting. If
  the plugin resolved the mapping of a certain pool name, let's say '.test', the
  plugin will look into the directory list and will find the first available
  file in the list corresponding with 'test' (e.g. 'test001') by checking the
  number of links to its i-node. If this number is 1, this account is still
  available. To lease this account a second hard link is created, named after
  the URL-encoded, decapitalized DN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a user returns to this site the plugin will look for the DN of the user
  (URL encoded) in this directory. If found, the corresponding poolaccount will
  be assigned to the user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The plugin will resolve the UID, GID and all the secondary GIDs belonging to the
  poolaccount. When this has been done and there weren't any problems detected,
  the plugin will add this information to a datastructure in the Plugin Manager.
  For version 1.6.0 and newer, if a <b> requested username </b> is specified
  (such as via the gsisshd) this needs to match the resulting poolaccount for
  the plugin to succeed, see <b> NOTES </b>. The plugin will finish its run with
  a <b>LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS</b>. This result will be reported to the Plugin
  Manager which started this plugin and it will forward this result to the
  Evaluation Manager, which will take appropriate actions for the next plugin to
  run. Normally this plugin would be followed by an Enforcement plugin that can
  apply these gathered credentials in a way that is appropriate to a system
  administration's needs.

  <dd class="It-tag">Moving a user from one pool to another (because of a VO
      change) should only be done by changing the gridmapfile indicating the new
      pool for this user. If a user has already been mapped previously to a
      poolaccount, there is a link present between this poolaccount and his DN.
      In the good old days prior to LCMAPS, a 'pool change' would still result
      in a mapping to the old pool account, neglecting the administrative
      changes in the gridmapfile. LCMAPS corrects this behaviour: By default the
      poolaccount plugin will fail if the pool designated by the gridmapfile
      doesn't match the previously mapped poolaccount leasename. If the site
      doesn't want a failure on this inconsistency it can turn on this
      parameter. When the inconsistency is detected the plugin will
      automatically unlink the previous mapping and will proceed by making a new
      lease from the new pool.</dd>

      Normally this number is 1. But if each job should run under its own

Since version 1.6.0 the poolaccount plugin also takes the <b> requested</b>
  <b>username </b> (such as forwarded by gsissh) into consideration. When
  present, the resulting poolaccount has to match it in order for the plugin to
  succeed. This requires LCMAPS version 1.6.0 or newer.
