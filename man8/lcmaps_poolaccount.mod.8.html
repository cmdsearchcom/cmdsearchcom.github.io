<p>LCMAPS_POOLACCOUNT.MOD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
LCMAPS_POOLACCOUNT.MOD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lcmaps_poolaccount.mod - LCMAPS plugin to switch user
identity by pool accounts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lcmaps_poolaccount.mod [-gridmapfile gridmapfile]
[-gridmapdir gridmapdir] [-override_inconsistency]
[-max_mappings_per_credential max nr of mappings]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This plugin is a Acquisition Plugin and will provide the
LCMAPS system with Pool Account information. To do this it
needs to look up the Distinguished Name (DN) from a
user&rsquo;s <br>
certificate in the gridmapfile. If this DN is found in the
gridmapfile the plugin now knows to which pool of local
system accounts the user will be mapped. The poolname
(starting <br>
with a dot (&rsquo;.&rsquo;) instead of an alphanumeric
character) will be converted into the an account from a list
of local accounts. This list is located in the
&nbsp;gridmapdir and is made <br>
out of filenames. These filenames correspond to the system
poolaccount names. (E.g. if a DN corresponds to .test in the
gridmapfile, it will be mapped to test001, test002, etc.,
<br>
which names can be found in the gridmapdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no pool account
assigned to the user yet, the plugin will get a directory
listing of the gridmapdir. This list will contain usernames
corresponding to system ac&acirc; <br>
counts specially designated for pool accounting. If the
plugin resolved the mapping of a certain pool name,
let&rsquo;s say &rsquo;.test&rsquo;, the plugin will look
into the directory list and <br>
will find the first available file in the list corresponding
with &rsquo;test&rsquo; (e.g. &rsquo;test001&rsquo;) by
checking the number of links to its i-node. If this number
is 1, this account is <br>
still available. To lease this account a second hard link is
created, named after the URL-encoded, decapitalized DN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user returns to this site
the plugin will look for the DN of the user (URL encoded) in
this directory. If found, the corresponding poolaccount will
be assigned to the us&acirc; <br>
er.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The plugin will resolve the UID,
GID and all the secondary GIDs belonging to the poolaccount.
When this has been done and there weren&rsquo;t any problems
detected, the plugin will add <br>
this information to a datastructure in the Plugin Manager.
For version 1.6.0 and newer, if a requested username is
specified (such as via the gsisshd) this needs to match the
<br>
resulting poolaccount for the plugin to succeed, see NOTES .
The plugin will finish its run with a LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS.
This result will be reported to the Plugin Manager which
<br>
started this plugin and it will forward this result to the
Evaluation Manager, which will take appropriate actions for
the next plugin to run. Normally this plugin would be
fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by an Enforcement plugin that can apply these gathered
credentials in a way that is appropriate to a system
administration&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-gridmapfile gridmapfile <br>
If this option is set, it will override the default path of
the gridmapfile. It is advised to use an absolute path to
the gridmapfile to avoid usage of the wrong <br>
file(path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gridmapdir gridmapdir <br>
If this option is set, it will override the default path to
the gridmapdir. It is advised to use an absolute path to the
gridmapdir to avoid usage of the wrong path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-override_inconsistency <br>
Moving a user from one pool to another (because of a VO
change) should only be done by changing the gridmapfile
indicating the new pool for this user. If a user has
al&acirc; <br>
ready been mapped previously to a poolaccount, there is a
link present between this poolaccount and his DN. In the
good old days prior to LCMAPS, a &rsquo;pool change&rsquo;
would <br>
still result in a mapping to the old pool account,
neglecting the administrative changes in the gridmapfile.
LCMAPS corrects this behaviour: By default the poolaccount
<br>
plugin will fail if the pool designated by the gridmapfile
doesn&rsquo;t match the previously mapped poolaccount
leasename. If the site doesn&rsquo;t want a failure on this
inconsis&acirc; <br>
tency it can turn on this parameter. When the inconsistency
is detected the plugin will automatically unlink the
previous mapping and will proceed by making a new lease <br>
from the new pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-max_mappings_per_credential max
nr of mappings <br>
This value indicates the maximum number of accounts a user,
or more specifically a set of credentials (=DN + FQANS), can
be mapped to. Normally this number is 1. But if <br>
each job should run under its own account the number should
be increased. The leasename (or poolindex) in this case
looks like:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">url_encoded(&lt;DN&gt;):mapcount=&lt;mapnumber&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_wildcard <br>
If this option is set, wildcards cannot be used in the
grid-mapfile (on by default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strict_poolprefix_match
{yes|no} <br>
Default is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;. If this is set to
&rsquo;yes&rsquo;, a line in the gridmapfile like
&lt;DN&gt;.pool will result in accounts matching the regexp
&rsquo;pool[0-9]+&rsquo;. Otherwise it will be al&acirc;
<br>
lowed to match &rsquo;pool.*&rsquo; (legacy behaviour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS <br>
Success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL <br>
Failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Since version 1.6.0 the poolaccount plugin also takes the
requested username (such as forwarded by gsissh) into
consideration. When present, the resulting poolaccount has
to <br>
match it in order for the plugin to succeed. This requires
LCMAPS version 1.6.0 or newer.</p>
