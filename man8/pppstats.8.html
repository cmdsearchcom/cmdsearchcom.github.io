PPPSTATS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pppstats - print PPP statistics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pppstats [ -a ] [ -v ] [ -r ] [ -z ] [ -c &lt;count&gt; ] [
-w &lt;secs&gt; ] [ interface ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pppstats utility reports PPP-related statistics at
regular intervals for the specified PPP interface. If the
interface is unspecified, it will default to ppp0. The
display <br>
is split horizontally into input and output sections
containing columns of statistics describing the properties
and volume of packets received and transmitted by the
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Display absolute values
rather than deltas. With this option, all reports show
statistics for the time since the link was initiated.
Without this option, the second and <br>
subsequent reports show statistics for the time since the
last report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c count <br>
Repeat the display count times. If this option is not
specified, the default repeat count is 1 if the -w option is
not specified, otherwise infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Display additional statistics
summarizing the compression ratio achieved by the packet
compression algorithm in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display additional statistics
relating to the performance of the Van Jacobson TCP header
compression algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w wait <br>
Pause wait seconds between each display. If this option is
not specified, the default interval is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Instead of the standard
display, show statistics indicating the performance of the
packet compression algorithm in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following fields are printed
on the input side when the -z option is not used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IN The total number of bytes
received by this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACK The total number of packets
received by this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJCOMP The number of
header-compressed TCP packets received by this
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJUNC The number of
header-uncompressed TCP packets received by this interface.
Not reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJERR The number of corrupted or
bogus header-compressed TCP packets received by this
interface. Not reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJTOSS The number of VJ
header-compressed TCP packets dropped on reception by this
interface because of preceding errors. Only reported when
the -v option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NON-VJ The total number of
non-TCP packets received by this interface. Only reported
when the -v option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIO The compression ratio
achieved for received packets by the packet compression
scheme in use, defined as the uncompressed size divided by
the compressed size. Only <br>
reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UBYTE The total number of bytes
received, after decompression of compressed packets. Only
reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following fields are printed
on the output side:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUT The total number of bytes
transmitted from this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACK The total number of packets
transmitted from this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJCOMP The number of TCP packets
transmitted from this interface with VJ-compressed TCP
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJUNC The number of TCP packets
transmitted from this interface with VJ-uncompressed TCP
headers. Not reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NON-VJ The total number of
non-TCP packets transmitted from this interface. Not
reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJSRCH The number of searches
for the cached header entry for a VJ header compressed TCP
packet. Only reported when the -v option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VJMISS The number of failed
searches for the cached header entry for a VJ header
compressed TCP packet. Only reported when the -v option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIO The compression ratio
achieved for transmitted packets by the packet compression
scheme in use, defined as the size before compression
divided by the compressed size. <br>
Only reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UBYTE The total number of bytes
to be transmitted, before packet compression is applied.
Only reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -z option is specified,
instead displays the following fields, relating to the
packet compression algorithm currently in use. If packet
compression is not in use, these <br>
fields will all display zeroes. The fields displayed on the
input side are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSED BYTE <br>
The number of bytes of compressed packets received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSED PACK <br>
The number of compressed packets received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE <br>
The number of bytes of incompressible packets (that is,
those which were transmitted in uncompressed form)
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK <br>
The number of incompressible packets received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMP RATIO <br>
The recent compression ratio for incoming packets, defined
as the uncompressed size divided by the compressed size
(including both compressible and incompressible pack&acirc;
<br>
ets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields displayed on the
output side are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSED BYTE <br>
The number of bytes of compressed packets transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSED PACK <br>
The number of compressed packets transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE <br>
The number of bytes of incompressible packets transmitted
(that is, those which were transmitted in uncompressed
form).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK <br>
The number of incompressible packets transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMP RATIO <br>
The recent compression ratio for outgoing packets.</p>
