ipmiconsole - IPMI console utility
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>ipmiconsole</b> [ <i>OPTION</i>...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>ipmiconsole</b> is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL) console utility. It can be used to
  establish console sessions to remote machines using the IPMI 2.0 SOL protocol.
  <b>Ipmiconsole</b> communicates with a remote machine's Baseboard Management
  Controller (BMC) to establish a console session. Before any SOL communication
  can take place, the remote machine's BMC must be configured properly. The
  FreeIPMI tool <b>bmc-config(8)</b> may be used to do this configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Often (although not always), console redirection must be also be configured
  properly in the BIOS and/or operating system. Both must be configured to
  redirect console traffic out the appropriate COM port. Please see your
  motherboard and OS documentation for instructions on proper setup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble shooting
  information, workaround information, examples, and known issues. For a general
  introduction to FreeIPMI please see <b>freeipmi(7).</b>

      not be sent out of the remote system and this problem is only detected
      once there is user interaction. By sending the occasional NUL character,
      the underlying loss of serial data transfer can be detected far more

  TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h1>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.
  Double check to make sure the following are configured properly in the remote
  machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
  enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN enablement, and
  allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make
  sure the cipher suite privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
  <b>bmc-config(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change these
  configuration settings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
  also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and
  worked around.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages. For additional
  support, please e-mail the &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;username invalid&quot; - The username entered (or a NULL username if none
  was entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also be possible
  the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;password invalid&quot; - The password entered (or a NULL password if none
  was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the password for the user
  is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;password verification timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed out.
  A &quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above) or a generic
  &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below) occurred. During this point in
  the protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was
  entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not correctly
  configured on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;privilege level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher
  user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to authenticate
  with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating to a different user
  which has a higher maximum privilege.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;privilege level cannot be obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege
  level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
  allowed for this user. Please try again with a lower privilege. It may also be
  possible the maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
  properly on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
  authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not available for this
  privilege level. Please try again with an alternate authentication type or
  alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the available
  authentication types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on
  the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;cipher suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
  authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please try again with an
  alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the available cipher suite
  ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote
  machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;connection timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of
  potential errors are possible, including an invalid hostname specified, an
  IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server,
  the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and
  connectivity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;session timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.
  If this error occurs often, you may wish to increase the retransmission
  timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;internal IPMI error&quot; - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does
  not know how to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to report
  the issue.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IPMICONSOLE_TROUBLESHOOTING"><a class="selflink" href="#IPMICONSOLE_TROUBLESHOOTING">IPMICONSOLE
  TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h1>
The following are common issues for error messages in <b>ipmiconsole.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;SOL unavailable&quot; - SOL is not configured for use on the remote BMC.
  It may be not configured in general or for the specific user specified.
  Authenticating with a different user may be sufficient, however the IPMI
  protocol does not reveal detail on what is not configured on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;SOL in use&quot; - SOL is already in use on the remote BMC. If you do not
  specify the <i>--dont-steal</i> option, <b>ipmiconsole</b> will attempt to
  steal the SOL session away from the other session. Not all BMCs support the
  ability to steal away a SOL session.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;SOL session stolen&quot; - Your SOL session has been stolen by another
  session. You may wish to try and steal the session back by reconnecting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;SOL requires encryption&quot; - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
  includes encryption. Please try to use cipher suite id 3, 8, or 12. It may
  also be possible the encryption requirements are not configured correctly on
  the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;SOL requires no encryption&quot; - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
  does not use encryption. Please try to use cipher suite id 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, or
  11. It may also be possible the encryption requirements are not configured
  correctly on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;BMC Implementation&quot; - The BMC on the remote machine has a severe
  problem in its implementation. Please see the WORKAROUNDS section below for
  possible workarounds. If additional vendor workarounds are required, please
  contact the authors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;excess retransmissions sent&quot; - An excessive number of retransmissions
  of SOL packets has occurred and <b>ipmiconsole</b> has given up. This may be
  due to network issues or SOL issues. Some of the same issues involved with
  &quot;connection timeout&quot; or &quot;session timeout&quot; errors may be
  involved. Please try to reconnect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;excess errors received&quot; - An excessive number of SOL packet errors
  has occurred and <b>ipmiconsole</b> has given up. This may be due to network
  issues or SOL issues. Please try to reconnect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;BMC Error&quot; - This error usually means a vendor SOL implementation
  requires a combination of authentication, encryption, privilege, etc. that
  have not been met by the user's choices. Please try a combination of different
  cipher suites, privileges, etc. to resolve the problem. Please see the
  WORKAROUNDS section below for possible workarounds too.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WORKAROUNDS"><a class="selflink" href="#WORKAROUNDS">WORKAROUNDS</a></h1>
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions, different
  vendors may implement their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following
  describes a number of workarounds currently available to handle discovered
  compliance issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they
  will be transparent to the user. However, some will require the user to
  specify a workaround be used via the -W option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was
  discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
  below. Similar machines from vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems.
  Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware
  developer, so it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if
  your motherboard is not listed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe your hardware has an additional compliance issue that needs a
  workaround to be implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
  &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or &lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>authcap</i> - This workaround flag will skip early checks for username
  capabilities, authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
  authentication to succeed. It works around multiple issues in which the remote
  system does not properly report username capabilities, authentication
  capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;username
  invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege
  level&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
  P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450
  with ELOM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>nochecksumcheck</i> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check
  the checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works around systems
  that return invalid checksums due to implementation errors, but the packet is
  otherwise valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it removes
  validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is
  unlikely to be an issue in most situations. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;, or &quot;password
  verification timeout&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
  &quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too. Issue observed on
  Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>intel20</i> - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0
  authentication issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
  password truncation if the authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those
  hitting this issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
  invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Intel
  SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>supermicro20</i> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro
  IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI firmware. The
  issues covered include handling invalid length authentication codes. Those
  hitting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed
  on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver

<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>sun20</i> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0
  authentication issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash keys,
  improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this
  issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot; errors.
  Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM. This workaround
  automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>opensesspriv</i> - This workaround flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI's IPMI
  2.0 connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing algorithm used by the
  remote system. The privilege level sent during the Open Session stage of an
  IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level
  sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;password invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus
  status code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM,
  Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
  S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta
  QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is automatically triggered with the
  &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>integritycheckvalue</i> - This workaround flag will work around an invalid
  integrity check value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
  Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be 0 length, however the
  remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue
  may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG,
  Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and Intel
  S2600JF/Appro 512X.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>solpayloadsize</i> - This workaround flag will not check for valid SOL
  payload sizes and assume a proper set. It works around remote systems that
  report invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL payload sizes. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;BMC Implementation&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
  P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Sun
  x4100, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Quanta
  QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>solport</i> - This workaround flag will ignore alternate SOL ports specified
  during the protocol. It works around remote systems that report invalid
  alternate SOL ports. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;connection
  timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus P5MT-R and Supermicro X8DTH-iF.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>solstatus</i> - This workaround flag will not check the current activation
  status of SOL during the protocol setup. It works around remote systems that
  do not properly support this command. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;BMC Error&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8SIL-F.

On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other
  potentially security relevant information on the command line, this
  information may be discovered by other users when using tools like the
  <b>ps(1)</b> command or looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
  secure to input password information with options like the -P or -K options.
  Configuring security relevant information in the FreeIPMI configuration file
  would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock
  up&quot; after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need to wait
  awhile in order to this temporary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may
  authenticate again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some motherboards define an OEM SOL inactivity timeout for SOL sessions. If SOL
  sessions stay inactive for long periods of time, <b>ipmiconsole</b> sessions
  may be abruptly closed, most likely resulting in session timeout errors.
  Please see OEM notes for information on modifying this parameter if you wish
  for sessions to stay active longer.

Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: After a reboot, the SOL session appears to
  &quot;disconnect&quot; from the motherboard but stay alive. Character data
  input from the <b>ipmiconsole</b> client is accepted by the remote machine,
  but no character data or console data is ever sent back from the remote
  machine. The SOL session is subsequently useless. There is currently no
  workaround in place to handle this. The session must be closed and restarted.
