ipmiconsole - IPMI console utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmiconsole [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ipmiconsole is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL) console utility. It
can be used to establish console sessions to remote machines
using the IPMI 2.0 SOL protocol. Ipmiconsole communicates
<br>
with a remote machine&rsquo;s Baseboard Management
Controller (BMC) to establish a console session. Before any
SOL communication can take place, the remote machine&rsquo;s
BMC must be con&acirc; <br>
figured properly. The FreeIPMI tool bmc-config(8) may be
used to do this configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Often (although not always),
console redirection must be also be configured properly in
the BIOS and/or operating system. Both must be configured to
redirect console traffic out <br>
the appropriate COM port. Please see your motherboard and OS
documentation for instructions on proper setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are general IPMI
options, tool specific options, trouble shooting
information, workaround information, examples, and known
issues. For a general introduction to <br>
FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
The following options are general options for configuring
IPMI communication and executing general tool commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h IPMIHOST,
--hostname=IPMIHOST[:PORT] <br>
Specify the remote host to communicate with. An optional
port can be specified, which may be useful in port
forwarding or similar situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --username=USERNAME <br>
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the
remote host. If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous)
username is assumed. The user must a high enough privilege
<br>
to establish a SOL session and have SOL session
abilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<br>
Specify the password to use when authenticationg with the
remote host. If not specified, a null password is assumed.
Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for <br>
IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --password-prompt <br>
Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in
process lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k K_G, --k-g=K_G <br>
Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the
remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not specified, a null key is
assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix <br>
the string with &rsquo;0x&rsquo;. E.g., the key
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; can be entered with the either the string
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; or the string &rsquo;0x616263&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --k-g-prompt <br>
Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to
60000 milliseconds (60 seconds) if not specified.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the packet retransmission timeout in milliseconds.
Defaults to 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) if not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I,
--cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID <br>
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0
communi&acirc; <br>
cation. The authentication algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signa&acirc; <br>
tures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The user should be aware <br>
that only cipher suite ids 3, 8, and 12 encrypt console
payloads. Console information will be sent in the clear if
an alternate cipher suite id is selected. The following <br>
cipher suite ids are currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Authentication Algorithm =
None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
= None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96;
Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96;
Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality
Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l PRIVILEGE-LEVEL,
--privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL <br>
Specify the privilege level to be used. The currently
available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to ADMIN if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-file=FILE <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W WORKAROUNDS,
--workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS <br>
Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
command line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
work&acirc; <br>
arounds (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Turn on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS <br>
The following options are specific to Ipmiconsole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e CHAR, --escape-char=CHAR <br>
Specify an alternate escape character (default char
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dont-steal <br>
Do not steal an SOL session if one is already detected as
being in use. Under most circumstances, if SOL is detected
as being in use, ipmiconsole will attempt to steal the <br>
SOL session away from the previous session. This default
behavior exists for several reasons, most notably that
earlier SOL sessions may have not been able to be
deacti&acirc; <br>
vate properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deactivate <br>
Deactivate SOL session if one is detected as being in use
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--serial-keepalive <br>
Occasionally send NUL characters to detect inactive serial
connections. This option is particularly useful for those
who intend to run ipmiconsole without much interac&acirc;
<br>
tion, such as for logging purposes. While IPMI connections
may still be alive, some motherboards have exhibited bugs in
which underlying serial data can no longer be <br>
sent/received. From the viewpoint of ipmiconsole, data is
simply not be sent out of the remote system and this problem
is only detected once there is user interaction. By <br>
sending the occasional NUL character, the underlying loss of
serial data transfer can be detected far more quickly. There
is some risk with this option, as the NUL charac&acirc; <br>
ter byte may affect the remote system depending on what data
it may or may not be expecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--serial-keepalive-empty <br>
This option is identical to --serial-keepalive except that
SOL packets will contain no NUL character data. On some
motherboards, this may be sufficient to deal with a <br>
hanging IPMI session without the risk regularly sending a
NUL character byte may have. However, some systems may not
ACK a SOL packet without character data in it, meaning <br>
these keepalive packets do nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sol-payload-instance=NUM <br>
Specify the SOL payload instance number. The default value
is 1, valid values range from 1 to 15. Most systems only
support a single instance, however a few allow users to <br>
access multiple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deactivate-all-instances <br>
When used along with the --deactivate option, will
deactivate all active SOL instances instead of just the
currently configured payload instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-memory <br>
Lock sensitive information (such as usernames and passwords)
in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCAPE CHARACTERS <br>
The following escape sequences are supported. The default
supported escape character is &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, but can
be changed with the -e option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;? Display a list of
currently available escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;. Terminate the
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;B Send a
&quot;serial-break&quot; to the remote console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;D Send a DEL character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;&amp; Send a single escape
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN problems involve a
misconfiguration of the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double
check to make sure the following are configured properly in
the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC: IP <br>
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connec&acirc; <br>
tions, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration <br>
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are many of the
common issues for error messages. For additional support,
please e-mail the &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;username invalid&quot; -
The username entered (or a NULL username if none was
entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also
be possible the remote BMC&rsquo;s username con&acirc; <br>
figuration is incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password invalid&quot; -
The password entered (or a NULL password if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the
password for the user is not correctly configured <br>
on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password verification
timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed out. A
&quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above) or a
generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. <br>
During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The
K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is
not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level
insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher user
privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may <br>
require authenticating to a different user which has a
higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level cannot be
obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege level you are
attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
allowed for this user. Please try <br>
again with a lower privilege. It may also be possible the
maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try <br>
again with an alternate authentication type or alternate
privilege level. It may also be possible the available
authentication types you can authenticate with are not
correctly <br>
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher suite id
unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may <br>
also be possible the available cipher suite ids are not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
- IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please
try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection timeout&quot; -
Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of potential
errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be <br>
resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the
network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration
and connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;session timeout&quot; -
The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect. If this
error occurs often, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are con&acirc; <br>
siderably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;internal IPMI error&quot;
- An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how
to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to
report the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
The following are common issues for error messages in
ipmiconsole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL unavailable&quot; -
SOL is not configured for use on the remote BMC. It may be
not configured in general or for the specific user
specified. Authenticating with a different user <br>
may be sufficient, however the IPMI protocol does not reveal
detail on what is not configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL in use&quot; - SOL is
already in use on the remote BMC. If you do not specify the
--dont-steal option, ipmiconsole will attempt to steal the
SOL session away from the other ses&acirc; <br>
sion. Not all BMCs support the ability to steal away a SOL
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL session stolen&quot; -
Your SOL session has been stolen by another session. You may
wish to try and steal the session back by reconnecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL requires
encryption&quot; - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
includes encryption. Please try to use cipher suite id 3, 8,
or 12. It may also be possible the encryption <br>
requirements are not configured correctly on the remote
BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL requires no
encryption&quot; - SOL requires a cipher suite id that does
not use encryption. Please try to use cipher suite id 0, 1,
2, 6, 7, or 11. It may also be possible the <br>
encryption requirements are not configured correctly on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC Implementation&quot; -
The BMC on the remote machine has a severe problem in its
implementation. Please see the WORKAROUNDS section below for
possible workarounds. If additional <br>
vendor workarounds are required, please contact the
authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;excess retransmissions
sent&quot; - An excessive number of retransmissions of SOL
packets has occurred and ipmiconsole has given up. This may
be due to network issues or SOL issues. <br>
Some of the same issues involved with &quot;connection
timeout&quot; or &quot;session timeout&quot; errors may be
involved. Please try to reconnect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;excess errors
received&quot; - An excessive number of SOL packet errors
has occurred and ipmiconsole has given up. This may be due
to network issues or SOL issues. Please try to <br>
reconnect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC Error&quot; - This
error usually means a vendor SOL implementation requires a
combination of authentication, encryption, privilege, etc.
that have not been met by the user&rsquo;s <br>
choices. Please try a combination of different cipher
suites, privileges, etc. to resolve the problem. Please see
the WORKAROUNDS section below for possible workarounds
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKAROUNDS <br>
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI
solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of
work&acirc; <br>
arounds currently available to handle discovered compliance
issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so
they will be transparent to the user. However, some will
<br>
require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardware listed below may
only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on.
Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
below. Similar machines from <br>
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds <br>
listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe your hardware has
an additional compliance issue that needs a workaround to be
implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or <br>
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authcap - This workaround flag
will skip early checks for username capabilities,
authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
authentication to succeed. It works <br>
around multiple issues in which the remote system does not
properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see <br>
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel <br>
SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochecksumcheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums <br>
due to implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise
valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes validation of packet integrity in a number of
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most
situations. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification time&acirc; <br>
out&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
&quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too.
Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F,
and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intel20 - This workaround flag
will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
password truncation if the <br>
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with <br>
Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermicro20 - This workaround
flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0
authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI
firmware. The issues covered include han&acirc; <br>
dling invalid length authentication codes. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors.
Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card.
Confirmed <br>
fixed on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sun20 - This workaround flag
will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and <br>
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround <br>
automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot;
workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opensesspriv - This workaround
flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s IPMI 2.0
connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing
algorithm used by the remote system. The privi&acirc; <br>
lege level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those
hit&acirc; <br>
ting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;,
&quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status
code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500
with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu <br>
II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and
Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is
automatically trig&acirc; <br>
gered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integritycheckvalue - This
workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check
value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity <br>
check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermi&acirc; <br>
cro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">solpayloadsize - This workaround
flag will not check for valid SOL payload sizes and assume a
proper set. It works around remote systems that report
invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL payload <br>
sizes. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;BMC
Implementation&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec 5441/Dell
Xanadu II, Sun x4100, <br>
Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and
Quanta QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">solport - This workaround flag
will ignore alternate SOL ports specified during the
protocol. It works around remote systems that report invalid
alternate SOL ports. Those hit&acirc; <br>
ting this issue may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Asus P5MT-R and Supermicro
X8DTH-iF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">solstatus - This workaround flag
will not check the current activation status of SOL during
the protocol setup. It works around remote systems that do
not properly support this <br>
command. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;BMC
Error&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
On older operating systems, if you input your username,
password, and other potentially security relevant
information on the command line, this information may be
discovered by <br>
other users when using tools like the ps(1) command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K <br>
options. Configuring security relevant information in the
FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way
to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent brute force
attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock up&quot;
after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need
to wait awhile in order to this tempo&acirc; <br>
rary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may authenticate
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some motherboards define an OEM
SOL inactivity timeout for SOL sessions. If SOL sessions
stay inactive for long periods of time, ipmiconsole sessions
may be abruptly closed, most <br>
likely resulting in session timeout errors. Please see OEM
notes for information on modifying this parameter if you
wish for sessions to stay active longer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFIC HARDWARE NOTES <br>
Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: After a reboot, the SOL session
appears to &quot;disconnect&quot; from the motherboard but
stay alive. Character data input from the ipmiconsole client
is accepted <br>
by the remote machine, but no character data or console data
is ever sent back from the remote machine. The SOL session
is subsequently useless. There is currently no workaround
<br>
in place to handle this. The session must be closed and
restarted.</p>

# ipmiconsole -h ahost -u myusername -p mypassword</p>
