<p>GPM(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual GPM(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpm - a cut and paste utility and mouse server for virtual
consoles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpm [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This package tries to be a useful mouse server for
applications running on the Linux console. It is based on
the &quot;selection&quot; package, and some of its code
comes from selection <br>
itself. This package is intended as a replacement for
&quot;selection&quot; as a cut-and-paste mechanism; it also
provides additional facilities. The &quot;selection&quot;
package offered the first <br>
cut-and-paste implementation for Linux using two mouse
buttons, and the cut buffer is still called &quot;selection
buffer&quot; or just &quot;selection&quot; throughout this
document. The informa&acirc; <br>
tion below is extracted from the texinfo file, which is the
preferred source of information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gpm executable is meant to
act like a daemon (thus, gpmd would be a better name for
it). This section is meant to describe the command-line
options for gpm, while its inter&acirc; <br>
nals are outlined in the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to restrictions in the
ioctl(TIOCLINUX) system call, gpm must be run by the
superuser. The restrictions have been added in the last 1.1
kernels to fix a security hole related <br>
to selection and screen dumping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server can be configured to
match the user&rsquo;s taste, and any application using the
mouse will inherit the server&rsquo;s attitude. From release
1.02 up to 1.19.2 is was possible for <br>
any user logged on the system console to change the mouse
feeling using the -q option. This is no longer possible for
security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of 0.97 the server program
puts itself in the background. To kill gpm you can just
reinvoke it with the -k cmdline switch, although killall gpm
can be a better choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIAL COMMANDS <br>
Version 1.10 adds the capability to execute special commands
on certain circumstances. Special commands default to
rebooting and halting the system, but the user can specify
<br>
his/her personal choice. The capability to invoke commands
using the mouse is a handy one for programmers, because it
allows to issue a clean shutdown when the keyboard is locked
<br>
and no network is available to restore the system to a sane
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special commands are toggled by
triple-clicking the left and right button -- an unlikely
event during normal mouse usage. The easiest way to
triple-click is pressing one of the <br>
buttons and triple-click the other one. When special
processing is toggled, a message appears on the console (and
the speaker beeps twice, if you have a speaker); if the user
<br>
releases all the buttons and presses one of them again
within three seconds, then the special command corresponding
to the button is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default special commands
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left button <br>
Reboot the system by signalling the init process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">middle button (if any) <br>
Execute /sbin/shutdown -h now</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">right button <br>
Execute /sbin/shutdown -r now</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S command line switch
enables special command processing and allows to change the
three special commands. To accept the default commands use
-S &quot;&quot; (i.e., specify an empty <br>
argument). To specify your own commands, use a
colon-separated list to specify commands associated to the
left, middle and right button. If any of the commands is
empty, it is <br>
interpreted as &lsquo;send a signal to the init
process&rsquo;. This particular operation is supported, in
addition to executing external commands, because sometimes
bad bugs put the system <br>
to the impossibility to fork; in these rare case the
programmer should be able to shutdown the system anyways,
and killing init from a running process is the only way to
do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, -S &quot;:telinit
1:/sbin/halt&quot;, associates killing init to the left
button, going single user to the middle one, and halting the
system to the right button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System administrators should
obviously be careful about special commands, as gpm runs
with superuser permissions. Special commands are best suited
for computers whose mouse can <br>
be physically accessed only by trusted people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
Available command line options are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a accel <br>
Set the acceleration value used when a single motion event
is longer than delta (see -d).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A[limit] <br>
Start up with selection pasting disabled. This is intended
as a security measure; a plausible attack on a system seems
to be to stuff a nasty shell command into the <br>
selection buffer (rm -rf /) including the terminating line
break, then all the victim has to do is click the middle
mouse button .. As of version 1.17.2, this has devel&acirc;
<br>
oped into a more general aging mechanism; the gpm daemon can
disable (age) selection pasting automatically after a period
of inactivity. To enable this mode just give the <br>
optional limit parameter (no space in between !) which is
interpreted as the time in seconds for which a selection is
considered valid and pastable. As of version <br>
1.15.7, a trivial program called disable-paste is provided.
The following makes a good addition to /etc/profile if you
allow multiple users to work on your console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case $( /usr/bin/tty ) in <br>
/dev/tty[0-9]*) /usr/bin/disable-paste ;; <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b baud <br>
Set the baud rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B sequence <br>
Set the button sequence. 123 is the normal sequence, 321 can
be used by left-handed people, and 132 can be useful with
two-button mice (especially within Emacs). All the <br>
button permutations are allowable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d delta <br>
Set the delta value. When a single motion event is longer
than delta, accel is used as a multiplying factor. (Must be
2 or above)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not automatically enter
background operation when started, and log messages to the
standard error stream, not the syslog mechanism. This is
useful for debugging; in <br>
previous releases it was done with a compile-time
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g number <br>
With glidepoint devices, emulate the specified button with
tapping. number must be 1, 2, or 3, and refers to the button
number before the -B button remapping is per&acirc; <br>
formed. This option applies to the mman and ps2 decoding. No
button is emulated by default because the ps2 tapping is
incompatible with some normal ps2 mice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a summary of command
line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Set interval to be used as an upper time limit for multiple
clicks. If the interval between button-up and button-down
events is less than limit, the press is considered a <br>
double or triple click. Time is in milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Kill a running gpm. This can
be used by busmouse users to kill gpm before running X
(unless they use -R or the single-open limitation is removed
from the kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l charset <br>
Choose the inword() look up table. The charset argument is a
list of characters. - is used to specify a range and &nbsp;
is used to escape the next character or to provide <br>
octal codes. Only visible character can appear in charset
because control characters can&rsquo;t appear in text-mode
video memory, whence selection is cut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m filename <br>
Choose the mouse file to open. Must be before -t and -o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Enable multiple mode. The
daemon will read two different mouse devices. Any subsequent
option will refer to the second device, while any preceding
option will be used for <br>
the first device. This option automatically forces the
repeater (-R) option on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o list-of-extra-options <br>
The option works similary to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-o&rsquo;&rsquo; option of mount; it is used
to specify a list of &lsquo;&lsquo;extra
options&rsquo;&rsquo; that are specific to each mouse type.
The list is comma-sepa&acirc; <br>
rated. The options dtr, rts or both are used by the serial
initialization to toggle the modem lines like, compatibly
with earlier gpm versions; note however that using -o <br>
dtr associated with non-plain-serial mouse types may now
generate an error. And by the way, use -o after -m and after
-t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Forces the pointer to be
visible while selecting. This is the behaviour of
selection-1.7, but it is sometimes confusing. The default is
not to show the pointer, which can <br>
be confusing as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r number <br>
Set the responsiveness. A higher responsiveness is used for
a faster cursor motion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[name] <br>
Causes gpm to act as a repeater: any mouse data received
while in graphic mode will be produced on the fifo
/dev/gpmdata in protocol name, given as an optional argument
<br>
(no space in between !). In principle, you can use the same
names as for the -t option, although repeating into some
protocols may not be implemented for a while. In <br>
addition, you can specify raw as the name, to repeat the
mouse data byte by byte, without any protocol translation.
If name is omitted, it defaults to msc. Using gpm in <br>
repeater mode, you can configure the X server to use its
fifo as a mouse device. This option is useful for bus-mouse
owners to override the single-open limitation. It is <br>
also an easy way to manage those stupid dual-mode mice which
force you to keep the middle button down while changing
video mode. The option is forced on by the -M option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s number <br>
Set the sample rate for the mouse device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S commands <br>
Enable special-command processing, and optionally specify
custom commands as a colon-separated list. See above for a
detailed description of special commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t name <br>
Set the mouse type. Use -t help to get a list of allowable
types. Since version 1.18.1, the list also shows which
protocols are available as repeaters (see -R above), by <br>
marking them with an asterisk
(&lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -t after you selected the
mouse device with -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Force two buttons. This means
that the middle button, if any, will be taken as it was the
right one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 Force three buttons. By
default the mouse is considered to be a 2-buttons one, until
the middle button is pressed. If three buttons are there,
the right one is used to <br>
extend the selection, and the middle one is used to paste
it. Beware: if you use the -3 option with a 2-buttons mouse,
you won&rsquo;t be able to paste the selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
To select text press the left mouse button and drag the
mouse. To paste text in the same or another console, press
the middle button. The right button is used to extend the
<br>
selection, like in &lsquo;xterm&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two-button mice use the right
button to paste text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double and triple clicks select
whole word and whole lines. Use of the &lsquo;-p&rsquo;
option is recommended for best visual feedback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a trailing space after the
contents of a line is highlighted, and if there is no other
text on the remainder of the line, the rest of the line will
be selected automatically. <br>
If a number of lines are selected, highlighted trailing
spaces on each line will be removed from the selection
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any output on the virtual
console holding the selection will clear the highlighted
selection from the screen, to maintain integrity of the
display, although the contents of the <br>
paste buffer will be unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selection mechanism is
disabled if the controlling virtual console is placed in
graphics mode, for example when running X11, and is
re-enabled when text mode is resumed. (But <br>
see BUGS section below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The gpm server may have problems interacting with X: if your
mouse is a single-open device (i.e. a bus mouse), you should
kill gpm before starting X, or use the -R option (see <br>
above). To kill gpm just invoke gpm -k. This problem
doesn&rsquo;t apply to serial mice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two instances of gpm can&rsquo;t
run on the same system. If you have two mice use the -M
option (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the current console is in
graphic mode, gpm sleeps until text mode is back (unless -R
is used). Thus, it won&rsquo;t reply to clients. Anyways, it
is unlikely that mouse-eager <br>
clients will spur out in hidden consoles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The clients shipped out with gpm
are not updated, thus there are potential security risks
when using them.</p>
