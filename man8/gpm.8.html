gpm - a cut and paste utility and mouse server for virtual consoles
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>gpm</b> [ <i>options</i> ]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This package tries to be a useful mouse server for applications running on the
  Linux console. It is based on the &quot;selection&quot; package, and some of
  its code comes from selection itself. This package is intended as a
  replacement for &quot;selection&quot; as a cut-and-paste mechanism; it also
  provides additional facilities. The &quot;selection&quot; package offered the
  first cut-and-paste implementation for Linux using two mouse buttons, and the
  cut buffer is still called &quot;selection buffer&quot; or just
  &quot;selection&quot; throughout this document. The information below is
  extracted from the texinfo file, which is the preferred source of information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The gpm executable is meant to act like a daemon (thus, gpmd would be a better
  name for it). This section is meant to describe the command-line options for
  gpm, while its internals are outlined in the next section.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to restrictions in the ioctl(TIOCLINUX) system call, gpm must be run by the
  superuser. The restrictions have been added in the last 1.1 kernels to fix a
  security hole related to selection and screen dumping.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The server can be configured to match the user's taste, and any application
  using the mouse will inherit the server's attitude. From release 1.02 up to
  1.19.2 is was possible for any user logged on the system console to change the
  mouse feeling using the -q option. This is no longer possible for security
  reasons.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of 0.97 the server program puts itself in the background. To kill gpm you can
  just reinvoke it with the -k cmdline switch, although killall gpm can be a
  better choice.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SPECIAL_COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#SPECIAL_COMMANDS">SPECIAL
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
Version 1.10 adds the capability to execute special commands on certain
  circumstances. Special commands default to rebooting and halting the system,
  but the user can specify his/her personal choice. The capability to invoke
  commands using the mouse is a handy one for programmers, because it allows to
  issue a clean shutdown when the keyboard is locked and no network is available
  to restore the system to a sane state.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Special commands are toggled by triple-clicking the left and right button -- an
  unlikely event during normal mouse usage. The easiest way to triple-click is
  pressing one of the buttons and triple-click the other one. When special
  processing is toggled, a message appears on the console (and the speaker beeps
  twice, if you have a speaker); if the user releases all the buttons and
  presses one of them again within three seconds, then the special command
  corresponding to the button is executed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default special commands are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">left button</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Reboot the system by signalling the init process</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">middle button (if any)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Execute /sbin/shutdown -h now</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">right button</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Execute /sbin/shutdown -r now
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -S command line switch enables special command processing and allows to
  change the three special commands. To accept the default commands use -S
  &quot;&quot; (i.e., specify an empty argument). To specify your own commands,
  use a colon-separated list to specify commands associated to the left, middle
  and right button. If any of the commands is empty, it is interpreted as `send
  a signal to the init process'. This particular operation is supported, in
  addition to executing external commands, because sometimes bad bugs put the
  system to the impossibility to fork; in these rare case the programmer should
  be able to shutdown the system anyways, and killing init from a running
  process is the only way to do it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As an example, -S &quot;:telinit 1:/sbin/halt&quot;, associates killing init to
  the left button, going single user to the middle one, and halting the system
  to the right button.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
System administrators should obviously be careful about special commands, as gpm
  runs with superuser permissions. Special commands are best suited for
  computers whose mouse can be physically accessed only by trusted people.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS">COMMAND
  LINE OPTIONS</a></h1>
Available command line options are the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-a <b>accel</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the acceleration value used when a single motion event
      is longer than <b>delta</b> (see -d<b>).</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-A[<b>limit</b>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Start up with selection pasting disabled. This is intended
      as a security measure; a plausible attack on a system seems to be to stuff
      a nasty shell command into the selection buffer (rm -rf /) including the
      terminating line break, then all the victim has to do is click the middle
      mouse button .. As of version 1.17.2, this has developed into a more
      general aging mechanism; the gpm daemon can disable (age) selection
      pasting automatically after a period of inactivity. To enable this mode
      just give the optional <b>limit</b> parameter (no space in between !)
      which is interpreted as the time in seconds for which a selection is
      considered valid and pastable. As of version 1.15.7, a trivial program
      called disable-paste is provided. The following makes a good addition to
      /etc/profile if you allow multiple users to work on your console.

      used by the serial initialization to toggle the modem lines like,
      compatibly with earlier gpm versions; note however that using -o dtr
      associated with non-plain-serial mouse types may now generate an error.

      protocol <b>name</b>, given as an optional argument (no space in between
      !). In principle, you can use the same names as for the -t option,
      although repeating into some protocols may not be implemented for a while.
      In addition, you can specify raw <b> as the </b><b>name</b><b>, to
      repeat</b> <b>the mouse data byte by byte, without any protocol
      translation.</b> <b>If </b><b>name</b><b> is omitted, it defaults to

      are there, the right one is used to extend the selection, and the middle
      one is used to paste it. Beware: if you use the -3 option with a 2-buttons
      mouse, you won't be able to paste the selection.

  </dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#OPERATION">OPERATION</a></h1>
To select text press the left mouse button and drag the mouse. To paste text in
  the same or another console, press the middle button. The right button is used
  to extend the selection, like in `xterm'.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Two-button mice use the right button to paste text.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Double and triple clicks select whole word and whole lines. Use of the `-p'
  option is recommended for best visual feedback.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a trailing space after the contents of a line is highlighted, and if there is
  no other text on the remainder of the line, the rest of the line will be
  selected automatically. If a number of lines are selected, highlighted
  trailing spaces on each line will be removed from the selection buffer.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any output on the virtual console holding the selection will clear the
  highlighted selection from the screen, to maintain integrity of the display,
  although the contents of the paste buffer will be unaffected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The selection mechanism is disabled if the controlling virtual console is placed
  in graphics mode, for example when running X11, and is re-enabled when text
  mode is resumed. (But see BUGS section below.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The gpm server may have problems interacting with X: if your mouse is a
  single-open device (i.e. a bus mouse), you should kill gpm before starting X,
  or use the -R option (see above). To kill gpm just invoke gpm -k. This problem
  doesn't apply to serial mice.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Two instances of gpm can't run on the same system. If you have two mice use the
  -M option (see above).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While the current console is in graphic mode, gpm sleeps until text mode is back
  (unless -R is used). Thus, it won't reply to clients. Anyways, it is unlikely
  that mouse-eager clients will spur out in hidden consoles.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The clients shipped out with gpm are not updated, thus there are potential
  security risks when using them.
