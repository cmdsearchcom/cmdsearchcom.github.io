<p>xfs_repair(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
xfs_repair(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfs_repair - repair an XFS filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfs_repair [ -dfLnPv ] [ -m maxmem ] [ -c subopt=value ] [
-o subopt[=value] ] [ -t interval ] [ -l logdev ] [ -r rtdev
] device <br>
xfs_repair -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfs_repair repairs corrupt or damaged XFS filesystems (see
xfs(5)). The filesystem is specified using the device
argument which should be the device name of the disk
partition <br>
or volume containing the filesystem. If given the name of a
block device, xfs_repair will attempt to find the raw device
associated with the specified block device and will use <br>
the raw device instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless, the filesystem to be
repaired must be unmounted, otherwise, the resulting
filesystem may be inconsistent or corrupt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed is
stored in a regular file at device (see the mkfs.xfs -d file
option). This might happen if an image copy of a <br>
filesystem has been copied or written into an ordinary file.
This option implies that any external log or realtime
section is also in an ordinary file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Force Log Zeroing. Forces
xfs_repair to zero the log even if it is dirty (contains
metadata changes). When using this option the filesystem
will likely appear to be cor&acirc; <br>
rupt, and can cause the loss of user files and/or data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logdev <br>
Specifies the device special file where the
filesystem&rsquo;s external log resides. Only for those
filesystems which use an external log. See the mkfs.xfs -l
option, and refer <br>
to xfs(5) for a detailed description of the XFS log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rtdev <br>
Specifies the device special file where the
filesystem&rsquo;s realtime section resides. Only for those
filesystems which use a realtime section. See the mkfs.xfs
-r option, <br>
and refer to xfs(5) for a detailed description of the XFS
realtime section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No modify mode. Specifies
that xfs_repair should not modify the filesystem but should
only scan the filesystem and indicate what repairs would
have been made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Disable prefetching of inode
and directory blocks. Use this option if you find xfs_repair
gets stuck and stops proceeding. Interrupting a stuck
xfs_repair is safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m maxmem <br>
Specifies the approximate maximum amount of memory, in
megabytes, to use for xfs_repair. xfs_repair has its own
internal block cache which will scale out up to the lesser
<br>
of the process&rsquo;s virtual address limit or about 75% of
the system&rsquo;s physical RAM. This option overrides these
limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: These memory limits are
only approximate and may use more than the specified
limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c subopt=value <br>
Change filesystem parameters. Refer to xfs_admin(8) for
information on changing filesystem parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o subopt[=value] <br>
Override what the program might conclude about the
filesystem if left to its own devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The suboptions supported
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bhash=bhashsize <br>
overrides the default buffer cache hash size. The total
number of buffer cache entries are limited to 8 times this
amount. The default size is set to use up the <br>
remainder of 75% of the system&rsquo;s physical RAM
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ag_stride=ags_per_concat_unit
<br>
This creates additional processing threads to parallel
process AGs that span multiple concat units. This can
significantly reduce repair times on concat based <br>
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force_geometry <br>
Check the filesystem even if geometry information could not
be validated. Geometry information can not be validated if
only a single allocation group exists and <br>
thus we do not have a backup superblock available, or if
there are two allocation groups and the two superblocks do
not agree on the filesystem geometry. Only <br>
use this option if you validated the geometry yourself and
know what you are doing. If In doubt run in no modify mode
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t interval <br>
Modify reporting interval, specified in seconds. During long
runs xfs_repair outputs its progress every 15 minutes.
Reporting is only activated when ag_stride is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output. May be
specified multiple times to increase verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Repair dangerously. Allow
xfs_repair to repair an XFS filesystem mounted read only.
This is typically done on a root filesystem from single user
mode, immediately followed <br>
by a reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the version number and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checks Performed <br>
Inconsistencies corrected include the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Inode and inode blockmap
(addressing) checks: bad magic number in inode, bad magic
numbers in inode blockmap blocks, extents out of order,
incorrect number of records in <br>
inode blockmap blocks, blocks claimed that are not in a
legal data area of the filesystem, blocks that are claimed
by more than one inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Inode allocation map checks:
bad magic number in inode map blocks, inode state as
indicated by map (free or in-use) inconsistent with state
indicated by the inode, inodes <br>
referenced by the filesystem that do not appear in the inode
allocation map, inode allocation map referencing blocks that
do not appear to contain inodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Size checks: number of blocks
claimed by inode inconsistent with inode size, directory
size not block aligned, inode size not consistent with inode
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Directory checks: bad magic
numbers in directory blocks, incorrect number of entries in
a directory block, bad freespace information in a directory
leaf block, entry <br>
pointing to an unallocated (free) or out of range inode,
overlapping entries, missing or incorrect dot and dotdot
entries, entries out of hashvalue order, incorrect
inter&acirc; <br>
nal directory pointers, directory type not consistent with
inode format and size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Pathname checks: files or
directories not referenced by a pathname starting from the
filesystem root, illegal pathname components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Link count checks: link
counts that do not agree with the number of directory
references to the inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Freemap checks: blocks
claimed free by the freemap but also claimed by an inode,
blocks unclaimed by any inode but not appearing in the
freemap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Super Block checks: total
free block and/or free i-node count incorrect, filesystem
geometry inconsistent, secondary and primary superblocks
contradictory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orphaned files and directories
(allocated, in-use but unreferenced) are reconnected by
placing them in the lost+found directory. The name assigned
is the inode number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disk Errors <br>
xfs_repair aborts on most disk I/O errors. Therefore, if you
are trying to repair a filesystem that was damaged due to a
disk drive failure, steps should be taken to ensure that
<br>
all blocks in the filesystem are readable and writable
before attempting to use xfs_repair to repair the
filesystem. A possible method is using dd(8) to copy the
data onto a good <br>
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lost+found <br>
The directory lost+found does not have to already exist in
the filesystem being repaired. If the directory does not
exist, it is automatically created if required. If it <br>
already exists, it will be checked for consistency and if
valid will be used for additional orphaned files. Invalid
lost+found directories are removed and recreated. Existing
<br>
files in a valid lost+found are not removed or renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Corrupted Superblocks <br>
XFS has both primary and secondary superblocks. xfs_repair
uses information in the primary superblock to automatically
find and validate the primary superblock against the
sec&acirc; <br>
ondary superblocks before proceeding. Should the primary be
too corrupted to be useful in locating the secondary
superblocks, the program scans the filesystem until it finds
and <br>
validates some secondary superblocks. At that point, it
generates a primary superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quotas <br>
If quotas are in use, it is possible that xfs_repair will
clear some or all of the filesystem quota information. If
so, the program issues a warning just before it terminates.
<br>
If all quota information is lost, quotas are disabled and
the program issues a warning to that effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that xfs_repair does not
check the validity of quota limits. It is recommended that
you check the quota limit information manually after
xfs_repair. Also, space usage <br>
information is automatically regenerated the next time the
filesystem is mounted with quotas turned on, so the next
quota mount of the filesystem may take some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
xfs_repair issues informative messages as it proceeds
indicating what it has found that is abnormal or any
corrective action that it has taken. Most of the messages
are com&acirc; <br>
pletely understandable only to those who are knowledgeable
about the structure of the filesystem. Some of the more
common messages are explained here. Note that the language
of <br>
the messages is slightly different if xfs_repair is run in
no-modify mode because the program is not changing anything
on disk. No-modify mode indicates what it would do to <br>
repair the filesystem if run without the no-modify flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnected inode ino, moving
to lost+found</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An inode numbered ino was not
connected to the filesystem directory tree and was
reconnected to the lost+found directory. The inode is
assigned the name of its inode num&acirc; <br>
ber (ino). If a lost+found directory does not exist, it is
automatically created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnected dir inode ino,
moving to lost+found</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As above only the inode is a
directory inode. If a directory inode is attached to
lost+found, all of its children (if any) stay attached to
the directory and therefore <br>
get automatically reconnected when the directory is
reconnected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imap claims in-use inode ino is
free, correcting imap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inode allocation map thinks
that inode ino is free whereas examination of the inode
indicates that the inode may be in use (although it may be
disconnected). The pro&acirc; <br>
gram updates the inode allocation map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imap claims free inode ino is in
use, correcting imap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inode allocation map thinks
that inode ino is in use whereas examination of the inode
indicates that the inode is not in use and therefore is
free. The program <br>
updates the inode allocation map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resetting inode ino nlinks from
x to y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program detected a mismatch
between the number of valid directory entries referencing
inode ino and the number of references recorded in the inode
and corrected the <br>
the number in the inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fork-type fork in ino ino claims
used block bno</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inode ino claims a block bno
that is used (claimed) by either another inode or the
filesystem itself for metadata storage. The fork-type is
either data or attr indicating <br>
whether the problem lies in the portion of the inode that
tracks regular data or the portion of the inode that stores
XFS attributes. If the inode is a real-time (rt) <br>
inode, the message says so. Any inode that claims blocks
used by the filesystem is deleted. If two or more inodes
claim the same block, they are both deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fork-type fork in ino ino claims
dup extent ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inode ino claims a block in an
extent known to be claimed more than once. The offset in the
inode, start and length of the extent is given. The message
is slightly dif&acirc; <br>
ferent if the inode is a real-time (rt) inode and the extent
is therefore a real-time (rt) extent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inode ino - bad extent ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extent record in the blockmap
of inode ino claims blocks that are out of the legal range
of the filesystem. The message supplies the start, end, and
file offset of the <br>
extent. The message is slightly different if the extent is a
real-time (rt) extent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bad fork-type fork in inode
ino</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There was something structurally
wrong or inconsistent with the data structures that map
offsets to filesystem blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cleared inode ino</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There was something wrong with
the inode that was uncorrectable so the program freed the
inode. This usually happens because the inode claims blocks
that are used by <br>
something else or the inode itself is badly corrupted.
Typically, this message is preceded by one or more messages
indicating why the inode needed to be cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bad attribute fork in inode ino,
clearing attr fork</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There was something wrong with
the portion of the inode that stores XFS attributes (the
attribute fork) so the program reset the attribute fork. As
a result of this, all <br>
attributes on that inode are lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">correcting nextents for inode
ino, was x - counted y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program found that the
number of extents used to store the data in the inode is
wrong and corrected the number. The message refers to
nextents if the count is wrong <br>
on the number of extents used to store attribute
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entry name in dir dir_ino not
consistent with .. value (xxxx) in dir ino ino, junking
entry name in directory inode dir_ino</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entry name in directory
inode dir_ino references a directory inode ino. However, the
.. entry in directory ino does not point back to directory
dir_ino, so the pro&acirc; <br>
gram deletes the entry name in directory inode dir_ino. If
the directory inode ino winds up becoming a disconnected
inode as a result of this, it is moved to lost+found <br>
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entry name in dir dir_ino
references already connected dir ino ino, junking entry name
in directory inode dir_ino</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entry name in directory
inode dir_ino points to a directory inode ino that is known
to be a child of another directory. Therefore, the entry is
invalid and is <br>
deleted. This message refers to an entry in a small
directory. If this were a large directory, the last phrase
would read &quot;will clear entry&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entry references free inode ino
in directory dir_ino, will clear entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An entry in directory inode
dir_ino references an inode ino that is known to be free.
The entry is therefore invalid and is deleted. This message
refers to a large direc&acirc; <br>
tory. If the directory were small, the message would read
&quot;junking entry ...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
xfs_repair -n (no modify node) will return a status of 1 if
filesystem corruption was detected and 0 if no filesystem
corruption was detected. xfs_repair run without the -n <br>
option will always return a status code of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The filesystem to be checked and repaired must have been
unmounted cleanly using normal system administration
procedures (the umount(8) command or system shutdown), not
as a <br>
result of a crash or system reset. If the filesystem has not
been unmounted cleanly, mount it and unmount it cleanly
before running xfs_repair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_repair does not do a
thorough job on XFS extended attributes. The structure of
the attribute fork will be consistent, but only the contents
of attribute forks that will fit <br>
into an inode are checked. This limitation will be fixed in
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The no-modify mode (-n option)
is not completely accurate. It does not catch
inconsistencies in the freespace and inode maps,
particularly lost blocks or subtly corrupted maps <br>
(trees).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The no-modify mode can generate
repeated warnings about the same problems because it cannot
fix the problems as they are encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a filesystem fails to be
repaired, a metadump image can be generated with
xfs_metadump(8) and be sent to an XFS maintainer to be
analysed and xfs_repair fixed and/or improved.</p>
