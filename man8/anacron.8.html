<p>ANACRON(8) System Administration ANACRON(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
anacron - runs commands periodically</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
anacron [-s] [-f] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-t anacrontab] [-S
spooldir] [job] <br>
anacron [-S spooldir] -u [-t anacrontab] [job] <br>
anacron [-V|-h] <br>
anacron -T [-t anacrontab]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Anacron is used to execute commands periodically, with a
frequency specified in days. Unlike cron(8), it does not
assume that the machine is running continuously. Hence, it
can <br>
be used on machines that are not running 24 hours a day to
control regular jobs as daily, weekly, and monthly jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anacron reads a list of jobs
from the /etc/anacrontab configuration file (see
anacrontab(5)). This file contains the list of jobs that
Anacron controls. Each job entry speci&acirc; <br>
fies a period in days, a delay in minutes, a unique job
identifier, and a shell command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each job, Anacron checks
whether this job has been executed in the last n days, where
n is the time period specified for that job. If a job has
not been executed in n days <br>
or more, Anacron runs the job&rsquo;s shell command, after
waiting for the number of minutes specified as the delay
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the command exits, Anacron
records the date (excludes the hour) in a special timestamp
file for that job, so it knows when to execute that job
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there are no more jobs to
be run, Anacron exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anacron only considers jobs
whose identifier, as specified in anacrontab(5), matches any
of the job command-line arguments. The job command-line
arguments can be represented by <br>
shell wildcard patterns (be sure to protect them from your
shell with adequate quoting). Specifying no job command-line
arguments is equivalent to specifying &quot;*&quot; (that
is, all <br>
jobs are considered by Anacron).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless Anacron is run with the
-d option (specified below), it forks to the background when
it starts, and any parent processes exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless Anacron is run with the
-s or -n options, it starts jobs immediately when their
delay is over. The execution of different jobs is completely
independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an executed job generates any
output to standard output or to standard error, the output
is mailed to the user under whom Anacron is running (usually
root), or to the address <br>
specified in the MAILTO environment variable in the
/etc/anacrontab file, if such exists. If the LOGNAME
environment variable is set, it is used in the From: field
of the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any informative messages
generated by Anacron are sent to syslogd(8) or rsyslogd(8)
under with facility set to cron and priority set to notice.
Any error messages are sent with <br>
the priority error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Active&quot; jobs (i.e.,
jobs that Anacron already decided to run and are now waiting
for their delay to pass, and jobs that are currently being
executed by Anacron), are &quot;locked&quot;, <br>
so that other copies of Anacron cannot run them at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f Forces execution of all jobs, ignoring any
timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Updates the timestamps of all
jobs to the current date, but does not run any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Serializes execution of jobs.
Anacron does not start a new job before the previous one
finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Runs jobs immediately and
ignores the specified delays in the /etc/anacrontab file.
This options implies -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Does not fork Anacron to the
background. In this mode, Anacron will output informational
messages to standard error, as well as to syslog. The output
of any job is <br>
mailed by Anacron.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppresses any messages to
standard error. Only applicable with -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t some_anacrontab <br>
Uses the specified anacrontab, rather than the
/etc/anacrontab default one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Anacrontab testing. Tests the
/etc/anacrontab configuration file for validity. If there is
an error in the file, it is shown on the standard output and
Anacron returns the <br>
value of 1. Valid anacrontabs return the value of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S spooldir <br>
Uses the specified spooldir to store timestamps in. This
option is required for users who wish to run anacron
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints version information,
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Prints short usage message,
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
After receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, Anacron waits for any
running jobs to finish and then exits. This can be used to
stop Anacron cleanly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Make sure your time-zone is set correctly before Anacron is
started since the time-zone affects the date. This is
usually accomplished by setting the TZ environment variable,
or <br>
by installing a /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime file. See
tzset(3) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timestamp files are created in
the spool directory for each job specified in an anacrontab.
These files are never removed automatically by Anacron, and
should be removed by hand <br>
if a job is no longer being scheduled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/anacrontab <br>
Contains specifications of jobs. See anacrontab(5) for a
complete description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/anacron <br>
This directory is used by Anacron for storing timestamp
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
anacrontab(5), cron(8), tzset(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Anacron README file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Anacron never removes timestamp files. Remove unused files
manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anacron uses up to two file
descriptors for each active job. It may run out of
descriptors if there are lots of active jobs. See echo
$(($(ulimit -n) / 2)) for information how <br>
many concurent jobs anacron may run.</p>
