<p>MAKEALIASES(8) Double Precision, Inc. MAKEALIASES(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makealiases - Create an alias database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
makealiases [-protocol=protocol] [-alias=filename]
[-src=pathname] [-tmp=filename] [-chk] [-dump] [module]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Courier mail server&rsquo;s /etc/courier/aliases.dat
file is a unified implementation of sendmail-style address
aliasing, qmail-style virtual domains, plus several Courier
mail <br>
server-style enhancements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term aliasing refers to
substituting one or more addresses for another address. A
one-to-one substitution results in the Courier mail server
accepting mail for one address, <br>
and delivering the mail to another address. A one-to-many
substitution results in the Courier mail server accepting
mail for one address, and delivering a separate copy of the
<br>
message to every address defined by the alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/courier/aliases.dat is a
binary database file. makealiases creates the binary
database file by reading the aliases from plain text files,
and makealiases creates <br>
/etc/courier/aliases.dat by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makealiases creates
/etc/courier/aliases.dat from one or more source files,
which are plain text files that may be created by any text
editor. The format of those source files is <br>
defined below. By default, makealiases obtains the source
text from /etc/courier/aliases. If this is a text file, it
is used verbatim. If this is a directory (the Courier mail
<br>
server creates it as a directory by default), all the
non-hidden files in this directory are concatenated
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-alias=filename <br>
Create filename, instead of /etc/courier/aliases.dat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chk <br>
Try to search for bad addresses used in the aliases.dat
file. This option takes some time to complete. It does not
create an aliases.dat file, but instead tries to check <br>
every address specified by the source text file. Why is this
necessary? That&rsquo;s because non-delivery reports will
not be sent to the sender for failures in delivering mail to
<br>
an aliased address. This is by design. the Courier mail
server considers aliases to be private mailing lists.
Because non-delivery notices are not sent, bad addresses
will <br>
not be immediately detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The -chk option is really effective for addresses which are
local, because there is no real way to determine if a remote
mail address is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dump <br>
Do not create aliases.dat, instead display the contents of
the alias database, in plain text form. The contents will be
the combined contents of all the source files, with <br>
all addresses converted to canonical format, with duplicates
removed and sub-aliases expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-src=pathname <br>
Use pathname instead of /etc/courier/aliases as the source
file. pathname can also refer to a directory. This
concatenates every non-hidden file in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tmp=filename <br>
Use filename as a temporary file, instead of
/etc/courier/aliases.tmp. makealiases requires a temporary
file for its own purposes, which is automatically removed
when done. <br>
This temporary file MUST reside on the same filesystem as
aliases.dat. If the -alias option specifies a file on a
different filesystem, use this option to specify where to
<br>
temporary place a file in the same filesystem. Because
makealiases always uses the same name for a temporary file
you cannot run more than one makealiases process at the same
<br>
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-protocol=protocol <br>
Use an alias list that&rsquo;s private to messages coming
from protocol. See below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional module specifies
the module whose rewriting rules are used to convert E-mail
addresses into a canonical form. If not specified, the local
module&rsquo;s address rewriting <br>
rules will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL ALIASES <br>
Addresses in /etc/courier/aliases.dat will be checked in
every message. Use the -protocol option to create aliases
that will be checked only for message that are received via
a <br>
specific protocol, such as ESMTP, UUCP, or locally-generated
mail. This allows you, for example, to create an alias such
as &quot;everyone&quot;, which is only avaliable to locally
<br>
generated mail, and does not work for mail received via
ESMTP. The argument to the -protocol option is one of:
esmtp, uucp, or local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protocol-specific alias files
are /etc/courier/aliases-protocol.dat, where
&quot;protocol&quot; is the specific protocol, such as
&quot;local&quot;, &quot;esmtp&quot;, or &quot;uucp&quot;,
and the source file read by <br>
makealiases would be /etc/courier/aliases-protocol. If the
-protocol option is specified, makealiases will access these
files instead of /etc/courier/aliases.dat and <br>
/etc/courier/aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALIAS SPECIFICATIONS <br>
The sources file used to create the binary aliases.dat
database are plain text files that may be created using any
editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each alias specification takes
the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias: address1, address2,
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail received by the Courier
mail server addressed to alias will be delivered to the list
of addresses specified. The list of addresses may be split
across multiple lines, if the <br>
second and subsequent line starts with a space
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines starting with the #
character are ignored, they are comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias is not restricted to be a
local address. It may be any valid RFC 2822[1] address. All
addresses do not necessary have to be in a canonical
form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias:
:include:/absolute/pathname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This notation reads the list of
addresses from another file, /absolute/pathname. This file
should contain one address per line (comma separated
addresses on the same line will <br>
also work).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
If alias refers to a local, existing, account, this account
will never get any mail. Any mail with the account listed as
recipient will be redirected to all the addresses <br>
specified for that alias. To have a copy of the mail
delivered to the account, define it as one of the addresses
in the alias itself. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">larry: larry, moe, curly,
shemp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Larry will still receive his
mail, but copies will will also be sent to Moe, Curly, and
Shemp. If Larry wasn&rsquo;t specified in the alias, he
would never get any mail, it will <br>
all be forwarded to Moe, Curly, and Shemp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPLICATE ADDRESSES <br>
Alias definitions may refer to other alias definitions, and
makealiases automatically incorporates addresses from other
aliases. If the same address is listed in multiple <br>
aliases, and two or more of them are specified as recipients
of the same message, only one copy of the message will be
delivered to the address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIRTUAL DOMAINS <br>
The following special syntax implements a virtual domain. A
virtual domain redirects all mail for an entire domain to
one user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@domain: user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This special entry results in
any recipient address of the form foo@domain to be rewritten
as user-foo@me, where me is the hostname of the machine,
which we expect to be a local <br>
domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples use the
alias entry &quot;@example.com: john&quot;, and
&quot;domain.com&quot; is in the control/me file. The
address &quot;postmaster@example.com&quot; becomes <br>
&quot;john-postmaster@domain.com&quot;, and
&quot;sales-info@example.com&quot; becomes
&quot;john-sales-info@domain.com&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intended behavior is to use
an actual account named john. As a result of the virtual
domain address rewriting, delivery instructions for
postmaster@example.com can now be <br>
specified by john&rsquo;s $HOME/.courier-postmaster file,
and delivery instructions for sales-info@example.com may be
specified by $HOME/.courier-sales-info. john&rsquo;s <br>
$HOME/.courier-default may be used to specify delivery
instructions for any other address in the example.com
domain, which does not have an explicit .courier file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the alias entry was
&quot;@example.com: john-example&quot;, the corresponding
files in john&rsquo;s $HOME directory are
.courier-example-postmaster, .courier-example-sales-info,
and <br>
.courier-example-default. See dot-courier(5)[2] for more
information on .courier files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Virtual domain rewriting is NOT recursive, unlike regular
aliases. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tom: john@example.com <br>
@example.com: larry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should explicitly expand the
alias out:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tom: larry-john</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM OR MAILBOX ALIASES <br>
The following notation associates an address directly with a
mailbox, or with a program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info: /var/shared/info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages addressed to
&quot;info&quot; will be delivered to the mailbox or maildir
/var/shared/info. A full pathname must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info: |
/usr/local/shared/info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail addressed to
&quot;info&quot; will be delivered to the indicated program.
The program receives each message on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program/mailbox delivery
notation is primarily used to support legacy sendmail
aliases entries. This is considered to be a legacy feature,
and new installations should create a <br>
dot-courier(5)[2] file with the necessary delivery
instructions. In fact, aliases for programs or mailboxes is
not directly supported by the Courier mail server&rsquo;s
aliasing <br>
mechanisms. It&rsquo;s implemented by having the makealiases
script automatically create a .courier file, and point the
alias address to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See dot-courier(5)[2] for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Unlike sendmail, the Courier mail server delivers as user
&quot;courier&quot; (group courier) when delivering to
programs or mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUCP VIRTUAL DOMAINS <br>
The following notation allows mail addressed to a certain
domain to be forwarded via uucp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@domain: uucp!bang!path!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trailing ! tells the Courier
mail server not to append a dash, so user@domain gets
rewritten as uucp!bang!path!user, and not
uucp!bang!path-user, which is probably not what <br>
you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELIVERY STATUS NOTIFICATIONS
<br>
An alias with only one address does not affect delivery
status notification attributes of an E-mail message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alias with multiple addresses
is treated like a private mailing list, as defined by RFC
1894[3]. If the message requests a successful delivery
notification, the Courier mail <br>
server generates a delivery status notification for the
successful delivery to the aliased address, and each alias
recipient address will have DSNs set to NEVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This has nothing to do with the Courier mail server&rsquo;s
support for a Qmail-style alias account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner-foo feature of
sendmail&rsquo;s aliasing is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the Courier mail server normally
tries to eliminate duplicate addresses listed as recipients
for the same message. Some mail servers are not capable of
delivering messages with <br>
multiple recipients, and will transmit a separate copy of
the same message addressed to each recipient. The Courier
mail server can&rsquo;t do anything in this case. Each copy
of the <br>
same original text is considered an individual, separate,
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate elimination can fail
in certain rare circumstances, involving exotic features of
RFC 2822[1] concerning case sensitivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;@example.com: jack,
jill&quot; is allowed, but strongly discouraged under the
penalty of law.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because multiple-recipient
aliases are treated like private mailing lists, failure DSNs
are turned off, and a bad recipient address is hardly
noticed by anyone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The makealiases command may
execute while the Courier mail server is running, and any
changes take effect immediately. However, only one instance
of makealiases is permitted to <br>
run at the same time.</p>
