<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server, dhcpd, implements the Dynamic Host
  Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP).
  DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request and be assigned IP addresses,
  and also to discover information about the network to which they are attached.
  BOOTP provides similar functionality, with certain restrictions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#OPERATION">OPERATION</a></h1>
The DHCP protocol allows a host which is unknown to the network administrator to
  be automatically assigned a new IP address out of a pool of IP addresses for
  its network. In order for this to work, the network administrator allocates
  address pools in each subnet and enters them into the dhcpd.conf(5) file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two versions of the DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. At startup the
  server may be started for one or the other via the <b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b>
  arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On startup, dhcpd reads the <i>dhcpd.conf</i> file and stores a list of
  available addresses on each subnet in memory. When a client requests an
  address using the DHCP protocol, dhcpd allocates an address for it. Each
  client is assigned a lease, which expires after an amount of time chosen by
  the administrator (by default, one day). Before leases expire, the clients to
  which leases are assigned are expected to renew them in order to continue to
  use the addresses. Once a lease has expired, the client to which that lease
  was assigned is no longer permitted to use the leased IP address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and server restarts,
  dhcpd keeps a list of leases it has assigned in the dhcpd.leases(5) file.
  Before dhcpd grants a lease to a host, it records the lease in this file and
  makes sure that the contents of the file are flushed to disk. This ensures
  that even in the event of a system crash, dhcpd will not forget about a lease
  that it has assigned. On startup, after reading the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd
  reads the dhcpd.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases have been
  assigned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
New leases are appended to the end of the dhcpd.leases file. In order to prevent
  the file from becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time dhcpd creates a
  new dhcpd.leases file from its in-core lease database. Once this file has been
  written to disk, the old file is renamed <i>dhcpd.leases~</i>, and the new
  file is renamed dhcpd.leases. If the system crashes in the middle of this
  process, whichever dhcpd.leases file remains will contain all the lease
  information, so there is no need for a special crash recovery process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
BOOTP support is also provided by this server. Unlike DHCP, the BOOTP protocol
  does not provide a protocol for recovering dynamically-assigned addresses once
  they are no longer needed. It is still possible to dynamically assign
  addresses to BOOTP clients, but some administrative process for reclaiming
  addresses is required. By default, leases are granted to BOOTP clients in
  perpetuity, although the network administrator may set an earlier cutoff date
  or a shorter lease length for BOOTP leases if that makes sense.
<div class="Pp"></div>
BOOTP clients may also be served in the old standard way, which is to simply
  provide a declaration in the dhcpd.conf file for each BOOTP client,
  permanently assigning an address to each client.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whenever changes are made to the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd must be restarted. To
  restart dhcpd, send a SIGTERM (signal 15) to the process ID contained in
  <i>/var/run/dhcpd.pid</i>, and then re-invoke dhcpd. Because the DHCP server
  database is not as lightweight as a BOOTP database, dhcpd does not
  automatically restart itself when it sees a change to the dhcpd.conf file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: We get a lot of complaints about this. We realize that it would be nice if
  one could send a SIGHUP to the server and have it reload the database. This is
  not technically impossible, but it would require a great deal of work, our
  resources are extremely limited, and they can be better spent elsewhere. So
  please don't complain about this on the mailing list unless you're prepared to
  fund a project to implement this feature, or prepared to do it yourself.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINE"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINE">COMMAND
  LINE</a></h1>
The names of the network interfaces on which dhcpd should listen for broadcasts
  may be specified on the command line. This should be done on systems where
  dhcpd is unable to identify non-broadcast interfaces, but should not be
  required on other systems. If no interface names are specified on the command
  line dhcpd will identify all network interfaces which are up, eliminating
  non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and listen for DHCP broadcasts on each
  interface.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The syntax of the dhcpd.conf(5) file is discussed separately. This section
  should be used as an overview of the configuration process, and the
  dhcpd.conf(5) documentation should be consulted for detailed reference
  information.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Subnets"><a class="selflink" href="#Subnets">Subnets</a></h1>
dhcpd needs to know the subnet numbers and netmasks of all subnets for which it
  will be providing service. In addition, in order to dynamically allocate
  addresses, it must be assigned one or more ranges of addresses on each subnet
  which it can in turn assign to client hosts as they boot. Thus, a very simple
  configuration providing DHCP support might look like this:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
	}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple address ranges may be specified like this:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
	  range 239.252.197.113 239.252.197.250;
	}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a subnet will only be provided with BOOTP service and no dynamic address
  assignment, the range clause can be left out entirely, but the subnet
  statement must appear.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Lease_Lengths"><a class="selflink" href="#Lease_Lengths">Lease
  Lengths</a></h1>
DHCP leases can be assigned almost any length from zero seconds to infinity.
  What lease length makes sense for any given subnet, or for any given
  installation, will vary depending on the kinds of hosts being served.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, in an office environment where systems are added from time to time
  and removed from time to time, but move relatively infrequently, it might make
  sense to allow lease times of a month or more. In a final test environment on
  a manufacturing floor, it may make more sense to assign a maximum lease length
  of 30 minutes - enough time to go through a simple test procedure on a network
  appliance before packaging it up for delivery.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible to specify two lease lengths: the default length that will be
  assigned if a client doesn't ask for any particular lease length, and a
  maximum lease length. These are specified as clauses to the subnet command:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
	  default-lease-time 600;
	  max-lease-time 7200;
	}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This particular subnet declaration specifies a default lease time of 600 seconds
  (ten minutes), and a maximum lease time of 7200 seconds (two hours). Other
  common values would be 86400 (one day), 604800 (one week) and 2592000 (30
  days).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each subnet need not have the same lease&#x2014;in the case of an office
  environment and a manufacturing environment served by the same DHCP server, it
  might make sense to have widely disparate values for default and maximum lease
  times on each subnet.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BOOTP_Support"><a class="selflink" href="#BOOTP_Support">BOOTP
  Support</a></h1>
Each BOOTP client must be explicitly declared in the dhcpd.conf file. A very
  basic client declaration will specify the client network interface's hardware
  address and the IP address to assign to that client. If the client needs to be
  able to load a boot file from the server, that file's name must be specified.
  A simple bootp client declaration might look like this:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	host haagen {
	  hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
	  fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
	  filename &quot;/tftpboot/haagen.boot&quot;;
	}
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Options">Options</a></h1>
DHCP (and also BOOTP with Vendor Extensions) provide a mechanism whereby the
  server can provide the client with information about how to configure its
  network interface (e.g., subnet mask), and also how the client can access
  various network services (e.g., DNS, IP routers, and so on).
<div class="Pp"></div>
These options can be specified on a per-subnet basis, and, for BOOTP clients,
  also on a per-client basis. In the event that a BOOTP client declaration
  specifies options that are also specified in its subnet declaration, the
  options specified in the client declaration take precedence. A reasonably
  complete DHCP configuration might look something like this:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
	  default-lease-time 600 max-lease-time 7200;
	  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
	  option broadcast-address 239.252.197.255;
	  option routers 239.252.197.1;
	  option domain-name-servers 239.252.197.2, 239.252.197.3;
	  option domain-name &quot;isc.org&quot;;
	}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A bootp host on that subnet that needs to be in a different domain and use a
  different name server might be declared as follows:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	host haagen {
	  hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
	  fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
	  filename &quot;/tftpboot/haagen.boot&quot;;
	  option domain-name-servers 192.5.5.1;
	  option domain-name &quot;vix.com&quot;;
	}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A more complete description of the dhcpd.conf file syntax is provided in
  dhcpd.conf(5).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OMAPI"><a class="selflink" href="#OMAPI">OMAPI</a></h1>
The DHCP server provides the capability to modify some of its configuration
  while it is running, without stopping it, modifying its database files, and
  restarting it. This capability is currently provided using OMAPI - an API for
  manipulating remote objects. OMAPI clients connect to the server using TCP/IP,
  authenticate, and can then examine the server's current status and make
  changes to it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Rather than implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user programs
  should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself. Dhcpctl is a wrapper that handles
  some of the housekeeping chores that OMAPI does not do automatically. Dhcpctl
  and OMAPI are documented in <b>dhcpctl(3)</b> and <b>omapi(3)</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OMAPI exports objects, which can then be examined and modified. The DHCP server
  exports the following objects: lease, host, failover-state and group. Each
  object has a number of methods that are provided: lookup, create, and destroy.
  In addition, it is possible to look at attributes that are stored on objects,
  and in some cases to modify those attributes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_LEASE_OBJECT"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_LEASE_OBJECT">THE
  LEASE OBJECT</a></h1>
Leases can't currently be created or destroyed, but they can be looked up to

<b>known <i>integer</i> examine, modify</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">if nonzero, indicates that a client matching
  this host declaration will be treated as <i>known</i> in pool permit lists. If
  zero, the client will not be treated as known.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_GROUP_OBJECT"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_GROUP_OBJECT">THE
  GROUP OBJECT</a></h1>
Named groups can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined and modified. If a
  group declaration is created or deleted using OMAPI, that information will be
  recorded in the dhcpd.leases file. It is permissible to delete group
  declarations that are declared in the dhcpd.conf file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Named groups currently can only be associated with hosts - this allows one set
  of statements to be efficiently attached to more than one host declaration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Groups have the following attributes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>name <i>data</i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">the name of the group. All groups that are
  created using OMAPI must have names, and the names must be unique among all
  groups.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>statements <i>data</i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">a list of statements in the format of the
  dhcpd.conf file that will be executed whenever a message from a client whose
  host declaration references this group is processed.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_CONTROL_OBJECT"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_CONTROL_OBJECT">THE
  CONTROL OBJECT</a></h1>
The control object allows you to shut the server down. If the server is doing
  failover with another peer, it will make a clean transition into the shutdown
  state and notify its peer, so that the peer can go into partner down, and then
  record the &quot;recover&quot; state in the lease file so that when the server
  is restarted, it will automatically resynchronize with its peer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On shutdown the server will also attempt to cleanly shut down all OMAPI
  connections. If these connections do not go down cleanly after five seconds,
  they are shut down preemptively. It can take as much as 25 seconds from the
  beginning of the shutdown process to the time that the server actually exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To shut the server down, open its control object and set the state attribute to
  2.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_FAILOVER-STATE_OBJECT"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_FAILOVER-STATE_OBJECT">THE
  FAILOVER-STATE OBJECT</a></h1>
The failover-state object is the object that tracks the state of the failover
  protocol as it is being managed for a given failover peer. The failover object
  has the following attributes (please see <b>dhcpd.conf (5)</b> for
  explanations about what these attributes mean):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>name <i>data</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the name of the failover peer
  relationship, as described in the server's <b>dhcpd.conf</b> file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>partner-address <i>data</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the failover partner's IP
  address.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>local-address <i>data</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the IP address that is being used by
  the DHCP server for this failover pair.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>partner-port <i>data</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the TCP port on which the failover
  partner is listening for failover protocol connections.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>local-port <i>data</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the TCP port on which the DHCP
  server is listening for failover protocol connections for this failover
  pair.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>max-outstanding-updates <i>integer</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the number of updates that can be
  outstanding and unacknowledged at any given time, in this failover
  relationship.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>mclt <i>integer</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the maximum client lead time in this
  failover relationship.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>load-balance-max-secs <i>integer</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the maximum value for the secs field
  in a client request before load balancing is bypassed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>load-balance-hba <i>data</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the load balancing hash bucket array
  for this failover relationship.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>local-state <i>integer</i> examine, modify</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the present state of the DHCP server
  in this failover relationship. Possible values for state are:</div>
<div style="margin-left: 1.00in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
1   - startup
2   - normal
3   - communications interrupted
4   - partner down
5   - potential conflict
6   - recover
7   - paused
8   - shutdown
9   - recover done
10  - resolution interrupted
11  - conflict done
254 - recover wait
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">(Note that some of the above values have
  changed since DHCP 3.0.x.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">In general it is not a good idea to make
  changes to this state. However, in the case that the failover partner is known
  to be down, it can be useful to set the DHCP server's failover state to
  partner down. At this point the DHCP server will take over service of the
  failover partner's leases as soon as possible, and will give out normal
  leases, not leases that are restricted by MCLT. If you do put the DHCP server
  into the partner-down when the other DHCP server is not in the partner-down
  state, but is not reachable, IP address assignment conflicts are possible,
  even likely. Once a server has been put into partner-down mode, its failover
  partner must not be brought back online until communication is possible
  between the two servers.</div>

<b>partner-state <i>integer</i> examine</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">Indicates the present state of the failover
