<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server, dhcpd,
implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
and the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). DHCP allows
hosts on a <br>
TCP/IP network to request and be assigned IP addresses, and
also to discover information about the network to which they
are attached. BOOTP provides similar functionality, with
<br>
certain restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
The DHCP protocol allows a host which is unknown to the
network administrator to be automatically assigned a new IP
address out of a pool of IP addresses for its network. In
<br>
order for this to work, the network administrator allocates
address pools in each subnet and enters them into the
dhcpd.conf(5) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two versions of the
DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. At startup the server may
be started for one or the other via the -4 or -6
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup, dhcpd reads the
dhcpd.conf file and stores a list of available addresses on
each subnet in memory. When a client requests an address
using the DHCP protocol, dhcpd <br>
allocates an address for it. Each client is assigned a
lease, which expires after an amount of time chosen by the
administrator (by default, one day). Before leases expire,
the <br>
clients to which leases are assigned are expected to renew
them in order to continue to use the addresses. Once a lease
has expired, the client to which that lease was assigned
<br>
is no longer permitted to use the leased IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to keep track of leases
across system reboots and server restarts, dhcpd keeps a
list of leases it has assigned in the dhcpd.leases(5) file.
Before dhcpd grants a lease <br>
to a host, it records the lease in this file and makes sure
that the contents of the file are flushed to disk. This
ensures that even in the event of a system crash, dhcpd will
<br>
not forget about a lease that it has assigned. On startup,
after reading the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd reads the
dhcpd.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
have been <br>
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New leases are appended to the
end of the dhcpd.leases file. In order to prevent the file
from becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time dhcpd
creates a new dhcpd.leases <br>
file from its in-core lease database. Once this file has
been written to disk, the old file is renamed dhcpd.leases~,
and the new file is renamed dhcpd.leases. If the system <br>
crashes in the middle of this process, whichever
dhcpd.leases file remains will contain all the lease
information, so there is no need for a special crash
recovery process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTP support is also provided
by this server. Unlike DHCP, the BOOTP protocol does not
provide a protocol for recovering dynamically-assigned
addresses once they are no longer <br>
needed. It is still possible to dynamically assign addresses
to BOOTP clients, but some administrative process for
reclaiming addresses is required. By default, leases are
<br>
granted to BOOTP clients in perpetuity, although the network
administrator may set an earlier cutoff date or a shorter
lease length for BOOTP leases if that makes sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTP clients may also be served
in the old standard way, which is to simply provide a
declaration in the dhcpd.conf file for each BOOTP client,
permanently assigning an address <br>
to each client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever changes are made to the
dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd must be restarted. To restart dhcpd,
send a SIGTERM (signal 15) to the process ID contained in
/var/run/dhcpd.pid, and <br>
then re-invoke dhcpd. Because the DHCP server database is
not as lightweight as a BOOTP database, dhcpd does not
automatically restart itself when it sees a change to the
<br>
dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: We get a lot of complaints
about this. We realize that it would be nice if one could
send a SIGHUP to the server and have it reload the database.
This is not technically <br>
impossible, but it would require a great deal of work, our
resources are extremely limited, and they can be better
spent elsewhere. So please don&rsquo;t complain about this
on the <br>
mailing list unless you&rsquo;re prepared to fund a project
to implement this feature, or prepared to do it
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE <br>
The names of the network interfaces on which dhcpd should
listen for broadcasts may be specified on the command line.
This should be done on systems where dhcpd is unable to <br>
identify non-broadcast interfaces, but should not be
required on other systems. If no interface names are
specified on the command line dhcpd will identify all
network inter&acirc; <br>
faces which are up, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if
possible, and listen for DHCP broadcasts on each
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
-4 Run as a DHCP server. This is the default and cannot be
combined with -6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Run as a DHCPv6 server. This
cannot be combined with -4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
The udp port number on which dhcpd should listen. If
unspecified dhcpd uses the default port of 67. This is
mostly useful for debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s address <br>
Specify an address or host name to which dhcpd should send
replies rather than the broadcast address (255.255.255.255).
This option is only supported in IPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force dhcpd to run as a
foreground process instead of as a daemon in the background.
This is useful when running dhcpd under a debugger, or when
running it out of inittab <br>
on System V systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Send log messages to the
standard error descriptor. This can be useful for debugging,
and also at sites where a complete log of all dhcp activity
must be kept but syslogd <br>
is not reliable or otherwise cannot be used. Normally, dhcpd
will log all output using the syslog(3) function with the
log facility set to LOG_DAEMON. Note that -d <br>
implies -f (the daemon will not fork itself into the
background).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet at startup. This
suppresses the printing of the entire copyright message
during startup. This might be desirable when starting dhcpd
from a system startup <br>
script (e.g., /etc/rc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Test the configuration file.
The server tests the configuration file for correct syntax,
but will not attempt to perform any network operations. This
can be used to test <br>
a new configuration file automatically before installing
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Test the lease file. The
server tests the lease file for correct syntax, but will not
attempt to perform any network operations. This can be used
to test a new leaes <br>
file automatically before installing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tf tracefile <br>
Specify a file into which the entire startup state of the
server and all the transactions it processes are logged.
This can be useful in submitting bug reports - if you <br>
are getting a core dump every so often, you can start the
server with the -tf option and then, when the server dumps
core, the trace file will contain all the transactions <br>
that led up to it dumping core, so that the problem can be
easily debugged with -play.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-play playfile <br>
Specify a file from which the entire startup state of the
server and all the transactions it processed are read. The
-play option must be specified with an alternate <br>
lease file, using the -lf switch, so that the DHCP server
doesn&rsquo;t wipe out your existing lease file with its
test data. The DHCP server will refuse to operate in
playback <br>
mode unless you specify an alternate lease file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-user user <br>
Setuid to user after completing privileged operations, such
as creating sockets that listen on privileged ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-group group <br>
Setgid to group after completing privileged operations, such
as creating sockets that listen on privileged ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chroot dir <br>
Chroot to directory after processing the command line
arguments, but before reading the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifying default file
locations: The following options can be used to modify the
locations dhcpd uses for it&rsquo;s files. Because of the
importance of using the same lease database <br>
at all times when running dhcpd in production, these options
should be used only for testing lease files or database
files in a non-production environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cf config-file <br>
Path to alternate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lf lease-file <br>
Path to alternate lease file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pf pid-file <br>
Path to alternate pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pid <br>
Option to disable writing pid files. By default the program
will write a pid file. If the program is invoked with this
option it will not check for an existing server <br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The syntax of the dhcpd.conf(5) file is discussed
separately. This section should be used as an overview of
the configuration process, and the dhcpd.conf(5)
documentation should <br>
be consulted for detailed reference information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subnets <br>
dhcpd needs to know the subnet numbers and netmasks of all
subnets for which it will be providing service. In addition,
in order to dynamically allocate addresses, it must be <br>
assigned one or more ranges of addresses on each subnet
which it can in turn assign to client hosts as they boot.
Thus, a very simple configuration providing DHCP support
might <br>
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask
255.255.255.0 { <br>
range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple address ranges may be
specified like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask
255.255.255.0 { <br>
range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107; <br>
range 239.252.197.113 239.252.197.250; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a subnet will only be
provided with BOOTP service and no dynamic address
assignment, the range clause can be left out entirely, but
the subnet statement must appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lease Lengths <br>
DHCP leases can be assigned almost any length from zero
seconds to infinity. What lease length makes sense for any
given subnet, or for any given installation, will vary
depend&acirc; <br>
ing on the kinds of hosts being served.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, in an office
environment where systems are added from time to time and
removed from time to time, but move relatively infrequently,
it might make sense to allow <br>
lease times of a month or more. In a final test environment
on a manufacturing floor, it may make more sense to assign a
maximum lease length of 30 minutes - enough time to go <br>
through a simple test procedure on a network appliance
before packaging it up for delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to specify two
lease lengths: the default length that will be assigned if a
client doesn&rsquo;t ask for any particular lease length,
and a maximum lease length. These <br>
are specified as clauses to the subnet command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask
255.255.255.0 { <br>
range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107; <br>
default-lease-time 600; <br>
max-lease-time 7200; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This particular subnet
declaration specifies a default lease time of 600 seconds
(ten minutes), and a maximum lease time of 7200 seconds (two
hours). Other common values would <br>
be 86400 (one day), 604800 (one week) and 2592000 (30
days).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each subnet need not have the
same lease&acirc;in the case of an office environment and a
manufacturing environment served by the same DHCP server, it
might make sense to have widely <br>
disparate values for default and maximum lease times on each
subnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTP Support <br>
Each BOOTP client must be explicitly declared in the
dhcpd.conf file. A very basic client declaration will
specify the client network interface&rsquo;s hardware
address and the IP <br>
address to assign to that client. If the client needs to be
able to load a boot file from the server, that file&rsquo;s
name must be specified. A simple bootp client declaration
<br>
might look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host haagen { <br>
hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23; <br>
fixed-address 239.252.197.9; <br>
filename &quot;/tftpboot/haagen.boot&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
DHCP (and also BOOTP with Vendor Extensions) provide a
mechanism whereby the server can provide the client with
information about how to configure its network interface
(e.g., <br>
subnet mask), and also how the client can access various
network services (e.g., DNS, IP routers, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options can be specified
on a per-subnet basis, and, for BOOTP clients, also on a
per-client basis. In the event that a BOOTP client
declaration specifies options that are <br>
also specified in its subnet declaration, the options
specified in the client declaration take precedence. A
reasonably complete DHCP configuration might look something
like <br>
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask
255.255.255.0 { <br>
range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250; <br>
default-lease-time 600 max-lease-time 7200; <br>
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0; <br>
option broadcast-address 239.252.197.255; <br>
option routers 239.252.197.1; <br>
option domain-name-servers 239.252.197.2, 239.252.197.3;
<br>
option domain-name &quot;isc.org&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bootp host on that subnet that
needs to be in a different domain and use a different name
server might be declared as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host haagen { <br>
hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23; <br>
fixed-address 239.252.197.9; <br>
filename &quot;/tftpboot/haagen.boot&quot;; <br>
option domain-name-servers 192.5.5.1; <br>
option domain-name &quot;vix.com&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more complete description of
the dhcpd.conf file syntax is provided in dhcpd.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OMAPI <br>
The DHCP server provides the capability to modify some of
its configuration while it is running, without stopping it,
modifying its database files, and restarting it. This
capa&acirc; <br>
bility is currently provided using OMAPI - an API for
manipulating remote objects. OMAPI clients connect to the
server using TCP/IP, authenticate, and can then examine the
<br>
server&rsquo;s current status and make changes to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rather than implementing the
underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user programs should use
the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself. Dhcpctl is a wrapper that
handles some of the house&acirc; <br>
keeping chores that OMAPI does not do automatically. Dhcpctl
and OMAPI are documented in dhcpctl(3) and omapi(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OMAPI exports objects, which can
then be examined and modified. The DHCP server exports the
following objects: lease, host, failover-state and group.
Each object has a number <br>
of methods that are provided: lookup, create, and destroy.
In addition, it is possible to look at attributes that are
stored on objects, and in some cases to modify those <br>
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE LEASE OBJECT <br>
Leases can&rsquo;t currently be created or destroyed, but
they can be looked up to examine and modify their state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leases have the following
attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">state integer lookup, examine
<br>
1 = free <br>
2 = active <br>
3 = expired <br>
4 = released <br>
5 = abandoned <br>
6 = reset <br>
7 = backup <br>
8 = reserved <br>
9 = bootp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip-address data lookup, examine
<br>
The IP address of the lease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp-client-identifier data
lookup, examine, update <br>
The client identifier that the client used when it acquired
the lease. Not all clients send client identifiers, so this
may be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client-hostname data examine,
update <br>
The value the client sent in the host-name option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host handle examine <br>
the host declaration associated with this lease, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subnet handle examine <br>
the subnet object associated with this lease (the subnet
object is not currently supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pool handle examine <br>
the pool object associated with this lease (the pool object
is not currently supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">billing-class handle examine
<br>
the handle to the class to which this lease is currently
billed, if any (the class object is not currently
supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardware-address data examine,
update <br>
the hardware address (chaddr) field sent by the client when
it acquired its lease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardware-type integer examine,
update <br>
the type of the network interface that the client reported
when it acquired its lease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ends time examine <br>
the time when the lease&rsquo;s current state ends, as
understood by the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tstp time examine <br>
the time when the lease&rsquo;s current state ends, as
understood by the server. <br>
tsfp time examine <br>
the adjusted time when the lease&rsquo;s current state ends,
as understood by the failover peer (if there is no failover
peer, this value is undefined). Generally this value is <br>
only adjusted for expired, released, or reset leases while
the server is operating in partner-down state, and otherwise
is simply the value supplied by the peer. <br>
atsfp time examine <br>
the actual tsfp value sent from the peer. This value is
forgotten when a lease binding state change is made, to
facilitate retransmission logic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cltt time examine <br>
The time of the last transaction with the client on this
lease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE HOST OBJECT <br>
Hosts can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined and
modified. If a host declaration is created or deleted using
OMAPI, that information will be recorded in the dhcpd.leases
<br>
file. It is permissible to delete host declarations that are
declared in the dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hosts have the following
attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name data lookup, examine,
modify <br>
the name of the host declaration. This name must be unique
among all host declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group handle examine, modify
<br>
the named group associated with the host declaration, if
there is one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardware-address data lookup,
examine, modify <br>
the link-layer address that will be used to match the
client, if any. Only valid if hardware-type is also
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardware-type integer lookup,
examine, modify <br>
the type of the network interface that will be used to match
the client, if any. Only valid if hardware-address is also
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp-client-identifier data
lookup, examine, modify <br>
the dhcp-client-identifier option that will be used to match
the client, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip-address data examine, modify
<br>
a fixed IP address which is reserved for a DHCP client that
matches this host declaration. The IP address will only be
assigned to the client if it is valid for the network <br>
segment to which the client is connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statements data modify <br>
a list of statements in the format of the dhcpd.conf file
that will be executed whenever a message from the client is
being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">known integer examine, modify
<br>
if nonzero, indicates that a client matching this host
declaration will be treated as known in pool permit lists.
If zero, the client will not be treated as known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE GROUP OBJECT <br>
Named groups can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined
and modified. If a group declaration is created or deleted
using OMAPI, that information will be recorded in the <br>
dhcpd.leases file. It is permissible to delete group
declarations that are declared in the dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named groups currently can only
be associated with hosts - this allows one set of statements
to be efficiently attached to more than one host
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Groups have the following
attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name data <br>
the name of the group. All groups that are created using
OMAPI must have names, and the names must be unique among
all groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statements data <br>
a list of statements in the format of the dhcpd.conf file
that will be executed whenever a message from a client whose
host declaration references this group is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONTROL OBJECT <br>
The control object allows you to shut the server down. If
the server is doing failover with another peer, it will make
a clean transition into the shutdown state and notify its
<br>
peer, so that the peer can go into partner down, and then
record the &quot;recover&quot; state in the lease file so
that when the server is restarted, it will automatically
resynchronize <br>
with its peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On shutdown the server will also
attempt to cleanly shut down all OMAPI connections. If these
connections do not go down cleanly after five seconds, they
are shut down preemp&acirc; <br>
tively. It can take as much as 25 seconds from the beginning
of the shutdown process to the time that the server actually
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To shut the server down, open
its control object and set the state attribute to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE FAILOVER-STATE OBJECT <br>
The failover-state object is the object that tracks the
state of the failover protocol as it is being managed for a
given failover peer. The failover object has the following
<br>
attributes (please see dhcpd.conf (5) for explanations about
what these attributes mean):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name data examine <br>
Indicates the name of the failover peer relationship, as
described in the server&rsquo;s dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">partner-address data examine
<br>
Indicates the failover partner&rsquo;s IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-address data examine <br>
Indicates the IP address that is being used by the DHCP
server for this failover pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">partner-port data examine <br>
Indicates the TCP port on which the failover partner is
listening for failover protocol connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-port data examine <br>
Indicates the TCP port on which the DHCP server is listening
for failover protocol connections for this failover
pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-outstanding-updates integer
examine <br>
Indicates the number of updates that can be outstanding and
unacknowledged at any given time, in this failover
relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mclt integer examine <br>
Indicates the maximum client lead time in this failover
relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-balance-max-secs integer
examine <br>
Indicates the maximum value for the secs field in a client
request before load balancing is bypassed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-balance-hba data examine
<br>
Indicates the load balancing hash bucket array for this
failover relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-state integer examine,
modify <br>
Indicates the present state of the DHCP server in this
failover relationship. Possible values for state are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - startup <br>
2 - normal <br>
3 - communications interrupted <br>
4 - partner down <br>
5 - potential conflict <br>
6 - recover <br>
7 - paused <br>
8 - shutdown <br>
9 - recover done <br>
10 - resolution interrupted <br>
11 - conflict done <br>
254 - recover wait</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that some of the above
values have changed since DHCP 3.0.x.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general it is not a good idea
to make changes to this state. However, in the case that the
failover partner is known to be down, it can be useful to
set the DHCP <br>
server&rsquo;s failover state to partner down. At this point
the DHCP server will take over service of the failover
partner&rsquo;s leases as soon as possible, and will give
out normal <br>
leases, not leases that are restricted by MCLT. If you do
put the DHCP server into the partner-down when the other
DHCP server is not in the partner-down state, but is not
<br>
reachable, IP address assignment conflicts are possible,
even likely. Once a server has been put into partner-down
mode, its failover partner must not be brought back <br>
online until communication is possible between the two
servers.</p>

Indicates the present state of the failover partner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-stos integer examine <br>
Indicates the time at which the DHCP server entered its
present state in this failover relationship.</p>

was sent by this DHCP server to its failover partner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last-timestamp-received integer
examine <br>
Indicates the timestamp that was on the failover message
most recently received from the failover partner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skew integer examine <br>
Indicates the skew between the failover partner&rsquo;s
clock and this DHCP server&rsquo;s clock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-response-delay integer
examine <br>

received from the failover partner, the partner is assumed
to be out of communication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cur-unacked-updates integer
examine <br>
Indicates the number of update messages that have been
received from the failover partner but not yet
processed.</p>
