<p>SETSERIAL(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
SETSERIAL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
setserial - get/set Linux serial port information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
setserial [ -abqvVWz ] device [ parameter1 [ arg ] ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setserial -g [ -abGv ] device1
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
setserial is a program designed to set and/or report the
configuration information associated with a serial port.
This information includes what I/O port and IRQ a particular
<br>
serial port is using, and whether or not the break key
should be interpreted as the Secure Attention Key, and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the normal bootup
process, only COM ports 1-4 are initialized, using the
default I/O ports and IRQ values, as listed below. In order
to initialize any additional serial <br>
ports, or to change the COM 1-4 ports to a nonstadard
configuration, the setserial program should be used.
Typically it is called from an rc.serial script, which is
usually run <br>
out of /etc/rc.local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device argument or arguments
specifies the serial device which should be configured or
interrogated. It will usually have the following form:
/dev/cua[0-3].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no parameters are specified,
setserial will print out the port type (i.e., 8250, 16450,
16550, 16550A, etc.), the hardware I/O port, the hardware
IRQ line, its &quot;baud base,&quot; <br>
and some of its operational flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -g option is given, the
arguments to setserial are interpreted as a list of devices
for which the characteristics of those devices should be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without the -g option, the first
argument to setserial is interpreted as the device to be
modified or characteristics to be printed, and any
additional arguments are interpreted <br>
as parameters which should be assigned to that serial
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the most part, superuser
privilege is required to set the configuration parameters of
a serial port. A few serial port parameters can be set by
normal users, however, and <br>
these will be noted as exceptions in this manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Setserial accepts the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a When reporting the
configuration of a serial device, print all available
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b When reporting the
configuration of a serial device, print a summary of the
device&rsquo;s configuration, which might be suitable for
printing during the bootup process, during <br>
the /etc/rc script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Print out the configuration
information of the serial port in a form which can be fed
back to setserial as command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet. Setserial will
print fewer lines of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. Setserial will
print additional status output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Do wild interrupt
initialization and exit. This option is no longer relevant
in Linux kernels after version 2.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Zero out the serial flags
before starting to set flags. This is related to the
automatic saving of serial flags using the -G flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
The following parameters can be assigned to a serial
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All argument values are assumed
to be in decimal unless preceeded by &quot;0x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port port_number <br>
The port option sets the I/O port, as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">irq irq_number <br>
The irq option sets the hardware IRQ, as described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uart uart_type <br>
This option is used to set the UART type. The permitted
types are none, 8250, 16450, 16550, 16550A, 16650, 16650V2,
16654, 16750, 16850, 16950, and 16954. Using UART <br>
type none will disable the port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some internal modems are billed
as having a &quot;16550A UART with a 1k buffer&quot;. This
is a lie. They do not have really have a 16550A compatible
UART; instead what they have <br>
is a 16450 compatible UART with a 1k receive buffer to
prevent receiver overruns. This is important, because they
do not have a transmit FIFO. Hence, they are not com&acirc;
<br>
patible with a 16550A UART, and the autoconfiguration
process will correctly identify them as 16450&rsquo;s. If
you attempt to override this using the uart parameter, you
will <br>
see dropped characters during file transmissions. These
UART&rsquo;s usually have other problems: the skip_test
parameter also often must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoconfig <br>
When this parameter is given, setserial will ask the kernel
to attempt to automatically configure the serial port. The
I/O port must be correctly set; the kernel will <br>
attempt to determine the UART type, and if the auto_irq
parameter is set, Linux will attempt to automatically
determine the IRQ. The autoconfig parameter should be given
<br>
after the port,auto_irq, and skip_test parameters have been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_irq <br>
During autoconfiguration, try to determine the IRQ. This
feature is not guaranteed to always produce the correct
result; some hardware configurations will fool the Linux
<br>
kernel. It is generally safer not to use the auto_irq
feature, but rather to specify the IRQ to be used
explicitly, using the irq parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^auto_irq <br>
During autoconfiguration, do not try to determine the
IRQ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip_test <br>
During autoconfiguration, skip the UART test. Some internal
modems do not have National Semiconductor compatible
UART&rsquo;s, but have cheap imitations instead. Some of
these <br>
cheasy imitations UART&rsquo;s do not fully support the
loopback detection mode, which is used by the kernel to make
sure there really is a UART at a particular address before
<br>
attempting to configure it. So for certain internal modems
you will need to specify this parameter so Linux can
initialize the UART correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^skip_test <br>
During autoconfiguration, do not skip the UART test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">baud_base baud_base <br>
This option sets the base baud rate, which is the clock
frequency divided by 16. Normally this value is 115200,
which is also the fastest baud rate which the UART can <br>
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spd_hi Use 57.6kb when the
application requests 38.4kb. This parameter may be specified
by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spd_vhi <br>
Use 115kb when the application requests 38.4kb. This
parameter may be specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spd_shi <br>
Use 230kb when the application requests 38.4kb. This
parameter may be specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spd_warp <br>
Use 460kb when the application requests 38.4kb. This
parameter may be specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spd_cust <br>
Use the custom divisor to set the speed when the application
requests 38.4kb. In this case, the baud rate is the
baud_base divided by the divisor. This parameter may be <br>
specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spd_normal <br>
Use 38.4kb when the application requests 38.4kb. This
parameter may be specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">divisor divisor <br>
This option sets the custom divison. This divisor will be
used then the spd_cust option is selected and the serial
port is set to 38.4kb by the application. This parame&acirc;
<br>
ter may be specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sak Set the break key at the
Secure Attention Key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^sak disable the Secure
Attention Key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fourport <br>
Configure the port as an AST Fourport card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^fourport <br>
Disable AST Fourport configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close_delay delay <br>
Specify the amount of time, in hundredths of a second, that
DTR should remain low on a serial line after the callout
device is closed, before the blocked dialin device <br>
raises DTR again. The default value of this option is 50, or
a half-second delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">closing_wait delay <br>
Specify the amount of time, in hundredths of a second, that
the kernel should wait for data to be transmitted from the
serial port while closing the port. If &quot;none&quot; is
<br>
specified, no delay will occur. If &quot;infinite&quot; is
specified the kernel will wait indefinitely for the buffered
data to be transmitted. The default setting is 3000 or 30
<br>
seconds of delay. This default is generally appropriate for
most devices. If too long a delay is selected, then the
serial port may hang for a long time if when a serial <br>
port which is not connected, and has data pending, is
closed. If too short a delay is selected, then there is a
risk that some of the transmitted data is output at all.
<br>
If the device is extremely slow, like a plotter, the
closing_wait may need to be larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session_lockout <br>
Lock out callout port (/dev/cuaXX) accesses across different
sessions. That is, once a process has opened a port, do not
allow a process with a different session ID to <br>
open that port until the first process has closed it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^session_lockout <br>
Do not lock out callout port accesses across different
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgrp_lockout <br>
Lock out callout port (/dev/cuaXX) accesses across different
process groups. That is, once a process has opened a port,
do not allow a process in a different process <br>
group to open that port until the first process has closed
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^pgrp_lockout <br>
Do not lock out callout port accesses across different
process groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hup_notify <br>
Notify a process blocked on opening a dial in line when a
process has finished using a callout line (either by closing
it or by the serial line being hung up) by returning <br>
EAGAIN to the open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application of this
parameter is for getty&rsquo;s which are blocked on a serial
port&rsquo;s dial in line. This allows the getty to reset
the modem (which may have had its con&acirc; <br>
figuration modified by the application using the callout
device) before blocking on the open again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^hup_notify <br>
Do not notify a process blocked on opening a dial in line
when the callout device is hung up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split_termios <br>
Treat the termios settings used by the callout device and
the termios settings used by the dialin devices as
separate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^split_termios <br>
Use the same termios structure to store both the dialin and
callout ports. This is the default option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callout_nohup <br>
If this particular serial port is opened as a callout
device, do not hangup the tty when carrier detect is
dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^callout_nohup <br>
Do not skip hanging up the tty when a serial port is opened
as a callout device. Of course, the HUPCL termios flag must
be enabled if the hangup is to occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">low_latency <br>
Minimize the receive latency of the serial device at the
cost of greater CPU utilization. (Normally there is an
average of 5-10ms latency before characters are handed off
<br>
to the line discpline to minimize overhead.) This is off by
default, but certain real-time applications may find this
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^low_latency <br>
Optimize for efficient CPU processing of serial characters
at the cost of paying an average of 5-10ms of latency before
the characters are processed. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSIDERATIONS OF CONFIGURING
SERIAL PORTS <br>
It is important to note that setserial merely tells the
Linux kernel where it should expect to find the I/O port and
IRQ lines of a particular serial port. It does *not*
config&acirc; <br>
ure the hardware, the actual serial board, to use a
particular I/O port. In order to do that, you will need to
physically program the serial board, usually by setting some
<br>
jumpers or by switching some DIP switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section will provide some
pointers in helping you decide how you would like to
configure your serial ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;standard MS-DOS&quot;
port associations are given below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/ttys0 (COM1), port 0x3f8,
irq 4 <br>
/dev/ttys1 (COM2), port 0x2f8, irq 3 <br>
/dev/ttys2 (COM3), port 0x3e8, irq 4 <br>
/dev/ttys3 (COM4), port 0x2e8, irq 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the limitations in the
design of the AT/ISA bus architecture, normally an IRQ line
may not be shared between two or more serial ports. If you
attempt to do this, one or <br>
both serial ports will become unreliable if you try to use
both simultaneously. This limitation can be overcome by
special multi-port serial port boards, which are designed to
<br>
share multiple serial ports over a single IRQ line.
Multi-port serial cards supported by Linux include the AST
FourPort, the Accent Async board, the Usenet Serial II
board, the <br>
Bocaboard BB-1004, BB-1008, and BB-2016 boards, and the
HUB-6 serial board.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selection of an alternative
IRQ line is difficult, since most of them are already used.
The following table lists the &quot;standard MS-DOS&quot;
assignments of available IRQ lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRQ 3: COM2 <br>
IRQ 4: COM1 <br>
IRQ 5: LPT2 <br>
IRQ 7: LPT1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most people find that IRQ 5 is a
good choice, assuming that there is only one parallel port
active in the computer. Another good choice is IRQ 2 (aka
IRQ 9); although this IRQ <br>
is sometimes used by network cards, and very rarely VGA
cards will be configured to use IRQ 2 as a vertical retrace
interrupt. If your VGA card is configured this way; try to
<br>
disable it so you can reclaim that IRQ line for some other
card. It&rsquo;s not necessary for Linux and most other
Operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only other available IRQ
lines are 3, 4, and 7, and these are probably used by the
other serial and parallel ports. (If your serial card has a
16bit card edge connector, and <br>
supports higher interrupt numbers, then IRQ 10, 11, 12, and
15 are also available.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On AT class machines, IRQ 2 is
seen as IRQ 9, and Linux will interpret it in this
manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRQ&rsquo;s other than 2 (9), 3,
4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 15, should not be used, since they
are assigned to other hardware and cannot, in general, be
changed. Here are the &quot;standard&quot; <br>
assignments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRQ 0 Timer channel 0 <br>
IRQ 1 Keyboard <br>
IRQ 2 Cascade for controller 2 <br>
IRQ 3 Serial port 2 <br>
IRQ 4 Serial port 1 <br>
IRQ 5 Parallel port 2 (Reserved in PS/2) <br>
IRQ 6 Floppy diskette <br>
IRQ 7 Parallel port 1 <br>
IRQ 8 Real-time clock <br>
IRQ 9 Redirected to IRQ2 <br>
IRQ 10 Reserved <br>
IRQ 11 Reserved <br>
IRQ 12 Reserved (Auxillary device in PS/2) <br>
IRQ 13 Math coprocessor <br>
IRQ 14 Hard disk controller <br>
IRQ 15 Reserved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIPORT CONFIGURATION <br>
Certain multiport serial boards which share multiple ports
on a single IRQ use one or more ports to indicate whether or
not there are any pending ports which need to be serviced.
<br>
If your multiport board supports these ports, you should
make use of them to avoid potential lockups if the interrupt
gets lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to set these ports
specify set_multiport as a parameter, and follow it with the
multiport parameters. The multiport parameters take the form
of specifying the port that <br>
should be checked, a mask which indicate which bits in the
register are significant, and finally, a match parameter
which specifies what the significant bits in that register
<br>
must match when there is no more pending work to be
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to four such port/mask/match
combinations may be specified. The first such combinations
should be specified by setting the parameters port1, mask1,
and match1. The second <br>
such combination should be specified with port2, mask2, and
match2, and so on. In order to disable this multiport
checking, set port1 to be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to view the current
multiport settings, specify the parameter get_multiport on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some multiport settings
for some common serial boards:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AST FourPort port1 0x1BF mask1
0xf match1 0xf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boca BB-1004/8 port1 0x107 mask1
0xff match1 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boca BB-2016 port1 0x107 mask1
0xff match1 0 <br>
port2 0x147 mask2 0xff match2 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hayes ESP Configuration <br>
Setserial may also be used to configure ports on a Hayes ESP
serial board.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following parameters when
configuring ESP ports:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx_trigger <br>
This is the trigger level (in bytes) of the receive FIFO.
Larger values may result in fewer interrupts and hence
better performance; however, a value too high could result
<br>
in data loss. Valid values are 1 through 1023.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tx_trigger <br>
This is the trigger level (in bytes) of the transmit FIFO.
Larger values may result in fewer interrupts and hence
better performance; however, a value too high could <br>
result in degraded transmit performance. Valid values are 1
through 1023.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow_off <br>
This is the level (in bytes) at which the ESP port will
&quot;flow off&quot; the remote transmitter (i.e. tell him
to stop stop sending more bytes). Valid values are 1 through
<br>
1023. This value should be greater than the receive trigger
level and the flow on level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow_on <br>
This is the level (in bytes) at which the ESP port will
&quot;flow on&quot; the remote transmitter (i.e. tell him to
resume sending bytes) after having flowed it off. Valid
values <br>
are 1 through 1023. This value should be less than the flow
off level, but greater than the receive trigger level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx_timeout <br>
This is the amount of time that the ESP port will wait after
receiving the final character before signaling an interrupt.
Valid values are 0 through 255. A value too <br>
high will increase latency, and a value too low will cause
unnecessary interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION <br>
CAUTION: Configuring a serial port to use an incorrect I/O
port can lock up your machine.</p>
