<p>ntpdate(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual ntpdate(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntpdate - set the date and time via NTP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disclaimer: The functionality of
this program is now available in the ntpd program. See the
-q command line option in the ntpd - Network Time Protocol
(NTP) daemon page. After a <br>
suitable period of mourning, the ntpdate program is to be
retired from this distribution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntpdate [ -46bBdqsuv ] [ -a key ] [ -e authdelay ] [ -k
keyfile ] [ -o version ] [ -p samples ] [ -t timeout ] [ -U
user_name ] server [ ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntpdate sets the local date and time by polling the Network
Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the server arguments
to determine the correct time. It must be run as root on
<br>
the local host. A number of samples are obtained from each
of the servers specified and a subset of the NTP clock
filter and selection algorithms are applied to select the
best <br>
of these. Note that the accuracy and reliability of ntpdate
depends on the number of servers, the number of polls each
time it is run and the interval between runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntpdate can be run manually as
necessary to set the host clock, or it can be run from the
host startup script to set the clock at boot time. This is
useful in some cases to set <br>
the clock initially before starting the NTP daemon ntpd. It
is also possible to run ntpdate from a cron script. However,
it is important to note that ntpdate with contrived cron
<br>
scripts is no substitute for the NTP daemon, which uses
sophisticated algorithms to maximize accuracy and
reliability while minimizing resource use. Finally, since
ntpdate does <br>
not discipline the host clock frequency as does ntpd, the
accuracy using ntpdate is limited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time adjustments are made by
ntpdate in one of two ways. If ntpdate determines the clock
is in error more than 0.5 second it will simply step the
time by calling the system set&acirc; <br>
timeofday() routine. If the error is less than 0.5 seconds,
it will slew the time by calling the system adjtime()
routine. The latter technique is less disruptive and more
accu&acirc; <br>
rate when the error is small, and works quite well when
ntpdate is run by cron every hour or two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntpdate will decline to set the
date if an NTP server daemon (e.g., ntpd) is running on the
same host. When running ntpdate on a regular basis from cron
as an alternative to run&acirc; <br>
ning a daemon, doing so once every hour or two will result
in precise enough timekeeping to avoid stepping the
clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in contexts where a
host name is expected, a -4 qualifier preceding the host
name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a -6
qualifier forces DNS resolu&acirc; <br>
tion to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If NetInfo support is compiled
into ntpdate, then the server argument is optional if
ntpdate can find a time server in the NetInfo configuration
for ntpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
-4 Force DNS resolution of following host names on the
command line to the IPv4 namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Force DNS resolution of
following host names on the command line to the IPv6
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a key Enable the authentication
function and specify the key identifier to be used for
authentication as the argument key. The keys and key
identifiers must match in both the <br>
client and server key files. The default is to disable the
authentication function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force the time to always be
slewed using the adjtime() system call, even if the measured
offset is greater than +-500 ms. The default is to step the
time using settimeof&acirc; <br>
day() if the offset is greater than +-500 ms. Note that, if
the offset is much greater than +-500 ms in this case, that
it can take a long time (hours) to slew the clock <br>
to the correct value. During this time. the host should not
be used to synchronize clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Force the time to be stepped
using the settimeofday() system call, rather than slewed
(default) using the adjtime() system call. This option
should be used when called <br>
from a startup file at boot time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable the debugging mode, in
which ntpdate will go through all the steps, but not adjust
the local clock. Information useful for general debugging
will also be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e authdelay <br>
Specify the processing delay to perform an authentication
function as the value authdelay, in seconds and fraction
(see ntpd for details). This number is usually small <br>
enough to be negligible for most purposes, though specifying
a value may improve timekeeping on very slow
CPU&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keyfile <br>
Specify the path for the authentication key file as the
string keyfile. The default is /etc/ntp/keys. This file
should be in the format described in ntpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o version <br>
Specify the NTP version for outgoing packets as the integer
version, which can be 1 or 2. The default is 4. This allows
ntpdate to be used with older NTP versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p samples <br>
Specify the number of samples to be acquired from each
server as the integer samples, with values from 1 to 8
inclusive. The default is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Query only - don&rsquo;t set
the clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Divert logging output from
the standard output (default) to the system syslog facility.
This is designed primarily for convenience of cron
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Specify the maximum time waiting for a server response as
the value timeout, in seconds and fraction. The value is is
rounded to a multiple of 0.2 seconds. The default is <br>
1 second, a value suitable for polling across a LAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Direct ntpdate to use an
unprivileged port for outgoing packets. This is most useful
when behind a firewall that blocks incoming traffic to
privileged ports, and you want <br>
to synchronize with hosts beyond the firewall. Note that the
-d option always uses unprivileged ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. This option will
cause ntpdate&rsquo;s version identification string to be
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U user_name <br>
ntpdate process drops root privileges and changes user ID to
user_name and group ID to the primary group of
server_user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
ntpdate&rsquo;s exit status is zero if it finds a server and
updates the clock, and nonzero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/ntp/keys - encryption keys used by ntpdate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The slew adjustment is actually 50% larger than the measured
offset, since this (it is argued) will tend to keep a badly
drifting clock more accurate. This is probably not a good
<br>
idea and may cause a troubling hunt for some values of the
kernel variables tick and tickadj.</p>
