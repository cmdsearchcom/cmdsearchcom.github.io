<p>RTCWAKE(8) System Administration RTCWAKE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rtcwake - enter a system sleep state until specified wakeup
time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rtcwake [options] [-d device] [-m standby_mode] {-t
time_t|-s seconds}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is used to enter a system sleep state until
specified wakeup time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This uses cross-platform Linux
interfaces to enter a system sleep state, and leave it no
later than a specified time. It uses any RTC framework
driver that supports standard <br>
driver model wakeup flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is normally used like the
old apmsleep utility, to wake from a suspend state like ACPI
S1 (standby) or S3 (suspend-to-RAM). Most platforms can
implement those without ana&acirc; <br>
logues of BIOS, APM, or ACPI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems, this can also
be used like nvram-wakeup, waking from states like ACPI S4
(suspend to disk). Not all systems have persistent media
that are appropriate for such <br>
suspend modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-v | --verbose <br>
Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h | --help <br>
Display a short help message that shows how to use the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V | --version <br>
Displays version information and exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n | --dry-run <br>
This option does everything but actually setup alarm,
suspend system or wait for the alarm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A | --adjfile file <br>
Specifies an alternative path to the adjust file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a | --auto <br>
Reads the clock mode (whether the hardware clock is set to
UTC or local time) from /etc/adjtime. That&rsquo;s the
location where the hwclock(8) stores that information. This
is <br>
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l | --local <br>
Assumes that the hardware clock is set to local time,
regardless of the contents of /etc/adjtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u | --utc <br>
Assumes that the hardware clock is set to UTC (Universal
Time Coordinated), regardless of the contents of
/etc/adjtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d device | --device device <br>
Uses device instead of rtc0 as realtime clock. This option
is only relevant if your system has more than one RTC. You
may specify rtc1, rtc2, ... here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s seconds | --seconds seconds
<br>
Sets the wakeup time to seconds in future from now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t time_t | --time time_t <br>
Sets the wakeup time to the absolute time time_t. time_t is
the time in seconds since 1970-01-01, 00:00 UTC. Use the
date(1) tool to convert between human-readable time <br>
and time_t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mode | --mode mode <br>
Use standby state mode. Valid values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standby <br>
ACPI state S1. This state offers minimal, though real, power
savings, while providing a very low-latency transition back
to a working system. This is the default <br>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mem ACPI state S3
(Suspend-to-RAM). This state offers significant power
savings as everything in the system is put into a low-power
state, except for memory, which is <br>
placed in self-refresh mode to retain its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freeze The processes are frozen,
all the devices are suspended and all the processors idles.
This state is a general state that does not need any
platform specific sup&acirc; <br>
port, but it saves less power than susepnd to RAM, because
the system is still in a running state. (since Linux
3.9)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disk ACPI state S4
(Suspend-to-disk). This state offers the greatest power
savings, and can be used even in the absence of low-level
platform support for power manage&acirc; <br>
ment. This state operates similarly to Suspend-to-RAM, but
includes a final step of writing memory contents to
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off ACPI state S5 (Poweroff).
This is done by calling &rsquo;/sbin/shutdown&rsquo;. Not
officially supported by ACPI, but usually working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no Don&rsquo;t suspend. The
rtcwake command sets RTC wakeup time only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on Don&rsquo;t suspend, but read
RTC device until alarm time appears. This mode is useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable <br>
Disable previously set alarm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show Print alarm information in
format: &quot;alarm: off|on &lt;time&gt;&quot;. The time is
in ctime() output format, e.g. &quot;alarm: on Tue Nov 16
04:48:45 2010&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Some PC systems can&rsquo;t currently exit sleep states such
as mem using only the kernel code accessed by this driver.
They need help from userspace code to make the framebuffer
work <br>
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The program was posted several times on LKML and other lists
before appearing in kernel commit message for Linux 2.6 in
the GIT commit 87ac84f42a7a580d0dd72ae31d6a5eb4bfe04c6d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>

available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The program was written by David Brownell
&lt;dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net&gt; and improved by
Bernhard Walle &lt;bwalle@suse.de&gt;.</p>
