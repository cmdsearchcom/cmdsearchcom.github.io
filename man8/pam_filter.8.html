<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_filter - PAM filter module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pam_filter.so [debug] [new_term] [non_term] run1|run2 filter
[...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This module is intended to be a platform for providing
access to all of the input/output that passes between the
user and the application. It is only suitable for tty-based
and <br>
(stdin/stdout) applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To function this module requires
filters to be installed on the system. The single filter
provided with the module simply transposes upper and lower
case letters in the input and <br>
output streams. (This can be very annoying and is not kind
to termcap based editors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each component of the module has
the potential to invoke the desired filter. The filter is
always execv(2) with the privilege of the calling
application and not that of the user. <br>
For this reason it cannot usually be killed by the user
without closing their session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
debug <br>
Print debug information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new_term <br>
The default action of the filter is to set the PAM_TTY item
to indicate the terminal that the user is using to connect
to the application. This argument indicates that the <br>
filter should set PAM_TTY to the filtered
pseudo-terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">non_term <br>
don&rsquo;t try to set the PAM_TTY item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runX <br>
In order that the module can invoke a filter it should know
when to invoke it. This argument is required to tell the
filter when to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permitted values for X are 1 and
2. These indicate the precise time that the filter is to be
run. To understand this concept it will be useful to have
read the pam(3) manual <br>
page. Basically, for each management group there are up to
two ways of calling the module&rsquo;s functions. In the
case of the authentication and session components there are
<br>
actually two separate functions. For the case of
authentication, these functions are pam_authenticate(3) and
pam_setcred(3), here run1 means run the filter from the <br>
pam_authenticate function and run2 means run the filter from
pam_setcred. In the case of the session modules, run1
implies that the filter is invoked at the <br>
pam_open_session(3) stage, and run2 for
pam_close_session(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the case of the account
component. Either run1 or run2 may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the case of the password
component, run1 is used to indicate that the filter is run
on the first occasion of pam_chauthtok(3) (the
PAM_PRELIM_CHECK phase) and run2 is <br>
used to indicate that the filter is run on the second
occasion (the PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK phase).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter <br>
The full pathname of the filter to be run and any command
line arguments that the filter might expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULE TYPES PROVIDED <br>
All module types (auth, account, password and session) are
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
PAM_SUCCESS <br>
The new filter was set successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_ABORT <br>
Critical error, immediate abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to see how to
configure login to transpose upper and lower case letters
once the user has logged in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session required pam_filter.so
run1 /lib/security/pam_filter/upperLOWER</p>
