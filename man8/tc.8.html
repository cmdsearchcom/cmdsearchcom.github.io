<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Tc is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel.
Traffic Control consists of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHAPING <br>
When traffic is shaped, its rate of transmission is under
control. Shaping may be more than lowering the available
bandwidth - it is also used to smooth out bursts in <br>
traffic for better network behaviour. Shaping occurs on
egress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCHEDULING <br>
By scheduling the transmission of packets it is possible to
improve interactivity for traffic that needs it while still
guaranteeing bandwidth to bulk transfers. Reorder&acirc;
<br>
ing is also called prioritizing, and happens only on
egress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICING <br>
Whereas shaping deals with transmission of traffic, policing
pertains to traffic arriving. Policing thus occurs on
ingress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DROPPING <br>
Traffic exceeding a set bandwidth may also be dropped
forthwith, both on ingress and on egress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing of traffic is
controlled by three kinds of objects: qdiscs, classes and
filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QDISCS <br>
qdisc is short for &rsquo;queueing discipline&rsquo; and it
is elementary to understanding traffic control. Whenever the
kernel needs to send a packet to an interface, it is
enqueued to the <br>
qdisc configured for that interface. Immediately afterwards,
the kernel tries to get as many packets as possible from the
qdisc, for giving them to the network adaptor driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple QDISC is the
&rsquo;pfifo&rsquo; one, which does no processing at all and
is a pure First In, First Out queue. It does however store
traffic when the network interface can&rsquo;t handle <br>
it momentarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSES <br>
Some qdiscs can contain classes, which contain further
qdiscs - traffic may then be enqueued in any of the inner
qdiscs, which are within the classes. When the kernel tries
to <br>
dequeue a packet from such a classful qdisc it can come from
any of the classes. A qdisc may for example prioritize
certain kinds of traffic by trying to dequeue from certain
<br>
classes before others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTERS <br>
A filter is used by a classful qdisc to determine in which
class a packet will be enqueued. Whenever traffic arrives at
a class with subclasses, it needs to be classified.
Vari&acirc; <br>
ous methods may be employed to do so, one of these are the
filters. All filters attached to the class are called, until
one of them returns with a verdict. If no verdict was <br>
made, other criteria may be available. This differs per
qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to notice that
filters reside within qdiscs - they are not masters of what
happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available filters are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basic Filter packets based on an
ematch expression. See tc-ematch(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bpf Filter packets using (e)BPF,
see tc-bpf(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgroup Filter packets based on
the control group of their process. See tc-cgroup(8) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow Flow-based classifier,
filtering packets based on their flow (identified by
selectable keys). See tc-flow(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fw Filter based on fwmark.
Directly maps fwmark value to traffic class. See
tc-fw(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">route Filter packets based on
routing table. See tc-route(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsvp Match Resource Reservation
Protocol (RSVP) packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcindex <br>
Filter packets based on traffic control index. See
tc-index(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u32 Generic filtering on
arbitrary packet data, assisted by syntax to abstract common
operations. See tc-u32(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSLESS QDISCS <br>
The classless qdiscs are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choke CHOKe (CHOose and Keep for
responsive flows, CHOose and Kill for unresponsive flows) is
a classless qdisc designed to both identify and penalize
flows that monopolize the <br>
queue. CHOKe is a variation of RED, and the configuration is
similar to RED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">codel CoDel (pronounced
&quot;coddle&quot;) is an adaptive &quot;no-knobs&quot;
active queue management algorithm (AQM) scheme that was
developed to address the shortcomings of RED and its
vari&acirc; <br>
ants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[p|b]fifo <br>
Simplest usable qdisc, pure First In, First Out behaviour.
Limited in packets or in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fq Fair Queue Scheduler realises
TCP pacing and scales to millions of concurrent flows per
qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fq_codel <br>
Fair Queuing Controlled Delay is queuing discipline that
combines Fair Queuing with the CoDel AQM scheme. FQ_Codel
uses a stochastic model to classify incoming packets <br>
into different flows and is used to provide a fair share of
the bandwidth to all the flows using the queue. Each such
flow is managed by the CoDel queuing discipline. <br>
Reordering within a flow is avoided since Codel internally
uses a FIFO queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gred Generalized Random Early
Detection combines multiple RED queues in order to achieve
multiple drop priorities. This is required to realize
Assured Forwarding (RFC 2597).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hhf Heavy-Hitter Filter
differentiates between small flows and the opposite,
heavy-hitters. The goal is to catch the heavy-hitters and
move them to a separate queue with less <br>
priority so that bulk traffic does not affect the latency of
critical traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ingress <br>
This is a special qdisc as it applies to incoming traffic on
an interface, allowing for it to be filtered and
policed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mqprio The Multiqueue Priority
Qdisc is a simple queuing discipline that allows mapping
traffic flows to hardware queue ranges using priorities and
a configurable priority to <br>
traffic class mapping. A traffic class in this context is a
set of contiguous qdisc classes which map 1:1 to a set of
hardware exposed queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multiq Multiqueue is a qdisc
optimized for devices with multiple Tx queues. It has been
added for hardware that wishes to avoid head-of-line
blocking. It will cycle though the <br>
bands and verify that the hardware queue associated with the
band is not stopped prior to dequeuing a packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netem Network Emulator is an
enhancement of the Linux traffic control facilities that
allow to add delay, packet loss, duplication and more other
characteristics to packets out&acirc; <br>
going from a selected network interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pfifo_fast <br>
Standard qdisc for &rsquo;Advanced Router&rsquo; enabled
kernels. Consists of a three-band queue which honors Type of
Service flags, as well as the priority that may be assigned
to a <br>
packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pie Proportional Integral
controller-Enhanced (PIE) is a control theoretic active
queue management scheme. It is based on the proportional
integral controller but aims to con&acirc; <br>
trol delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">red Random Early Detection
simulates physical congestion by randomly dropping packets
when nearing configured bandwidth allocation. Well suited to
very large bandwidth appli&acirc; <br>
cations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rr Round-Robin qdisc with
support for multiqueue network devices. Removed from Linux
since kernel version 2.6.27.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sfb Stochastic Fair Blue is a
classless qdisc to manage congestion based on packet loss
and link utilization history while trying to prevent
non-responsive flows (i.e. flows <br>
that do not react to congestion marking or dropped packets)
from impacting performance of responsive flows. Unlike RED,
where the marking probability has to be config&acirc; <br>
ured, BLUE tries to determine the ideal marking probability
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sfq Stochastic Fairness Queueing
reorders queued traffic so each &rsquo;session&rsquo; gets
to send a packet in turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tbf The Token Bucket Filter is
suited for slowing traffic down to a precisely configured
rate. Scales well to large bandwidths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING CLASSLESS QDISCS
<br>
In the absence of classful qdiscs, classless qdiscs can only
be attached at the root of a device. Full syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc qdisc add dev DEV root QDISC
QDISC-PARAMETERS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove, issue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc qdisc del dev DEV root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pfifo_fast qdisc is the
automatic default in the absence of a configured qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSFUL QDISCS <br>
The classful qdiscs are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATM Map flows to virtual
circuits of an underlying asynchronous transfer mode
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CBQ Class Based Queueing
implements a rich linksharing hierarchy of classes. It
contains shaping elements as well as prioritizing
capabilities. Shaping is performed using <br>
link idle time calculations based on average packet size and
underlying link bandwidth. The latter may be ill-defined for
some interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRR The Deficit Round Robin
Scheduler is a more flexible replacement for Stochastic
Fairness Queuing. Unlike SFQ, there are no built-in queues
-- you need to add classes and <br>
then set up filters to classify packets accordingly. This
can be useful e.g. for using RED qdiscs with different
settings for particular traffic. There is no default <br>
class -- if a packet cannot be classified, it is
dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSMARK Classify packets based on
TOS field, change TOS field of packets based on
classification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HFSC Hierarchical Fair Service
Curve guarantees precise bandwidth and delay allocation for
leaf classes and allocates excess bandwidth fairly. Unlike
HTB, it makes use of <br>
packet dropping to achieve low delays which interactive
sessions benefit from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTB The Hierarchy Token Bucket
implements a rich linksharing hierarchy of classes with an
emphasis on conforming to existing practices. HTB
facilitates guaranteeing bandwidth <br>
to classes, while also allowing specification of upper
limits to inter-class sharing. It contains shaping elements,
based on TBF and can prioritize classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRIO The PRIO qdisc is a
non-shaping container for a configurable number of classes
which are dequeued in order. This allows for easy
prioritization of traffic, where lower <br>
classes are only able to send if higher ones have no packets
available. To facilitate configuration, Type Of Service bits
are honored by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QFQ Quick Fair Queueing is an
O(1) scheduler that provides near-optimal guarantees, and is
the first to achieve that goal with a constant cost also
with respect to the number <br>
of groups and the packet length. The QFQ algorithm has no
loops, and uses very simple instructions and data structures
that lend themselves very well to a hardware imple&acirc;
<br>
mentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEORY OF OPERATION <br>
Classes form a tree, where each class has a single parent. A
class may have multiple children. Some qdiscs allow for
runtime addition of classes (CBQ, HTB) while others (PRIO)
<br>
are created with a static number of children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qdiscs which allow dynamic
addition of classes can have zero or more subclasses to
which traffic may be enqueued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, each class contains
a leaf qdisc which by default has pfifo behaviour, although
another qdisc can be attached in place. This qdisc may again
contain classes, but <br>
each class can have only one leaf qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a packet enters a classful
qdisc it can be classified to one of the classes within.
Three criteria are available, although not all qdiscs will
use all three:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc filters <br>
If tc filters are attached to a class, they are consulted
first for relevant instructions. Filters can match on all
fields of a packet header, as well as on the firewall <br>
mark applied by ipchains or iptables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type of Service <br>
Some qdiscs have built in rules for classifying packets
based on the TOS field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skb-&gt;priority <br>
Userspace programs can encode a class-id in the
&rsquo;skb-&gt;priority&rsquo; field using the SO_PRIORITY
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each node within the tree can
have its own filters but higher level filters may also point
directly to lower classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If classification did not
succeed, packets are enqueued to the leaf qdisc attached to
that class. Check qdisc specific manpages for details,
however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAMING <br>
All qdiscs, classes and filters have IDs, which can either
be specified or be automatically assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDs consist of a major number
and a minor number, separated by a colon. Both major and
minor number are limited to 16 bits. There are two special
values: root is signified by <br>
major and minor of all ones, and unspecified is all
zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QDISCS A qdisc, which
potentially can have children, gets assigned a major number,
called a &rsquo;handle&rsquo;, leaving the minor number
namespace available for classes. The handle is <br>
expressed as &rsquo;10:&rsquo;. It is customary to
explicitly assign a handle to qdiscs expected to have
children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSES <br>
Classes residing under a qdisc share their qdisc major
number, but each have a separate minor number called a
&rsquo;classid&rsquo; that has no relation to their parent
classes, only <br>
to their parent qdisc. The same naming custom as for qdiscs
applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTERS <br>
Filters have a three part ID, which is only needed when
using a hashed filter hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
The following parameters are widely used in TC. For other
parameters, see the man pages for individual qdiscs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATES Bandwidths or rates. These
parameters accept a floating point number, possibly followed
by a unit (both SI and IEC units supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bit or a bare number <br>
Bits per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kbit Kilobits per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbit Megabits per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gbit Gigabits per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tbit Terabits per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bps Bytes per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kbps Kilobytes per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbps Megabytes per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gbps Gigabytes per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tbps Terabytes per second</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify in IEC units, replace
the SI prefix (k-, m-, g-, t-) with IEC prefix (ki-, mi-,
gi- and ti-) respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TC store rates as a 32-bit
unsigned integer in bps internally, so we can specify a max
rate of 4294967295 bps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMES Length of time. Can be
specified as a floating point number followed by an optional
unit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s, sec or secs <br>
Whole seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ms, msec or msecs <br>
Milliseconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">us, usec, usecs or a bare number
<br>
Microseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TC defined its own time unit
(equal to microsecond) and stores time values as 32-bit
unsigned integer, thus we can specify a max time value of
4294967295 usecs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIZES Amounts of data. Can be
specified as a floating point number followed by an optional
unit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b or a bare number <br>
Bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kbit Kilobits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kb or k <br>
Kilobytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbit Megabits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mb or m <br>
Megabytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gbit Gigabits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gb or g <br>
Gigabytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TC stores sizes internally as
32-bit unsigned integer in byte, so we can specify a max
size of 4294967295 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALUES Other values without a
unit. These parameters are interpreted as decimal by
default, but you can indicate TC to interpret them as octal
and hexadecimal by adding a &rsquo;0&rsquo; or <br>
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; prefix respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TC COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are available for qdiscs, classes and
filter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add Add a qdisc, class or filter
to a node. For all entities, a parent must be passed, either
by passing its ID or by attaching directly to the root of a
device. When creat&acirc; <br>
ing a qdisc or a filter, it can be named with the handle
parameter. A class is named with the classid parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete A qdisc can be deleted by
specifying its handle, which may also be &rsquo;root&rsquo;.
All subclasses and their leaf qdiscs are automatically
deleted, as well as any filters attached <br>
to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change Some entities can be
modified &rsquo;in place&rsquo;. Shares the syntax of
&rsquo;add&rsquo;, with the exception that the handle cannot
be changed and neither can the parent. In other words, <br>
change cannot move a node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">replace <br>
Performs a nearly atomic remove/add on an existing node id.
If the node does not exist yet it is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link Only available for qdiscs
and performs a replace where the node must exist
already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, -b filename, -batch, -batch filename <br>
read commands from provided file or standard input and
invoke them. First failure will cause termination of tc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force don&rsquo;t terminate tc
on errors in batch mode. If there were any errors during
execution of the commands, the application return code will
be non zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-OK in batch mode, print OK and
a new line on standard output after each successfully
interpreted command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, -net, -netns &lt;NETNS&gt;
<br>
switches tc to the specified network namespace NETNS.
Actually it just simplifies executing of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip netns exec NETNS tc [ OPTIONS
] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ]
OBJECT { COMMAND | help }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMAT <br>
The show command has additional formatting options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, -stats, -statistics <br>
output more statistics about packet usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -details <br>
output more detailed information about rates and cell
sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, -raw <br>
output raw hex values for handles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, -pretty <br>
decode filter offset and mask values to equivalent filter
commands based on TCP/IP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iec print rates in IEC units
(ie. 1K = 1024).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
tc was written by Alexey N. Kuznetsov and added in Linux
2.2.</p>
