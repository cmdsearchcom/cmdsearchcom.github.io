sge_shepherd - Grid Engine single job-controlling agent

<b>sge_shepherd</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>sge_shepherd</i> provides the parent process functionality for a single Grid
  Engine job. The parent functionality is necessary on UNIX systems to retrieve
  resource usage information (see after a job has finished. In addition, the
  <i>sge_shepherd</i> forwards signals to the job, such for suspension,
  enabling, termination, and the Grid Engine checkpointing signal (see and for
  details).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>sge_shepherd</i> receives information about the job to be started from
  the During the execution of the job it actually starts up to 5 child
  processes. First a prolog script is run if this feature is enabled by the
  <b>prolog</b> parameter in the cluster configuration. (See Next a parallel
  environment startup procedure is run if the job is a parallel job. (See for
  more information.) After that, the job itself is run, followed by a parallel
  environment shutdown procedure for parallel jobs, and finally an epilog script
  if requested by the <b>epilog</b> parameter in the cluster configuration. The
  prolog and epilog scripts, as well as the parallel environment startup and
  shutdown procedures, are to be provided by the Grid Engine administrator and
  are intended for site-specific actions to be taken before and after execution
  of the actual user job.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the job has finished and the epilog script is processed,
  <i>sge_shepherd</i> retrieves resource usage statistics about the job, places
  them in a job-specific subdirectory of the spool directory for reporting
  through and finishes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>sge_shepherd</i> also places an exit status file in the spool directory. This
  exit status can be viewed with qacct -j JobId (see it is not the exit status
  of <i>sge_shepherd</i> itself but of one of the methods executed by
  <i>sge_shepherd.</i> This exit status can have several meanings, depending on
  the method in which an error occurred (if any). The possible methods are:
  prolog, parallel start, job, parallel stop, epilog, suspend, restart,
  terminate, clean, migrate, and checkpoint.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">All methods: Operation was executed successfully.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      re-queued. It is assumed that the job itself ran successfully and only the

    Suspend, restart, terminate, clean, and migrate: Always successful.

      that to enable core dumps for debugging if they are otherwise allowed.
      This is typically not a big hazard with SGE, since most information is
      exposed in the spool area anyhow. Dumps will appear in the qmaster spool
      directory, which need not be world-readable.
