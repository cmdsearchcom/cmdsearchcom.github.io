<p>SGE_SHEPHERD(8) Grid Engine Administrative Commands
SGE_SHEPHERD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sge_shepherd - Grid Engine single job-controlling agent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sge_shepherd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sge_shepherd provides the parent process functionality for a
single Grid Engine job. The parent functionality is
necessary on UNIX systems to retrieve resource usage
information <br>
(see getrusage(2)) after a job has finished. In addition,
the sge_shepherd forwards signals to the job, such for
suspension, enabling, termination, and the Grid Engine
check&acirc; <br>
pointing signal (see sge_ckpt(1) and queue_conf(5) for
details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sge_shepherd receives
information about the job to be started from the
sge_execd(8). During the execution of the job it actually
starts up to 5 child processes. First a pro&acirc; <br>
log script is run if this feature is enabled by the prolog
parameter in the cluster configuration. (See sge_conf(5).)
Next a parallel environment startup procedure is run if the
<br>
job is a parallel job. (See sge_pe(5) for more information.)
After that, the job itself is run, followed by a parallel
environment shutdown procedure for parallel jobs, and <br>
finally an epilog script if requested by the epilog
parameter in the cluster configuration. The prolog and
epilog scripts, as well as the parallel environment startup
and shut&acirc; <br>
down procedures, are to be provided by the Grid Engine
administrator and are intended for site-specific actions to
be taken before and after execution of the actual user
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the job has finished and
the epilog script is processed, sge_shepherd retrieves
resource usage statistics about the job, places them in a
job-specific subdirectory of the <br>
sge_execd(8) spool directory for reporting through
sge_execd(8), and finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_shepherd also places an exit
status file in the spool directory. This exit status can be
viewed with qacct -j JobId (see qacct(1)); it is not the
exit status of sge_shepherd <br>
itself but of one of the methods executed by sge_shepherd.
This exit status can have several meanings, depending on the
method in which an error occurred (if any). The possible
<br>
methods are: prolog, parallel start, job, parallel stop,
epilog, suspend, restart, terminate, clean, migrate, and
checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following exit values are
returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All methods: Operation was
executed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">99 Job script, prolog and
epilog: When FORBID_RESCHEDULE is not set in the
configuration (see sge_conf(5)), the job gets re-queued.
Otherwise see &quot;Other&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">100 Job script, prolog and
epilog: When FORBID_APPERROR is not set in the configuration
(see sge_conf(5)), the job gets re-queued. Otherwise see
&quot;Other&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Job script: This is the
exit status of the job itself. No action is taken upon this
exit status because the meaning of this exit status is not
known. <br>
Prolog, epilog and parallel start: The queue is set to error
state and the job is re-queued. <br>
Parallel stop: The queue is set to error state, but the job
is not re-queued. It is assumed that the job itself ran
successfully and only the clean up script failed. <br>
Suspend, restart, terminate, clean, and migrate: Always
successful. <br>
Checkpoint: Success, except for kernel checkpointing:
checkpoint was not successful, did not happen (but migration
will happen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the meaning of the return
codes of the shepherd itself (which are interpreted by
qacct(1)) see sge_status(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
sge_shepherd should not be invoked manually, but only by
sge_execd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SGE_ROOT Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CELL If set, specifies the
default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell
sge_execd uses (in the order of precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the cell specified
in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the default cell,
i.e. default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_ENABLE_COREDUMP <br>
If set, enable core dumps on Linux when the admin_user is
not root. Linux normally disables core dumps when the daemon
has changed uid or gid. Setting <br>
SGE_ENABLE_COREDUMP in sge_execd&rsquo;s environment defeats
that to enable core dumps for debugging if they are
otherwise allowed. This is typically not a big hazard <br>
with SGE, since most information is exposed in the spool
area anyhow. Dumps will appear in the qmaster spool
directory, which need not be world-readable. <br>
On Solaris, coreadm(1) may be used to enable such dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CGROUP_DIR If Linux cgroups
handling is enabled, this variable names a directory under
the cgroup mount point in which to create job-specific
directories. The default is <br>
sge.SGE_CELL so, for instance, the cpuset cgroup for a job
might be /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/sge.default/123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
sgepasswd contains a list of user names and their
corresponding encrypted passwords. If available, the
password file will be used by sge_shepherd. To change the
contents of this <br>
file please use the sgepasswd command. It is not advised to
change that file manually. <br>
&lt;execd_spool&gt;/job_dir/&lt;job_id&gt; job specific
directory <br>
&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/sgepasswd <br>
Password information used on Microsoft Windows hosts. See
<br>
sgepasswd(5).</p>
