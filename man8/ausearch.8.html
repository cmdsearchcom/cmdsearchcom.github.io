<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ausearch - a tool to query audit daemon logs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ausearch [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ausearch is a tool that can query the audit daemon logs
based for events based on different search criteria. The
ausearch utility can also take input from stdin as long as
the <br>
input is the raw log data. Each commandline option given
forms an &quot;and&quot; statement. For example, searching
with -m and -ui means return events that have both the
requested type <br>
and match the user id given. An exception is the -n option;
multiple nodes are allowed in a search which will return any
matching node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should also be noted that
each syscall excursion from user space into the kernel and
back into user space has one event ID that is unique. Any
auditable event that is trig&acirc; <br>
gered during this trip share this ID so that they may be
correlated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Different parts of the kernel
may add supplemental records. For example, an audit event on
the syscall &quot;open&quot; will also cause the kernel to
emit a PATH record with the file name. <br>
The ausearch utility will present all records that make up
one event together. This could mean that even though you
search for a specific kind of record, the resulting events
may <br>
contain SYSCALL records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also be aware that not all
record types have the requested information. For example, a
PATH record does not have a hostname or a loginuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --event audit-event-id <br>
Search for an event based on the given event ID. Messages
always start with something like
msg=audit(1116360555.329:2401771). The event ID is the
number after the &rsquo;:&rsquo;. All <br>
audit events that are recorded from one application&rsquo;s
syscall have the same audit event ID. A second syscall made
by the same application will have a different event ID. <br>
This way they are unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch CPU <br>
Search for events based on a specific CPU architecture. If
you do not know the arch of your machine but you want to use
the 32 bit syscall table and your machine supports <br>
32 bits, you can also use b32 for the arch. The same applies
to the 64 bit syscall table, you can use b64. The arch of
your machine can be found by doing &rsquo;uname
-m&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --comm comm-name <br>
Search for an event based on the given comm name. The comm
name is the executable&rsquo;s name from the task
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Write malformed events that are skipped to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--checkpoint checkpoint-file
<br>
Checkpoint the output between successive invocations of
ausearch such that only events not previously output will
print in subsequent invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An auditd event is made up of
one or more records. When processing events, ausearch
defines events as either complete or in-complete. A complete
event is either a single <br>
record event or one whose event time occurred 2 seconds in
the past compared to the event being currently
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A checkpoint is achieved by
recording the last completed event output along with the
device number and inode of the file the last completed event
appeared in checkpoint- <br>
file. On a subsequent invocation, ausearch will load this
checkpoint data and as it processes the log files, it will
discard all complete events until it matches the <br>
checkpointed one. At this point, it will start outputting
complete events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should the file or the last
checkpointed event not be found, one of a number of errors
will result and ausearch will terminate. See EXIT STATUS for
detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --exit exit-code-or-errno
<br>
Search for an event based on the given syscall exit code or
errno.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --file file-name <br>
Search for an event based on the given filename. The
argument will match normal files as well as af_unix
sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ga, --gid-all all-group-id <br>
Search for an event with either effective group ID or group
ID matching the given group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ge, --gid-effective
effective-group-id <br>
Search for an event with the given effective group ID or
group name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gi, --gid group-id <br>
Search for an event with the given group ID or group
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hn, --host host-name <br>
Search for an event with the given host name. The hostname
can be either a hostname, fully qualified domain name, or
numeric network address. No attempt is made to resolve <br>
numeric addresses to domain names or aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interpret <br>
Interpret numeric entities into text. For example, uid is
converted to account name. The conversion is done using the
current resources of the machine where the search is <br>
being run. If you have renamed the accounts, or don&rsquo;t
have the same accounts on your machine, you could get
misleading results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-if, --input file-name |
directory <br>
Use the given file or directory instead of the logs. This is
to aid analysis where the logs have been moved to another
machine or only part of a log was saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input-logs <br>
Use the log file location from auditd.conf as input for
searching. This is needed if you are using ausearch from a
cron job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--just-one <br>
Stop after emitting the first event that matches the search
criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --key key-string <br>
Search for an event based on the given key string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --line-buffered <br>
Flush output on every line. Most useful when stdout is
connected to a pipe and the default block buffering strategy
is undesirable. May impose a performance penalty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --message message-type |
comma-sep-message-type-list <br>
Search for an event matching the given message type. You may
also enter a comma separated list of message types. There is
an ALL message type that doesn&rsquo;t exist in the <br>
actual logs. It allows you to get all messages in the
system. The list of valid messages types is long. The
program will display the list whenever no message type is
<br>
passed with this parameter. The message type can be either
text or numeric. If you enter a list, there can be only
commas and no spaces separating the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --node node-name <br>
Search for events originating from node name string.
Multiple nodes are allowed, and if any nodes match, the
event is matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --object
SE-Linux-context-string <br>
Search for event with tcontext (object) matching the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pid process-id <br>
Search for an event matching the given process ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pp, --ppid parent-process-id
<br>
Search for an event matching the given parent process
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
Output is completely unformatted. This is useful for
extracting records that can still be interpreted by audit
tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sc, --syscall
syscall-name-or-value <br>
Search for an event matching the given syscall. You may
either give the numeric syscall value or the syscall name.
If you give the syscall name, it will use the syscall <br>
table for the machine that you are using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-se, --context
SE-Linux-context-string <br>
Search for event with either scontext/subject or
tcontext/object matching the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--session Login-Session-ID <br>
Search for events matching the given Login Session ID. This
process attribute is set when a user logs in and can tie any
process to a particular user login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-su, --subject
SE-Linux-context-string <br>
Search for event with scontext (subject) matching the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sv, --success success-value
<br>
Search for an event matching the given success value. Legal
values are yes and no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-te, --end [end-date] [end-time]
<br>
Search for events with time stamps equal to or before the
given end time. The format of end time depends on your
locale. If the date is omitted, today is assumed. If the
<br>
time is omitted, now is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time
rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using
the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time <br>
is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced by the
LC_TIME environmental variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use the word: now,
recent, today, yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month,
or this-year. Today means starting now. Recent is 10 minutes
ago. Yesterday is 1 <br>
second after midnight the previous day. This-week means
starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week
determined by your locale (see localtime). Week-ago means 1
<br>
second after midnight exactly 7 days ago. This-month means 1
second after midnight on day 1 of the month. This-year means
the 1 second after midnight on the first day of <br>
the first month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ts, --start [start-date]
[start-time] <br>
Search for events with time stamps equal to or after the
given start time. The format of start time depends on your
locale. If the date is omitted, today is assumed. If <br>
the time is omitted, midnight is assumed. Use 24 hour clock
time rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date
using the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An exam&acirc;
<br>
ple of time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is
influenced by the LC_TIME environmental variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use the word: now,
recent, today, yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month,
this-year, or checkpoint. Today means starting at 1 second
after midnight. <br>
Recent is 10 minutes ago. Yesterday is 1 second after
midnight the previous day. This-week means starting 1 second
after midnight on day 0 of the week determined by your <br>
locale (see localtime). Week-ago means starting 1 second
after midnight exactly 7 days ago. This-month means 1 second
after midnight on day 1 of the month. This-year means <br>
the 1 second after midnight on the first day of the first
month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkpoint means ausearch will
use the timestamp found within a valid checkpoint file
ignoring the recorded inode, device, serial, node and event
type also found within a <br>
checkpoint file. Essentially, this is the recovery action
should an invocation of ausearch with a checkpoint option
fail with an exit status of 10, 11 or 12. It could be <br>
used in a shell script something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ausearch --checkpoint
/etc/audit/auditd_checkpoint.txt -i <br>
_au_status=$? <br>
if test ${_au_status} eq 10 -o ${_au_status} eq 11 -o
${_au_status} eq 12 <br>
then <br>
ausearch --checkpoint /etc/audit/auditd_checkpoint.txt
--start checkpoint -i <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tm, --terminal terminal <br>
Search for an event matching the given terminal value. Some
daemons such as cron and atd use the daemon name for the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ua, --uid-all all-user-id <br>
Search for an event with either user ID, effective user ID,
or login user ID (auid) matching the given user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ue, --uid-effective
effective-user-id <br>
Search for an event with the given effective user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ui, --uid user-id <br>
Search for an event with the given user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ul, --loginuid login-id <br>
Search for an event with the given login user ID. All entry
point programs that are pamified need to be configured with
pam_loginuid required for the session for searching <br>
on loginuid (auid) to be accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-uu, --uuid guest-uuid <br>
Search for an event with the given guest UUID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vm, --vm-name guest-name <br>
Search for an event with the given guest name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --word <br>
String based matches must match the whole word. This
category of matches include: filename, hostname, terminal,
and SE Linux context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --executable executable <br>
Search for an event matching the given executable name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 if OK,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 if nothing found, or argument
errors or minor file acces/read errors,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 invalid checkpoint data found
in checkpoint file,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 checkpoint processing
error</p>
