<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-client -d nbd-device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-client -l host [ port ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
With nbd-client, you can connect to a server running
nbd-server, thus using raw diskspace from that server as a
blockdevice on the local client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do this, support from the
Linux Kernel is necessary, in the form of the Network Block
Device (NBD). When you have that, either in the kernel, or
as a module, you can connect <br>
to an NBD server and use its exported file through a block
special file with major mode 43.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, long options can
also be specified with two leading dashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block-size block size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Use a blocksize of
&quot;block size&quot;. Default is 1024; allowed values are
either 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-connections num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Use num connections to the
server, to allow speeding up request handling, at the cost
of higher resource usage on the server. Use of this option
requires kernel support <br>
available first with Linux 4.9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host The hostname or IP address
of the machine running nbd-server. Since 2.9.15, the NBD
utilities support IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timeout seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Set the connection timeout to
&quot;seconds&quot;. For this to work, you need a kernel
with support for the NBD_SET_TIMEOUT ioctl; this was
introduced into Linus&rsquo; tree on <br>
2007-10-11, and will be part of kernel 2.6.24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port The TCP port on which
nbd-server is running at the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The port number defaults to
10809, the IANA-assigned port number for the NBD
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous versions of the nbd
tools supported an older version of the negotiation protocol
known as &quot;oldstyle&quot;. This protocol version is no
longer supported as of version <br>
3.11 of the nbd support tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-device <br>
The block special file (/dev entry) which this nbd-client
should connect to, specified as a full path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the mode is used wherein no
hostname or export name is specified, nbd-client will look
up the necessary configuration in the nbdtab file. For more
information, see <br>
nbdtab(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Check whether the specified
nbd device is connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the device is connected,
nbd-client will exit with an exit state of 0 and print the
PID of the nbd-client instance that connected it to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the device is not connected
or does not exist (for example because the nbd module was
not loaded), nbd-client will exit with an exit state of 1
and not print anything <br>
on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurred, nbd-client
will exit with an exit state of 2, and not print anything on
stdout either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disconnect</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Disconnect the specified nbd
device from the server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Ask the server for a list of
available exports. If the server is exporting over IPv6 as
well as over IPv4, this will list all exports twice;
otherwise, it should list them <br>
all only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option only works
with nbd-server processes running version 3.1 or above, and
must be enabled in server configuration (with the
&quot;allowlist&quot; option) before <br>
it can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-persist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p When this option is
specified, nbd-client will immediately try to reconnect an
nbd device if the connection ever drops unexpectedly due to
a lost server or something simi&acirc; <br>
lar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sdp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Connect to the server using
the Socket Direct Protocol (SDP), rather than IP. See
nbd-server(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-swap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Specifies that this NBD
device will be used as swapspace. This option attempts to
prevent deadlocks by performing mlockall() and adjusting the
oom-killer score at an <br>
appropriate time. It does not however guarantee that such
deadlocks can be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-systemd-mark</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m The systemd init system
requires that processes which should not be killed at
shutdown time be marked appropriately by replacing the first
letter of their argv[0] with an <br>
&rsquo;@&rsquo; sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will cause
nbd-client to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this only works if
nbd-client is run from an initrd; i.e., systemd will ignore
such a mark if run from a systemd unit file or from the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nofork</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Specifies that the NBD client
should not detach and daemonize itself. This is mostly
useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that nbd-client will still
fork once to trigger an update to the device node&rsquo;s
partition table. It is not possible to disable this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Specifies the name of the
export that we want to use. If not specified, nbd-client
will ask for a &quot;default&quot; export, if one exists on
the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Connect to the server over a
unix domain socket at path, rather than to a server over a
TCP socket. The server must be listening on the given
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TLS SUPPORT <br>
Enabling any of the TLS-related options causes the client to
use the NBD_OPT_STARTTLS command to upgrade the connection
to TLS. Since negotiating TLS support from userspace for a
<br>
kernel socket would be very involved (if passing keys to
kernel space were even possible, which it isn&rsquo;t), the
way this is implemented is that the nbd-client process
creates a <br>
socketpair, one side of which it hands to the kernel, and
the other side of which is handed to an
encrypting/decrypting proxy. This has the effect that all
communication will be <br>
encrypted before being sent over the wire; however, doing so
is not safe in combination with swapping over an NBD
device:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to free memory by
swapping, the kernel needs to be sure that the write to the
nbd device has finalized. For this, it needs to be able to
receive an NBD_CMD_WRITE reply <br>
which informs it that the write has completed successfully
and that the memory may be released. Receiving data over the
network, however, requires that the kernel allocate memory
<br>
first, which is impossible if we&rsquo;re low on memory (a
likely situation when trying to swap). This is likely to
cause a deadlock when we&rsquo;re low on memory and there
are high amounts <br>
of network traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remedy this situation, the
kernel sets the PF_MEMALLOC option on the nbd socket; when
low on memory, it will throw away all packets except for
those destined to a socket with <br>
that option set, relying on the normal TCP retransmit system
to ensure that data is not lost. This avoids the deadlock
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the PF_MEMALLOC option
is set on the socket that is connected to the nbd device,
not the encrypted socket connected to the
encrypting/decrypting proxy. As such, when <br>
using TLS, the PF_MEMALLOC option is not set on the socket
that actually receives data from the network, which means
that the deadlock reappears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this reason, if the -swap
option is used when TLS is in use, nbd-client will issue an
appropriate warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-certfile file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Use the specified file as the
client certificate for TLS authentication to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keyfile file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Use the specified file as the
private key for the client cerificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cacertfile file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Use the specified file as the
CA certificate for TLS authentication to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tlshostname hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Use the specified hostname
for the TLS context. If not specified, the hostname used to
connect to the server will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Some examples of nbd-client usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To connect to a
server running on port 2000 at host
&quot;server.domain.com&quot;, using the client&rsquo;s
block special file &quot;/dev/nbd0&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-client server.domain.com
2000 /dev/nbd0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To connect to a
server running on port 2001 at host
&quot;swapserver.domain.com&quot;, using the client&rsquo;s
block special file &quot;/dev/nbd1&quot;, for swap
purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-client swapserver.domain.com
2001 /dev/nbd1 -swap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To disconnect
the above connection again (after making sure the block
special file is not in use anymore):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-client -d /dev/nbd1</p>
