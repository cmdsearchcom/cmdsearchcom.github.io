<p>WATCHDOG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
WATCHDOG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
watchdog - a software watchdog daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
watchdog [-F|--foreground] [-f|--force] [-c
filename|--config-file filename] [-v|--verbose] [-s|--sync]
[-b|--softboot] [-q|--no-action]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Linux kernel can reset the system if serious problems
are detected. This can be implemented via special watchdog
hardware, or via a slightly less reliable software-only <br>
watchdog inside the kernel. Either way, there needs to be a
daemon that tells the kernel the system is working fine. If
the daemon stops doing that, the system is reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watchdog is such a daemon. It
opens /dev/watchdog, and keeps writing to it often enough to
keep the kernel from resetting, at least once per minute.
Each write delays the reboot <br>
time another minute. After a minute of inactivity the
watchdog hardware will cause the reset. In the case of the
software watchdog the ability to reboot will depend on the
state <br>
of the machines and interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The watchdog daemon can be
stopped without causing a reboot if the device /dev/watchdog
is closed correctly, unless your kernel is compiled with the
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT <br>
option enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTS <br>
The watchdog daemon does several tests to check the system
status:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Is the process
table full?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Is there enough
free memory?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Are some files
accessible?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Have some files
changed within a given interval?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Is the average
work load too high?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Has a file table
overflow occurred?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Is a process
still running? The process is specified by a pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do some IP
addresses answer to ping?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do network
interfaces receive traffic?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Is the
temperature too high? (Temperature data not always
available.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Execute a user
defined command to do arbitrary tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Execute one or
more test/repair commands found in /etc/watchdog.d. These
commands are called with the argument test or repair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of these checks fail
watchdog will cause a shutdown. Should any of these tests
except the user defined binary last longer than one minute
the machine will be rebooted, <br>
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Available command line options are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Set verbose mode. Only implemented if compiled with SYSLOG
feature. This mode will log each several infos in LOG_DAEMON
with priority LOG_INFO. This is useful if you want <br>
to see exactly what happened until the watchdog rebooted the
system. Currently it logs the temperature (if available),
the load average, the change date of the files it <br>
checks and how often it went to sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sync <br>
Try to synchronize the filesystem every time the process is
awake. Note that the system is rebooted if for any reason
the synchronizing lasts longer than a minute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --softboot <br>
Soft-boot the system if an error occurs during the main
loop, e.g. if a given file is not accessible via the stat(2)
call. Note that this does not apply to the opening of <br>
/dev/watchdog and /proc/loadavg, which are opened before the
main loop starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --foreground <br>
Run in foreground mode, useful for running under systemd
(for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Force the usage of the interval given or the maximal load
average given in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-file, --config-file
config-file <br>
Use config-file as the configuration file instead of the
default /etc/watchdog.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --no-action <br>
Do not reboot or halt the machine. This is for testing
purposes. All checks are executed and the results are logged
as usual, but no action is taken. Also your hardware <br>
card or the kernel software watchdog driver is not enabled.
Temperature checking is also disabled since this triggers
the hardware watchdog on some cards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTION <br>
After watchdog starts, it puts itself into the background
and then tries all checks specified in its configuration
file in turn. Between each two tests it will write to the
ker&acirc; <br>
nel device to prevent a reset. After finishing all tests
watchdog goes to sleep for some time. The kernel drivers
expects a write to the watchdog device every minute.
Otherwise <br>
the system will be reset. As a default watchdog will sleep
for only 1 second so it triggers the device early
enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under high system load watchdog
might be swapped out of memory and may fail to make it back
in in time. Under these circumstances the Linux kernel will
reset the machine. To make <br>
sure you won&rsquo;t get unnecessary reboots make sure you
have the variable realtime set to yes in the configuration
file watchdog.conf. This adds real time support to watchdog:
it <br>
will lock itself into memory and there should be no problem
even under the highest of loads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On system running out of memory
the kernel will try to free enough memory by killing
process. The watchdog daemon itself is exempted from this
so-called out-of-memory killer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also you can specify a maximal
allowed load average. Once this load average is reached the
system is rebooted. You may specify maximal load averages
for 1 minute, 5 minutes or 15 <br>
minutes. The default values is to disable this test. Be
careful not to set this parameter too low. To set a value
less then the predefined minimal value of 2, you have to use
the <br>
-f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also specify a minimal
amount of virtual memory you want to have available as free.
As soon as more virtual memory is used action is taken by
watchdog. Note, however, <br>
that watchdog does not distinguish between different types
of memory usage. It just checks for free virtual memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a watchdog card with
temperature sensor you can specify the maximal allowed
temperature. Once this temperature is reached the system is
halted. The default value is <br>
120. There is no unit conversion so make sure you use the
same unit as your hardware. watchdog will issue warnings
once the temperature increases 90%, 95% and 98% of this
tem&acirc; <br>
perature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using file mode watchdog
will try to stat(2) the given files. Errors returned by stat
will not cause a reboot. For a reboot the stat call has to
last at least one minute. <br>
This may happen if the file is located on an NFS mounted
filesystem. If your system relies on an NFS mounted
filesystem you might try this option. However, in such a
case the <br>
sync option may not work if the NFS server is not
answering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watchdog can read the pid from a
pid file and see whether the process still exists. If not,
action is taken by watchdog. So you can for instance restart
the server from your <br>
repair-binary. See the Systemd section below for additinal
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watchdog will try periodically
to fork itself to see whether the process table is full.
This process will leave a zombie process until watchdog
wakes up again and catches it; <br>
this is harmless, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ping mode watchdog tries to
ping the given IP addresses. These addresses do not have to
be a single machine. It is possible to ping to a broadcast
address instead to see if at <br>
least one machine in a subnet is still living.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use this broadcast ping
unless your MIS person a) knows about it and b) has given
you explicit permission to use it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watchdog will send out three
ping packages and wait up to &lt;interval&gt; seconds for
the reply with &lt;interval&gt; being the time it goes to
sleep between two times triggering the watch&acirc; <br>
dog device. Thus a unreachable network will not cause a hard
reset but a soft reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also test passively for
an unreachable network by just monitoring a given interface
for traffic. If no traffic arrives the network is considered
unreachable causing a <br>
soft reboot or action from the repair binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start the watchdog when
network is available see the Systemd section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watchdog can run an external
command for user-defined tests. A return code not equal 0
means an error occured and watchdog should react. If the
external command is killed by an <br>
uncaught signal this is considered an error by watchdog too.
The command may take longer than the time slice defined for
the kernel device without a problem. However, error
mes&acirc; <br>
sages are generated into the syslog facility. If you have
enabled softboot on error the machine will be rebooted if
the binary doesn&rsquo;t exit in half the time watchdog
sleeps <br>
between two tries triggering the kernel device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify a repair binary
it will be started instead of shutting down the system. If
this binary is not able to fix the problem watchdog will
still cause a reboot after&acirc; <br>
wards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the machine is halted an
email is sent to notify a human that the machine is going
down. Starting with version 4.4 watchdog will also notify
the human in charge if the machine <br>
is rebooted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOFT REBOOT <br>
A soft reboot (i.e. controlled shutdown and reboot) is
initiated for every error that is found. Since there might
be no more processes available, watchdog does it all by
himself. <br>
That means:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Kill all processes with
SIGTERM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. After a short pause kill all
remaining processes with SIGKILL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Record a shutdown entry in
wtmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Save the random seed from
/dev/urandom. If the device is non-existant or there is no
filename for saving this step is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Turn off accounting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Turn off quota and swap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Unmount all partitions except
the root partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Remount the root partition
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Shut down all network
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. Finally reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK BINARY <br>
If the return code of the check binary is not zero watchdog
will assume an error and reboot the system. Be careful with
this if you are using the real-time properties of watchdog
<br>
since watchdog will wait for the return of this binary
before proceeding. An positive exit code is interpreted as
an system error code (see errno.h for details). Negative
values <br>
are special to watchdog:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Reboot the system. This is
not exactly an error message but a command to watchdog. If
the return code is -1 watchdog will not try to run a
shutdown script instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Reset the system. This is not
exactly an error message but a command to watchdog. If the
return code is -2 watchdog will simply refuse to write the
kernel device again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 Maximum load average
exceeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 The temperature inside is too
high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-5 /proc/loadavg contains no (or
not enough) data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 The given file was not
changed in the given interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7 /proc/meminfo contains
invalid data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8 Child process was killed by a
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-9 Child process did not return
in time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-10 Free for personal use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With enforcing SELinux policy
please use the /usr/libexec/watchdog/scripts/ for your
test-binary configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPAIR BINARY <br>
The repair binary is started with one parameter: the error
number that caused watchdog to initiate the boot process.
After trying to repair the system the binary should exit
with <br>
0 if the system was successfully repaired and thus there is
no need to boot anymore. A return value not equal 0 tells
watchdog to reboot. The return code of the repair binary
<br>
should be the error number of the error causing watchdog to
reboot. Be careful with this if you are using the real-time
properties since watchdog will wait for the return of this
<br>
binary before proceeding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With enforcing SELinux policy
please use the /usr/libexec/watchdog/scripts/ for your
repair-binary configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST DIRECTORY <br>
Executables placed in the test directory are discovered by
watchdog on startup and are automatically executed. They are
bounded time-wise by the test-timeout directive in
watch&acirc; <br>
dog.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These executables are called
with either &quot;test&quot; as the first argument (if a
test is being performed) or &quot;repair&quot; as the first
argument (if a repair for a previously-failed
&quot;test&quot; <br>
operation on is being performed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The as with test binaries and
repair binaries, expected exit codes for a successful test
or repair operation is always zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an executable&rsquo;s test
operation fails, the same executable is automatically called
with the &quot;repair&quot; argument as well as the return
code of the previously-failed test opera&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if the following
execution returns 42:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/watchdog.d/my-test test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The watchdog daemon will attempt
to repair the problem by calling:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/watchdog.d/my-test repair
42</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This enables administrators and
application developers to make intelligent test/repair
commands. If the &quot;repair&quot; operation is not
required (or is not likely to succeed), it is <br>
important that the author of the command return a non-zero
value so the machine will still reboot as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the watchdog daemon
may interpret and act upon any of the reserved return codes
noted in the Check Binary section prior to calling a given
command in &quot;repair&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEMD <br>
To start watchdog after the network is available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemctl disable watchdog <br>
systemctl enable NetworkManager-wait-online <br>
systemctl enable watchdog-ping</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using custom service pid
check with custom service systemd unit file please be aware
the &quot;Requires=&quot; does dependent service
deactivation. Using &quot;Before=watchdog.service&quot; or
<br>
&quot;Before=watchdog-ping.service&quot; in the custom
service unit file may be the desired operation instead. See
systemd.unit documentation for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELINUX <br>
The directories /etc/watchdog.d/ and
/usr/libexec/watchdog/scripts/ are recognized locations for
custom executables.</p>
