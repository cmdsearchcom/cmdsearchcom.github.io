watchdog - a software watchdog daemon
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>watchdog</b> [<b>-F</b>|<b>--foreground</b>] [<b>-f</b>|<b>--force</b>]
  [<b>-c</b> <i>filename</i>|<b>--config-file</b> <i>filename</i>]
  [<b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose</b>] [<b>-s</b>|<b>--sync</b>]
  [<b>-b</b>|<b>--softboot</b>] [<b>-q</b>|<b>--no-action</b>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The Linux kernel can reset the system if serious problems are detected. This can
  be implemented via special watchdog hardware, or via a slightly less reliable
  software-only watchdog inside the kernel. Either way, there needs to be a
  daemon that tells the kernel the system is working fine. If the daemon stops
  doing that, the system is reset.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>watchdog</b> is such a daemon. It opens <i>/dev/watchdog</i>, and keeps
  writing to it often enough to keep the kernel from resetting, at least once
  per minute. Each write delays the reboot time another minute. After a minute
  of inactivity the watchdog hardware will cause the reset. In the case of the
  software watchdog the ability to reboot will depend on the state of the
  machines and interrupts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The watchdog daemon can be stopped without causing a reboot if the device
  <i>/dev/watchdog</i> is closed correctly, unless your kernel is compiled with
  the <i>CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT</i> option enabled.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TESTS"><a class="selflink" href="#TESTS">TESTS</a></h1>
The watchdog daemon does several tests to check the system status:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Is the process table full?</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<div class="Pp"></div>
If any of these checks fail watchdog will cause a shutdown. Should any of these
  tests except the user defined binary last longer than one minute the machine
  will be rebooted, too.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Available command line options are the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set verbose mode. Only implemented if compiled with
      <i>SYSLOG</i> feature. This mode will log each several infos in
      <i>LOG_DAEMON</i> with priority <i>LOG_INFO.</i> This is useful if you
      want to see exactly what happened until the watchdog rebooted the system.
      Currently it logs the temperature (if available), the load average, the
      change date of the files it checks and how often it went to sleep.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b>, <b>--sync</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Try to synchronize the filesystem every time the process is
      awake. Note that the system is rebooted if for any reason the
      synchronizing lasts longer than a minute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b>, <b>--softboot</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Soft-boot the system if an error occurs during the main
      loop, e.g. if a given file is not accessible via the <b>stat</b>(2) call.
      Note that this does not apply to the opening of <i>/dev/watchdog</i> and
      <i>/proc/loadavg</i>, which are opened before the main loop starts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q</b>, <b>--no-action</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not reboot or halt the machine. This is for testing
      purposes. All checks are executed and the results are logged as usual, but
      no action is taken. Also your hardware card or the kernel software
      watchdog driver is not enabled. Temperature checking is also disabled
      since this triggers the hardware watchdog on some cards.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FUNCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a></h1>
After <b>watchdog</b> starts, it puts itself into the background and then tries
  all checks specified in its configuration file in turn. Between each two tests
  it will write to the kernel device to prevent a reset. After finishing all
  tests watchdog goes to sleep for some time. The kernel drivers expects a write
  to the watchdog device every minute. Otherwise the system will be reset. As a
  default <b>watchdog</b> will sleep for only 1 second so it triggers the device
  early enough.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under high system load <b>watchdog</b> might be swapped out of memory and may
  fail to make it back in in time. Under these circumstances the Linux kernel
  will reset the machine. To make sure you won't get unnecessary reboots make
  sure you have the variable <i>realtime</i> set to <i>yes</i> in the
  configuration file <i>watchdog.conf</i>. This adds real time support to
  <b>watchdog</b>: it will lock itself into memory and there should be no
  problem even under the highest of loads.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On system running out of memory the kernel will try to free enough memory by
  killing process. The <b>watchdog</b> daemon itself is exempted from this
  so-called out-of-memory killer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also you can specify a maximal allowed load average. Once this load average is
  reached the system is rebooted. You may specify maximal load averages for 1
  minute, 5 minutes or 15 minutes. The default values is to disable this test.
  Be careful not to set this parameter too low. To set a value less then the
  predefined minimal value of 2, you have to use the <b>-f</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also specify a minimal amount of virtual memory you want to have
  available as free. As soon as more virtual memory is used action is taken by
  <b>watchdog</b>. Note, however, that watchdog does not distinguish between
  different types of memory usage. It just checks for free virtual memory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a watchdog card with temperature sensor you can specify the maximal
  allowed temperature. Once this temperature is reached the system is halted.
  The default value is 120. There is no unit conversion so make sure you use the
  same unit as your hardware. <b>watchdog</b> will issue warnings once the
  temperature increases 90%, 95% and 98% of this temperature.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using file mode <b>watchdog</b> will try to <b>stat</b>(2) the given files.
  Errors returned by stat will <b>not</b> cause a reboot. For a reboot the stat
  call has to last at least one minute. This may happen if the file is located
  on an NFS mounted filesystem. If your system relies on an NFS mounted
  filesystem you might try this option. However, in such a case the <i>sync</i>
  option may not work if the NFS server is not answering.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>watchdog</b> can read the pid from a pid file and see whether the process
  still exists. If not, action is taken by <b>watchdog</b>. So you can for
  instance restart the server from your <i>repair-binary</i>. See the Systemd
  section below for additinal information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>watchdog</b> will try periodically to fork itself to see whether the process
  table is full. This process will leave a zombie process until watchdog wakes
  up again and catches it; this is harmless, don't worry about it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In ping mode <b>watchdog</b> tries to ping the given IP addresses. These
  addresses do not have to be a single machine. It is possible to ping to a
  broadcast address instead to see if at least one machine in a subnet is still
  living.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Do not use this broadcast ping unless your MIS person a) knows about it
  and</b> <b>b) has given you explicit permission to use it!</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>watchdog</b> will send out three ping packages and wait up to
  &lt;interval&gt; seconds for the reply with &lt;interval&gt; being the time it
  goes to sleep between two times triggering the watchdog device. Thus a
  unreachable network will not cause a hard reset but a soft reboot.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also test passively for an unreachable network by just monitoring a
  given interface for traffic. If no traffic arrives the network is considered
  unreachable causing a soft reboot or action from the repair binary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start the watchdog when network is available see the Systemd section below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>watchdog can run an external command for user-defined tests. A return
  code</b> not equal 0 means an error occured and watchdog should react. If the
  external command is killed by an uncaught signal this is considered an error
  by watchdog too. The command may take longer than the time slice defined for
  the kernel device without a problem. However, error messages are generated
  into the syslog facility. If you have enabled softboot on error the machine
  will be rebooted if the binary doesn't exit in half the time <b>watchdog</b>
  sleeps between two tries triggering the kernel device.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify a repair binary it will be started instead of shutting down the
  system. If this binary is not able to fix the problem <b>watchdog</b> will
  still cause a reboot afterwards.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the machine is halted an email is sent to notify a human that the machine is
  going down. Starting with version 4.4 <b>watchdog</b> will also notify the
  human in charge if the machine is rebooted.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOFT_REBOOT"><a class="selflink" href="#SOFT_REBOOT">SOFT
  REBOOT</a></h1>
A soft reboot (i.e. controlled shutdown and reboot) is initiated for every error
  that is found. Since there might be no more processes available, watchdog does
  it all by himself. That means:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Kill all processes with SIGTERM.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHECK_BINARY"><a class="selflink" href="#CHECK_BINARY">CHECK
  BINARY</a></h1>
If the return code of the check binary is not zero <b>watchdog</b> will assume
  an error and reboot the system. Be careful with this if you are using the
  real-time properties of watchdog since <b>watchdog</b> will wait for the
  return of this binary before proceeding. An positive exit code is interpreted
  as an system error code (see <i>errno.h</i> for details). Negative values are
  special to <b>watchdog</b>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Reboot the system. This is not exactly an error message but

With enforcing SELinux policy please use the /usr/libexec/watchdog/scripts/ for
  your test-binary configuration.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPAIR_BINARY"><a class="selflink" href="#REPAIR_BINARY">REPAIR
  BINARY</a></h1>
The repair binary is started with one parameter: the error number that caused
  <b>watchdog</b> to initiate the boot process. After trying to repair the
  system the binary should exit with 0 if the system was successfully repaired
  and thus there is no need to boot anymore. A return value not equal 0 tells
  <b>watchdog</b> to reboot. The return code of the repair binary should be the
  error number of the error causing <b>watchdog</b> to reboot. Be careful with
  this if you are using the real-time properties since <b>watchdog</b> will wait
  for the return of this binary before proceeding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With enforcing SELinux policy please use the /usr/libexec/watchdog/scripts/ for
  your repair-binary configuration.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TEST_DIRECTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#TEST_DIRECTORY">TEST
  DIRECTORY</a></h1>
Executables placed in the test directory are discovered by watchdog on startup
  and are automatically executed. They are bounded time-wise by the test-timeout
  directive in watchdog.conf.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These executables are called with either &quot;test&quot; as the first argument
  (if a test is being performed) or &quot;repair&quot; as the first argument (if
  a repair for a previously-failed &quot;test&quot; operation on is being
  performed).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The as with test binaries and repair binaries, expected exit codes for a
  successful test or repair operation is always zero.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If an executable's test operation fails, the same executable is automatically
  called with the &quot;repair&quot; argument as well as the return code of the
  previously-failed test operation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, if the following execution returns 42:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /etc/watchdog.d/my-test test
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The watchdog daemon will attempt to repair the problem by calling:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /etc/watchdog.d/my-test repair 42
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This enables administrators and application developers to make intelligent
  test/repair commands. If the &quot;repair&quot; operation is not required (or
  is not likely to succeed), it is important that the author of the command
  return a non-zero value so the machine will still reboot as expected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the watchdog daemon may interpret and act upon any of the reserved
  return codes noted in the Check Binary section prior to calling a given
  command in &quot;repair&quot; mode.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSTEMD"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSTEMD">SYSTEMD</a></h1>
To start watchdog after the network is available:
<div class="Pp"></div>
systemctl disable watchdog
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
systemctl enable NetworkManager-wait-online
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
systemctl enable watchdog-ping
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using custom service pid check with custom service systemd unit file please
  be aware the &quot;Requires=&quot; does dependent service deactivation. Using
  &quot;Before=watchdog.service&quot; or
  &quot;Before=watchdog-ping.service&quot; in the custom service unit file may
  be the desired operation instead. See systemd.unit documentation for more
