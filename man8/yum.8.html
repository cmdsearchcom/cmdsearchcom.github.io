<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
yum - Yellowdog Updater Modified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
yum [options] [command] [package ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
yum is an interactive, rpm based, package manager. It can
automatically perform system updates, including dependency
analysis and obsolete processing based on
&quot;repository&quot; meta&acirc; <br>
data. It can also perform installation of new packages,
removal of old packages and perform queries on the installed
and/or available packages among many other commands/services
<br>
(see below). yum is similar to other high level package
managers like apt-get and smart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While there are some graphical
interfaces directly to the yum code, more recent graphical
interface development is happening with PackageKit and the
gnome-packagekit application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command is one of: <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the --help or -h option
is given, one of the above commands must be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repository configuration is
honored in all operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install <br>
Is used to install the latest version of a package or group
of packages while ensuring that all dependencies are
satisfied. (See Specifying package names for more
infor&acirc; <br>
mation) If no package matches the given package name(s),
they are assumed to be a shell glob and any matches are then
installed. If the name starts with @^ then it is <br>
treated as an environment group (group install @^foo), an @
character and it&rsquo;s treated as a group (plain group
install).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the name starts with a
&quot;-&quot; character, then a search is done within the
transaction and any matches are removed. Note that Yum
options use the same syntax and it may be <br>
necessary to use &quot;--&quot; to resolve any possible
conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the name is a file, then
install works like localinstall. If the name doesn&rsquo;t
match a package, then package &quot;provides&quot; are
searched (e.g. &quot;_sqlitecache.so()(64bit)&quot;) as <br>
are filelists (Eg. &quot;/usr/bin/yum&quot;). Also note that
for filelists, wildcards will match multiple packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because install does a lot of
work to make it as easy as possible to use, there are also a
few specific install commands &quot;install-n&quot;,
&quot;install-na&quot; and &quot;install-nevra&quot;. <br>
These only work on package names, and do not process
wildcards etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update If run without any
packages, update will update every currently installed
package. If one or more packages or package globs are
specified, Yum will only update the listed <br>
packages. While updating packages, yum will ensure that all
dependencies are satisfied. (See Specifying package names
for more information) If the packages or globs spec&acirc;
<br>
ified match to packages which are not currently installed
then update will not install them. update operates on
groups, files, provides and filelists just like the <br>
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the main obsoletes configure
option is true (default) or the --obsoletes flag is present
yum will include package obsoletes in its calculations -
this makes it better <br>
for distro-version changes, for example: upgrading from
somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;update&quot;
works on installed packages first, and only if there are no
matches does it look for available packages. The difference
is most noticeable when you do <br>
&quot;update foo-1-2&quot; which will act exactly as
&quot;update foo&quot; if foo-1-2 is installed. You can use
the &quot;update-to&quot; if you&rsquo;d prefer that nothing
happen in the above case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-to <br>
This command works like &quot;update&quot; but always
specifies the version of the package we want to update
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-minimal <br>
This works like the update command, but if you have the
package foo-1 installed and have foo-2 (bugfix) and foo-3
(enhancement) available with updateinfo.xml then update-
<br>
minimal --bugfix will update you to foo-2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check-update <br>
Implemented so you could know if your machine had any
updates that needed to be applied without running it
interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if there are
packages <br>
available for an update. Also returns a list of the packages
to be updated in list format. Returns 0 if no packages are
available for update. Returns 1 if an error <br>
occurred. Running in verbose mode also shows obsoletes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade <br>
Is the same as the update command with the --obsoletes flag
set. See update for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade-to <br>
This command works like &quot;upgrade&quot; but always
specifies the version of the package we want to update
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distribution-synchronization or
distro-sync <br>
Synchronizes the installed package set with the latest
packages available, this is done by either obsoleting,
upgrading or downgrading as appropriate. This will
&quot;normally&quot; <br>
do the same thing as the upgrade command however if you have
the package FOO installed at version 4, and the latest
available is only version 3, then this command will <br>
downgrade FOO to version 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give the optional
argument &quot;full&quot;, then the command will also
reinstall packages where the install checksum and the
available checksum do not match. And remove old <br>
packages (can be used to sync. rpmdb versions). The optional
argument &quot;different&quot; can be used to specify the
default operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command does not perform
operations on groups, local packages or negative
selections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove or erase <br>
Are used to remove the specified packages from the system as
well as removing any packages which depend on the package
being removed. remove operates on groups, files, <br>
provides and filelists just like the &quot;install&quot;
command.(See Specifying package names for more
information)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;yum&quot; is
included in the protected_packages configuration, by
default. So you can&rsquo;t accidentally remove yum
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remove_leaf_only
configuration changes the behaviour of this command to only
remove packages which aren&rsquo;t required by something
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The clean_requirements_on_remove
configuration changes the behaviour of this command to also
remove packages that are only dependencies of this
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because remove does a lot of
work to make it as easy as possible to use, there are also a
few specific remove commands &quot;remove-n&quot;,
&quot;remove-na&quot; and &quot;remove-nevra&quot;. These
<br>
only work on package names, and do not process wildcards
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoremove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With one or more arguments this
command works like running the &quot;remove&quot; command
with the clean_requirements_on_remove turned on. However you
can also specify no arguments, <br>
at which point it tries to remove any packages that
weren&rsquo;t installed explicitly by the user and which
aren&rsquo;t required by anything (so called leaf
packages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because autoremove does a lot of
work to make it as easy as possible to use, there are also a
few specific autoremove commands &quot;autoremove-n&quot;,
&quot;autoremove-na&quot; and &quot;autore&acirc; <br>
move-nevra&quot;. These only work on package names, and do
not process wildcards etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list Is used to list various
information about available packages; more complete details
are available in the List Options section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">provides or whatprovides <br>
Is used to find out which package provides some feature or
file. Just use a specific name or a file-glob-syntax
wildcards to list the packages available or installed that
<br>
provide that feature or file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search This is used to find
packages when you know something about the package but
aren&rsquo;t sure of it&rsquo;s name. By default search will
try searching just package names and sum&acirc; <br>
maries, but if that &quot;fails&quot; it will then try
descriptions and url.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yum search orders the results so
that those packages matching more terms will appear
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can force searching
everything by specifying &quot;all&quot; as the first
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info Is used to list a
description and summary information about available
packages; takes the same arguments as in the List Options
section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean Is used to clean up
various things which accumulate in the yum cache directory
over time. More complete details can be found in the Clean
Options section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makecache <br>
Is used to download and make usable all the metadata for the
currently enabled yum repos. If the argument
&quot;fast&quot; is passed, then we just try to make sure
the repos. are <br>
current (much like &quot;yum clean expire-cache&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groups A command, new in 3.4.2,
that collects all the subcommands that act on groups
together. Note that recent yum using distributions
(Fedora-19+, RHEL-7+) have configured <br>
group_command=objects which changes how group commands act
in some important ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group install&quot; is
used to install all of the individual packages in a group,
of the specified types (this works as if you&rsquo;d taken
each of those package names and put them <br>
on the command line for a &quot;yum install&quot; command).
<br>
The group_package_types configuration option specifies which
types will be installed. <br>
If you wish to &quot;reinstall&quot; a group so that you get
a package that is currently blacklisted the easiest way to
do that currently is to install the package manually and
<br>
then run &quot;groups mark packages-sync mygroup
mypackagename&quot; (or use yumdb to set the group_member of
the package(s)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group update&quot; is just
an alias for group install, when using group_command=compat.
This will install packages in the group not already
installed and upgrade existing <br>
packages. With group_command=simple it will just upgrade
already installed packages. With group_command=objects it
will try to upgrade the group object, installing any <br>
available packages not blacklisted (marked &rsquo;-&rsquo;
in group info) and will upgrade the installed packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group list&quot; is used
to list the available groups from all yum repos. When
group_command=objects the group is installed if the user
explicitly installed it (or used the <br>
group mark* commands to mark it installed). It does not need
to have any packages installed. When not using
group_command=objects groups are shown as
&quot;installed&quot; if all <br>
mandatory packages are installed, or if a group
doesn&rsquo;t have any mandatory packages then it is
installed if any of the optional or default package are
installed (when not <br>
in group_command=objects mode). You can pass optional
arguments to the list/summary commands: installed,
available, environment, language, packages, hidden and ids
(or <br>
any of those prefixed by &quot;no&quot; to turn them off
again). Note that groups that are available but hidden will
not be listed unless &Acirc;&acute;hidden&Acirc;&acute;
keyword is passed to the command. <br>
If you pass the -v option, to enable verbose mode, then the
groupids are displayed by default (but &quot;yum group list
ids&quot; is often easier to read).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group remove&quot; is used
to remove all of the packages in a group, unlike
&quot;groupinstall&quot; this will remove everything
regardless of group_package_types. It is worth pointing <br>
out that packages can be in more than one group, so
&quot;group install X Y&quot; followed by &quot;group remove
Y&quot; does not do give you the same result as &quot;group
install X&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The groupremove_leaf_only
configuration changes the behaviour of this command to only
remove packages which aren&rsquo;t required by something
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group info&quot; is used
to give the description and package list of a group (and
which type those packages are marked as). Note that you can
use the yum-filter-data and yum- <br>
list-data plugins to get/use the data the other way around
(i.e. what groups own packages need updating). If you pass
the -v option, to enable verbose mode, then the pack&acirc;
<br>
age names are matched against installed/available packages
similar to the list command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using
group_command=objects, the info command will display markers
next to each package saying how that package relates to the
group object. The meaning of these <br>
markers is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-&quot; = Package
isn&rsquo;t installed, and won&rsquo;t be installed as part
of the group (Eg. &quot;yum group install foo -pkgA&quot; or
&quot;yum group install foo; yum remove pkgA&quot;
&acirc;&brvbar; this will have <br>
pkgA marked as &rsquo;-&rsquo;) <br>
&quot;+&quot; = Package isn&rsquo;t installed, but will be
the next time you run &quot;yum upgrade&quot; or &quot;yum
group upgrade foo&quot; <br>
&quot; &quot; = Package is installed, but wasn&rsquo;t
installed via the group (so &quot;group remove foo&quot;
won&rsquo;t remove it). <br>
&quot;=&quot; = Package is installed, and was installed via
the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you can move an installed
package into an installed group using either &quot;group
mark package-sync/package-sync-forced&quot; or &quot;yumdb
set group_member&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group summary&quot; is
used to give a quick summary of how many groups are
installed and available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark&quot; and
&quot;group unmark&quot; are used when groups are configured
in group_command=objects mode. These commands then allow you
to alter yum&rsquo;s idea of which groups are <br>
installed, and the packages that belong to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark install&quot;
mark the group as installed. When installed &quot;yum
upgrade&quot; and &quot;yum group upgrade&quot; will install
new packages for the group (only those packages already <br>
installed will be marked as members of the installed group
to start with).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark remove&quot;
the opposite of mark install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark packages&quot;
takes a group id (which must be installed) and marks any
given installed packages (which aren&rsquo;t members of a
group) as members of the group. Note <br>
that the data from the repositories does not need to specify
the packages as a member of the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark
packages-force&quot; works like mark packages, but
doesn&rsquo;t care if the packages are already members of
another group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark blacklist&quot;
will blacklist all packages marked to be installed for a
group. After this command a &quot;yum group upgrade&quot;
will not install any new packages as part <br>
of the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark
convert-blacklist&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark
convert-whitelist&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group mark convert&quot;
converts the automatic data you get without using groups as
objects into groups as objects data, in other words this
will make &quot;yum <br>
--setopt=group_command=objects groups list&quot; look as
similar as possible to the current output of &quot;yum
--setopt=group_command=simple groups list&quot;. This makes
it much easier <br>
to convert to groups as objects without having to reinstall.
For groups that are installed the whitelist variant will
mark all uninstalled packages for the group as to be <br>
installed on the next &quot;yum group upgrade&quot;, the
blacklist variant (current default) will mark them all as
blacklisted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;group unmark
packages&quot; remove a package as a member from any
groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell Is used to enter the
&rsquo;yum shell&rsquo;, when a filename is specified the
contents of that file is executed in yum shell mode. See
yum-shell(8) for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolvedep <br>
Is used to list packages providing the specified
dependencies, at most one package is listed per dependency.
This command is maintained for legacy reasons only, use
repo&acirc; <br>
query instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localinstall <br>
Is used to install a set of local rpm files. If required the
enabled repositories will be used to resolve dependencies.
Note that the install command will do a local <br>
install, if given a filename. This command is maintained for
legacy reasons only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localupdate <br>
Is used to update the system by specifying local rpm files.
Only the specified rpm files of which an older version is
already installed will be installed, the remaining <br>
specified packages will be ignored. If required the enabled
repositories will be used to resolve dependencies. Note that
the update command will do a local update, if <br>
given a filename. This command is maintained for legacy
reasons only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reinstall <br>
Will reinstall the identically versioned package as is
currently installed. This does not work for
&quot;installonly&quot; packages, like Kernels. reinstall
operates on groups, <br>
files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">downgrade <br>
Will try and downgrade a package from the version currently
installed to the previously highest version (or the
specified version). The depsolver will not necessarily <br>
work, but if you specify all the packages it should work
(thus, all the simple cases will work). Also this does not
work for &quot;installonly&quot; packages, like Kernels.
down&acirc; <br>
grade operates on groups, files, provides, filelists and rpm
files just like the &quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap At it&rsquo;s simplest this
is just a simpler way to remove one set of package(s) and
install another set of package(s) without having to use the
&quot;shell&quot; command. However you <br>
can specify different commands to call than just remove or
install, and you can list multiple packages (it splits using
the &quot;--&quot; marker). Note that option parsing will
<br>
remove the first &quot;--&quot; in an argument list on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap foo bar <br>
swap -- remove foo -- install bar <br>
swap foo group install bar-grp <br>
swap -- group remove foo-grp -- group install bar-grp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deplist <br>
Produces a list of all dependencies and what packages
provide those dependencies for the given packages. As of
3.2.30 it now just shows the latest version of each package
<br>
that matches (this can be changed by using --showduplicates)
and it only shows the newest providers (which can be changed
by using --verbose).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repolist <br>
Produces a list of configured repositories. The default is
to list all enabled repositories. If you pass -v, for
verbose mode, or use repoinfo then more information is <br>
listed. If the first argument is
&Acirc;&acute;enabled&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;disabled&Acirc;&acute; or
&Acirc;&acute;all&Acirc;&acute; then the command will list
those types of repos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can pass repo id or name
arguments, or wildcards which to match against both of
those. However if the id or name matches exactly then the
repo will be listed even if <br>
you are listing enabled repos. and it is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In non-verbose mode the first
column will start with a &Acirc;&acute;*&Acirc;&acute; if
the repo. has metalink data and the latest metadata is not
local and will start with a &Acirc;&acute;!&Acirc;&acute; if
the repo. has <br>
metadata that is expired. For non-verbose mode the last
column will also display the number of packages in the repo.
and (if there are any user specified excludes) the <br>
number of packages excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One last special feature of
repolist, is that if you are in non-verbose mode then yum
will ignore any repo errors and output the information it
can get (Eg. &quot;yum clean <br>
all; yum -C repolist&quot; will output something, although
the package counts/etc. will be zeroed out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repoinfo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command works exactly like
repolist -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repository-packages <br>
Treat a repo. as a collection of packages (like &quot;yum
groups&quot;) allowing the user to install or remove them as
a single entity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; list&quot; - Works like the &quot;yum
list&quot; command, but only shows packages from the given
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; info&quot; - Works like the &quot;yum
info&quot; command, but only shows packages from the given
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; check-update&quot; - Works like the &quot;yum
check-update&quot; command, but only shows packages from the
given repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; install&quot; - Install all of the packages in
the repository, basically the same as: yum install
$(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). Specific pack&acirc;
<br>
ages/wildcards can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; upgrade&quot; - Update all of the packages in
the repository, basically the same as: yum upgrade
$(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). Specific pack&acirc;
<br>
ages/wildcards can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; upgrade-to&quot; - Update all of the packages
in the repository, basically the same as: yum upgrade
$(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). Without argu&acirc;
<br>
ments it works the same as upgrade, with arguments it just
interprets them as the versions you want to move to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; reinstall-old&quot; - ReInstall all of the
packages that are installed from the repository and
available in the repository, similar to: yum rein&acirc;
<br>
stall $(yumdb search-quiet from_repo &lt;repo&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; move-to&quot; - ReInstall all of the packages
that are available in the repository, basically the same as:
yum reinstall $(repoquery --repoid=&lt;repo&gt; <br>
-a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repository-packages
&lt;repo&gt; reinstall&quot; - Tries to do reinstall-old,
but if that produces no packages then tries move-to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repo-pkgs &lt;repo&gt;
remove&quot; - Remove all of the packages in the repository,
very similar to: yum remove $(repoquery
--repoid=&lt;repo&gt; -a). However the
repopkgsremove_leaf_only <br>
option is obeyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repo-pkgs &lt;repo&gt;
remove-or-reinstall&quot; - Works like remove for any
package that doesn&rsquo;t have the exact same version in
another repository. For any package that does have <br>
the exact NEVRA in another repository then that version will
be reinstalled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;repo-pkgs &lt;repo&gt;
remove-or-distro-sync&quot; - Works like remove for any
package that doesn&rsquo;t exist in another repository. For
any package that does exist it tries to work as <br>
if distro-sync was called (with the repo. disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Produces a &quot;version&quot; of the rpmdb, and of the
enabled repositories if &quot;all&quot; is given as the
first argument. You can also specify version groups in the
version-groups con&acirc; <br>
figuration file. If you pass -v, for verbose mode, more
information is listed. The version is calculated by taking
an SHA1 hash of the packages (in sorted order), and the <br>
checksum_type/checksum_data entries from the yumdb. Note
that this rpmdb version is now also used significantly
within yum (esp. in yum history).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version command will now
show &quot;groups&quot; of packages as a separate version,
and so takes sub-commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version grouplist&quot; -
List the defined version groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version groupinfo&quot; -
Get the complete list of packages within one or more version
groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version installed&quot; -
This is the default, only show the version information for
installed packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version available&quot; -
Only show the version information for available
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version all&quot; - Show
the version information for installed and available
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version nogroups |
nogroups-*&quot; - Just show the main version
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version group-*&quot; -
Just show the grouped version information, if more arguments
are given then only show the data for those groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history <br>
The history command allows the user to view what has
happened in past transactions (assuming the history_record
config. option is set). You can use info/list/packages- <br>
list/packages-info/summary to view what happened,
undo/redo/rollback to act on that information and new to
start a new history file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The info/list/summary commands
take either a transaction id or a package (with wildcards,
as in Specifying package names), all three can also be
passed no arguments. list <br>
can be passed the keyword &quot;all&quot; to list all the
transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The info command can also take
ranges of transaction ids, of the form start..end, which
will then display a merged history as if all the
transactions in the range had hap&acirc; <br>
pened at once. <br>
Eg. &quot;history info 1..4&quot; will merge the first four
transactions and display them as a single transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packages-list/packages-info
commands takes a package (with wildcards, as in Specifying
package names). And show data from the point of view of that
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The undo/redo/rollback commands
take either a single transaction id or the keyword last and
an offset from the last transaction (Eg. if you&rsquo;ve
done 250 transactions, <br>
&quot;last&quot; refers to transaction 250, and
&quot;last-4&quot; refers to transaction 246). The redo
command can also take some optional arguments before you
specify the transaction. <br>
&quot;force-reinstall&quot; tells it reinstall any packages
that were installed in that transaction (via install,
upgrade or downgrade). &quot;force-remove&quot; tells it to
forcibly remove <br>
any packages that were updated or downgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The undo/redo commands act on
the specified transaction, undo&rsquo;ing or repeating the
work of that transaction. While the rollback command will
undo all transactions up to <br>
the point of the specified transaction. For example, if you
have 3 transactions, where package A; B and C where
installed respectively. Then &quot;undo 1&quot; will try to
remove <br>
package A, &quot;redo 1&quot; will try to install package A
(if it is not still installed), and &quot;rollback 1&quot;
will try to remove packages B and C. Note that after a
&quot;rollback 1&quot; you <br>
will have a fourth transaction, although the ending rpmdb
version (see: yum version) should be the same in
transactions 1 and 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The addon-info command takes a
transaction ID, and the packages-list command takes a
package (with wildcards).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stats command shows some
statistics about the current history DB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sync commands allows you to
change the rpmdb/yumdb data stored for any installed
packages, to whatever is in the current rpmdb/yumdb (this is
mostly useful when this <br>
data was not stored when the package went into the history
DB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &quot;history list&quot; you
can change the behaviour of the 2nd column via the
configuration option history_list_view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &quot;history list&quot;
output the Altered column also gives some extra information
if there was something not good with the transaction (this
is also shown at the end of the <br>
package column in the packages-list command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; - The rpmdb was changed,
outside yum, after the transaction. <br>
&lt; - The rpmdb was changed, outside yum, before the
transaction. <br>
* - The transaction aborted before completion. <br>
# - The transaction completed, but with a non-zero status.
<br>
E - The transaction completed fine, but had warning/error
output during the transaction. <br>
P - The transaction completed fine, but problems already
existed in the rpmdb. <br>
s - The transaction completed fine, but --skip-broken was
enabled and had to skip some packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-transaction <br>
This command will re-load a saved yum transaction file, this
allows you to run a transaction on one machine and then use
it on another. The two common ways to get a saved <br>
yum transaction file are from &quot;yum -q history
addon-info last saved_tx&quot; or via the automatic saves in
$TMPDIR/yum_save_tx.* when a transaction is solved but not
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the command without an
argument, or a directory as an argument will try and list
the possible files available to load. Showing if the
packages are still available, <br>
if the rpmdb matches the current rpmdb, how many transaction
install/removes members are in the saved transaction and
what the filename is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">updateinfo <br>
This command has a bunch of sub-commands to act on the
updateinfo in the repositories. The simplest commands
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo info [all |
available | installed | updates] <br>
yum updateinfo list [all | available | installed | updates]
<br>
yum updateinfo [summary] [all | available | installed |
updates]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which all display information
about the available update information relevant to your
machine (including anything installed, if you supply
&quot;all&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* updates Is used to display
information about advisories for packages that can be
updated. This is the default. <br>
* installed Is used to display information only about
installed advisories. <br>
* available Is used to display information about advisories
for packages available for updating or installation. <br>
* all Is used to display information about both installed
and available advisories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They all take as arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* &lt;advisory&gt; [advisory...]
Is used to display information about one or more
advisories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* &lt;package&gt; [package...]
Is used to display information about one or more
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* bugzillas / bzs Is the subset
of the updateinfo information, pertaining to the
bugzillas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* cves Is the subset of the
updateinfo information, pertaining to the CVEs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* enhancement Is the subset of
the updateinfo information, pertaining to enhancements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* bugfix Is the subset of the
updateinfo information, pertaining to bugfixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* security / sec Is the subset
of the updateinfo information, pertaining to security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* severity / sev Include
security relevant packages of this severity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* recommended Is the subset of
the updateinfo information, pertaining to recommended
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* new-packages Is the subset of
the updateinfo information, pertaining to new packages.
These are packages which weren&rsquo;t available at the
initial release of your distri&acirc; <br>
bution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also three
sub-commands to remove packages when using &quot;yum
shell&quot;, they are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
remove-pkgs-ts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
exclude-updates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo exclude-all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">they all take the following
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* [bzs=foo] [advisories=foo]
[cves=foo] [security-severity=foo] [security] [bugfix]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and finally there is a command
to manually check the running kernel against updateinfo
data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo
check-running-kernel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fssnapshot or fssnap <br>
This command has a few sub-commands to act on the LVM data
of the host, to list snapshots and to create and remove
them. The simplest commands, to display information <br>
about the configured LVM snapshotable devices, are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fssnapshot [summary] <br>
yum fssnapshot list <br>
yum fssnapshot have-space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then you can create and delete
snapshots using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fssnapshot create <br>
yum fssnapshot delete &lt;device(s)&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration Options:
fssnap_automatic_pre, fssnap_automatic_post,
fssnap_automatic_keep, fssnap_percentage, fssnap_devices,
fssnap_abort_on_errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fs This command has a few
sub-commands to act on the filesystem data of the host,
mainly for removing languages/documentation for minimal
installs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs filters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs filter languages
en:es</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs filter documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs refilter [package(s)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs refilter-cleanup
[package(s)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs du [path]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs status [path]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum fs diff [path]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the first 3 being a simple
interface to change yum.conf altering the tsflags and
override_install_langs configurations. The refilter command
is an optimized way of calling <br>
&quot;yum reinstall&quot; to reinstall the packages with the
new filters applied. The refilter-cleanup command is needed
because rpm doesn&rsquo;t actually remove the files on
reinstall, <br>
as it should. And the du/status/diff commands are included
so you can easily see the space used/saved and any other
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check Checks the local rpmdb and
produces information on any problems it finds. You can pass
the check command the arguments &quot;dependencies&quot;,
&quot;duplicates&quot;, &quot;obsoletes&quot; or
&quot;pro&acirc; <br>
vides&quot;, to limit the checking that is performed (the
default is &quot;all&quot; which does all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Produces help, either for
all commands or if given a command name then the help for
that particular command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
Most command line options can be set using the configuration
file as well and the descriptions indicate the necessary
configuration option to set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Help; display a help message and then quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --assumeyes <br>
Assume yes; assume that the answer to any question which
would be asked is yes. <br>
Configuration Option: assumeyes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--assumeno <br>
Assume no; assume that the answer to any question which
would be asked is no. This option overrides assumeyes, but
is still subject to alwaysprompt. <br>
Configuration Option: assumeno</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config=[config file] <br>
Specifies the config file location - can take HTTP and FTP
URLs and local file paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Run without output. Note that you likely also want to use
-y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Run with a lot of debugging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debuglevel=[number] <br>
Sets the debugging level to [number] - turns up or down the
amount of things that are printed. Practical range: 0 - 10
<br>
Configuration Option: debuglevel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --errorlevel=[number] <br>
Sets the error level to [number] Practical range 0 - 10. 0
means print only critical errors about which you must be
told. 1 means print all errors, even ones that are not <br>
overly important. 1+ means print more errors (if any) -e 0
is good for cron jobs. <br>
Configuration Option: errorlevel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rpmverbosity=[name] <br>
Sets the debug level to [name] for rpm scriptlets.
&rsquo;info&rsquo; is the default, other options are:
&rsquo;critical&rsquo;, &rsquo;emergency&rsquo;,
&rsquo;error&rsquo;, &rsquo;warn&rsquo; and
&rsquo;debug&rsquo;. <br>
Configuration Option: rpmverbosity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --randomwait=[time in
minutes] <br>
Sets the maximum amount of time yum will wait before
performing a command - it randomizes over the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --cacheonly <br>
Tells yum to run entirely from system cache - does not
download or update any headers unless it has to to perform
the requested action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Reports the yum version number and installed package
versions for everything in history_record_packages (can be
added to by plugins).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showduplicates <br>
Doesn&rsquo;t limit packages to their latest versions in the
info, list and search commands (will also affect plugins
which use the doPackageLists() API).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--installroot=root <br>
Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to which all
packages will be installed. Think of this like doing
&quot;chroot &lt;root&gt; yum&quot; except using
--installroot allows yum <br>
to work before the chroot is created. Note: You may also
want to use the option --releasever=/ when creating the
installroot as otherwise the $releasever value is taken <br>
from the rpmdb within the installroot (and thus. will be
empty, before creation). <br>
Configuration Option: installroot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enablerepo=repoidglob <br>
Enables specific repositories by id or glob that have been
disabled in the configuration file using the enabled=0
option. <br>
Configuration Option: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disablerepo=repoidglob <br>
Disables specific repositories by id or glob. <br>
Configuration Option: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--obsoletes <br>
This option only has affect for an update, it enables
yum&Acirc;&acute;s obsoletes processing logic. For more
information see the update command above. <br>
Configuration Option: obsoletes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exclude=package <br>
Exclude a specific package by name or glob from all
repositories, so yum works as if that package was never in
the repositories. This is commonly used so a package
isn&rsquo;t <br>
upgraded or installed accidentally, but can be used to
remove packages in any way that &quot;yum list&quot; will
show packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can be disabled using
--disableexcludes. Configuration Option: exclude,
includepkgs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color=[always|auto|never] <br>
Display colorized output automatically, depending on the
output terminal, always (using ANSI codes) or never. Note
that some commands (Eg. list and info) will do a little <br>
extra work when color is enabled. Configuration Option:
color</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disableexcludes=[all|main|repoid]
<br>
Disable the excludes defined in your config files. Takes one
of three options: <br>
all == disable all excludes <br>
main == disable excludes defined in [main] in yum.conf <br>
repoid == disable excludes defined for that repo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disableincludes=[all|repoid]
<br>
Disable the includes defined in your config files. Takes one
of two options: <br>
all == disable all includes <br>
repoid == disable includes defined for that repo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disableplugin=plugin <br>
Run with one or more plugins disabled, the argument is a
comma separated list of wildcards to match against plugin
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noplugins <br>
Run with all plugins disabled. <br>
Configuration Option: plugins</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nogpgcheck <br>
Run with GPG signature checking disabled. <br>
Configuration Option: gpgcheck</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-broken <br>
Resolve depsolve problems by removing packages that are
causing problems from the transaction. <br>
Configuration Option: skip_broken</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--releasever=version <br>
Pretend the current release version is the given string.
This is very useful when combined with --installroot. You
can also use --releasever=/ to take the releasever <br>
information from outside the installroot. Note that with the
default upstream cachedir, of /var/cache/yum, using this
option will corrupt your cache (and you can use <br>
$releasever in your cachedir configuration to stop
this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tolerant <br>
This option makes yum go slower, checking for things that
shouldn&rsquo;t be possible making it more tolerant of
external errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--downloadonly <br>
Don&rsquo;t update, just download. This is done in the
background, so the yum lock is released for other
operations. This can also be chosen by typing
&rsquo;d&rsquo;ownloadonly at the <br>
transaction confirmation prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--downloaddir=directory <br>
Specifies an alternate directory to store packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--setopt=option=value <br>
Set any config option in yum config or repo files. For
options in the global config just use: --setopt=option=value
for repo options use: --setopt=repoid.option=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security <br>
This option includes packages that say they fix a security
issue, in updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--advisory=ADVS,
--advisories=ADVS <br>
This option includes in updates packages corresponding to
the advisory ID, Eg. FEDORA-2201-123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bz=BZS <br>
This option includes in updates packages that say they fix a
Bugzilla ID, Eg. 123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cve=CVES <br>
This option includes in updates packages that say they fix a
CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID
(http://cve.mitre.org/about/), Eg. CVE-2201-0123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bugfix <br>
This option includes in updates packages that say they fix a
bugfix issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sec-severity=SEVS,
--secseverity=SEVS <br>
This option includes in updates security relevant packages
of the specified severity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST OPTIONS <br>
The following are the ways which you can invoke yum in list
mode. Note that all list commands include information on the
version of the package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the output of yum
list is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name.arch
[epoch:]version-release repo or @installed-from-repo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the repo cannot be
determined, &quot;installed&quot; is printed instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list [all | glob_exp1]
[glob_exp2] [...] <br>
List all available and installed packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list available [glob_exp1]
[...] <br>
List all packages in the yum repositories available to be
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list updates [glob_exp1]
[...] <br>
List all packages with updates available in the yum
repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list installed [glob_exp1]
[...] <br>
List the packages specified by args. If an argument does not
match the name of an available package, it is assumed to be
a shell-style glob and any matches are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list extras [glob_exp1]
[...] <br>
List the packages installed on the system that are not
available in any yum repository listed in the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list distro-extras
[glob_exp1] [...] <br>
List the packages installed on the system that are not
available, by name, in any yum repository listed in the
config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list obsoletes [glob_exp1]
[...] <br>
List the packages installed on the system that are obsoleted
by packages in any yum repository listed in the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum list recent <br>
List packages recently added into the repositories. This is
often not helpful, but what you may really want to use is
&quot;yum list-updateinfo new&quot; from the security yum
plug&acirc; <br>
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFYING PACKAGE NAMES <br>
A package can be referred to for install, update, remove,
list, info etc with any of the following as well as globs of
any of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name <br>
name.arch <br>
name-ver <br>
name-ver-rel <br>
name-ver-rel.arch <br>
name-epoch:ver-rel.arch <br>
epoch:name-ver-rel.arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: yum remove
kernel-2.4.1-10.i686 <br>
this will remove this specific kernel-ver-rel.arch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or: yum list available
&rsquo;foo*&rsquo; <br>
will list all available packages that match
&rsquo;foo*&rsquo;. (The single quotes will keep your shell
from expanding the globs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLEAN OPTIONS <br>
The following are the ways which you can invoke yum in clean
mode. Note that &quot;all files&quot; in the commands below
means &quot;all files in currently enabled
repositories&quot;. If you want <br>
to also clean any (temporarily) disabled repositories you
need to use --enablerepo=&rsquo;*&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean expire-cache <br>
Eliminate the local data saying when the metadata and
mirrorlists were downloaded for each repo. This means yum
will revalidate the cache for each repo. next time it is
<br>
used. However if the cache is still valid, nothing
significant was deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean packages <br>
Eliminate any cached packages from the system. Note that
packages are not automatically deleted after they are
downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean headers <br>
Eliminate all of the header files, which old versions of yum
used for dependency resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean metadata <br>
Eliminate all of the files which yum uses to determine the
remote availability of packages. Using this option will
force yum to download all the metadata the next time it <br>
is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean dbcache <br>
Eliminate the sqlite cache used for faster access to
metadata. Using this option will force yum to download the
sqlite metadata the next time it is run, or recreate the
<br>
sqlite metadata if using an older repo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean rpmdb <br>
Eliminate any cached data from the local rpmdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean plugins <br>
Tell any enabled plugins to eliminate their cached data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum clean all <br>
Does all of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To list all updates that are security relevant, and get a
return code on whether there are security updates use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum --security check-update</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To upgrade packages that have
security errata (upgrades to the latest available package)
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum --security update</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To upgrade packages that have
security errata (upgrades to the last security errata
package) use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Red Hat advisories, respin
suffixes are also accepted in the ID, although they
won&rsquo;t have any effect on the actual respin selected by
yum, as it will always select the latest <br>
one available. For example, if you use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yum updateinfo info
RHSA-2016:1234-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while RHSA-2016:1234-3 has been
shipped already, yum will select the latter (provided your
updateinfo.xml is current). The same would happen if you
just specified <br>
RHSA-2016:1234. That said, there&rsquo;s no need for you to
specify or care about the suffix at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLUGINS <br>
Yum can be extended through the use of plugins. A plugin is
a Python &quot;.py&quot; file which is installed in one of
the directories specified by the pluginpath option in
yum.conf. For a <br>
plugin to work, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The plugin module file must
be installed in the plugin path as just described.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The global plugins option in
/etc/yum.conf must be set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A configuration file for the
plugin must exist in
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/&lt;plugin_name&gt;.conf and the
enabled setting in this file must set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;.
The minimal content for such a <br>
configuration file is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[main] <br>
enabled = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the yum.conf(5) man page for
more information on plugin related configuration
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/yum.conf <br>
/etc/yum/version-groups.conf <br>
/etc/yum.repos.d/ <br>
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/ <br>
