<p>PTP4l(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual PTP4l(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ptp4l - PTP Boundary/Ordinary Clock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ptp4l [ -AEP246HSLmqsv ] [ -f config ] [ -p phc-device ] [
-l print-level ] [ -i interface ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ptp4l is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol
(PTP) according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. It
implements Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A Select the delay mechanism automatically. Start with E2E
and switch to P2P when a peer delay request is received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Select the delay
request-response (E2E) mechanism. This is the default
mechanism. All clocks on single PTP communication path must
use the same mechanism. A warning will <br>
be printed when a peer delay request is received on port
using the E2E mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Select the peer delay (P2P)
mechanism. A warning will be printed when a delay request is
received on port using the P2P mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Select the IEEE 802.3 network
transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Select the UDP IPv4 network
transport. This is the default transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Select the UDP IPv6 network
transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Select the hardware time
stamping. All ports specified by the -i option and in the
configuration file must be attached to the same PTP hardware
clock (PHC). This is the <br>
default time stamping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Select the software time
stamping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Select the legacy hardware
time stamping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config <br>
Read configuration from the specified file. No configuration
file is read by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface <br>
Specify a PTP port, it may be used multiple times. At least
one port must be specified by this option or in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p phc-device <br>
With hardware time stamping, force which PHC device (e.g.
/dev/ptp0) should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Enable the slaveOnly
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l print-level <br>
Set the maximum syslog level of messages which should be
printed or sent to the system logger. The default is 6
(LOG_INFO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Print messages to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Don&rsquo;t send messages to
the system logger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints the software version
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file is divided into sections. Each
section starts with a line containing its name enclosed in
brackets and it follows with settings. Each setting is
placed on <br>
a separate line, it contains the name of the option and the
value separated by whitespace characters. Empty lines and
lines starting with # are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The global section (indicated as
[global]) sets the program options, clock options and
default port options. Other sections are port specific
sections and they override the <br>
default port options. The name of the section is the name of
the configured port (e.g. [eth0]). Ports specified in the
configuration file don&rsquo;t need to be specified by the
-i <br>
option. An empty port section can be used to replace the
command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORT OPTIONS <br>
delayAsymmetry <br>
The time difference in nanoseconds of the transmit and
receive paths. This value should be positive when the
master-to-slave propagation time is longer and negative when
<br>
the slave-to-master time is longer. The default is 0
nanoseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logAnnounceInterval <br>
The mean time interval between Announce messages. A shorter
interval makes ptp4l react faster to the changes in the
master-slave hierarchy. The interval should be the same <br>
in the whole domain. It&rsquo;s specified as a power of two
in seconds. The default is 1 (2 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logSyncInterval <br>
The mean time interval between Sync messages. A shorter
interval may improve accuracy of the local clock. It&rsquo;s
specified as a power of two in seconds. The default is 0 (1
<br>
second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logMinDelayReqInterval <br>
The minimum permitted mean time interval between Delay_Req
messages. A shorter interval makes ptp4l react faster to the
changes in the path delay. It&rsquo;s specified as a <br>
power of two in seconds. The default is 0 (1 second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logMinPdelayReqInterval <br>

Announce messages expires. The default is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syncReceiptTimeout <br>
The number of sync/follow up messages that may go missing
before triggering a Best Master Clock election. This option
is used for running in gPTP mode according to the <br>
802.1AS-2011 standard. Setting this option to zero will
disable the sync message timeout. The default is 0 or
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transportSpecific <br>

enabled. The default is 0 (disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fault_reset_interval <br>
The time in seconds between the detection of a port&rsquo;s
fault and the fault being reset. This value is expressed as
a power of two. Setting this value to -128 or to the
spe&acirc; <br>
cial key word &quot;ASAP&quot; will let the fault be reset
immediately. The default is 4 (16 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fault_badpeernet_interval <br>
The time in seconds between the detection of a peer network
misconfiguration and the fault being reset. The port is
disabled for the duration of the interval. The value is <br>
in seconds and the special key word ASAP will let the fault
be reset immediately. The default is 16 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delay_mechanism <br>

Select the network transport. Possible values are UDPv4,
UDPv6 and L2. The default is UDPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">neighborPropDelayThresh <br>
Upper limit for peer delay in nanoseconds. If the estimated
peer delay is greater than this value the port is marked as
not 802.1AS capable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min_neighbor_prop_delay <br>

used only with hardware time stamping. The default is 1
(enabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slaveOnly <br>
The local clock is a slave-only clock if enabled. This
option is only for use with 1588 clocks and should not be
enabled for 802.1AS clocks. The default is 0 (disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmCapable <br>
If this option is enabled, then the local clock is able to
become grand master. This is only for use with 802.1AS
clocks and has no effect on 1588 clocks. The default is <br>
1 (enabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">priority1 <br>
The priority1 attribute of the local clock. It is used in
the best master selection algorithm, lower values take
precedence. Must be in the range 0 to 255. The default is
<br>
128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">priority2 <br>

precedence. Must be in the range 0 to 255. The default is
<br>
128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clockClass <br>
The clockClass attribute of the local clock. It denotes the
traceability of the time distributed by the grandmaster
clock. The default is 248.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clockAccuracy <br>

local and peer clock frequencies. It is specified as a power
of two in seconds. The default is 1 (2 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assume_two_step <br>
Treat one-step responses as two-step if enabled. It is used
to work around buggy 802.1AS switches. The default is 0
(disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tx_timestamp_timeout <br>
The number of milliseconds to poll waiting for the tx time
stamp from the kernel when a message has recently been sent.
The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check_fup_sync <br>
Because of packet reordering that can occur in the network,
in the hardware, or in the networking stack, a follow up
message can appear to arrive in the application before <br>
the matching sync message. As this is a normal occurrence,
and the sequenceID message field ensures proper matching,
the ptp4l program accepts out of order packets. This <br>
option adds an additional check using the software time
stamps from the networking stack to verify that the sync
message did arrive first. This option is only useful if <br>
you do not trust the sequence IDs generated by the master.
The default is 0 (disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clock_servo <br>
The servo which is used to synchronize the local clock.
Valid values are pi for a PI controller, linreg for an
adaptive controller using linear regression, and ntpshm for
<br>
the NTP SHM reference clock to allow another process to
synchronize the local clock (the SHM segment number is set
to the domain number). The default is pi.</p>

The integral constant of the PI controller. When set to 0.0,
the integral constant will be set by the following formula
from the current sync interval. The default is <br>
0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ki = min(ki_scale *
sync^ki_exponent, ki_norm_max / sync)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pi_proportional_scale <br>
The kp_scale constant in the formula used to set the
proportional constant of the PI controller from the sync
interval. When set to 0.0, the value will be selected from
<br>
0.7 and 0.1 for the hardware and software time stamping
respectively. The default is 0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pi_proportional_exponent <br>
The kp_exponent constant in the formula used to set the
proportional constant of the PI controller from the sync
interval. The default is -0.3.</p>

integral constant of the PI controller from the sync
interval. The default is 0.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">step_threshold <br>
The maximum offset the servo will correct by changing the
clock frequency instead of stepping the clock. When set to
0.0, the servo will never step the clock except on <br>
start. It&rsquo;s specified in seconds. The default is 0.0.
This option used to be called pi_offset_const.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first_step_threshold <br>
The maximum offset the servo will correct by changing the
clock frequency instead of stepping the clock. This is only
applied on the first update. It&rsquo;s specified in
sec&acirc; <br>
onds. When set to 0.0, the servo won&rsquo;t step the clock
on start. The default is 0.00002 (20 microseconds). This
option used to be called pi_f_offset_const.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_frequency <br>

clock and the system monotonic clock in parts per billion
(ppb). This is used as a sanity check of the synchro&acirc;
<br>
nized clock. When a larger offset is measured, a warning
message will be printed and the servo will be reset. When
set to 0, the sanity check is disabled. The default is <br>
200000000 (20%).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntpshm_segment <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">udp6_scope <br>
Specifies the desired scope for the IPv6 multicast messages.
This will be used as the second byte of the primary address.
This option is only relevant with IPv6 trans&acirc; <br>
port. See RFC 4291. The default is 0x0E for the global
scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uds_address <br>
Specifies the address of the UNIX domain socket for
receiving local management messages. The default is
/var/run/ptp4l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logging_level <br>
The maximum logging level of messages which should be
printed. The default is 6 (LOG_INFO).</p>

Print messages to the standard output if enabled. The
default is 0 (disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_syslog <br>
Print messages to the system log if enabled. The default is
1 (enabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summary_interval <br>
The time interval in which are printed summary statistics of
the clock. It is specified as a power of two in seconds. The
statistics include offset root mean square (RMS), <br>
maximum absolute offset, frequency offset mean and standard
deviation, and path delay mean and standard deviation. The
units are nanoseconds and parts per billion (ppb). <br>
If there is only one clock update in the interval, the
sample will be printed instead of the statistics. The
messages are printed at the LOG_INFO level. The default is 0
<br>
(1 second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_stamping <br>
The time stamping method. The allowed values are hardware,
software and legacy. The default is hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">productDescription <br>
The product description string. Allowed values must be of
the form manufacturerName;modelNumber;instanceIdentifier and
contain at most 64 utf8 symbols. The default is <br>
&quot;;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revisionData <br>
The revision description string which contains the revisions
for node hardware (HW), firmware (FW), and software (SW).
Allowed values are of the form HW;FW;SW and contain <br>
at most 32 utf8 symbols. The default is an
&quot;;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userDescription <br>
The user description string. Allowed values are of the form
name;location and contain at most 128 utf8 symbols. The
default is an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manufacturerIdentity <br>

manufacturer. The default is 00:00:00.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_leap <br>
When a leap second is announced, let the kernel apply it by
stepping the clock instead of correcting the one-second
offset with servo, which would correct the one-second <br>
offset slowly by changing the clock frequency (unless the
step_threshold option is set to correct such offset by
stepping). Relevant only with software time stamping. The
<br>
default is 1 (enabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeSource <br>
The time source is a single byte code that gives an idea of
the kind of local clock in use. The value is purely
informational, having no effect on the outcome of the Best
<br>
Master Clock algorithm, and is advertised when the clock
becomes grand master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME SCALE USAGE <br>
ptp4l as domain master either uses PTP or UTC time scale
depending on time stamping mode. In software and legacy time
stamping modes it announces Arbitrary time scale mode, <br>
which is effectively UTC here, in hardware time stamping
mode it announces use of PTP time scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ptp4l is the domain master
using hardware time stamping, it is up to phc2sys to
maintain the correct offset between UTC and PTP times. See
phc2sys(8) manual page for more <br>
details.</p>
