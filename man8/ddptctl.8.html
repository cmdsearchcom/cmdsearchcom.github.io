<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility is a helper/auxiliary for the ddpt utility
which copies data between or within SCSI devices (logical
units). While ddpt&rsquo;s command line syntax is modelled
on that of <br>
the POSIX dd command, this utility has a more standard Unix
command line syntax with both short and long variants of
each option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The T10 committee defines a
family of SCSI commands for offloaded copy. The central (but
not the only) command is EXTENDED COPY often shortened to
XCOPY or xcopy. There are now <br>
two generations of xcopy, the older one is given the suffix
&quot;LID1&quot; and the newer one: &quot;LID4&quot;. There
is a subset of XCOPY(LID4) that supports disk to disk copies
and is based on <br>
the SBC-3 commands: POPULATE TOKEN (PT) and WRITE USING
TOKEN (WUT). ODX is a market name that has become associated
with this subset. This utility can issue PT, WUT and related
<br>
commands, read the Third Party Copy VPD page and perform
several other housekeeping tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xcopy family of commands are
described in the SPC-4 and SBC-3 documents found at
http://www.t10.org .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --abort <br>
this option will issue the COPY OPERATION ABORT command with
the LID given in the --list_id=LID option. If the
--list_id=LID option is not given then its default LID (257)
<br>
is used. If there is an xcopy operation ongoing on this I-T
nexus (i.e. issued by this machine to any LU sharing the
same target) using that LID then the copy is aborted. <br>
Note there is a sense key (COPY ABORTED) indicating some but
not all data has been copied due to this action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all_toks <br>
send the REPORT ALL ROD TOKENS SCSI command to DEVICE and
decode the response. An ODX implementation is not required
to support this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --block <br>
treat DEVICE as a block device when checking its --size. The
default action of this utility is to treat DEVICE as a SCSI
pass-through device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --del_tkn <br>
set the DEL_TKN bit in a WUT command (default: clear the
DEL_TKN bit). Since an ODX copy manager deletes the ROD
Token after is has been fully copied from (once), this <br>
option is typically not needed. It may be useful for
long-lived ROD Tokens that have only been partially written
from (or not used at all) and are no longer needed. <br>
To delete an unused ROD Token a degenerate scatter list
seems to be acceptable (e.g. &rsquo;--wut=0,0
--del_tkn&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
outputs the usage message summarizing command line options
then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --immed <br>
set the IMMED bit in the PT or WUT command. When given the
PT and WUT commands return promptly before the data transfer
is complete; then this utility exits. The user <br>
should then invoke the utility again with the --poll option
and the same LID and DEVICE to await completion and receive
the final transfer count. The default action of PT <br>
and WUT (i.e. without this option) is to wait for completion
(i.e. all data transferred or an error occurs) before
exiting this utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
when the DEVICE argument is given then check its Third Party
Copy VPD page and print out anything found. Also check if
the 3PC bit is set in the standard INQUIRY response. <br>
If the DEVICE argument is not given and the --rtf=RTF option
is given then decode part of the ROD Token held in the --RTF
file. SPC-4 defines some parts of a ROD Token <br>
that can be decoded but does not require the copy manager to
set these fields; so many fields may appear as zeros. A
--RTF file that has been generated by the ddpt utility <br>
may contain multiple ROD Tokens, each optionally followed by
an 8 byte &quot;number of bytes represented&quot; integer.
They are all decoded, based on --RTF file length which
should <br>
either be a multiple of 512 or 520 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list_id=LID <br>
LID is a list identifier which is used to associate an
originating xcopy command (e.g. PT or WUT) with a follow-up
command that retrieves information or aborts the
opera&acirc; <br>
tion. T10 requires active LIDs to be unique on a given I-T
nexus. An I-T nexus is the current machine (more precisely a
HBA if a machine has two or more) and a specific <br>
target which will contain one or more logical units (LUs) of
which DEVICE is one. If the DEVICE&rsquo;s copy manager
feels that rather complex condition has not been met then
<br>
an error is generated with sense data that decodes to
&quot;operation in progress&quot;. Rather than try to work
out who is doing what elsewhere, try another LID value. <br>
The default value for LID is 257.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --oir=OIR <br>
OIR is the Offset In ROD, a field in the WUT command. It may
be be used together with the --wut=SL option. Its default
value is 0 and its units are the logical block size <br>
of DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --poll <br>
send RECEIVE ROD TOKEN INFORMATION SCSI commands (RRTIs) to
the DEVICE using the LID (i.e. from the --list_id=LID
option). If a copy status is received indicating the <br>
operation is ongoing, then this SCSI command is sent
periodically (as suggested by the previous RRTI command or
500 milliseconds) until some other copy status is detected.
<br>
If the --list_id=LID option is not given then a LID of 257
is assumed. <br>
If the originating xcopy command was POPULATE TOKEN and the
RRTI command indicates that it has completed successfully
then the associated ROD Token (returned in the RRTI <br>
response) is written to the RTF file. If the --rtf=RTF
option is not given then the ROD token is written to a file
called ddptctl_rod_tok.bin in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pt=GL <br>
send a POPULATE TOKEN (PT) command with the given gather
list. The format of GL is given in the NOTES section. If
used without the --immed option then this utility, after
<br>
the PT command finishes successfully, will call the RRTI
command. When the RRTI command finishes, potentially with a
new ROD Token, this utility will exit. Prior to that <br>
exit, if a new ROD Token is available and the --rtf=RTF
option is given then that ROD Token is written to the RTF
file. If the --rtf=RTF option is not given then the ROD <br>
token is written to a file called ddptctl_rod_tok.bin in the
current directory. <br>
If the --immed option is given this utility will exit after
the PT command finishes. To complete the operation this
utility should be invoked again with the --poll option <br>
and the same DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --receive <br>
send the RECEIVE ROD TOKEN INFORMATION SCSI command (RRTI)
to the DEVICE using the LID (i.e. from the --list_id=LID
option). If the --list_id=LID option is not given then <br>
a LID of 257 is assumed. <br>
If the originating xcopy command was POPULATE TOKEN and the
RRTI command indicates that it has completed successfully
then the associated ROD Token (returned in the RRTI <br>
response) is written to the RTF file. If the --rtf=RTF
option is not given then the ROD token is written to a file
called ddptctl_rod_tok.bin in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rtf=RTF <br>
when RTF is a file containing an ODX ROD Token or the name
of a file the ROD Token is to be written to. A ROD Token
used by ODX is 512 bytes long. If the RTF file was
pro&acirc; <br>
duced by the ddpt utility then it might contain multiple ROD
Tokens, each optionally followed by an 8 byte integer
containing the &quot;number of bytes represented&quot; by
the pre&acirc; <br>
ceding ROD Token. <br>
If an RTF file with multiple ROD Tokens is given to this
utility with --wut=SL then only the first ROD Token is used.
If an RTF file is being decoded (i.e. no DEVICE argu&acirc;
<br>
ment given) then all ROD Tokens are decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --rtype=RTYPE <br>
where RTYPE is the ROD Type, a field in the PT command
(apart from &quot;zero&quot;). The default value (0)
indicates that the copy manager (in the DEVICE) decides.
RTYPE can be a <br>
decimal number, a hex number (prefixed by 0x or with a
&quot;h&quot; appended) or one of &quot;pit-def&quot;,
&quot;pit-vuln&quot;, &quot;pit-pers&quot;,
&quot;pit-any&quot; or &quot;zero&quot;. The final truncated
word can be <br>
spelt out (e.g. &quot;pit-vulnerable&quot;). The
&quot;pit-&quot; lead-in stands for &quot;point in
time&quot; copy. <br>
The &quot;zero&quot; is a special case and is not given to a
PT command. Instead it causes a special Block Device Zero
Token to be created that can be used with the --wut=SL
option <br>
to write blocks of zeros to the given DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --size <br>
prints the number of blocks and the size of each block for
the given DEVICE. Protection information is printed if
available. By default uses the pass-through interface and
<br>
the READ CAPACITY command to obtain this information. If the
--block option is given then the block layer in the OS is
query for size information (and protection informa&acirc;
<br>
tion is not reported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --timeout=ITO[,CMD] <br>
where ITO is the inactivity timeout (units: seconds) given
to the PT command. The default is 0 in which case the copy
manager uses its own default which is shown in the <br>
Third party Copy VPD page. <br>
CMD is the SCSI command timeout (units: seconds) applied to
SCSI commands issued by this utility; default is 0 which is
translated to 600 seconds for originating xcopy <br>
commands (e.g. PT and WUT) and 60 seconds for other
commands. Best not to trigger command timeouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wut=SL <br>
send a WRITE USING TOKEN (WUT) command with the given
scatter list. The format of SL is given in the NOTES
section. This option requires the --rtf=RTF option to supply
the <br>
ROD Token. If used without the --immed option then after the
WUT command finishes successfully this utility will call the
RRTI command. When the RRTI command finishes this <br>
utility will exit. <br>
If the --immed option is given this utility will exit after
the WUT command finishes. To complete the operation this
utility should be invoked again with the --poll option <br>
and the same DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The scatter gather list given to the --pt=GL and --wut=SL
options in the simplest case contains a pair a numbers,
separated by a comma. The first number is the starting LBA
and <br>
the second number is the number of blocks (no bigger than 32
bits) to read to or write from that starting LBA. Another
pair of numbers can appear after that forming the second
<br>
element of a scatter gather list. Starting LBAs can be in
any order but T10 prohibits any logical block appearing more
than once in a scatter gather list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scatter gather lists can be
placed in a file or read from stdin. A file name referring
to a file containing a scatter gather list must follow the
&quot;@&quot; character (e.g. <br>
--pt=@my_sgl.txt&quot;). Reading a list from stdin is
indicated by &quot;@-&quot; or &quot;-&quot; (e.g.
&quot;--pt=-&quot;). Scatter gather lists in a file have a
looser format and can take spaces and tabs as <br>
well as a comma as separators. Anything from and including a
&quot;#&quot; on a line is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the PT and WUT commands are
issued &quot;as is&quot; without checking the Third Party
Copy VPD page. The copy manager may well reject these
commands (with exit status 51: invalid <br>
field in parameter list) if the maximum range descriptors
field or the maximum token transfer size field are
exceeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a web page discussing
ddptctl and ddpt, XCOPY and ODX at
http://sg.danny.cz/sg/ddpt_xcopy_odx.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of ddptctl is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise the exit status for this utility is the same as
that for ddpt. See the EXIT STATUS section in the ddpt man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
First issue a PT command without the --immed option so RRTI
is called to complete the operation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddptctl --pt=0x0,10k,20k,5k
--rtf=aa.rt /dev/sdb <br>
PT completes with a transfer count of 15360 [0x3c00]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transfer count (10k + 5k ==
15360) indicates the operation was successful and the ROD
Token is in the aa.rt file. Now use that ROD Token to write
to the same locations on <br>
/dev/sdc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddptctl --rtf=aa.rt
--wut=0x0,10k,20k,5k /dev/sdc <br>
WUT completes with a transfer count of 15360 [0x3c00]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So the copy was successful. Now
taking a closer look at the ROD token:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddptctl --info --rtf=aa.rt
<br>
Decoding information from ROD Token: <br>
ROD type: point in time copy - default [0x800000] <br>
Copy manager ROD Token identifier: 0x520000710000000c <br>
Creator Logical Unit descriptor: <br>
Peripheral Device type: 0x0 <br>
Relative initiator port identifier: 0x0 <br>
designator_type: NAA, code_set: Binary <br>
associated with the addressed logical unit <br>
0x60002ac0000000000000000c00009502 <br>
Number of bytes represented: 0 [0x0] <br>
Device type specific data (for disk) has block size of 0;
unlikely so skip <br>
Target device descriptor: unexpected designator type
[0x0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T10 does not require
implementations to supply much of the above (only the ROD
type and the token length) so expect to see some empty
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see information about
/dev/sdb relevant to ODX, try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddptctl --info /dev/sdb <br>
/dev/sdb [readcap]: num_blks=209715200 [0xc800000],
blk_size=512, 107 GB <br>
3PC (third party copy) bit set in standard INQUIRY response
<br>
Third Party Copy VPD page: <br>
Block Device ROD Token Limits: <br>
Maximum Range Descriptors: 8 <br>
Maximum Inactivity Timeout: 60 seconds <br>
Default Inactivity Timeout: 30 seconds <br>
Maximum Token Transfer Size: 524288 <br>
Optimal Transfer Count: 524288</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That maximum token transfer size
[524288 blocks each 512 bytes gives 256 MB] is the largest
size a ROD Token created by /dev/sdb can hold. Use that and
show the --immed option on <br>
the destination:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddptctl --pt=0x0,0x80000
--rtf=aa.rt /dev/sdb <br>
PT completes with a transfer count of 524288 [0x80000]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddptctl --rtf=aa.rt
--wut=0x0,0x80000 --immed /dev/sdc <br>
Started ODX Write Using Token command in immediate mode.
<br>
User may need --list_id=257 on following invocation with
--receive or <br>
--poll for completion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddptctl --poll --rtf=aa.rt
/dev/sdc <br>
RRTI for Write using token: Operation completed without
errors <br>
transfer count of 524288 [0x80000]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy larger amounts and/or
with a larger number of scatter gather elements (than 8
&quot;range descriptors&quot;) use one of the four ODX
variants in the ddpt utility.</p>
