<p>gufw(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual gufw(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Gufw - Graphic user interface for managing ufw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Gufw is an easy to use Ubuntu / Linux firewall, powered by
ufw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gufw is an easy, intuitive, way
to manage your Ubuntu firewall. It supports common tasks
such as allowing or blocking pre-configured, common p2p, or
individual ports port(s), and <br>
many others! Gufw is powered by ufw. Introduction iptables
is already a very powerful tool by itself, but it&rsquo;s
syntax can get awkward at times and hard to figure out, so
Ubuntu <br>
developers decided to make ufw (&quot;The reason ufw was
developed is that we wanted to create a server-level
firewalling utility that was a little bit more for
&lsquo;human beings&lsquo;&quot;), <br>
which was to be simpler. Now, on the graphical side of
things, Firestarer already existed. But why not make an even
easier to use GUI for desktop &lsquo;human beings&lsquo;,
powered by ufw? <br>
This is where Gufw comes in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE BASIC SETTINGS <br>
Gufw has two states: Enabled and disabled. When Gufw is
enabled, you can allow/reject/deny all incoming and outgoing
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADD PRECONFIGURED RULE(S) <br>
You can select between more Programs and Services
preconfigured. Once Program/Service can have multiples
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOVE ONE RULE <br>
Steps: <br>
1. Select a rule in the list. <br>
2. Click in Remove button. You can delete more rules if you
select it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESET CONFIGURATION <br>
You will remove all rules and reset the ufw configuration to
initial status (disable)!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDIT PREFERENCES <br>
You can edit your preferences in /Edit/Preferences menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP/PORTS FORWARD <br>
To routing policy and rules, you must setup IP forwarding:
<br>
Close Gufw <br>
Uncomment the following lines in /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf: <br>
net/ipv4/ip_forward=1 <br>
net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1 <br>
net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding=1 <br>
Restart firewall: <br>
ufw reload <br>
Open Gufw again: You&rsquo;ll see a new &quot;Routed&quot;
option (with an arrow around the shield) and you can forward
any rule from the Update window or Advanced Tab in Add
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE GUFW WITHOUT GRAPHICAL
ENVIRONMENT OR REMOTE COMPUTER <br>
You can use Gufw in a Linux without Graphical Environment
(for example an Ubuntu Server) or from a remote computer.
You will need Gufw 13.10.2 or higher. Just export your X
Dis&acirc; <br>
play. All the operations in Gufw will be apply in the remote
computer. Important: If you enable the firewall under ssh
without the ssh rule, you&rsquo;ll close the ssh connection,
<br>
then before to enable Gufw under a ssh connection, append
the ssh rule using ufw with this command: <br>
sudo ufw enable ssh Linux, for example: <br>
Remote computer without graphic environment (IP =
192.168.1.102, Gufw installed and ssh server). <br>
Local Linux. In this local computer, open a Terminal and run
this command: <br>
ssh user_remote@192.168.1.102 -X <br>
sudo /usr/bin/gufw-pkexec -ssh Windows (For example, Windows
IP = 192.168.1.101; Linux IP = 192.168.1.100): <br>
Install Putty &amp; Xming. <br>
In Windows: Run XLaunch from the Start Menu and check
&quot;No Access Control&quot; in the last step. <br>
Connect to your Linux with Putty and run: <br>
export DISPLAY=192.168.1.101:0.0 <br>
sudo /usr/bin/gufw-pkexec -ssh</p>
