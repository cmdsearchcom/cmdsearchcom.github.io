<p>MAILPOST(8) InterNetNews Documentation MAILPOST(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mailpost - Feed an e-mail message into a newsgroup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mailpost [-hn] [-a addr] [-b database] [-c wait-time] [-d
distribution] [-f addr] [-m mailing-list] [-o
output-command] [-p port] [-r addr] [-t tempdir] [-x
header[:header...]] <br>
newsgroups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mailpost program reads a properly formatted e-mail
message from stdin and feeds it to inews for posting to a
news server. newsgroups is a whitespace-separated list of
group <br>
names to which to post the article (at least one newsgroup
must be specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before feeding the article to
inews, it checks that the article has not been seen before,
and it changes some headers (cleans up some address headers,
removes X-Trace: and <br>
X-Complaints-To:, and puts &quot;X-&quot; in front of
unknown headers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the article has been seen
before (mailpost records the Message-ID of each article it
handles), then the article will be dropped with a non-zero
error status. Other errors <br>
will cause the article to be mailed to the newsmaster
(selected at configure time and defaulting to
&quot;usenet&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, mailpost is run by
sendmail(8) via an alias entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-mail-wreck-bikes:
&quot;|&lt;pathbin in inn.conf&gt;/mailpost <br>
-b /var/tmp -t /var/tmp -d local
local.mail.rec.bicycles.racing&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b and -t flags are useful
to change the directories used by mailpost by default. As a
matter of fact, though it is recommended to run mailpost as
the news user, it is as <br>
often as not run as another user, for instance the mail
user. Therefore, you should make sure to create and set to
be writable by the user that mailpost runs as the
directories <br>
where to put the database and the temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of /var/tmp, the mail
spool directory can be specified, or any other directory
where the mailpost process has write access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a addr <br>
If the -a flag is used, the value given is added to the
article as an Approved: header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b database <br>
If the -b flag is used, then it defines the location of the
persistent database used to store the Message-IDs of
articles sent on. This is to prevent articles looping around
<br>
if a news-to-mail gateway sends them back here. This option
may be required if the mailpost process does not have write
access to the news database directory. The default <br>
value is pathdb as set in inn.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c wait-time <br>
The -c flag indicates a length of time to sleep before
posting. If duplicate messages are received in this interval
(by any instance of mailpost using the same database), <br>
the article is only posted once, but with Newsgroups: header
modified to crosspost the article to all indicated groups.
The units for wait-time are seconds; a reasonable <br>
value may be anywhere from tens to hundreds of seconds, or
even higher, depending on how long mail can be delayed on
its way to your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d distribution <br>
If the -d flag is used, the value given is added to the
article as a Distribution: header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f addr <br>
The -f flag is a synonym for the -r flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print usage information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mailing-list <br>
If the -m flag is used, the value given is added to the
article in a Mailing-List: header, if such a header
doesn&rsquo;t already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n If the -n flag is used,
neither an article is posted nor a mail is sent in case an
error occurs. Everything is written to the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output-command <br>
Specifies the program to which the resulting article
processed by mailpost should be sent. For debugging purpose,
&quot;-o cat&quot; can be used. The default value is
&quot;inews -S -h&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Specifies the port on which nnrpd is listening, used for
article posting. If given, -p is passed along to inews.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r addr <br>
A heuristic is used to determine a reasonable value for the
Path: header. The -r flag indicates what to use if no other
value can be determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tempdir <br>
If the -t flag is used, then it defines the location of the
directory to use to temporarily store error messages that
are sent to the newsmaster. This option may be required <br>
if the default value refers to a path that does not exist or
the mailpost process does not have write access to. Two
paths are tried by default: pathtmp as set in inn.conf, <br>
and then /var/tmp if pathtmp is not writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x header[:header...] <br>
A colon-separated list of additional headers which should be
treated as known headers; these headers will be passed
through to inews without having &quot;X-&quot;
prepended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known headers are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Approved <br>
Content-* <br>
Date <br>
Distribution <br>
From <br>
Mailing-List <br>
Message-ID <br>
MIME-* <br>
References <br>
Return-Path <br>
Sender <br>
Subject</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
pathbin/mailpost <br>
The Perl script itself used to feed an e-mail message to a
newsgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathdb/mailpost-msgid.dir and
pathdb/mailpost-msgid.pag <br>
The default database files which record previously seen
Message-IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>

Brister for INN integration.</p>
