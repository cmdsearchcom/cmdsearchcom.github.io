<p>SUDO(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual SUDO(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sudo, sudoedit &acirc; execute a command as another user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sudo -h | -K | -k | -V <br>
sudo -v [-AknS] [-a auth_type] [-g group name | #gid] [-p
prompt] [-u user name | #uid] <br>
sudo -l[l] [-AknS] [-a auth_type] [-g group name | #gid] [-p

[VAR=value] -i | -s [command] <br>
sudoedit [-AnS] [-a auth_type] [-C fd] [-g group name |
#gid] [-p prompt] [-u user name | #uid] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the
superuser or another user, as specified by the security
policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sudo supports a plugin
architecture for security policies and input/output logging.
Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy
and I/O logging plugins to work seam&acirc; <br>
lessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy
is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers,
or via LDAP. See the PLUGINS section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The security policy determines
what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy
may require that users authenticate themselves with a
password or another authentication <br>
mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if
the user&rsquo;s password is not entered within a
configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific; the
default pass&acirc; <br>
word prompt timeout for the sudoers security policy is 5
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security policies may support
credential caching to allow the user to run sudo again for a
period of time without requiring authentication. The sudoers
policy caches credentials <br>
for 5 minutes, unless overridden in sudoers(5). By running
sudo with the -v option, a user can update the cached
credentials without running a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked as sudoedit, the -e
option (described below), is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security policies may log
successful and failed attempts to use sudo. If an I/O plugin
is configured, the running command&rsquo;s input and output
may be logged as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Normally, if sudo requires a
password, it will read it from the user&rsquo;s terminal. If
the -A (askpass) option is specified, a (possibly graphical)
helper program is exe&acirc; <br>
cuted to read the user&rsquo;s password and output the
password to the standard output. If the SUDO_ASKPASS
environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the
helper <br>
program. Otherwise, if /etc/sudo.conf contains a line
specifying the askpass program, that value will be used. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Path to askpass helper program
<br>
Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no askpass program is
available, sudo will exit with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b The -b (background) option
tells sudo to run the given command in the background. Note
that if you use the -b option you cannot use shell job
control to manipulate the <br>
process. Most interactive commands will fail to work
properly in background mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C fd Normally, sudo will close
all open file descriptors other than standard input,
standard output and standard error. The -C (close from)
option allows the user to spec&acirc; <br>
ify a starting point above the standard error (file
descriptor three). Values less than three are not permitted.
The security policy may restrict the user&rsquo;s ability
<br>
to use the -C option. The sudoers policy only permits use of
the -C option when the administrator has enabled the
closefrom_override option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E The -E (preserve environment)
option indicates to the security policy that the user wishes
to preserve their existing environment variables. The
security policy may <br>
return an error if the -E option is specified and the user
does not have permission to preserve the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e The -e (edit) option
indicates that, instead of running a command, the user
wishes to edit one or more files. In lieu of a command, the
string &quot;sudoedit&quot; is used when <br>
consulting the security policy. If the user is authorized by
the policy, the following steps are taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Temporary copies are made of
the files to be edited with the owner set to the invoking
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The editor specified by the
policy is run to edit the temporary files. The sudoers
policy uses the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment
variables (in that <br>
order). If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are set,
the first program listed in the editor sudoers(5) option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If they have been modified,
the temporary files are copied back to their original
location and the temporary versions are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the specified file does not
exist, it will be created. Note that unlike most commands
run by sudo, the editor is run with the invoking
user&rsquo;s environment unmodi&acirc; <br>
fied. If, for some reason, sudo is unable to update a file
with its edited version, the user will receive a warning and
the edited copy will remain in a temporary <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g group Normally, sudo runs a
command with the primary group set to the one specified by
the password database for the user the command is being run
as (by default, root). The <br>
-g (group) option causes sudo to run the command with the
primary group set to group instead. To specify a gid instead
of a group name, use #gid. When running com&acirc; <br>
mands as a gid, many shells require that the &acirc;#&acirc;
be escaped with a backslash (&acirc;&acirc;). If no -u
option is specified, the command will be run as the invoking
user (not <br>
root). In either case, the primary group will be set to
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H The -H (HOME) option requests
that the security policy set the HOME environment variable
to the home directory of the target user (root by default)
as specified by the <br>
password database. Depending on the policy, this may be the
default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h The -h (help) option causes
sudo to print a short help message to the standard output
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i [command] <br>
The -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell
specified by the password database entry of the target user
as a login shell. This means that login-specific <br>
resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by
the shell. If a command is specified, it is passed to the
shell for execution via the shell&rsquo;s -c option. If <br>
no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
sudo attempts to change to that user&rsquo;s home directory
before running the shell. The security policy shall <br>
initialize the environment to a minimal set of variables,
similar to what is present when a user logs in. The Command
Environment section in the sudoers(5) manual doc&acirc; <br>
uments how the -i option affects the environment in which a
command is run when the sudoers policy is in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K The -K (sure kill) option is
like -k except that it removes the user&rsquo;s cached
credentials entirely and may not be used in conjunction with
a command or other option. <br>
This option does not require a password. Not all security
policies support credential caching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k [command] <br>
When used alone, the -k (kill) option to sudo invalidates
the user&rsquo;s cached credentials. The next time sudo is
run a password will be required. This option does not <br>
require a password and was added to allow a user to revoke
sudo permissions from a .logout file. Not all security
policies support credential caching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used in conjunction with a
command or an option that may require a password, the -k
option will cause sudo to ignore the user&rsquo;s cached
credentials. As a result, <br>
sudo will prompt for a password (if one is required by the
security policy) and will not update the user&rsquo;s cached
credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l[l] [command] <br>
If no command is specified, the -l (list) option will list
the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user
(or the user specified by the -U option) on the <br>
current host. If a command is specified and is permitted by
the security policy, the fully-qualified path to the command
is displayed along with any command line argu&acirc; <br>
ments. If command is specified but not allowed, sudo will
exit with a status value of 1. If the -l option is specified
with an l argument (i.e. -ll), or if -l is <br>
specified multiple times, a longer list format is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The -n (non-interactive)
option prevents sudo from prompting the user for a password.
If a password is required for the command to run, sudo will
display an error mes&acirc; <br>
sage and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P The -P (preserve group
vector) option causes sudo to preserve the invoking
user&rsquo;s group vector unaltered. By default, the sudoers
policy will initialize the group vec&acirc; <br>
tor to the list of groups the target user is in. The real
and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the
target user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prompt The -p (prompt) option
allows you to override the default password prompt and use a
custom one. The following percent (&acirc;%&acirc;) escapes
are supported by the sudoers pol&acirc; <br>
icy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%H expanded to the host name
including the domain name (on if the machine&rsquo;s host
name is fully qualified or the fqdn option is set in
sudoers(5))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%h expanded to the local host
name without the domain name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%p expanded to the name of the
user whose password is being requested (respects the rootpw,
targetpw, and runaspw flags in sudoers(5))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%U expanded to the login name of
the user the command will be run as (defaults to root unless
the -u option is also specified)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u expanded to the invoking
user&rsquo;s login name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% two consecutive
&acirc;%&acirc; characters are collapsed into a single
&acirc;%&acirc; character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prompt specified by the -p
option will override the system password prompt on systems
that support PAM unless the passprompt_override flag is
disabled in sudoers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r role The -r (role) option
causes the new (SELinux) security context to have the role
specified by role.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S The -S (stdin) option causes
sudo to read the password from the standard input instead of
the terminal device. The password must be followed by a
newline character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s [command] <br>
The -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL
environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified
in the password database. If a command is spec&acirc; <br>
ified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the
shell&rsquo;s -c option. If no command is specified, an
interactive shell is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type The -t (type) option
causes the new (SELinux) security context to have the type
specified by type. If no type is specified, the default type
is derived from the speci&acirc; <br>
fied role.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U user The -U (other user)
option is used in conjunction with the -l option to specify
the user whose privileges should be listed. The security
policy may restrict listing <br>
other users&rsquo; privileges. The sudoers policy only
allows root or a user with the ALL privilege on the current
host to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user The -u (user) option
causes sudo to run the specified command as a user other
than root. To specify a uid instead of a user name, #uid.
When running commands as a <br>
uid, many shells require that the &acirc;#&acirc; be escaped
with a backslash (&acirc;&acirc;). Security policies may
restrict uids to those listed in the password database. The
sudoers <br>
policy allows uids that are not in the password database as
long as the targetpw option is not set. Other security
policies may not support this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V The -V (version) option
causes sudo to print its version string and the version
string of the security policy plugin and any I/O plugins. If
the invoking user is <br>
already root the -V option will display the arguments passed
to configure when sudo was built and plugins may display
more verbose information such as default options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v When given the -v (validate)
option, sudo will update the user&rsquo;s cached
credentials, authenticating the user&rsquo;s password if
necessary. For the sudoers plugin, this <br>
extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever
the timeout is set to by the security policy) but does not
run a command. Not all security policies support <br>
cached credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- The -- option indicates that
sudo should stop processing command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment variables to be set
for the command may also be passed on the command line in
the form of VAR=value, e.g.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkg/lib. Variables passed on the
<br>
command line are subject to the same restrictions as normal
environment variables with one important exception. If the
setenv option is set in sudoers, the command to be run has
<br>
the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user
may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden. See
sudoers(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND EXECUTION <br>
When sudo executes a command, the security policy specifies
the execution envionment for the command. Typically, the
real and effective uid and gid are set to match those of the
<br>
target user, as specified in the password database, and the
group vector is initialized based on the group database
(unless the -P option was specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following parameters may be
specified by security policy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; real and
effective user ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; real and
effective group ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; supplementary
group IDs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the environment
list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; current working
directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; file creation
mode mask (umask)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SELinux role and
type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; scheduling
priority (aka nice value)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process model <br>
When sudo runs a command, it calls fork(2), sets up the
execution environment as described above, and calls the
execve system call in the child process. The main sudo
process <br>
waits until the command has completed, then passes the
command&rsquo;s exit status to the security policy&rsquo;s
close method and exits. If an I/O logging plugin is
configured, a new <br>
pseudo-terminal (&acirc;pty&acirc;) is created and a second
sudo process is used to relay job control signals between
the user&rsquo;s existing pty and the new pty the command is
being run in. This <br>
extra process makes it possible to, for example, suspend and
resume the command. Without it, the command would be in what
POSIX terms an &acirc;orphaned process group&acirc; and it
would not <br>
receive any job control signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal handling <br>
Because the command is run as a child of the sudo process,
sudo will relay signals it receives to the command. Unless
the command is being run in a new pty, the SIGHUP, SIGINT
and <br>
SIGQUIT signals are not relayed unless they are sent by a
user process, not the kernel. Otherwise, the command would
receive SIGINT twice every time the user entered control-C.
<br>
Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, cannot be caught
and thus will not be relayed to the command. As a general
rule, SIGTSTP should be used instead of SIGSTOP when you
wish <br>
to suspend a command being run by sudo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, sudo will not
relay signals that were sent by the command it is running.
This prevents the command from accidentally killing itself.
On some systems, the <br>
reboot(8) command sends SIGTERM to all non-system processes
other than itself before rebooting the systyem. This
prevents sudo from relaying the SIGTERM signal it received
back to <br>
reboot(8), which might then exit before the system was
actually rebooted, leaving it in a half-dead state similar
to single user mode. Note, however, that this check only
applies <br>
to the command run by sudo and not any other processes that
the command may create. As a result, running a script that
calls reboot(8) or shutdown(8) via sudo may cause the system
<br>
to end up in this undefined state unless the reboot(8) or
shutdown(8) are run using the exec() family of functions
instead of system() (which interposes a shell between the
command <br>
and the calling process).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLUGINS <br>
Plugins are dynamically loaded based on the contents of the
/etc/sudo.conf file. If no /etc/sudo.conf file is present,
or it contains no Plugin lines, sudo will use the
tradi&acirc; <br>
tional sudoers security policy and I/O logging, which
corresponds to the following /etc/sudo.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# Default /etc/sudo.conf file <br>
# <br>
# Format: <br>
# Plugin plugin_name plugin_path plugin_options ... <br>
# Path askpass /path/to/askpass <br>
# Path noexec /path/to/sudo_noexec.so <br>
# Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@warn <br>
# Set disable_coredump true <br>
# <br>
# The plugin_path is relative to /usr/libexec unless <br>
# fully qualified. <br>
# The plugin_name corresponds to a global symbol in the
plugin <br>
# that contains the plugin interface structure. <br>
# The plugin_options are optional. <br>
# <br>
Plugin policy_plugin sudoers.so <br>
Plugin io_plugin sudoers.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Plugin line consists of the
Plugin keyword, followed by the symbol_name and the path to
the shared object containing the plugin. The symbol_name is
the name of the struct <br>
policy_plugin or struct io_plugin in the plugin shared
object. The path may be fully qualified or relative. If not
fully qualified it is relative to the /usr/libexec
directory. <br>
Any additional parameters after the path are passed as
arguments to the plugin&rsquo;s open function. Lines that
don&rsquo;t begin with Plugin, Path, Debug, or Set are
silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see the
sudo_plugin(8) manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATHS <br>
A Path line consists of the Path keyword, followed by the
name of the path to set and its value. E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Path noexec
/usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so <br>
Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following plugin-agnostic
paths may be set in the /etc/sudo.conf file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">askpass The fully qualified path
to a helper program used to read the user&rsquo;s password
when no terminal is available. This may be the case when
sudo is executed from a graphical <br>
(as opposed to text-based) application. The program
specified by askpass should display the argument passed to
it as the prompt and write the user&rsquo;s password to the
<br>
standard output. The value of askpass may be overridden by
the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noexec The fully-qualified path
to a shared library containing dummy versions of the
execv(), execve() and fexecve() library functions that just
return an error. This is used <br>
to implement the noexec functionality on systems that
support LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent. Defaults to
/usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG FLAGS <br>
sudo versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging
framework that can help track down what sudo is doing
internally if there is a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Debug line consists of the
Debug keyword, followed by the name of the program to debug
(sudo, visudo, sudoreplay), the debug file name and a
comma-separated list of debug flags. <br>
The debug flag syntax used by sudo and the sudoers plugin is
subsystem@priority but the plugin is free to use a different
format so long as it does not include a comma
(&acirc;,&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug
all@warn,plugin@info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would log all debugging
statements at the warn level and higher in addition to those
at the info level for the plugin subsystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, only one Debug entry
per program is supported. The sudo Debug entry is shared by
the sudo front end, sudoedit and the plugins. A future
release may add support for <br>
per-plugin Debug lines and/or support for multiple debugging
files for a single program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The priorities used by the sudo
front end, in order of decreasing severity, are: crit, err,
warn, notice, diag, info, trace and debug. Each priority,
when specified, also includes <br>
all priorities higher than it. For example, a priority of
notice would include debug messages logged at notice and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following subsystems are
used by the sudo front-end:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all matches every subsystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">args command line argument
processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conv user conversation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit sudoedit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec command execution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main sudo main function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netif network interface
handling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcomm communication with the
plugin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plugin plugin configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pty pseudo-tty related code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selinux SELinux-specific
handling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">util utility functions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utmp utmp handling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT VALUE <br>
Upon successful execution of a program, the exit status from
sudo will simply be the exit status of the program that was
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, sudo exits with a
value of 1 if there is a configuration/permission problem or
if sudo cannot execute the given command. In the latter case
the error string is printed <br>
to the standard error. If sudo cannot stat(2) one or more
entries in the user&rsquo;s PATH, an error is printed on
stderr. (If the directory does not exist or if it is not
really a <br>
directory, the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)
This should not happen under normal circumstances. The most
common reason for stat(2) to return &acirc;permission
denied&acirc; is <br>
if you are running an automounter and one of the directories
in your PATH is on a machine that is currently
unreachable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY NOTES <br>
sudo tries to be safe when executing external commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To prevent command spoofing,
sudo checks &quot;.&quot; and &quot;&quot; (both denoting
current directory) last when searching for a command in the
user&rsquo;s PATH (if one or both are in the PATH). Note,
<br>
however, that the actual PATH environment variable is not
modified and is passed unchanged to the program that sudo
executes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that sudo will
normally only log the command it explicitly runs. If a user
runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh, subsequent
commands run from that shell are not <br>
subject to sudo&rsquo;s security policy. The same is true
for commands that offer shell escapes (including most
editors). If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands
will have their <br>
input and/or output logged, but there will not be
traditional logs for those commands. Because of this, care
must be taken when giving users access to commands via sudo
to verify <br>
that the command does not inadvertently give the user an
effective root shell. For more information, please see the
PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES section in sudoers(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To prevent the disclosure of
potentially sensitive information, sudo disables core dumps
by default while it is executing (they are re-enabled for
the command that is run). To aid <br>
in debugging sudo crashes, you may wish to re-enable core
dumps by setting &acirc;disable_coredump&acirc; to false in
the /etc/sudo.conf file as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set disable_coredump false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that by default, most
operating systems disable core dumps from setuid programs,
which includes sudo. To actually get a sudo core file you
may need to enable core dumps for <br>
setuid processes. On BSD and Linux systems this is
accomplished via the sysctl command, on Solaris the coreadm
command can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
sudo utilizes the following environment variables. The
security policy has control over the actual content of the

/usr/local/protected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list the home directory of
user yaz on a machine where the file system holding ~yaz is
not exported as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo -u yaz ls ~yaz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To edit the index.html file as
user www:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo -u www vi
~www/htdocs/index.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view system logs only
accessible to root and users in the adm group:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
See the HISTORY file in the sudo distribution
(http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/history.html) for a brief history
of sudo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Many people have worked on sudo over the years; this version
consists of code written primarily by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Todd C. Miller</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the CONTRIBUTORS file in the
sudo distribution
(http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/contributors.html) for an
exhaustive list of people who have contributed to sudo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root
shell if that user is allowed to run arbitrary commands via
sudo. Also, many programs (such as editors) allow the user
<br>
to run commands via shell escapes, thus avoiding
sudo&rsquo;s checks. However, on most systems it is possible
to prevent shell escapes with the sudoers(5) plugin&rsquo;s
noexec functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not meaningful to run the
cd command directly via sudo, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo cd
/usr/local/protected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">since when the command exits the
parent process (your shell) will still be the same. Please
see the EXAMPLES section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running shell scripts via sudo
can expose the same kernel bugs that make setuid shell
scripts unsafe on some operating systems (if your OS has a
/dev/fd/ directory, setuid shell <br>
scripts are generally safe).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you feel you have found a bug in sudo, please submit a
bug report at http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/bugs/</p>
