<p>BLAZER_SER(8) NUT Manual BLAZER_SER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
blazer_ser - Driver for Megatec/Q1 protocol serial based UPS
equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the blazer driver. For information about the core driver,
see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
The blazer driver is known to work with various UPSes from
Blazer, Energy Sistem, Fenton Technologies, General
Electric, Mustek and many others. The NUT compatibility
table lists <br>
all the known supported models. Keep in mind, however, that
other models not listed there may also be supported, but
haven&acirc;t been tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All devices with a serial
interface (use the blazer_ser driver) and many with a USB
interface (use the blazer_usb driver) are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
You may need to override or provide defaults for some
values, depending on the make and model of your UPS. The
following are the ones that most likely will need changing
(see <br>
ups.conf(5)):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default.battery.voltage.high =
value <br>
Maximum battery voltage that is reached after about 12 to 24
hours charging. If you want the driver to report a
guesstimated battery.charge, you need to specify this (see
<br>
BATTERY CHARGE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default.battery.voltage.low =
value <br>
Minimum battery voltage just before the UPS automatically
shuts down. If you want the driver to report a guesstimated
battery.charge, you need to specify this (see BATTERY <br>
CHARGE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default.battery.voltage.nominal
= value, override.battery.voltage.nominal = value <br>
Some devices show a wrong nominal battery voltage (or none
at all), so you may need to override or set a default
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">override.battery.packs = value
<br>
Some devices report a part of the total battery voltage. For
instance, if battery.voltage.nominal is 24 V, but it reports
a battery.voltage of around 2 V, the number of <br>
battery.packs to correct this reading would be 12. The
driver will attempt to detect this automatically, but if
this fails somehow, you may want to override this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ondelay = value <br>
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (minutes). Note
that a value below 3 minutes, may cause earlier firmware
versions to not switch on automatically, so it defaults to 3
<br>
minutes. The acceptable range is 0..9999 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offdelay = value <br>
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (seconds). This
value is truncated to units of 6 seconds (less than 60
seconds) or 60 seconds (more than 60 seconds). Defaults to
30 <br>
seconds. The acceptable range is 12..600 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norating <br>
Some UPSes will lock up if you attempt to read rating
information from them. Setting this flag will make the
driver skip this step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">novendor <br>
Some UPSes will lock up if you attempt to read vendor
information from them. Setting this flag will make the
driver skip this step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol = string <br>
Skip autodetection of the protocol to use and only use the
one specified. Supported values megatec, megatec/old, mustek
and zinto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runtimecal =
value,value,value,value <br>
Parameter used in the (optional) runtime estimation. This
takes two runtimes at different loads. Typically, this uses
the runtime at full load and the runtime at half load. <br>
For instance, if your UPS has a rated runtime of 240 seconds
at full load and 720 seconds at half load, you would
enter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runtimecal = 240,100,720,50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first load should always be
higher than the second. If you have values available for
loads other than 100 and 50 % respectively, you can use
those too, but keep them <br>
spaced apart as far as reasonably possible. Just don&acirc;t
get too close to no load (prediction of runtime depends more
on idle load for the battery then).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chargetime = value <br>
The time needed to fully recharge the battery after being
fully discharged. If not specified, the driver defaults to
43200 seconds (12 hours). Only used if runtimecal is also
<br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idleload = value <br>
Minimum battery load used by the driver to estimate the
runtime. If not specified, the driver defaults to 10%. Only
used if runtimecal is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERIAL INTERFACE ONLY <br>
cablepower = string <br>
By default the driver will set DTR and clear RTS (normal).
If you find that your UPS isn&acirc;t detected or the
communication with the UPS is unreliable, you may try if
clear DTR <br>
and set RTS (reverse), set DTR and RTS (both) or clear DTR
and RTS (none) improves this situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPS COMMANDS <br>
This driver supports some instant commands (see
upscmd(8)):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beeper.toggle <br>
Toggle the UPS beeper. (Not available on some hardware.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load.on <br>
Turn on the load immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load.off <br>
Turn off the load immediately (see KNOWN PROBLEMS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.return <br>
Turn off the load and return when power is back. Uses the
timers defined by ondelay and offdelay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.stayoff <br>
Turn off the load and remain off (see KNOWN PROBLEMS). Uses
the timer defined by offdelay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.stop <br>
Stop a shutdown in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.battery.start.deep <br>
Perform a long battery test (Not available on some
hardware.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.battery.start.quick <br>
Perform a (10 second) battery test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.battery.start value <br>
Perform a battery test for the duration of value
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.battery.stop <br>
Stop a running battery test (not available on some
hardware.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BATTERY CHARGE <br>
Due to popular demand, this driver will report a
guesstimated battery.charge and optionally battery.runtime,
provided you specified a couple of the EXTRA ARGUMENTS
listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify both
battery.voltage.high and battery.voltage.low in ups.conf(5),
but don&acirc;t enter runtimecal, it will guesstimate the
state of charge by looking at the battery <br>
voltage alone. This is not reliable under load, as this only
gives reasonably accurate readings if you disconnect the
load, let the battery rest for a couple of minutes and then
<br>
measure the open cell voltage. This just isn&acirc;t
practical if the power went out and the UPS is providing
power for your systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battery.voltage -
battery.voltage.low <br>
battery.charge = ------------------------------------------
x 100 % <br>
battery.voltage.high - battery.voltage.low</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a way to get better
readings without disconnecting the load but this requires
one to keep track on how much (and how fast) current is
going in- and out of the battery. <br>
If you specified the runtimecal, the driver will attempt to
do this. Note however, that this heavily relies on the
values you enter and that the UPS must be able to report the
<br>
load as well. There are quite a couple of devices that
report 0 % (or any other fixed value) at all times, in which
case this obviously doesn&acirc;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The driver also has no way of
determining the degradation of the battery capacity over
time, so you&acirc;ll have to deal with this yourself (by
adjusting the values in runtimecal). <br>
Also note that the driver guesses the initial state of
charge based on the battery voltage, so this may be less
than 100 %, even when you are certain that they are full.
There is <br>
just no way to reliably measure this between 0 and 100 %
full charge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is better than nothing (but
not by much). If any of the above calculations is giving you
incorrect readings, you are the one that put in the values
in ups.conf(5), so don&acirc;t <br>
complain with the author. If you need something better, buy
a UPS that reports battery.charge and battery.runtime all by
itself without the help of a NUT driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES FOR THE PREVIOUS USER OF
MEGATEC DRIVERS <br>
The blazer drivers having replaced the megatec ones, some
configuration changes may be required by users switching to
blazer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Part of this, the following
megatec options, in ups.conf, have to be changed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battvolts <br>
You need to use default.battery.voltage.high and
default.battery.voltage.low</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dtr and rts <br>
You need to use cablepower</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreoff <br>
This parameter can simply be discarded, since it was a wrong
understanding of the specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
Some UPS commands aren&acirc;t supported by all models. In
most cases, the driver will send a message to the system log
when the user tries to execute an unsupported command. <br>
Unfortunately, some models don&acirc;t even provide a way
for the driver to check for this, so the unsupported
commands will silently fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the load.off and
shutdown.stayoff instant commands are meant to turn the load
off indefinitely. However, some UPS models don&acirc;t allow
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some models report a bogus value
for the beeper status (will always be enabled or disabled).
So, the beeper.toggle command may appear to have no effect
in the status reported by <br>
the driver when, in fact, it is working fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The temperature and load value
is known to be bogus in some models.</p>
