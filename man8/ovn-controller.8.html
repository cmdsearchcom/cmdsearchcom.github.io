<p>ovn-controller(8) Open vSwitch Manual
ovn-controller(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ovn-controller - Open Virtual Network local controller</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ovn-controller [options] [ovs-database]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ovn-controller is the local controller daemon for OVN, the
Open Virtual Network. It connects up to the OVN Southbound
database (see ovn-sb(5)) over the OVSDB protocol, and down
<br>
to the Open vSwitch database (see ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5))
over the OVSDB protocol and to ovs-vswitchd(8) via OpenFlow.
Each hypervisor and software gateway in an OVN deployment
<br>
runs its own independent copy of ovn-controller; thus,
ovn-controller&acirc;s downward connections are
machine-local and do not run over a physical network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
ovn-controller retrieves most of its configuration
information from the local Open vSwitch&acirc;s ovsdb-server
instance. The default location is db.sock in the local Open
vSwitch&acirc;s <br>
&quot;run&quot; directory. It may be overridden by
specifying the ovs-database argument in one of the following
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ssl:ip:port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified SSL port on the
host at the given ip, which must be expressed as an IP
address (not a DNS name) in IPv4 or IPv6 address format. If
ip is an IPv6 <br>
address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
ssl:[::1]:6640. The --private-key, --certificate and either
of --ca-cert or --bootstrap-ca-cert options are manda&acirc;
<br>
tory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tcp:ip:port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect to the given TCP port on
ip, where ip can be IPv4 or IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6
address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
tcp:[::1]:6640.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On POSIX, connect to the Unix
domain server socket named file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a
localhost TCP port whose value is written in file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-controller assumes it gets
configuration information from the following keys in the
Open_vSwitch table of the local OVS instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:system-id <br>
The chassis name to use in the Chassis table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:hostname <br>
The hostname to use in the Chassis table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-bridge <br>
The integration bridge to which logical ports are attached.
The default is br-int. If this bridge does not exist when
ovn-controller starts, it will be created <br>
automatically with the default configuration suggested in
ovn-architecture(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-remote <br>
The OVN database that this system should connect to for its
configuration, in one of the same forms documented above for
the ovs-database.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-remote-probe-interval
<br>
The inactivity probe interval of the connection to the OVN
database, in milliseconds. If the value is zero, it disables
the connection keepalive feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value is nonzero, then it
will be forced to a value of at least 1000 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-encap-type <br>
The encapsulation type that a chassis should use to connect
to this node. Multiple encapsulation types may be specified
with a comma-separated list. Each listed <br>
encapsulation type will be paired with ovn-encap-ip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported tunnel types for
connecting hypervisors are geneve and stt. Gateways may use
geneve, vxlan, or stt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the limited amount of
metadata in vxlan, the capabilities and performance of
connected gateways will be reduced versus other tunnel
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-encap-ip <br>
The IP address that a chassis should use to connect to this
node using encapsulation types specified by
external_ids:ovn-encap-type.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings
<br>
A list of key-value pairs that map a physical network name
to a local ovs bridge that provides connectivity to that
network. An example value mapping two physical <br>
network names to two ovs bridges would be:
physnet1:br-eth0,physnet2:br-eth1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-encap-csum <br>
ovn-encap-csum indicates that encapsulation checksums can be
transmitted and received with reasonable performance. It is
a hint to senders transmitting data to this <br>
chassis that they should use checksums to protect OVN
metadata. Set to true to enable or false to disable.
Depending on the capabilities of the network interface <br>
card, enabling encapsulation checksum may incur performance
loss. In such cases, encapsulation checksums can be
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-controller reads the
following values from the Open_vSwitch database of the local
OVS instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datapath-type from Bridge table
<br>
This value is read from local OVS integration bridge row of
Bridge table and populated in external_ids:datapath-type of
the Chassis table in the OVN_Southbound <br>
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface-types from Open_vSwitch
table <br>
This value is populated in external_ids:iface-types of the
Chassis table in the OVN_Southbound database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPEN VSWITCH DATABASE USAGE <br>
ovn-controller uses a number of external_ids keys in the
Open vSwitch database to keep track of ports and interfaces.
For proper operation, users should not change or clear these
<br>
keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-chassis-id in
the Port table <br>
The presence of this key identifies a tunnel port within the
integration bridge as one created by ovn-controller to reach
a remote chassis. Its value is the chassis <br>
ID of the remote chassis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ct-zone-* in the
Bridge table <br>
Logical ports and gateway routers are assigned a connection
tracking zone by ovn-controller for stateful services. To
keep state across restarts of ovn-controller, <br>
these keys are stored in the integration bridge&acirc;s
Bridge table. The name contains a prefix of ct-zone-
followed by the name of the logical port or gateway
router&acirc;s <br>
zone key. The value for this key identifies the zone used
for this port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-localnet-port
in the Port table <br>
The presence of this key identifies a patch port as one
created by ovn-controller to connect the integration bridge
and another bridge to implement a localnet logi&acirc; <br>
cal port. Its value is the name of the logical port with
type set to localnet that the port implements. See
external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings, above, for more
infor&acirc; <br>
mation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each localnet logical port is
implemented as a pair of patch ports, one in the integration
bridge, one in a different bridge, with the same
external_ids:ovn-local&acirc; <br>
net-port value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ids:ovn-l2gateway-port
in the Port table <br>
The presence of this key identifies a patch port as one
created by ovn-controller to connect the integration bridge
and another bridge to implement a l2gateway log&acirc; <br>
ical port. Its value is the name of the logical port with
type set to l2gateway that the port implements. See
external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings, above, for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each l2gateway logical port is
implemented as a pair of patch ports, one in the integration
bridge, one in a different bridge, with the same
exter&acirc; <br>
nal_ids:ovn-l2gateway-port value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external-ids:ovn-l3gateway-port
in the Port table <br>
This key identifies a patch port as one created by
ovn-controller to implement a l3gateway logical port. Its
value is the name of the logical port with type set to <br>
l3gateway. This patch port is similar to the OVN logical
patch port, except that l3gateway port can only be bound to
a paticular chassis.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">external-ids:ovn-logical-patch-port
in the Port table <br>
This key identifies a patch port as one created by
ovn-controller to implement an OVN logical patch port within
the integration bridge. Its value is the name of the <br>
OVN logical patch port that it implements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS <br>
ovs-appctl can send commands to a running ovn-controller
process. The currently supported commands are described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit Causes ovn-controller to
gracefully terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ct-zone-list <br>
Lists each local logical port and its connection tracking
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inject-pkt microflow <br>
Injects microflow into the connected Open vSwitch instance.
microflow must contain an ingress logical port (inport
argument) that is present on the Open vSwitch <br>
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The microflow argument describes
the packet whose forwarding is to be simulated, in the
syntax of an OVN logical expression, as described in
ovn-sb(5), to express <br>
constraints. The parser understands prerequisites; for
example, if the expression refers to ip4.src, there is no
need to explicitly state ip4 or eth.type == 0x800.</p>
