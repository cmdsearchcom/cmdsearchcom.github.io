<p>ip-sentinel(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ip-sentinel(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ip-sentinel - keeps your IP space clean</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ip-sentinel [--user|-u username] [--group|-g groupname]
[--chroot|-r dir] [--ipfile|-i file] [--pidfile|-p file]
[--logfile|-l file] [--errfile|-e file] [--mac mac] [--llmac
mac] <br>
[--direction dir] [--action program] [--nofork|-n]
[--help|-h] [--version] interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ip-sentinel starts a daemon which tries to prevent
unauthorized usage of IPs within an ethernet broadcastdomain
by answering ARP requests. After receiving such a faked
reply, the <br>
requesting party stores the MAC address in its ARP-table and
will send future packets to this invalid MAC, rendering the
IP unreachable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After startup it opens its
logfiles, goes into a chroot jail, drops privileges and
forks itself into background by default. The parameters of
these operations can by changed by <br>
the options described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: with an uncareful
configuration, ip-sentinel can bring down the entire network
and your physical presence at the ip-sentinel machine and/or
the switch will be required <br>
to fix it. Some switches can show an unexpected behavior are
even crash when the special 802.* mac-addresses will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--user|-u username and --group|-g groupname <br>
After doing basical initializations, the program will drop
its privilegies by changing its user and group ID. The
username and groupname parameters determine these new IDs
<br>
and must be an alphanumeric username/groupname or a numeric
uid/gid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attention: When having a
dietlibc-compiled version in a system which uses remote NSS
(e.g. LDAP, NIS) to make passwd-lookups, you will have to
use numeric IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chroot|-r dirname <br>
Specifies the directory where the program shall go into and
call chroot() after finishing its initialization. By default
it is the homedirectory of the user specified with <br>
the --user option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipfile|-i filename <br>
Sets the name of the configuration file which contains the
list of forbidden IPs. This name is relative to the chroot
and is ips.cfg by default. This file will be reread <br>
automatically after changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile|-p filename <br>
Sets the file where the pid of the daemon will be written
into. This filename is relative to the root-filesystem and
is /var/run/ip-sentinel.run by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logfile|-l filename <br>
Sets the file where normal operations will be logged. Normal
operations are e.g. an ARP-reply for a forbidden IP. This
filename is relative to the root-filesystem and <br>
/var/log/ip-sentinel.out by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--errfile|-e filename <br>
Sets the file where error-conditions will be logged.
Error-conditions are e.g. detected DOS attacks (bombing the
ip-sentinel with ARP-requests) or errors in the
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file. This filename is relative to the root-filesystem
and /var/log/ip-sentinel.err by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nofork|-n <br>
Prevents daemon from going into background after
initialization. This option may be useful when using
advanced init-concepts like minit
(http://www.fefe.de/minit/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--direction dir <br>
ip-sentinel can answer both requests asking for an
intruder&rsquo;s address, and requests coming from an
intruder asking for official addresses. This parameter
specifies which <br>
requests shall be answered. Possible values are FROM
(requests from intruders), TO (requests to intruders) and
BOTH. The current default value is TO, but will probably
<br>
change to BOTH in future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mac mac <br>
Use mac as the default faked mac-address; see below for
possible values. This parameter can be overriden in the
ipfile for each questionable IP. The default value is
RAN&acirc; <br>
DOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--llmac mac <br>
Specifies the mac-address which will be used in the
link-level headers when answering requests from intruders.
Additionally to the values described below, ip-sentinel <br>
understands the SAME string, which means that the address
from the ARP-header will be used. When not using the FROM or
BOTH directions, the assigned value will not have <br>
any effect. The default is LOCAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--poison <br>
When an intruder sends a request from a registered ip
address and this option is set, ip-sentinel will send ARP
replies which are poisoning this ip. When the @!srcmac
syn&acirc; <br>
tax is used for the questionable ip, the srcmac is used as
the is-at mac. Else, the mac specified by the --mac option
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option takes an affect only
when --destination BOTH or FROM is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--action program <br>
Execute program when a faked ARP reply will be generated. It
will be called with 6 arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; type 0 when an
intruder sent the request, 1 when a protected IP was
requested and -1 else (should never happen)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; spa the protocol
address (IP) of the source</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sha the hardware
address (MAC) of the source</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tpa the protocol
address (IP) of the target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tha the hardware
address (MAC) of the target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mac the
generated MAC address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will be executed
only without evaluating its return value or something else.
Please note, that the program will be executed in the chroot
with restricted <br>
rights.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help|-h <br>
Prints help message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints the version of the program and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface <br>
Specifies the network-interface where ip-sentinel listens
for ARP-requests and sends ARP-replies. It is a name like
&quot;eth0&quot;; aliases like &quot;eth0:1&quot; are not
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The location of the configfile is relatively to the choosen
chroot-directory. Its default is determined at compilation
time but it can be overriden by the --ipfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The content of this file has the
following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip [mac] <br>
Specifies an IP which shall be blocked. &quot;Blocked&quot;
means that ARP-replies will be generated telling that the IP
address ip has the MAC mac. When the MAC parameter is not
<br>
given, a random one will be choosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attention: Assigning a MAC in a
switched environment will not have the desired effect,
because the switch will be confused when receiving
ARP-replies for the same IP on <br>
different ports (this one of the bad-host and this one of
the ip-sentinel host).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples are:
&quot;192.168.42.23 11:22:33:44:55:66&quot; or
&quot;10.0.0.0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip@[!]srcmac [mac] <br>
Similarly to above, but when receiving ARP-requests, the
entire sender-address (IP and MAC) will be compared against
the ip and srcmac values. This setting affects packets <br>
from intruders only; ip-sentinel will not generate replies
when ip is requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the srcmac is negated with
&quot;!&quot;, only addresses from this ip which are not
having this mac will be matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples are:
&quot;10.0.0.1@0:1:2:3:4:5&quot; or
&quot;10.0.0.2@!a:b:c:d:e:f&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*@srcmac [mac] <br>
Every host using the srcmac will be blocked unless there is
a matching ip@srcmac specification. This option does not
support &rsquo;!&rsquo; modifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">net/mask [mac] <br>
net/mask@[!]srcmac [mac] <br>
Specifies that IPs of an entiry network shall be blocked.
See above for the meaning of &quot;blocked&quot;. It is
possible to specify a MAC address; else a random one will be
gener&acirc; <br>
ated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples are:
&quot;169.0.0.0/8&quot;,
&quot;192.168.8.15/255.255.65.31&quot; or
&quot;192.168.23.42/26 a:b:c:d:e:f&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!ip <br>
!ip@[!]srcmac <br>
The given IP address ip will be ignored. By default, any not
specified address will be ignored but when having blocked
netmasks it may be usefully to allow certain IPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example is:
&quot;!192.168.23.42&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!net/mask <br>
!net/mask@[!]srcmac <br>
Tells that IPs of the given network shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples are:
&quot;!192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0&quot; or
&quot;!0.0.0.0/0&quot; (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># comment (and empty lines) <br>
A comment; will be ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be switch-friendly, there are
only a few random MACs possible which are having the format
&quot;de:ad:be:ef:00:XX&quot;. Within a short timespan only
32 values are possible for XX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When having overlapping networks
and/or single IPs, this one with the most specified netmask
(count of 1&rsquo;s) takes precedence. When netmasks are
equal, networks which are using <br>
the &quot;@srcmac&quot; or &quot;@!srcmac&quot; syntax are
taking precedence over those without source-macs. This
&quot;@...&quot; rule does not apply to IPs. The behavior is
unspecified when having overlap&acirc; <br>
ping networks with the same count of 1&rsquo;s and
&quot;@...&quot; specification, or when having duplicate
IPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE <br>
The lookup of single IPs has a complexity of O(log n) and
this of netmasks a complexity of O(n).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIAL MAC ADDRESSES <br>
Beside the usual hex-octets-delimited-by-colons mac
addresses, ip-sentinel understands some special strings both
on the commandline and in the configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL expands to the mac-address
of the used interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANDOM means a random
mac-address which is newly calculated on every usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">802.1d expands to
01:80:C2:00:00:00 which is the &quot;Bridge Group
Address&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">802.3x expands to
01:80:C2:00:00:01 which is the &quot;IEEE Std. 802.3x Full
Duplex PAUSE operation&quot;. This MAC address will be
blocked by a lot of switches and will probably become <br>
the default in future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 802.* addresses are having a
special meaning for some switches and packets having them as
destination-address will be dropped by the switch instead of
flooding all ports. But <br>
it depends on the used switch how/if these macs are
honored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some switches can show an
unexpected behavior are even crash if the special 802.*
mac-addresses will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANGES <br>
Except in comments, it is possible to specify ranges
everywhere in the configuration file. These ranges are
having the format &quot;{from-to}&quot; or
&quot;{item1,item2,...,itemN}&quot;. The first <br>
format includes any number beginning at &quot;from&quot;
till &quot;to&quot; (inclusive), while the latter format
expands to the listed items only. The expansion happens on a
line-level and it is <br>
possible to use more than one range per line, so that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.168.0.{1-3} 0:0:0:0:0:1 <br>
192.168.1.{1,3} 0:0:0:0:0:2 <br>
192.168.{2,4}.{1-3} 0:0:0:0:0:3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is the same like writing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.168.0.1 0:0:0:0:0:1 <br>
192.168.0.2 0:0:0:0:0:1 <br>
192.168.0.3 0:0:0:0:0:1 <br>
192.168.1.1 0:0:0:0:0:1 <br>
192.168.1.3 0:0:0:0:0:1 <br>
192.168.2.1 0:0:0:0:0:3 <br>
192.168.2.2 0:0:0:0:0:3 <br>
192.168.2.3 0:0:0:0:0:3 <br>
192.168.4.1 0:0:0:0:0:3 <br>
192.168.4.2 0:0:0:0:0:3 <br>
192.168.4.3 0:0:0:0:0:3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because there can be created
very much entries with a single line (e.g.
&quot;{0-255}.{0-255}.{0-255}.{0-255}&quot; would cover the
entire IPv4 internet), ranges should be used sparely. <br>
When possible, large ranges should be expressed with
netmasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
0.0.0.0/0 ## Block anything <br>
!192.168.0.0/24 ## Allow IPs of the form 192.168.0.* <br>
192.168.0.0 ## but block 192.168.0.0 <br>
192.168.0.1 a:b:c:d:e:f ## use a special mac for 192.168.0.1
<br>
192.168.0.2 802.1d ## and 01:80:C2:00:00:00 for 192.168.0.2
<br>
10.0.0.1@a:a:a:a:a:a <br>
10.0.0.2@!1:1:1:1:1:1 <br>
*@b:b:b:b:b:b ## block MAC b:b:b:b:b:b regardless of the
IP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setup will not send
ARP-replies for the IPs 192.168.0.{3-255} but when a host
tries to use e.g. 169.254.145.213, ip-sentinel will tell
that this IP has a MAC of <br>
&quot;de:ad:be:ef:00:XX&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an intruder is at
&quot;10.0.0.1&quot; and uses the mac
&quot;a:a:a:a:a:a:&quot;, a faked reply will be generated.
Users at the same ip but another mac will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In opposite, users with ip
&quot;10.0.0.2&quot; and mac &quot;1:1:1:1:1:1&quot; will be
ignored but intruders with other macs (e.g.
&quot;2:2:2:2:2:2&quot;) are getting faked replies. When
--poision is used, <br>
ip-sentinel will generate a &quot;10.0.0.2 is at
1:1:1:1:1:1&quot; arp-reply to a broad address.</p>
