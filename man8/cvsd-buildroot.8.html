<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvsd-buildroot - create a chrooted directory structure for
use in cvsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvsd-buildroot DIRECTORY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cvsd-buildroot creates and populates a directory that can be
used as a chroot jail for running cvsd (see cvsd(8) )
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script should be run as the
root user since the creation of devices and the changing of
ownership and permissions require this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script gives warnings about
files that it&rsquo;s not expecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvsd-buildroot creates the
following directory structure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/bin This directory is populated
with the cvs binary that is found on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib This directory is populated
with all the libraries that are required for running
programs in the /bin directory as well as some predefined
required libraries that are <br>
present on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev Here null and zero devices
are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc In this directory a passwd
file is created that is used for matching user id&rsquo;s
with usernames. The root and cvsd user are added to this
file if they&rsquo;re not there yet. The <br>
passwd file is checked for consistency with the system
/etc/passwd to prevent mistakes. The passwd file is also
populated with users referenced in the repository <br>
directories. Note that no password data from /etc/passwd or
any other file is stored in the generated passwd file, all
password entries are set to &acirc;x&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr Here symbolic links are
placed to /bin and /lib for some common library and binary
directories found on the system. This is done for systems
that have hard-coded paths <br>
for libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/libexec and /usr/libexec <br>
Symbolic links for these directories are created if they are
present on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp This directory is cleaned
out on systems that have tmpreaper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the directories are
created and populated ownership and rights are set to a
reasonable value (root:root,umask=022).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
cvsd-buildroot takes one argument, namely a directory in
which the chroot jail will be created. The directory should
be specified with an absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Creating a chroot environment is a terribly non-portable
thing to do and therefore you may experience problems with
missing libraries and system files. For more information see
<br>
the FAQ and the README. If you have to install libraries or
perform actions not covered by cvsd-buildroot please report
your findings to
&lt;cvsd-users@lists.arthurdejong.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rerunning cvsd-buildroot after
you have created your repository is advised since the
repositories are checked for references to userid&rsquo;s
and lockfile directories.</p>
