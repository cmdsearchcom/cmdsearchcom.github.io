<p style="margin-top: 1em">tipc link monitor list <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options (flags) that can be passed anywhere in the command
chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show help about last valid command. For example tipc link
--help will show link help and tipc --help will show general
help. The position of the option in the string is <br>
irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Link statistics <br>
ACTIVE link state <br>
An ACTIVE link is serving traffic. Two links to the same
node can become ACTIVE if they have the same link priority.
If there is more than two links with the same prior&acirc;
<br>
ity the additional links will be put in STANDBY state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDBY link state <br>
A STANDBY link has lower link priority than an ACTIVE link.
A STANDBY link has control traffic flowing and is ready to
take over should the ACTIVE link(s) go down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MTU <br>
The Maximum Transmission Unit. The two endpoints advertise
their default or configured MTU at initial link setup and
will agree to use the lower of the two values should <br>
they differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packets <br>
The total amount of transmitted or received TIPC packets on
a link. Including fragmented and bundled packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fragments <br>
Represented in the form fragments/fragmented. Where
fragmented is the amount of data messages which have been
broken into fragments. Subsequently the fragments are the
<br>
total amount of packets that the fragmented messages has
been broken into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bundles <br>
Represented in the form bundles/bundled. If a link becomes
congested the link will attempt to bundle data from small
bundled packets into bundles of full MTU size packets <br>
before they are transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Profile <br>
Shows the average packet size in octets/bytes for a sample
of packets. It also shows the packet size distribution of
the sampled packets in the intervals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0-64 bytes <br>
64-256 bytes <br>
256-1024 bytes <br>
1024-4096 bytes <br>
4096-16384 bytes <br>
16384-32768 bytes <br>
32768-66000 bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message counters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">states - Number of link state
messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">probes - Link state messages
with probe flag set. Typically sent when a link is idle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nacks - Number of negative
acknowledgement (NACK) packets sent and received by the
link</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defs - Number of packets
received out of order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dups - Number of duplicate
packets received</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Congestion link <br>
The number of times an application has tried to send data
when the TIPC link was congested</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send queue <br>
Max is the maximum amount of messages that has resided in
the out queue during the statistics collection period of a
link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avg is the average outqueue size
during the lifetime of a link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link properties <br>
priority <br>
The priority between logical TIPC links to a particular
node. Link priority can range from 0 (lowest) to 31
(highest).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tolerance <br>
Link tolerance specifies the maximum time in milliseconds
that TIPC will allow a communication problem to exist before
taking the link down. The default value is 1500 mil&acirc;
<br>
liseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">window <br>
The link window controls how many unacknowledged messages a
link endpoint can have in its transmit queue before
TIPC&rsquo;s congestion control mechanism is activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monitor properties <br>
threshold <br>
The threshold specifies the cluster size exceeding which the
link monitoring algorithm will switch from
&quot;full-mesh&quot; to &quot;overlapping-ring&quot;. If
set of 0 the overlapping- <br>
ring monitoring is always on and if set to a value larger
than anticipated cluster size the overlapping-ring is
disabled. The default value is 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monitor information <br>
table_generation <br>
Represents the event count in a node&rsquo;s local
monitoring list. It steps every time something changes in
the local monitor list, including changes in the local
domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cluster_size <br>
Represents the current count of cluster members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">algorithm <br>
The current supervision algorithm used for neighbour
monitoring for the bearer. Possible values are full-mesh or
overlapping-ring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
The node status derived by the local node. Possible status
are up or down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitored <br>
Represent the type of monitoring chosen by the local node.
Possible values are direct or indirect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generation <br>
Represents the domain generation which is the event count in
a node&rsquo;s local domain. Every time something changes
(peer add/remove/up/down) the domain generation is stepped
<br>
and a new version of node record is sent to inform the
neighbors about this change. The domain generation helps the
receiver of a domain record to know if it should ignore <br>
or process the record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">applied_node_status <br>
The node status reported by the peer node for the succeeding
peers in the node list. The Node list is a circular list of
ascending addresses starting with the local node. <br>
Possible status are: U or D. The status U implies up and D
down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[non_applied_node:status] <br>
Represents the nodes and their status as reported by the
peer node. These nodes were not applied to the monitoring
list for this peer node. They are usually transient <br>
and occur during the cluster startup phase or network
reconfiguration. Possible status are: U or D. The status U
implies up and D down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
tipc link monitor list <br>
Shows the link monitoring information for cluster members on
device data0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tipc link monitor summary <br>
The monitor summary command prints the basic attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive
integer upon failure.</p>
