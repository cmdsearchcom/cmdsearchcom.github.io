<p>PAM(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PAM, pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to
Linux-PAM. For more information the reader is directed to
the Linux-PAM system administrators&rsquo; guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux-PAM is a system of
libraries that handle the authentication tasks of
applications (services) on the system. The library provides
a stable general interface (Application <br>
Programming Interface - API) that privilege granting
programs (such as login(1) and su(1)) defer to to perform
standard authentication tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The principal feature of the PAM
approach is that the nature of the authentication is
dynamically configurable. In other words, the system
administrator is free to choose how <br>
individual service-providing applications will authenticate
users. This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of
the single Linux-PAM configuration file /etc/pam.conf. <br>
Alternatively, the configuration can be set by individual
configuration files located in the /etc/pam.d/ directory.
The presence of this directory will cause Linux-PAM to <br>
ignore/etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vendor-supplied PAM
configuration files might be installed in the system
directory /usr/lib/pam.d/ instead of the machine
configuration directory /etc/pam.d/. If no machine <br>
configuration file is found, the vendor-supplied file is
used. All files in /etc/pam.d/ override files with the same
name in /usr/lib/pam.d/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the point of view of the
system administrator, for whom this manual is provided, it
is not of primary importance to understand the internal
behavior of the Linux-PAM <br>
library. The important point to recognize is that the
configuration file(s) define the connection between
applications (services) and the pluggable authentication
modules (PAMs) <br>
that perform the actual authentication tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux-PAM separates the tasks of
authentication into four independent management groups:
account management; authentication management; password
management; and session <br>
management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these
groups in the configuration file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simply put, these groups take
care of different aspects of a typical user&rsquo;s request
for a restricted service:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account - provide account
verification types of service: has the user&rsquo;s password
expired?; is this user permitted access to the requested
service?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authentication - authenticate a
user and set up user credentials. Typically this is via some
challenge-response request that the user must satisfy: if
you are who you claim to be <br>
please enter your password. Not all authentications are of
this type, there exist hardware based authentication schemes
(such as the use of smart-cards and biometric devices), <br>
with suitable modules, these may be substituted seamlessly
for more standard approaches to authentication - such is the
flexibility of Linux-PAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password - this group&rsquo;s
responsibility is the task of updating authentication
mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly coupled to
those of the auth group. Some <br>
authentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being
updated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based
access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement
<br>
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session - this group of tasks
cover things that should be done prior to a service being
given and after it is withdrawn. Such tasks include the
maintenance of audit trails and <br>
the mounting of the user&rsquo;s home directory. The session
management group is important as it provides both an opening
and closing hook for modules to affect the services
available <br>
to a user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/pam.conf <br>
the configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/pam.d <br>
the Linux-PAM configuration directory. Generally, if this
directory is present, the /etc/pam.conf file is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/pam.d <br>
the Linux-PAM vendor configuration directory. Files in
/etc/pam.d override files with the same name in this
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
Typically errors generated by the Linux-PAM system of
libraries, will be written to syslog(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFORMING TO <br>
DCE-RFC 86.0, October 1995. Contains additional features,
but remains backwardly compatible with this RFC.</p>
