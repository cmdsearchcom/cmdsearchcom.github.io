<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_write_and_verify - send the SCSI WRITE AND VERIFY
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_write_verify [--16] [--bytchk=BC] [--dpo] [--group=GN]
[--help] [--ilen=ILEN] [--in=IF] --lba=LBA [--num=NUM]
[--repeat] [--timeout=TO] [--verbose] [--version]
[--wrpro&acirc; <br>
tect=WP] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Send a SCSI WRITE AND VERIFY (10) or (16) command to DEVICE.
The data to be written is read from the IF file or, in its
absence, a buffer full of 0xff bytes is used. The length
<br>
of the data-out buffer sent with the command is ILEN bytes
or, if that is not given, then it is the length of the IF
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The write operation is to the
DEVICE&rsquo;s medium (optionally to its cache) starting at
logical block address LBA for NUM logical blocks. After the
write to medium is performed a <br>
verify operation takes place which may viewed as a medium
read (with appropriate checks) but without the data being
returned. Additionally, if BS is set to one, the data read
<br>
back from the medium in the verify operation is compared to
the original data-out buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The relationship between the
number of logical blocks to be written (i.e. NUM) and the
length (in bytes) of the data-out buffer (i.e. ILEN) may be
simply found by multiplying <br>
the former by the logical block size. However if the DEVICE
has protection information (PI) then it becomes a bit more
complicated. Hence the calculation is left to the user with
<br>
the default ILEN, in the absence of the IF file, being set
to NUM * 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For sending large amounts of
data to contiguous logical blocks, a single WRITE AND VERIFY
command may not be appropriate (e.g. due to operating system
limitations). In such cases <br>
see the REPEAT section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. The options are arranged in alphabetical order based
on the long option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --16 <br>
Send a WRITE AND VERIFY(16) command. The default is to send
a WRITE AND VERIFY(10) command unless LBA or NUM are too
large for the 10 byte variant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bytchk=BC <br>
where BC is the value to place in the command&rsquo;s BYTCHK
field. Values between 0 and 3 (inclusive) are accepted. The
default is value is 0 which implies only a write to the <br>
medium then a verify operation are performed. The only other
value T10 defines currently is 1 which does performs an
additional comparison between the data-out buffer that <br>
was used by the write operation and the contents of the
logical blocks read back from the medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dpo <br>
Set the DPO (disable page out) bit in the command. The
default is to leave it clear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --group=GN <br>
where GN is the value to place in the command&rsquo;s GROUP
NUMBER field. Values between 0 and 31 (inclusive) are
accepted. The default is value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --ilen=ILEN <br>
where ILEN is the number of bytes that will be placed in the
data-out buffer. If the IF file is given then no more than
ILEN bytes are read from that file. If the IF file <br>
does not contain ILEN bytes then an error is reported. If
the IF file is not given then a data-out buffer with ILEN
bytes of 0xff is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --in=IF <br>
read data (binary) from file named IF. If IF is
&quot;-&quot; then stdin is used. This data will become the
data-out buffer and will be written to the DEVICE&rsquo;s
medium. If BC is 1 <br>
then that data-out buffer will be held until after the
verify operation and compared to the data read back from the
medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lba=LBA <br>
where LBA is the logical block address to start the write to
medium. Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed with
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; or has a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;. Must be
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --num=NUM <br>
where NUM is the number of blocks, starting at LBA, to write
to the medium. The default value for NUM is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --repeat <br>
this option will continue to do WRITE AND VERIFY commands
until the IF file is exhausted. This option requires both
the --ilen=ILEN and --in=IF options to be given. Each <br>
command starts at the next logical block address and is for
no more than NUM blocks. The last command may be shorter
with the number of blocks scaled as required. If there <br>
are residue bytes a warning is sent to stderr. See the
REPEAT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout=TO <br>
where TO is the command timeout value in seconds. The
default value is 60 seconds. If NUM is large then command
may require considerably more time than 60 seconds to
com&acirc; <br>
plete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
output version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wrprotect=WP <br>
set the WRPROTECT field in the cdb to WP. The default value
is 0 which implies no protection information is sent (along
with the user data) in the data-out buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPEAT <br>
For data sizes around a megabyte and larger, it may be
appropriate to send multiple SCSI WRITE AND VERIFY commands
due to operating system limitations (e.g. pass-through SCSI
<br>
interfaces often limit the amount of data that can be passed
with a SCSI command). With this utility the mechanism for
doing that is the --repeat option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode the --ilen=ILEN and
--in=IF options must be given. The ILEN and NUM values are
treated as a per SCSI command parameters. Up to ILEN bytes
will be read from the IF <br>
file continually until it is exhausted. If the IF file is
stdin, reading continues until an EOF is detected. The data
read from each iteration becomes the data-out buffer for a
<br>
new WRITE AND VERIFY command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last read from the file (or
stdin) may read less than ILEN bytes in which case the
number of logical blocks sent to the last WRITE AND VERIFY
is scaled back accordingly. If <br>
there is a residual number of bytes left after that scaling
then that is reported to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurs then that is
reported to stderr and via the exit status and the utility
stops at that point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Other SCSI WRITE commands have a Force Unit Access (FUA) bit
but that is set (implicitly) by WRITE AND VERIFY commands
hence there is no option to set it. The data-out buffer may
<br>
still additionally be placed in the DEVICE&rsquo;s cache and
setting the DPO bit is a hint not to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal SCSI WRITEs can be done
with the ddpt and the sg_dd utilities. The SCSI WRITE SAME
command can be done with the sg_write_same utility while the
SCSI COMPARE AND WRITE com&acirc; <br>
mand (sg_compare_and_write utility) offers a &quot;test and
set&quot; facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various numeric arguments (e.g.
LBA) may include multiplicative suffixes or be given in
hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section
in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_write_verify is 0 when it is
successful. If the verify operation fails that is typically
indicated with a medium error which leads to an exit status
of 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If BC is set to 1 and the
comparison it causes fails this utility will indicate the
miscompare with an exit status of 14. For other exit status
values see the EXIT STATUS section <br>
in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To start with, a simple example: write 1 block of data held
in file t.bin that is 512 bytes long then write that block
to LBA 0x1234 on /dev/sg4 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_write_verify --lba=0x1234
--in=t.bin /dev/sg4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since &rsquo;--num=&rsquo; is
not given then it defaults to 1. Further the ILEN value is
obtained from the file size of t.bin . To additionally do a
data-out comparison to the read back <br>
data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_write_verify -l 0x1234 -i
t.bin --bytchk=1 /dev/sg4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ddpt command can do copies
between SCSI devices using READ and WRITE commands. However,
currently it has no facility to promote those WRITES to
WRITE AND VERIFY commands. <br>
Using a pipe, that could be done like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ddpt if=/dev/sg2 bs=512 bpt=8
count=11 of=- | <br>
sg_write_verify --in=- -l 0x567 -n 8 --ilen=4096 --repeat
/dev/sg4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both ddpt and sg_write_verify
are configured for segments of 8 512 byte logical blocks.
Since 11 logical blocks are read then first 8 logical blocks
are copied followed by a copy <br>
of the remaining 3 blocks. Since it is assumed that there is
no protection information then the data-in and data-out
buffers will be 4096 bytes each. For sg_write_verify this
<br>
needs to be stated explicitly with the --ilen=4096
option.</p>
