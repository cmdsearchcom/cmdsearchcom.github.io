<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
imapd - The Courier IMAP server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/lib/courier/couriertcpd {couriertcpd options}
{/usr/sbin/imaplogin} [modules...] {/usr/bin/imapd}
{./Maildir}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/imapd {./Maildir}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
imapd is the Courier IMAP server that provides IMAP access
to Maildir mailboxes. Normally you don&rsquo;t have to worry
about it, as imapd runs automatically after receiving a
network <br>
connection, accompanied by the appropriate userid and
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd opens network ports
that receive incoming IMAP connections. After an incoming
network connections is established, couriertcpd runs the
command specified by its first <br>
argument, which is imaplogin passing the remaining arguments
to imaplogin. imaplogin reads the IMAP login userid and
password, then runs the modules specified by its remaining
<br>
options, which are Courier server authentication modules
described in the authlib(7)[1] manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last daisy-chained command
is imapd, which is the actual IMAP server, which is started
from the logged-in account&rsquo;s home directory. The sole
argument to imapd is the pathname <br>
to the default IMAP mailbox, which is usually ./Maildir.
Some authentication modules are capable of specifying a
different filename, by setting the MAILDIR environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imapd may also be invoked from
the shell prompt, in which case it issues a PREAUTH
response, then changes the current directory to either its
argument, or the contents of the <br>
MAILDIR environment variable, then attempts to talk IMAP on
standard input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imapd implements IMAP4REV1, as
defined by RFC 2060[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<br>
AUTH* <br>
imapd examines several environment variables whose names
start with AUTH - these environment variables are set by
imaplogin and the authentication modules. Their absence <br>
tells imapd that it&rsquo;s running from the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILDIR <br>
MAILDIR - if defined, imapd changes its directory to the one
specified by this environment variable. Otherwise imapd
changes its directory to the one specified on the command
<br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;pwd&lsquo;/. <br>
The current directory is assumed to be the main INBOX
Maildir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;pwd&lsquo;/.folder <br>
Maildir folders, each one containing their own tmp, new,
cur, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other environment variables are
initialized from the /etc/courier/imapd and
/etc/courier/imapd-ssl configuration files. These files are
loaded into the environment by the system <br>
startup script that runs couriertcpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Realtime concurrent folder
status updates <br>
Setting the IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE to 1 in /etc/courier/imapd
enables realtime concurrent folder status updates. When
relatime folder status updates are enabled all IMAP mail
clients <br>
that have the same folder open will be immediately notified
of any changes to the folder&rsquo;s contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Courier IMAP server always
allows more than one mail client to have the same folder
opened. However, when two or more clients have the same
folder opened, the mail clients <br>
may not necessarily know when another client added or
removed messages from the folder. The base IMAP protocol
specification requires IMAP mail clients to explicitly check
for <br>
any changes to the folder&rsquo;s contents. No provisions
exists to notify the mail client immediately when the
folder&rsquo;s contents are modified by another mail
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IDLE extension to the base
IMAP protocol provides a delivery mechanism for notifying
mail clients of changes to the mail folder&rsquo;s contents.
Although at this time it&rsquo;s not <br>
known to which extent the IDLE extension is supported by
IMAP mail clients, the Courier IMAP server fully implements
the IDLE extension provided that the following requirements
<br>
are met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gamin or FAM <br>
Either Gamin[3] or FAM[4] must be properly installed and
configured prior to installing the Courier IMAP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gamin/FAM is an application
library that provides an interface to the operating
system&rsquo;s kernel that applications can use to be
notified when specific files or directories <br>
are changed, and the Courier IMAP server leverages this API
to implement realtime concurrent folder status updates.
According to the most recently available documentation, <br>
Gamin is a Linux-specific library, and FAM builds and runs
on Linux and IRIX. FAM should also build on other platforms,
but without a supported kernel monitor FAM will fall <br>
back to a polling mode. At press time, FAM&rsquo;s web site
reports that FAM succesfully builds (in polling mode) on
FreeBSD and Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAM (but not Gamin) also works
with NFS filesystems. On NFS clients fam transparently
forwards file monitoring requests to a peer fam process on
the NFS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and configuration
of Gamin or FAM is beyond the scope of this document. This
documentation presumes that Gamin or FAM is succesfully
installed. Use the resources <br>
and tools on Gamin&rsquo;s or FAM&rsquo;s web site for
assistance with setting them up. Systems that use GNOME or
KDE desktops already have FAM or Gamin installed, as FAM or
Gamin is <br>
used by the current versions of both desktops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDLE IMAP capability <br>
IDLE must be listed in the IMAP_CAPABILITY setting in the
/etc/courier/imapd configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAP_USELOCKS <br>
This setting in /etc/courier/imapd must be enabled. This
setting uses dot-lock files to synchronize updates to folder
indexes between multiple IMAP clients that have the same
<br>
folder opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting is safe to use with
NFS, as it does not use actual file locking calls, and does
not require the services of the problematic NFS lock
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An IMAP mail client that fully
supports the IDLE protocol extension. <br>
Of course, an IMAP client that supports the IDLE protocol
extension is required. At press time the status and extent
of IDLE support in most IMAP mail clients is not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE <br>
This setting in /etc/courier/imapd actually enables
concurrent realtime folder status updates using the IDLE
extension. Note that it is possible to enable the IDLE
extension <br>
even if FAM or Gamin is not available, or without enabling
either the IMAP_USELOCKS and/or IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE settings.
The resulting consequences are described are as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Without IMAP_USERLOCKS there
exists a small possibility that multiple mail clients will
receive a slightly inconsistent folder index if both clients
try to update the <br>
contents of the folder at the same time. Usually, the worst
case result is that some clients will eventually end up
downloading the same message twice from the server, <br>
and caching it incorrectly in the local cache (if the IMAP
client caches message contents). Clearing the local message
cache will quickly eliminate any residual confusion <br>
that results from this situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Without FAM or Gamin, and
IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE set, the Courier IMAP server will manually
check for changes to the folder&rsquo;s contents every 60
seconds, in IDLE mode (instead <br>
of in real time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verifying realtime concurrent
folder status updates <br>
Use the following procedure to verify that realtime
concurrent folder status updates are properly working. It is
helpful to be familiar with the IMAP protocol. If
that&rsquo;s not the <br>
case, just be extra careful in entering the IMAP protocol
commands. The following instructions describe the procedure
for connecting to the IMAP server, and manually issuing IMAP
<br>
protocol commands, as if they originate from an IMAP client.
The following instructions use &quot;C:&quot; to indicate
IMAP client commands that must be entered, and
&quot;S:&quot; to indicate the <br>
expected replies from the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The actual replies from the server may differ slightly, due
to the actual server configuration, and other minor factors.
The following examples have long lines wrapped for <br>
readability. Slight observed differences from the expected
replies are normal, but they should still be substantively
the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Prepare a test account with a
couple of messages. Open two or three terminal windows. In
each window, connect to the IMAP server, and enter IDLE
mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S:* OK Courier-IMAP ready.
Copyright 1998-2002 Double Precision, Inc. <br>
See COPYING for distribution information. <br>
C:a login userid password <br>
S:a OK LOGIN Ok. <br>
C:a SELECT INBOX <br>
S:* FLAGS ( * 2 EXISTS <br>
* 0 RECENT <br>
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 939609418] Ok <br>
a OK [READ-WRITE] Ok <br>
C:a IDLE <br>
S:+ entering ENHANCED idle mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The default Courier IMAP server configuration permits a
maximum of four connections from the same IP address. It may
be necessary to adjust this setting in <br>
/etc/courier/imapd for the duration of this test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The last message from the
server must be &quot;entering ENHANCED idle mode&quot;.
Otherwise, it means that some of the necessary prerequisites
have not been met. Verify that FAM or <br>
Gamin was set up prior to installing The Courier IMAP server
(use ldd(1) to verify that the imapd executable is linked
with the libfam library), and verify the settings in <br>
the /etc/courier/imapd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Open another terminal window,
connect to the server, and modify the flags of one of the
messages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S:* OK Courier-IMAP ready.
Copyright 1998-2002 Double Precision, Inc. <br>
See COPYING for distribution information. <br>
C:a login userid password <br>
S:a OK LOGIN Ok. <br>
C:a SELECT INBOX <br>
S:* FLAGS ( * 2 EXISTS <br>
* 0 RECENT <br>
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 939609418] Ok <br>
a OK [READ-WRITE] Ok <br>
C:STORE 1 +FLAGS (ted) <br>
* 1 FETCH (FLAGS (ted)) <br>
a OK STORE completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The last command sets the ted
flag on the first message in the folder. Immediately after
entering the last command, &quot;* 1 FETCH (FLAGS
(ted))&quot; should also appear in <br>
all other terminal windows. On systems where FAM uses the
fall-back polling mode this response may appear after a
brief delay of a few seconds. The delay should never exceed
<br>
15-20 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Verify that all terminal
windows reliably receive folder status updates in real time
by alternatively entering the commands &quot;a STORE 1
-FLAGS (ted)&quot; and &quot;a STORE 1 <br>
+FLAGS (ted)&quot;, to toggle the deleted flag on the first
message. Observe that the message is received by all
terminal windows quickly, and reliably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. With the ted flag set on the
first message, enter the EXPUNGE command, which removes the
deleted message from the folder:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C:a EXPUNGE <br>
S:* 1 EXPUNGE <br>
* 2 EXISTS <br>
* 0 RECENT <br>
S:a OK EXPUNGE completed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lines that begin with the
&quot;*&quot; character should also appear in all other
terminal windows (depending on the initial folder state one
of the terminal windows may have a <br>
different RECENT message, which is fine).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Use a mail client to create
and send a test message to the test account. As soon as the
mail server delivers the message, the following messages
should appear in every <br>
terminal window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 3 EXISTS <br>
* 0 RECENT <br>
* 3 FETCH (FLAGS ())</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The numbers in these messages
may be different, depending upon the initial contents of the
test mail folder. One of the terminal windows should have a
different RECENT count, <br>
and one of the terminal windows should include a lag in the
untagged FLAGS message. These difference are acceptable; the
important thing is to make sure that all <br>
terminal windows have the same EXISTS message.</p>
