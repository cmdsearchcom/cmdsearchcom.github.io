<b>imapd</b> is the Courier IMAP server that provides IMAP access to Maildir
  mailboxes. Normally you don't have to worry about it, as <b>imapd</b> runs
  automatically after receiving a network connection, accompanied by the
  appropriate userid and password.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>couriertcpd</b> opens network ports that receive incoming IMAP connections.
  After an incoming network connections is established, <b>couriertcpd</b> runs
  the command specified by its first argument, which is <b>imaplogin</b> passing
  the remaining arguments to <b>imaplogin</b>. <b>imaplogin</b> reads the IMAP
  login userid and password, then runs the modules specified by its remaining
  options, which are Courier server authentication modules described in the
  <b></b> <b>authlib</b>(7)[1] manual page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The last daisy-chained command is <b>imapd</b>, which is the actual IMAP server,
  which is started from the logged-in account's home directory. The sole
  argument to <b>imapd</b> is the pathname to the default IMAP mailbox, which is
  usually ./Maildir. Some authentication modules are capable of specifying a
  different filename, by setting the <b>MAILDIR</b> environment variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>imapd</b> may also be invoked from the shell prompt, in which case it issues
  a PREAUTH response, then changes the current directory to either its argument,
  or the contents of the <b>MAILDIR</b> environment variable, then attempts to
  talk IMAP on standard input and output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>imapd</b> implements IMAP4REV1, as defined by <b>RFC 2060</b>[2].
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES_AND_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES_AND_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">FILES
  AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</a></h1>
<b>AUTH*</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><b>imapd</b> examines several environment
  variables whose names start with AUTH - these environment variables are set by
  <b>imaplogin</b> and the authentication modules. Their absence tells
  <b>imapd</b> that it's running from the command line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>MAILDIR</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><b>MAILDIR</b> - if defined, <b>imapd</b>
  changes its directory to the one specified by this environment variable.
  Otherwise <b>imapd</b> changes its directory to the one specified on the
  command line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>pwd</b>`/.
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The current directory is assumed to be the
  main INBOX Maildir.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>pwd</b>`/.<i>folder</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Maildir folders, each one containing their own
  tmp, new, cur, etc...</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other environment variables are initialized from the /etc/courier/imapd and
  /etc/courier/imapd-ssl configuration files. These files are loaded into the
  environment by the system startup script that runs <b>couriertcpd</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Realtime_concurrent_folder_status_updates"><a class="selflink" href="#Realtime_concurrent_folder_status_updates">Realtime
  concurrent folder status updates</a></h2>
Setting the IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE to 1 in /etc/courier/imapd enables realtime
  concurrent folder status updates. When relatime folder status updates are
  enabled all IMAP mail clients that have the same folder open will be
  immediately notified of any changes to the folder's contents.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Courier IMAP server always allows more than one mail client to have the same
  folder opened. However, when two or more clients have the same folder opened,
  the mail clients may not necessarily know when another client added or removed
  messages from the folder. The base IMAP protocol specification requires IMAP
  mail clients to explicitly check for any changes to the folder's contents. No
  provisions exists to notify the mail client immediately when the folder's
  contents are modified by another mail client.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The IDLE extension to the base IMAP protocol provides a delivery mechanism for
  notifying mail clients of changes to the mail folder's contents. Although at
  this time it's not known to which extent the IDLE extension is supported by
  IMAP mail clients, the Courier IMAP server fully implements the IDLE extension
  provided that the following requirements are met:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Gamin or FAM
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Either <b>Gamin</b>[3] or <b>FAM</b>[4] must
  be properly installed and configured prior to installing the Courier IMAP
  server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Gamin/FAM is an application library that provides an interface to the operating
  system's kernel that applications can use to be notified when specific files
  or directories are changed, and the Courier IMAP server leverages this API to
  implement realtime concurrent folder status updates. According to the most
  recently available documentation, Gamin is a Linux-specific library, and FAM
  builds and runs on Linux and IRIX. FAM should also build on other platforms,
  but without a supported kernel monitor FAM will fall back to a polling mode.
  At press time, FAM's web site reports that FAM succesfully builds (in polling
  mode) on FreeBSD and Solaris.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
FAM (but not Gamin) also works with NFS filesystems. On NFS clients <b>fam</b>
  transparently forwards file monitoring requests to a peer <b>fam</b> process
  on the NFS server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Installation and configuration of Gamin or FAM is beyond the scope of this
  document. This documentation presumes that Gamin or FAM is succesfully
  installed. Use the resources and tools on Gamin's or FAM's web site for
  assistance with setting them up. Systems that use GNOME or KDE desktops
  already have FAM or Gamin installed, as FAM or Gamin is used by the current
  versions of both desktops.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
IDLE IMAP capability
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">IDLE must be listed in the
  <b>IMAP_CAPABILITY</b> setting in the /etc/courier/imapd configuration
  file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>IMAP_USELOCKS</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This setting in /etc/courier/imapd must be
  enabled. This setting uses dot-lock files to synchronize updates to folder
  indexes between multiple IMAP clients that have the same folder opened.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This setting is safe to use with NFS, as it does not use actual file locking
  calls, and does not require the services of the problematic NFS lock
  daemon.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An IMAP mail client that fully supports the IDLE protocol extension.
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Of course, an IMAP client that supports the
  IDLE protocol extension is required. At press time the status and extent of
  IDLE support in most IMAP mail clients is not known.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This setting in /etc/courier/imapd actually
  enables concurrent realtime folder status updates using the IDLE extension.
  Note that it is possible to enable the IDLE extension even if FAM or Gamin is
  not available, or without enabling either the <b>IMAP_USELOCKS</b> and/or
  <b>IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE</b> settings. The resulting consequences are described
  are as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.Without <b>IMAP_USERLOCKS</b> there exists
  a small possibility that multiple mail clients will receive a slightly
  inconsistent folder index if both clients try to update the contents of the
  folder at the same time. Usually, the worst case result is that some clients
  will eventually end up downloading the same message twice from the server, and
  caching it incorrectly in the local cache (if the IMAP client caches message
  contents). Clearing the local message cache will quickly eliminate any
  residual confusion that results from this situation.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.Without FAM or Gamin, and
  <b>IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE</b> set, the Courier IMAP server will manually check for
  changes to the folder's contents every 60 seconds, in IDLE mode (instead of in
  real time).</div>
</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Verifying_realtime_concurrent_folder_status_updates"><a class="selflink" href="#Verifying_realtime_concurrent_folder_status_updates">Verifying
  realtime concurrent folder status updates</a></h2>
Use the following procedure to verify that realtime concurrent folder status
  updates are properly working. It is helpful to be familiar with the IMAP
  protocol. If that's not the case, just be extra careful in entering the IMAP
  protocol commands. The following instructions describe the procedure for
  connecting to the IMAP server, and manually issuing IMAP protocol commands, as
  if they originate from an IMAP client. The following instructions use
  &quot;C:&quot; to indicate IMAP client commands that must be entered, and
  &quot;S:&quot; to indicate the expected replies from the server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The actual replies from the server may differ slightly, due to the actual server
  configuration, and other minor factors. The following examples have long lines
  wrapped for readability. Slight observed differences from the expected replies
  are normal, but they should still be substantively the same.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.Prepare a test account with a couple of
  messages. Open two or three terminal windows. In each window, connect to the
  IMAP server, and enter IDLE mode:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">

</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The default Courier IMAP server configuration permits a maximum of four
  connections from the same IP address. It may be necessary to adjust this
  setting in /etc/courier/imapd for the duration of this test.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.The last message from the server must be
  &quot;entering ENHANCED idle mode&quot;. Otherwise, it means that some of the
  necessary prerequisites have not been met. Verify that FAM or Gamin was set up
  prior to installing The Courier IMAP server (use <b>ldd</b>(1) to verify that
  the <b>imapd</b> executable is linked with the libfam library), and verify the
  settings in the /etc/courier/imapd.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 3.Open another terminal window, connect to
  the server, and modify the flags of one of the messages:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
S:* OK Courier-IMAP ready. Copyright 1998-2002 Double Precision, Inc.
  See COPYING for distribution information.
C:a login  <i>userid</i> <i>password</i>
S:a OK LOGIN Ok.
C:a SELECT INBOX
S:* FLAGS (\Draft \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Recent)
  * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Draft \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen)]
    Limited
  * 2 EXISTS
  * 0 RECENT
  * OK [UIDVALIDITY 939609418] Ok
  a OK [READ-WRITE] Ok
C:STORE 1 +FLAGS (\Deleted)
* 1 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted))
a OK STORE completed.
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 4.The last command sets the \Deleted flag on
  the first message in the folder. Immediately after entering the last command,
  &quot;* 1 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted))&quot; should also appear in all other
  terminal windows. On systems where FAM uses the fall-back polling mode this
  response may appear after a brief delay of a few seconds. The delay should
  never exceed 15-20 seconds.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 5.Verify that all terminal windows reliably
  receive folder status updates in real time by alternatively entering the
  commands &quot;a STORE 1 -FLAGS (\Deleted)&quot; and &quot;a STORE 1 +FLAGS
  (\Deleted)&quot;, to toggle the deleted flag on the first message. Observe
  that the message is received by all terminal windows quickly, and
  reliably.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 6.With the \Deleted flag set on the first
  message, enter the <b>EXPUNGE</b> command, which removes the deleted message
  from the folder:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
C:a EXPUNGE
S:* 1 EXPUNGE
  * 2 EXISTS
  * 0 RECENT
S:a OK EXPUNGE completed
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The lines that begin with the &quot;*&quot; character should also appear in all
  other terminal windows (depending on the initial folder state one of the
  terminal windows may have a different RECENT message, which is fine).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 7.Use a mail client to create and send a test
  message to the test account. As soon as the mail server delivers the message,
  the following messages should appear in every terminal window:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
* 3 EXISTS
* 0 RECENT
* 3 FETCH (FLAGS ())
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The numbers in these messages may be different, depending upon the initial
  contents of the test mail folder. One of the terminal windows should have a
  different RECENT count, and one of the terminal windows should include a
  \Recent flag in the untagged FLAGS message. These difference are acceptable;
  the important thing is to make sure that all terminal windows have the same
  EXISTS message.</div>
