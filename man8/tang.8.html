<p>TANG(8) TANG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tang - Network-Based Cryptographic Binding Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
Tang is a service for binding cryptographic keys to network
presence. It offers a secure, stateless, anonymous
alternative to key escrow services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tang project arose as a tool
to help the automation of decryption. Existing mechanisms
predominantly use key escrow systems where a client encrypts
some data with a symmetric <br>
key and stores the symmetric key in a remote server for
later retrieval. The desired goal of this setup is that the
client can automatically decrypt the data when it is able to
<br>
contact the escrow server and fetch the key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, escrow servers have
many additional requirements, including authentication (so
that clients can&Acirc;&acute;t get keys they
aren&Acirc;&acute;t suppossed to have) and transport
encryption (so <br>
that attackers listening on the network can&Acirc;&acute;t
eavesdrop on the keys in transit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tang avoids this complexity.
Instead of storing a symmetric key remotely, the client
performs an asymmetric key exchange with the Tang server.
Since the Tang server doesn&Acirc;&acute;t store <br>
or transport symmetric keys, neither authentication nor
encryption are required. Thus, Tang is completely stateless
and zero-configuration. Further, clients can be completely
<br>
anonymous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tang does not provide a client.
But it does export a simple REST API and it transfers only
standards compliant JSON Object Signing and Encryption
(JOSE) objects, allowing you to <br>
create your own clients using off the shelf components. For
an off-the-shelf automated encryption framework with support
for Tang, see the Clevis project. For the full technical
<br>
details of the Tang protocol, see the Tang
project&Acirc;&acute;s homepage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
Getting a Tang server up and running is simple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo systemctl enable
tangd.socket --now</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&Acirc;&acute;s it. The
server is now running with a fresh set of cryptographic keys
and will automatically start on the next reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Tang intends to be a minimal network service and therefore
does not have any configuration. To adjust the network
settings, you can override the tangd.socket unit file using
the <br>
standard systemd mechanisms. See systemd.unit(5) and
systemd.socket(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY ROTATION <br>
In order to preserve the security of the system over the
long run, you need to periodically rotate your keys. The
precise interval at which you should rotate depends upon
your <br>
application, key sizes and institutional policy. For some
common recommendations, see: https://www.keylength.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To rotate keys, first we need to
generate new keys in the key database directory. This is
typically /var/db/tang. For example, you can create new
signature and exchange keys with <br>
the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># DB=/var/db/tang <br>
# jose jwk gen -i
&Acirc;&acute;{&quot;alg&quot;:&quot;ES512&quot;}&Acirc;&acute;
-o $DB/new_sig.jwk <br>
# jose jwk gen -i
&Acirc;&acute;{&quot;alg&quot;:&quot;ECMR&quot;}&Acirc;&acute;
-o $DB/new_exc.jwk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, rename the old keys to
have a leading . in order to hide them from
advertisement:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># mv $DB/old_sig.jwk
$DB/.old_sig.jwk <br>
# mv $DB/old_exc.jwk $DB/.old_exc.jwk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tang will immediately pick up
all changes. No restart is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, new client
bindings will pick up the new keys and old clients can
continue to utilize the old keys. Once you are sure that all
the old clients have been migrated <br>
to use the new keys, you can remove the old keys. Be aware
that removing the old keys while clients are still using
them can result in data loss. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIGH PERFORMANCE <br>
The Tang protocol is extremely fast. However, in the default
setup we use systemd socket activiation to start one process
per connection. This imposes a performance overhead. For
<br>
most deployments, this is still probably quick enough, given
that Tang is extremely lightweight. But for larger
deployments, greater performance can be achieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Our recommendation for achieving
higher throughput is to proxy traffic to Tang through your
existing web services using a connection pool. Since there
is one process per connec&acirc; <br>
tion, keeping a number of connections open in this setup
will enable effective parallelism since there are no
internal locks in Tang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Apache, this is possible
using the ProxyPass directive of the mod_proxy module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIGH AVAILABILITY <br>
Tang provides two methods for building a high availability
deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Client redundency
(recommended)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Key sharing with DNS
round-robin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While it may be tempting to
share keys between Tang servers, this method should be
avoided. Sharing keys increases the risk of key compromise
and requires additional automation <br>
infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, clients should be coded
with the ability to bind to multiple Tang servers. In this
setup, each Tang server will have its own keys and clients
will be able to decrypt by <br>
contacting a subset of these servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clevis already supports this
workflow through its sss plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you still feel that
key sharing is the right deployment strategy, Tang will do
nothing to stop you. Just (securely!) transfer all the
contents of the database direc&acirc; <br>
tory to all your servers. Make sure you don&Acirc;&acute;t
forget the unadvertised keys! Then set up DNS round-robin so
that clients will be load balanced across your servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The Tang server provides no public commands.</p>
