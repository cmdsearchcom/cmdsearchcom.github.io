<b>tang</b> - Network-Based Cryptographic Binding Server
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
Tang is a service for binding cryptographic keys to network presence. It offers
  a secure, stateless, anonymous alternative to key escrow services.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Tang project arose as a tool to help the automation of decryption. Existing
  mechanisms predominantly use key escrow systems where a client encrypts some
  data with a symmetric key and stores the symmetric key in a remote server for
  later retrieval. The desired goal of this setup is that the client can
  automatically decrypt the data when it is able to contact the escrow server
  and fetch the key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, escrow servers have many additional requirements, including
  authentication (so that clients can&#x00B4;t get keys they aren&#x00B4;t
  suppossed to have) and transport encryption (so that attackers listening on
  the network can&#x00B4;t eavesdrop on the keys in transit).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tang avoids this complexity. Instead of storing a symmetric key remotely, the
  client performs an asymmetric key exchange with the Tang server. Since the
  Tang server doesn&#x00B4;t store or transport symmetric keys, neither
  authentication nor encryption are required. Thus, Tang is completely stateless
  and zero-configuration. Further, clients can be completely anonymous.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tang does not provide a client. But it does export a simple REST API and it
  transfers only standards compliant JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)
  objects, allowing you to create your own clients using off the shelf
  components. For an off-the-shelf automated encryption framework with support
  for Tang, see the Clevis project. For the full technical details of the Tang
  protocol, see the Tang project&#x00B4;s homepage.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
Getting a Tang server up and running is simple:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
$ sudo systemctl enable tangd.socket --now
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That&#x00B4;s it. The server is now running with a fresh set of cryptographic
  keys and will automatically start on the next reboot.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
Tang intends to be a minimal network service and therefore does not have any
  configuration. To adjust the network settings, you can override the
  <b>tangd.socket</b> unit file using the standard systemd mechanisms. See
  <b>systemd.unit</b>(5) and <b>systemd.socket</b>(5) for more information.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KEY_ROTATION"><a class="selflink" href="#KEY_ROTATION">KEY
  ROTATION</a></h1>
In order to preserve the security of the system over the long run, you need to
  periodically rotate your keys. The precise interval at which you should rotate
  depends upon your application, key sizes and institutional policy. For some
  common recommendations, see: https://www.keylength.com.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To rotate keys, first we need to generate new keys in the key database
  directory. This is typically <b>/var/db/tang</b>. For example, you can create
  new signature and exchange keys with the following commands:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
# DB=/var/db/tang
# jose jwk gen -i &#x00B4;{&quot;alg&quot;:&quot;ES512&quot;}&#x00B4; -o $DB/new_sig.jwk
# jose jwk gen -i &#x00B4;{&quot;alg&quot;:&quot;ECMR&quot;}&#x00B4; -o $DB/new_exc.jwk
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next, rename the old keys to have a leading <b>.</b> in order to hide them from
  advertisement:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
# mv $DB/old_sig.jwk $DB/.old_sig.jwk
# mv $DB/old_exc.jwk $DB/.old_exc.jwk
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tang will immediately pick up all changes. No restart is required.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At this point, new client bindings will pick up the new keys and old clients can
  continue to utilize the old keys. Once you are sure that all the old clients
  have been migrated to use the new keys, you can remove the old keys. Be aware
  that removing the old keys while clients are still using them can result in
  data loss. You have been warned.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HIGH_PERFORMANCE"><a class="selflink" href="#HIGH_PERFORMANCE">HIGH
  PERFORMANCE</a></h1>
The Tang protocol is extremely fast. However, in the default setup we use
  systemd socket activiation to start one process per connection. This imposes a
  performance overhead. For most deployments, this is still probably quick
  enough, given that Tang is extremely lightweight. But for larger deployments,
  greater performance can be achieved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Our recommendation for achieving higher throughput is to proxy traffic to Tang
  through your existing web services using a connection pool. Since there is one
  process per connection, keeping a number of connections open in this setup
  will enable effective parallelism since there are no internal locks in Tang.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For Apache, this is possible using the <b>ProxyPass</b> directive of the
  <b>mod_proxy</b> module.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HIGH_AVAILABILITY"><a class="selflink" href="#HIGH_AVAILABILITY">HIGH
  AVAILABILITY</a></h1>
Tang provides two methods for building a high availability deployment.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Client redundency (recommended)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Key sharing with DNS round-robin</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While it may be tempting to share keys between Tang servers, this method should
  be avoided. Sharing keys increases the risk of key compromise and requires
  additional automation infrastructure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead, clients should be coded with the ability to bind to multiple Tang
  servers. In this setup, each Tang server will have its own keys and clients
  will be able to decrypt by contacting a subset of these servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Clevis already supports this workflow through its <b>sss</b> plugin.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, if you still feel that key sharing is the right deployment strategy,
  Tang will do nothing to stop you. Just (securely!) transfer all the contents
  of the database directory to all your servers. Make sure you don&#x00B4;t
  forget the unadvertised keys! Then set up DNS round-robin so that clients will
  be load balanced across your servers.
