<p>SG_RESET(8) SG3_UTILS SG_RESET(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_reset - sends SCSI device, target, bus or host reset; or
checks reset state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_reset [--bus] [--device] [--help] [--host] [--no-esc]
[--target] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sg_reset utility with no options (just a DEVICE) reports
on the reset state (e.g. if a reset is underway) of the
DEVICE. When given a --device, --target, --bus or --host
<br>
option it requests a device, target, bus or host reset
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A device reset is applied to the
Logical Unit (LU) corresponding to DEVICE. It is most likely
implemented by a Low level Driver (LLD) in Linux as a
LOGICAL UNIT RESET task man&acirc; <br>
agement function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ability to reset a SCSI
target was added in Linux kernel 2.6.27 . A LLD may send Low
level Drivers (LLDs) the I_T NEXUS RESET task management
function. Alternatively it may <br>
use a transport mechanism to do the same thing (e.g. a hard
reset on the link containing a SAS target).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Linux kernel 2.6 and 3
series this utility can be called on sd, sr (cd/dvd), st or
sg device nodes; if the user has appropriate
permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of this utility can check
whether a reset recovery is already underway before trying
to send a new reset with this utility. Calling this utility
with no options, just the <br>
DEVICE, will do such a check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --bus <br>
attempt a SCSI bus reset. A bus reset is a SCSI Parallel
Interface (SPI) concept not found in modern transports. A
recent LLD may implement it as a series of resets on <br>
targets that might be considered as siblings to the target
on the DEVICE path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --device <br>
attempt a SCSI device reset. This would typically involve
sending a LOGICAL UNIT RESET task management function to
DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --host <br>
attempt a host reset. The &quot;host&quot; in this context
is often called a Host Bus Adapter (HBA) and contains one or
more SCSI initiators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-esc <br>
without this option, if a device reset (--device) fails then
it will escalate to a target reset. And if a target reset
(--target) fails then it will escalate to a bus <br>
reset. And if a bus reset (--bus) fails then it will
escalate to a host reset. With this option only the
requested reset is attempted. An alternate option name of
--no- <br>
escalate is also accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --target <br>
attempt a SCSI target reset. A SCSI target contains one or
more LUs. This would typically involve sending a I_T NEXUS
RESET task management function to DEVICE There may be <br>
a transport action that is equivalent (e.g. in SAS a hard
reset on the link that contains the target).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
prints the version string then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The error recovery code within the Linux kernel (SCSI
mid-level) when faced with a SCSI command timing out and no
response from the device (LU) does the following. First it
tries <br>
a device reset and if that is not successful tries a target
reset. If that is not successful it tries a bus reset. If
that is not successful it tries a host reset. The <br>
&quot;device,target,bus,host&quot; order is the reset
escalation that the --no-esc option attempts to stop. In
large storage configurations the escalation may be (very)
undesirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility calls the
SG_SCSI_RESET ioctl and as of lk 3.10.7 the --no-esc option
is not supported. Patches to implement this functionality
have not been accepted. If you want <br>
it, post your concern to linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org which is
the linux-scsi list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAM-4 and 5 define a hard reset,
a LOGICAL UNIT RESET and a I_T NEXUS RESET. A hard reset is
defined to be a power on condition, a microcode change or a
transport reset event. <br>
LOGICAL UNIT RESET and I_T NEXUS RESET can be requested via
task management functions (and support for LOGICAL UNIT
RESET is mandatory). In Linux the SCSI subsystem leaves it
up <br>
to the LLDs as to exactly what type (if any) of reset is
performed. The &quot;bus reset&quot; is SCSI Parallel
Interface (SPI) concept that may not map well to recent SCSI
transports so <br>
it may be a dummy operation. A &quot;host reset&quot;
attempts to re-initialize the HBA that the request passes
through en route to the DEVICE. Note that a &quot;host
reset&quot; and a &quot;bus reset&quot; <br>
may cause collateral damage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility does not allow
individual SCSI commands to be aborted. SAM-4 defines ABORT
TASK and ABORT TASK SET task management functions for
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to SAM-3 there was a
TARGET RESET task management function. And in SAM-4 I_T
NEXUS RESET appeared which seems closely related: the
&quot;I_T&quot; stands for Initiator-Target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transports may have their own
types of resets not supported by this utility. For example
SAS has a link reset in which both ends of a physical link
(e.g. between a SAS expander <br>
and a SAS tape drive) renegotiate their connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to version 0.57 of this
utility the command line had short options only (e.g. -d but
not --device). Also -h invoked a host reset while in the
current version -h is equiva&acirc; <br>
lent to --help and both -H and --host invoke a host reset.
For backward compatibility define the environment variable
SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS or SG_RESET_OLD_OPTS . In this case -h
<br>
will invoke a host reset and the output will be verbose as
it was previously (equivalent to using the --verbose option
now). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SG_RESET_OLD_OPTS=1 sg_reset -h
/dev/sg1 <br>
sg_reset: starting host reset <br>
sg_reset: completed host reset</p>
