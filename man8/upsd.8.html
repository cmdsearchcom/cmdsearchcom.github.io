<p>UPSD(8) NUT Manual UPSD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
upsd - UPS information server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
upsd -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upsd [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
upsd is responsible for serving the data from the drivers to
the clients. It connects to each driver and maintains a
local cache of the current state. Queries from the clients
<br>
are served from this cache, so delays are minimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also conveys administrative
messages from the clients back to the drivers, such as
starting tests, or setting values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Communication between upsd and
clients is handled on a TCP port. Configuration details for
this port are described in upsd.conf(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is essential, and
must be running at all times to actually make any use out of
the drivers and clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controls in the configuration
files allow you to limit access to the server, but you
should also use a firewall for extra protection. Client
processes such as upsmon(8) trust <br>
upsd for status information about the UPS hardware, so keep
it secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c command <br>
Send command to the background process as a signal. Valid
commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload <br>
reread configuration files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop <br>
stop process and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Raise the debug level. Use this multiple times for
additional details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Display the help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r directory <br>
upsd will chroot(2) to directory shortly after startup and
before parsing any configuration files with this option set.
You can use this to create a &quot;jail&quot; for greater
<br>
security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must coordinate this with
your drivers, as upsd must be able to find the state path
within directory. See upsdrvctl(8) and nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Switch to user user after startup if started as root. This
overrides whatever you may have compiled in with configure
--with-user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Display the version of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELOADING <br>
upsd can reload its configuration files without shutting
down the process if you send it a SIGHUP or start it again
with -c reload. This only works if the background process is
<br>
able to read those files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you think that upsd
can&acirc;t reload, check your syslogs for error messages.
If it&acirc;s complaining about not being able to read the
files, then you need to adjust your system to <br>
make it possible. Either change the permissions on the
files, or run upsd as another user that will be able to read
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO NOT make your upsd.conf or
upsd.users world-readable, as those files hold important
authentication information. In the wrong hands, it could be
used by some evil person to <br>
spoof your master upsmon and command your systems to shut
down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
upsd expects the drivers to either update their status
regularly or at least answer periodic queries, called pings.
If a driver doesn&acirc;t answer, upsd will declare it
&quot;stale&quot; and <br>
no more information will be provided to the clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If upsd complains about
staleness when you start it, then either your driver or
configuration files are probably broken. Be sure that the
driver is actually running, and that the <br>
UPS definition in ups.conf(5) is correct. Also make sure
that you start your driver(s) before starting upsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data can also be marked stale if
the driver can no longer communicate with the UPS. In this
case, the driver should also provide diagnostic information
in the syslog. If this <br>
happens, check the serial or USB cabling, or inspect the
network path in the case of a SNMP UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL <br>
If the server is build with tcp-wrappers support enabled, it
will check if the NUT username is allowed to connect from
the client address through the /etc/hosts.allow and <br>
/etc/hosts.deny files. Note that this will only be done for
commands that require to be logged into the server. Further
details are described in hosts_access(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The general upsd configuration file is upsd.conf(5). The
administrative functions like SET and INSTCMD for users are
defined and controlled in upsd.users(5). UPS definitions are
<br>
found in ups.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
NUT_CONFPATH is the path name of the directory that contains
upsd.conf and other configuration files. If this variable is
not set, upsd uses a built-in default, which is often <br>
/usr/local/ups/etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUT_STATEPATH is the path name
of the directory in which upsd keeps state information. If
this variable is not set, upsd uses a built-in default,
which is often /var/state/ups. <br>
The STATEPATH directive in upsd.conf(5) overrides this
variable.</p>
