<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-trigger, dnssec-triggerd, dnssec-trigger-panel,
dnssec-trigger-control, dnssec-trigger-control-setup,
dnssec-trigger.conf - check DNS servers for DNSSEC support
and adjust <br>
to compensate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-triggerd [-d] [-v] [-u] [-c file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-trigger-control [-c file]
[-s ip[@port] ] command [arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-trigger-panel [-d] [-c
file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The dnssec-trigger programs steer unbound(8) towards DNSSEC
capable DNS servers. A DHCP hook installed on the system
calls dnssec-trigger-control that contacts the daemon <br>
dnssec-triggerd that probes the list of servers. The daemon
then adjusts a running unbound through unbound-control(8)
and notifies the user applet dnssec-trigger-panel for GUI
<br>
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dnssec-trigger-panel runs
after user login, displays notifications and status to the
user. It may popup a warning if no DNSSEC capable servers
are available, with options to <br>
disconnect or to connect insecurely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dnssec-trigger-control tool
is used in the background by scripts to notify the daemon of
new (DHCP) DNS servers. It can be used to test the system by
providing a (fake) list <br>
of DNS server IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dnssec-trigger-control-setup
tool is used to setup the SSL keys that the daemon and user
panel use to communicate securely. It must be run once after
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DNSSEC-TRIGGERD DAEMON <br>
Thus the dnssec-triggerd daemon runs continually, and is
started after boot. It receives a list of IP addresses,
probes them, and adjusts unbound and resolv.conf. Unbound
acts <br>
as the validating local resolver, running on 127.0.0.1. And
resolv.conf is modified to point to 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cfgfile <br>
Set the config file with settings for the dnssec-triggerd to
read instead of reading the file at the default location,
/etc/dnssec-trigger/dnssec-trigger.conf. The syntax <br>
is described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debug flag, do not fork into
the background, but stay attached to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u uninstall dns override: makes
resolv.conf mutable again, or other OS action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase verbosity. If given
multiple times, more information is logged. This is in
addition to the verbosity (if any) from the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DNSSEC-TRIGGER.CONF FILE
<br>
The config file contains options. It is fairly simple, key:
value. You can make comments with &rsquo;#&rsquo; and have
empty lines. The parser is simple and expects one statement
per <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbosity: &lt;num&gt; <br>
Amount of logging, 1 is default. 0 is only errors, 2 is more
detail, 4 for debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pidfile:
&quot;&lt;file&gt;&quot; <br>
The filename where the pid of the dnssec-triggerd is stored.
Default is /var/run/dnssec-trigger.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logfile:
&quot;&lt;file&gt;&quot; <br>
Log to a file instead of syslog, default is to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use-syslog: &lt;yes or no&gt;
<br>
Log to syslog, default is yes. Set to no logs to stderr (if
no logfile) or the configured logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unbound-control:
&quot;&lt;command&gt;&quot; <br>
The string gives the command to execute. It can be
&quot;unbound-control&quot; to search the runtime PATH, or a
full pathname. With a space after the command arguments can
be con&acirc; <br>
figured to the command, i.e.
&quot;/usr/local/bin/unbound-control -c my.conf&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolvconf:
&quot;/etc/resolv.conf&quot; <br>
The resolv.conf file to edit (on posix systems). The daemon
keeps the file readonly and only make it writable shortly to
change it itself. This is to keep other software <br>
from interfering. On OSX (if compiled in) also the DNS
settings are changed in the network configuration machinery
(visible in the network settings control panel). On <br>
Windows (if compiled), it sets registry settings for network
configuration (may be visible in the control panel tab for
network devices) and does not write a resolv.conf <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">domain: &quot;example.com&quot;
<br>
The domain to set in resolv.conf. See resolv.conf(5). Picked
up once during installation, and not from DHCP since it
allows directing traffic elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search: &quot;example.com&quot;
<br>
The domain name search path to set in resolv.conf. See
resolv.conf(5). Picked up once during installation, and not
from DHCP since it allows directing traffic elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noaction: &lt;yes or no&gt; <br>
Default is no. If yes, no action is taken to change
unbound-control or resolv.conf. The software can be tested
with this, probe results are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port: &lt;8955&gt; <br>
Port number to use for communication with dnssec-triggerd.
Communication uses 127.0.0.1 (the loopback interface). SSL
is used to secure it, and the keys are stored on <br>
the disk (see below). The other tools read this config file
to find the port number and key locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login-command: &quot;&quot; <br>
The command that is run when the user clicks Login on the no
web access dialog. That is supposedly a web browser, that is
aimed to open some url so that the hot-spot net&acirc; <br>
work login can intercept and show its login page. The
default is a detected generic web browser. The &quot;&quot;
empty string turns off this feature and no command gets
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login-location:
&quot;http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/dnssec-trigger&quot;
<br>
The url that is opened with the web browser. Used as
commandline argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server-key-file:
&quot;/etc/dnssec-trigger/dnssec_trigger_server.key&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server-cert-file:
&quot;/etc/dnssec-trigger/dnssec_trigger_server.pem&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control-key-file:
&quot;/etc/dnssec-trigger/dnssec_trigger_control.key&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control-cert-file:
&quot;/etc/dnssec-trigger/dnssec_trigger_control.pem&quot;
<br>
The files used for SSL secured communication with
dnssec-triggerd. These files can be created with
dnssec-trigger-control-setup (run as root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check-updates: &lt;yes or no&gt;
<br>
Check for software updates, if there are, download them and
present the user with a dialog that allows them to run the
installer to upgrade the software. It checks a <br>
SHA256 checksum on the download, the checksum is signed with
DNSSEC (from a TXT record). On windows and osx the default
is yes. On other systems the default is no (it&rsquo;ll <br>
download the source tarball if enabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url: &quot;http://example.com
OK&quot; <br>
This command adds an url to probe via HTTP (port 80). The
first word, before the space is the url to resolve. The
remainder is the string that is expected as page con&acirc;
<br>
tents (that may be prefixed or suffixed with whitespace).
The url is resolved, a HTTP 1.1 query is sent. The reply
must be type 2xx and contain the page contents. If <br>
this is not true, dnssec-trigger knows that there is a
&rsquo;hot spot&rsquo; of some sort interfering with
traffic. If you do not configure any urls, then no probes
are done. If <br>
you configure multiple urls then it probes a random
selection of 3 urls, all of their IP addresses in turn, with
IP4 and IP6 simultaneously. At most 5 of the DHCP DNS <br>
servers are used to resolve (in parallel). If an answer is
gotten and it fails the probe stop, the probing continues if
there is no connection or response 404.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp80: &lt;ip&gt; <br>
Add an IP4 or IP6 address to the list of fallback open
DNSSEC resolvers that are used on TCP port 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp443: &lt;ip&gt; <br>
Add an IP4 or IP6 address to the list of fallback open
DNSSEC resolvers that are used on TCP port 443.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp443: &lt;ip&gt; or &lt;ip&gt;
{ &lt;hash&gt;} <br>
Add an IP4 of IP6 address to the list of fallback SSL open
DNSSEC resolvers. They serve plain-DNS(tcp-style) over port
443, encapsulated in SSL. The SSL certificate <br>
online is checked with the fingerprint (if configured here).
You may configure multiple hashes (one space between), if
one matches its OK, so that pre-publish rollover of <br>
the certificates is possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DNSSEC-TRIGGER-PANEL <br>
The dnssec-trigger-panel is an applet that runs in the tray.
It shows the DNSSEC status. It can be invoked with -d to
test in the build directory. The -c cfgfile option can <br>
set the config file away from the default. The applet keeps
an SSL connection to the daemon and displays the status, and
can show the user dialogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The applet has a small menu. The
menu item Reprobe causes the daemon to probe the last seen
DHCP DNS servers again, which may now work after a hotspot
signon. The menu item <br>
Hotspot Signon goes into insecure mode for hotspots where
this must be used to sign on to the hot spot: use reprobe
when done to resume dnssec protection efforts. The Probe
<br>
Result menu item shows the results of the previous probe to
the user, for technical help with network difficulties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DNSSEC-TRIGGER-CONTROL TOOL
<br>
The dnssec-trigger-control tool can be used to test. It is
also used inside DHCP scripts (platform specific). It can
send commands to the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cfgfile <br>
Set the config file to use away from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s ip[@port] <br>
Default connects to 127.0.0.1 with the port from config
file, but this options overrides that with an IPv4 or IPv6
address and optional a port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v increase verbosity of
dnssec-trigger-control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submit &lt;ips&gt; <br>
Submit a list of space separated IP addresses (from DHCP)
that are the DNS servers that the daemon will probe. IPv4
and IPv6 addresses can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsafe Test command that probes
some 127/8 addresses in a way that makes the daemon conclude
that no DNSSEC works. Presents user with
&rsquo;Insecure?&rsquo; dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Shows the last probe
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprobe <br>
Probe the last probe again. It also cancels forced insecure
state from hotspot signon, causing probes for dnssec to
resume. This command acts as the menu item with the <br>
same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip_http <br>
Skip the http probe step. Setup DNSSEC, as possible, without
taking the result of the http probe into account. Once http
works again, it&rsquo;ll stop skipping the http <br>
results. Useful, if you want to have DNSSEC on a network
where web access is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hotspot_signon <br>
This command acts as the menu item with the same name. Use
it to force insecure mode, where you can then interact with
(weird) hotspot set ups. When you are done, do the <br>
reprobe command to resume DNSSEC protection efforts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">results <br>
continuous feed of probe results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmdtray <br>
Continuous input feed, used by the tray icon to send
commands to the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stoppanels <br>
Makes connected tray icons quit. Useful for installers that
need to update their executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop stops the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DNSSEC-TRIGGER-CONTROL-SETUP
TOOL <br>
This tool aids setup of files. Without arguments it creates
the key files. If key files already exist, it resigns
certificates with existing private keys. With -d dir the
<br>
files are placed in the given directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -i the tool changes
configuration files. It tests if unbound has remote-control:
control-enable: yes and if not appends lines to unbound.conf
that enable unbound-control, <br>
and it runs unbound-control-setup to generate the keys for
unbound-control. It tests if unbound has a trust anchor, if
not it enables the root.key as auto-trust-anchor-file and
<br>
runs unbound-anchor(8) to initialize the key. It picks up
the domain and search from resolv.conf and configures the
dnssec-trigger.conf to use that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the tool trusts the domain
and search path at install time. You should review them or
perform configuration manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -u it removes the options
it enabled in unbound.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/dnssec-trigger/dnssec-trigger.conf <br>
The default configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dnssec-trigger <br>
Directory with keys used for SSL connections to
dnssec-triggerd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/dnssec-trigger.pid <br>
Default pidfile with the pid of the running
dnssec-triggerd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
unbound(8), unbound-control(8), unbound.conf(5),
resolv.conf(5).</p>
