<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dbab - dnsmasq based ad blocking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
# start dbab-svr server <br>
/etc/init.d/dbab start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># stop dbab-svr server <br>
/etc/init.d/dbab stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># get/update ad blocking list
<br>
/usr/sbin/dbab-get-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># add your own to the ad
blocking list <br>
/usr/sbin/dbab-add-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dbab provides a total solution for SOHO service environment,
smoothly integrates DHCP, DNS, local caching and Ad blocking
into harmony. Ad blocking is done by DNSmasq + Pix&acirc;
<br>
elserv, i.e., done at the DNS level -- all requests to
ad-sites are blocked right there at DNS. No more user space
extensive pattern matching necessary at all. Work for your
<br>
mobile devices as well. You don&Acirc;&acute;t need to
install anything to your mobile devices to enjoy the ad-free
and speed-up browsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALTERNATIVES <br>
People may also use browsers&Acirc;&acute; adblock-plus
extension to block ads, but fewer think over how it works
internally. Here is an overview of Adblock Plus from a
thousand mile high [1] <br>
-- whenever the browser needs to load something, the
extension kicks in and do a thorough pattern matching of all
known ad urls using regular expressions, then hectically
replace <br>
all found ad urls with something else. This is done on every
page, every load, and every component of the web page, using
JavaScript. Thus it is by nature slow and CPU intensive,
<br>
at least inefficient. There are other alternatives to this,
e.g., privoxy, but the concepts are the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1]
http://adblockplus.org/en/faq_internal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANTAGES <br>
Comparing to other ad-blocking efforts, dbab will be super
light. Only a few operations are enough to determine and
stop the ads. No heavy-lifting (using CPU intensive URL
pat&acirc; <br>
tern matching) necessary. Thus it will be lighting fast as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantages of using dbab
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Work at the DNS
level. Leave the web pages intact, without any pattern
matching, string substitution, and/or html elements
replacing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Work for your
mobile devices as well. Were you previously in the dilemma
of choosing ads free or slow response for your mobile
devices (iphone, ipad, etc)? Now you don&Acirc;&acute;t. You
<br>
don&Acirc;&acute;t need to install any thing to your mobile
devices for them to enjoy the ad-free browsing experience.
Moreover, their browsing speed will increase dramatically on
revis&acirc; <br>
ited pages/images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Serve instantly.
All ads will be replaced by a 1x1 pixel gif image served
locally by the dbab-svr server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Maintenance
free. You don&Acirc;&acute;t need to maintain the list of ad
sites yourself. The block list can be downloaded from
pgl.yoyo.org periodically. If you don&Acirc;&acute;t like
some of the <br>
entries there, you can add-to or remove-from that list
easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBAB-SVR <br>
The dbab-svr is a super minimal web server / pixelserv, it
has one purpose of serving a 1x1 pixel transparent gif file.
It can optionally provide the automatic WPAD service as <br>
well if so configured. By default it listens on
localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBAB-GET-LIST <br>
The dbab-get-list is used to get dnsmasq blocking list from
pgl.yoyo.org to be used by DNSmasq. The result is stored as
/etc/dnsmasq.d/dbab.adblock.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run it once, or put it
in a cron job so as to update the block list periodically.
E.g., to update on a weekly basis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln -s /usr/sbin/dbab-get-list
/etc/cron.weekly/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBAB-ADD-LIST <br>
You can use dbab-add-list to add your own entries to dnsmasq
blocking list, if the list from pgl.yoyo.org is not
sufficient for you. The result is stored as /etc/dns&acirc;
<br>
masq.d/dbab.trashsites.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBAB-CHK-LIST <br>
The dbab-chk-list can help you to check if your own list is
already covered by pgl.yoyo.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCP-ADD-WPAD <br>
he dhcp-add-wpad will take the content in
/etc/dbab/dbab.proxy as the host name of the squid caching
server, as well as taking the content in /etc/dbab/dbab.addr
as the IP <br>
address of dhcp server, then enable the automatic WPAD
service within the system, with the help of the DNS and DHCP
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/dbab/dbab.addr: <br>
The IP address that dbab-svr listens on. Defaults to
localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dbab/dbab.list-: <br>
The entries you want to filter out from the pgl.yoyo.org
lists. List sites you still wish to visit there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dbab/dbab.list+: <br>
The entries you want to add to blocking list on top of the
pgl.yoyo.org list, used by dbab-add-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dbab/dbab.proxy: <br>
The name or IP address of your squid caching server.
Defaults to localhost.</p>
