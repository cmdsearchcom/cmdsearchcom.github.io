<p>REMCTL-SHELL(8) remctl REMCTL-SHELL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
remctl-shell - Restricted shell that mimics a remctl
server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
remctl-shell [-dhqSv] [-f config] -c command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl-shell [-dqS] [-f config]
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
remctl-shell is a restricted shell that mimics the behavior
of the remctld server without using the remctl protocol,
GSS-API, or Kerberos. It&rsquo;s intended to be run via ssh
as <br>
either the shell or the forced command for a special user
(by convention, &quot;remctl&quot;, although remctl-shell
doesn&rsquo;t care), with an authorized_keys file that
specifies the user <br>
identity corresponding to each key that is allowed to run
remctl commands. All access control then works as
normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the command ran is
returned on standard output and standard error, like a
normal command run via ssh, and the exit status of
remctl-shell will be the exit status of <br>
the command. Only one command can be run per ssh connection,
so this will be noticeably slower for each command execution
than a well-designed remctl client and server design <br>
that holds connections open for multiple commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl-shell is designed to
mimic the behavior of remctld and uses the same
configuration syntax and environment variables. See
&quot;CONFIGURATION FILE&quot; in remctld(8) for <br>
configuration information and ENVIRONMENT below for more
specific details about environment variable handling. The
location of the configuration file may be specified with the
<br>
-f option. The default location is /etc/remctl.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since remctl-shell is designed
to be run by a potentially untrusted user as a shell,
normally all error messages and logging is done via syslog
and not sent to standard error. <br>
See the -S, -d, and -q options when running it manually to
debug problems. (When running manually, you will also
normally need to set the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable
and <br>
either REMCTL_USER or SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND depending on how
you invoke it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoting and Command Limitations
<br>
The ssh protocol is much less sophisticated than remctl at
passing command arguments from the client to the server, so
remctl-shell requires careful attention to command <br>
arguments and quoting. ssh does no quoting of arguments,
just adds a single space between each argument and passes
them verbatim to the shell on the server side. This means
the <br>
client has to add quoting to any arguments containing
whitespace. remctl-shell supports single and double quotes,
and supports using backslash to escape any character inside
or <br>
outside either quotes. However, be aware, when running ssh
from the command line, that your shell will remove another
level of quoting. You will therefore usually have to <br>
double-quote arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to run the command
&quot;log message&quot; with argument &quot;this is a
message&quot; via ssh from the command line, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh remctl@example.com log
message &quot;&rsquo;this is a message&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first level of &quot;&quot;
quoting will be removed by your local shell, and
remctl-shell will interpret the second level of
&rsquo;&rsquo; quotes. Note that, because of how ssh does
command <br>
argument passing, this is exactly equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh remctl@example.com &quot;log
message &rsquo;this is a message&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">since ssh doesn&rsquo;t preserve
the distinction between separate arguments when creating the
command to send to the remote server. It may be less
confusing to get in the habit of <br>
quoting the entire command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also be aware that the full
command is passed via command line arguments, which means,
when invoking remctl-shell as a shell, there is a tight
limit on the length of the whole <br>
command plus arguments. Expect to have problems if the total
command length exceeds 1000 characters. For the same reason,
binary data including nul characters cannot be passed <br>
via remctl-shell. Invoking it as a forced command may work
around these limitations by putting the command into the
environment instead, but there may still be restrictions on
<br>
that. (The regular remctl protocol supports arbitrary-length
arguments, limited only by server-side configuration and
available server memory, and supports arbitrary binary data
<br>
in arguments.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;authorized_keys&quot;
Configuration <br>
remctl-shell is intended for use via ssh using
&quot;authorized_keys&quot; to manage authentication. (If
you have Kerberos available, it&rsquo;s generally better to
use the normal remctld <br>
server and native remctl protocol.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways to set up
remctl-shell: either by specifying forced commands, or by
configuring remctl-shell as the shell of the account. The
forced command approach is <br>
recommended, since it doesn&rsquo;t require setting a
non-default sshd_config option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using forced commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the role account that you
want to use to run remctl commands (&quot;remctl&quot; by
convention), create an authorized_keys file listing everyone
who should be able to run commands. <br>
Before each key, set the &quot;command&quot; option like the
below:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">command=&quot;/usr/sbin/remctl-shell
example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the argument to
remctl-shell is the identity matching the ssh key on that
line. A more complete example of a line in
authorized_keys:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">command==&quot;/usr/sbin/remctl-shell
example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;,
no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,
no-X11-forwarding ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA...
example@some-host.example.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backslashes and line breaks were
added for clarity. The actual entry should be a single long
line. For more information on the other settings here, see
Examples below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running remctl-shell as the
shell of the account, instead of using forced commands, the
authorized_keys configuration must be set up to associate
each key with an identity <br>
by setting the REMCTL_USER environment variable. Using user
identities that look like Kerberos principal names is
strongly recommended, since it may make it easier to use
some <br>
of the ACL methods intended for the normal remctl
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since this relies on setting
environment variables via &quot;authorized_keys&quot;, you
unfortunately have to enable
&quot;PermitUserEnvironment&quot; in sshd_config (this is
not the default) by <br>
adding:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PermitUserEnvironment yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl-shell will not make use
of forwarded connections or agents, and will not pass them
along to the processes they run, so all such ssh options
should normally be disabled for <br>
defense in depth security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a recommended line in
&quot;authorized_keys&quot; for the account managed by
remctl-shell, with appropriate restrictions and an example
of how to set the REMCTL_USER variable. <br>
Backslashes and line breaks were added for clarity. The
actual entry should be a single long line.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">environment=&quot;REMCTL_USER=example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;,no-agent-forwarding,
no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA...
example@some-host.example.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting &quot;no-user-rc&quot;
is particularly important for remctl-shell. If you have
OpenSSH 7.2 or later, which added the &quot;restrict&quot;
keyword, you can instead use the much simpler:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">environment=&quot;REMCTL_USER=example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;,restrict
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA...
example@some-host.example.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMCTL_USER should be set to the
identity string for the owner of that key pair, as used in
the ACLs in your remctl configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
remctl-shell is normally only run with either the -c option
or with a user, since it&rsquo;s intended for use as a shell
or forced command. However, it does support some other
options <br>
for testing, which may be useful in authorized_keys. If
using it as a shell, one can use a small wrapper program as
the configured shell that passes additional options into
<br>
remctl-shell if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The start of each option
description is annotated with the version of remctl-shell in
which that option was added with its current meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
[3.12] The command to run. This is how ssh passes the
command string into remctl-shell. remctl-shell will then
parse it into separate arguments using an algorithm similar
<br>
to that used by a shell. See the above discussion of quoting
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is mandatory when using
remctl-shell as a shell. If using it as a forced command,
pass the user on the command line instead and do not use
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d [3.12] Enable verbose debug
logging to syslog (or to standard output if -S is also
given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config <br>
[3.12] The configuration file for remctld, overriding the
default path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h [3.12] Show a brief usage
message and then exit. This usage method will include a list
of supported ACL types and can be used to determine if
optional ACL methods were <br>
compiled into a given remctl-shell build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q [3.12] Suppress the normal
informational logging of what commands are being executed
and by whom. This is intended primarily to avoid spamming
syslog during testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S [3.12] Rather than logging to
syslog, log debug and routine connection messages to
standard output and error messages to standard error. In
normal usage, this would send all <br>
the logging back to the client, intermixed with program
output, so it&rsquo;s normally useful only for testing and
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [3.12] Print the version of
remctl-shell and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
remctl-shell itself requires the following environment
variables be set when it is invoked, or it exits with an
error and doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMCTL_USER <br>
The user used for logging and to make authorization
decisions, unless that was passed on the command line. The
security of all remctl-shell authorization checks is based
on <br>
the accuracy of this environment variable, so be sure that
it is set correctly. The best way to do this is via
&quot;environment&quot; stanzas in authorized_keys as
described above. <br>
If the user is passed on the command line, this is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_CONNECTION <br>
sshd uses this environment variable to communication
information about the local and remote IP addresses and
ports of the ssh connection. remctl-shell expects the first
<br>
space-separated token in this environment variable to be the
IP address of the client. It then uses that to set
REMOTE_ADDR in the environment of any commands it runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND <br>
When run as a forced command, the command run by the user is
taken from this environment variable, which is set by
sshd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following environment
variables will be set for any commands run via remctl-shell
(annotated with the version at which they were added). These
are mostly the same as those <br>
set by remctld. Differences are noted in each
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMCTL_COMMAND <br>
[3.12] The command string that caused this command to be
run. This variable will contain only the command, not the
subcommand or any additional arguments (which are passed
<br>
as command arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_ADDR <br>
[3.12] The IP address of the remote host. This may be IPv4
or IPv6. This is taken from the SSH_CONNECTION environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_EXPIRES <br>
[3.12] Normally, this communicates the time (in seconds
since UNIX epoch) when the authenticated remote session will
expire. However, this is not a meaningful concept for <br>
ssh authentication via public key, and regardless is not
communicated by sshd to the shell. It is therefore always
set to 0 by remctl-shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_HOST <br>
[3.12] The hostname of the remote host, if it was available.
If reverse name resolution failed, this environment variable
will not be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is determined via a simple
reverse DNS lookup and should be considered under the
control of the client. remctl commands should treat it with
skepticism and not use it <br>
for anything other than logging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_USER <br>
REMUSER <br>
[3.12] Set to the value of REMCTL_CLIENT as set in the
environment of remctl-shell. This should be set security via
authorized_keys as discussed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that REMOTE_HOST is not set
by remctl-shell, at least currently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Typically, remctl-shell will either be run as a forced
command or set as the shell for a dedicated user, normally
&quot;remctl&quot;, via the normal mechanism for local
account creation. <br>
That account should be configured with an ssh
authorized_keys file as discussed above. remctl-shell will
then be invoked with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl-shell -c &rsquo;command
subcommand argument&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(if used as a shell) or
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl-shell
user@EXAMPLE.ORG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(if used as a forced command) by
sshd for each incoming connection from a user that has a key
in the authorized_keys file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to run a command
manually for debugging, you can run the same command as
above, but it&rsquo;s often more useful to send errors to
standard error instead of to syslog. You <br>
can do that with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl-shell -S -c
&rsquo;command subcommand argument&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t want to see
the normal command logging, add the -q option as well. You
can test an alternate configuration file by specifying it
with the -f option. You will need <br>
to set SSH_CONNECTION and either REMCTL_USER (if using -c)
or SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND (if passing the user on the command
line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
remctl-shell was added in the remctl 3.12 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The forced command mode where
the user can be passed on the command line and the command
retrieved from SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND was added in the remctl
3.13 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Most of the caveats and differences between remctl-shell and
the normal remctld server are from quoting and the
limitations of passing arguments via the command line.
Review the <br>
section on quoting above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, remctl-shell runs as a
dedicated non-root user (as opposed to often running as root
like remctld), which means that all commands will normally
run as that user and the <br>
&quot;user&quot; configuration option will not work. The
easiest way to run commands as other users is to have the
underlying command use sudo or some other user switching
mechanism, <br>
which will normally require additional local
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User environment setting has to
be enabled in sshd by setting the non-default
&quot;PermitUserEnvironment&quot; configuration option. A
future version of remctl-shell may use forced <br>
commands with an argument instead of a shell to avoid
this.</p>
