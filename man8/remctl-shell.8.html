<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>remctl-shell</b> is a restricted shell that mimics the behavior of the
  <b>remctld</b> server without using the remctl protocol, GSS-API, or Kerberos.
  It's intended to be run via ssh as either the shell or the forced command for
  a special user (by convention, &quot;remctl&quot;, although
  <b>remctl-shell</b> doesn't care), with an <i>authorized_keys</i> file that
  specifies the user identity corresponding to each key that is allowed to run
  remctl commands. All access control then works as normal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output of the command ran is returned on standard output and standard error,
  like a normal command run via ssh, and the exit status of <b>remctl-shell</b>
  will be the exit status of the command. Only one command can be run per ssh
  connection, so this will be noticeably slower for each command execution than
  a well-designed remctl client and server design that holds connections open
  for multiple commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>remctl-shell</b> is designed to mimic the behavior of <b>remctld</b> and uses
  the same configuration syntax and environment variables. See
  &quot;CONFIGURATION FILE&quot; in <i>remctld</i>(8) for configuration
  information and ENVIRONMENT below for more specific details about environment
  variable handling. The location of the configuration file may be specified
  with the <b>-f</b> option. The default location is <i>/etc/remctl.conf</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since <b>remctl-shell</b> is designed to be run by a potentially untrusted user
  as a shell, normally all error messages and logging is done via syslog and not
  sent to standard error. See the <b>-S</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-q</b> options
  when running it manually to debug problems. (When running manually, you will
  also normally need to set the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable and either
  REMCTL_USER or SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND depending on how you invoke it.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Quoting_and_Command_Limitations"><a class="selflink" href="#Quoting_and_Command_Limitations">Quoting
  and Command Limitations</a></h2>
The ssh protocol is much less sophisticated than remctl at passing command
  arguments from the client to the server, so <b>remctl-shell</b> requires
  careful attention to command arguments and quoting. ssh does no quoting of
  arguments, just adds a single space between each argument and passes them
  verbatim to the shell on the server side. This means the client has to add
  quoting to any arguments containing whitespace. <b>remctl-shell</b> supports
  single and double quotes, and supports using backslash to escape any character
  inside or outside either quotes. However, be aware, when running ssh from the
  command line, that your shell will remove another level of quoting. You will
  therefore usually have to double-quote arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, to run the command &quot;log message&quot; with argument &quot;this
  is a message&quot; via ssh from the command line, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ssh remctl@example.com log message &quot;'this is a message'&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first level of &quot;&quot; quoting will be removed by your local shell, and
  <b>remctl-shell</b> will interpret the second level of '' quotes. Note that,
  because of how ssh does command argument passing, this is exactly equivalent
  to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ssh remctl@example.com &quot;log message 'this is a message'&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
since ssh doesn't preserve the distinction between separate arguments when
  creating the command to send to the remote server. It may be less confusing to
  get in the habit of quoting the entire command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also be aware that the full command is passed via command line arguments, which
  means, when invoking <b>remctl-shell</b> as a shell, there is a tight limit on
  the length of the whole command plus arguments. Expect to have problems if the
  total command length exceeds 1000 characters. For the same reason, binary data
  including nul characters cannot be passed via <b>remctl-shell</b>. Invoking it
  as a forced command may work around these limitations by putting the command
  into the environment instead, but there may still be restrictions on that.
  (The regular remctl protocol supports arbitrary-length arguments, limited only
  by server-side configuration and available server memory, and supports
  arbitrary binary data in arguments.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;authorized_keys&quot;_Configuration"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;authorized_keys&quot;_Configuration">&quot;authorized_keys&quot;
  Configuration</a></h2>
<b>remctl-shell</b> is intended for use via ssh using
  &quot;authorized_keys&quot; to manage authentication. (If you have Kerberos
  available, it's generally better to use the normal <b>remctld</b> server and
  native remctl protocol.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two ways to set up <b>remctl-shell</b>: either by specifying forced
  commands, or by configuring <b>remctl-shell</b> as the shell of the account.
  The forced command approach is recommended, since it doesn't require setting a
  non-default <i>sshd_config</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Using forced commands</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the role account that you want to use to run remctl commands
  (&quot;remctl&quot; by convention), create an <i>authorized_keys</i> file
  listing everyone who should be able to run commands. Before each key, set the
  &quot;command&quot; option like the below:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    command=&quot;/usr/sbin/remctl-shell example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where the argument to <b>remctl-shell</b> is the identity matching the ssh key
  on that line. A more complete example of a line in <i>authorized_keys</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    command==&quot;/usr/sbin/remctl-shell example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;,\
    no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,\
    no-X11-forwarding ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA... \
    example@some-host.example.org
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Backslashes and line breaks were added for clarity. The actual entry should be a
  single long line. For more information on the other settings here, see
  Examples below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Using a shell</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When running <b>remctl-shell</b> as the shell of the account, instead of using
  forced commands, the <i>authorized_keys</i> configuration must be set up to
  associate each key with an identity by setting the REMCTL_USER environment
  variable. Using user identities that look like Kerberos principal names is
  strongly recommended, since it may make it easier to use some of the ACL
  methods intended for the normal remctl server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since this relies on setting environment variables via
  &quot;authorized_keys&quot;, you unfortunately have to enable
  &quot;PermitUserEnvironment&quot; in <i>sshd_config</i> (this is not the
  default) by adding:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    PermitUserEnvironment yes
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Other options</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>remctl-shell</b> will not make use of forwarded connections or agents, and
  will not pass them along to the processes they run, so all such ssh options
  should normally be disabled for defense in depth security.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Examples</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is a recommended line in &quot;authorized_keys&quot; for the account
  managed by <b>remctl-shell</b>, with appropriate restrictions and an example
  of how to set the REMCTL_USER variable. Backslashes and line breaks were added
  for clarity. The actual entry should be a single long line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    environment=&quot;REMCTL_USER=example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;,no-agent-forwarding,\
    no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding ssh-rsa \
    AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA... example@some-host.example.org
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Setting &quot;no-user-rc&quot; is particularly important for
  <b>remctl-shell</b>. If you have OpenSSH 7.2 or later, which added the
  &quot;restrict&quot; keyword, you can instead use the much simpler:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    environment=&quot;REMCTL_USER=example@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;,restrict ssh-rsa \
    AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA... example@some-host.example.org
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
REMCTL_USER should be set to the identity string for the owner of that key pair,
  as used in the ACLs in your remctl configuration.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>remctl-shell</b> is normally only run with either the <b>-c</b> option or
  with a user, since it's intended for use as a shell or forced command.
  However, it does support some other options for testing, which may be useful
  in <i>authorized_keys</i>. If using it as a shell, one can use a small wrapper
  program as the configured shell that passes additional options into
  <b>remctl-shell</b> if needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The start of each option description is annotated with the version of
  <b>remctl-shell</b> in which that option was added with its current meaning.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<b>remctl-shell</b> itself requires the following environment variables be set
  when it is invoked, or it exits with an error and doesn't do anything.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">REMCTL_USER</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The user used for logging and to make authorization
      decisions, unless that was passed on the command line. The security of all

      do this is via &quot;environment&quot; stanzas in <i>authorized_keys</i>
      as described above. If the user is passed on the command line, this is
      ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag"><b>sshd</b> uses this environment variable to communication
      information about the local and remote IP addresses and ports of the ssh
      connection. <b>remctl-shell</b> expects the first space-separated token in

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following environment variables will be set for any commands run via
  <b>remctl-shell</b> (annotated with the version at which they were added).
  These are mostly the same as those set by <b>remctld</b>. Differences are
  noted in each description.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">REMCTL_COMMAND</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[3.12] The command string that caused this command to be

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">REMOTE_ADDR</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[3.12] The IP address of the remote host. This may be IPv4
      or IPv6. This is taken from the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">REMOTE_EXPIRES</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[3.12] Normally, this communicates the time (in seconds
      since UNIX epoch) when the authenticated remote session will expire.
      However, this is not a meaningful concept for ssh authentication via
      public key, and regardless is not communicated by <b>sshd</b> to the
      shell. It is therefore always set to 0 by <b>remctl-shell</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">REMOTE_HOST</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[3.12] The hostname of the remote host, if it was

      will not be set.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is determined via a simple reverse DNS lookup and should be considered

<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that REMOTE_HOST is not set by <b>remctl-shell</b>, at least currently.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Typically, <b>remctl-shell</b> will either be run as a forced command or set as
  the shell for a dedicated user, normally &quot;remctl&quot;, via the normal
  mechanism for local account creation. That account should be configured with
  an ssh <i>authorized_keys</i> file as discussed above. <b>remctl-shell</b>
  will then be invoked with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    remctl-shell -c 'command subcommand argument'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(if used as a shell) or with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    remctl-shell user@EXAMPLE.ORG
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(if used as a forced command) by <b>sshd</b> for each incoming connection from a
  user that has a key in the <i>authorized_keys</i> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need to run a command manually for debugging, you can run the same
  command as above, but it's often more useful to send errors to standard error
  instead of to syslog. You can do that with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    remctl-shell -S -c 'command subcommand argument'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you don't want to see the normal command logging, add the <b>-q</b> option as
  well. You can test an alternate configuration file by specifying it with the
  <b>-f</b> option. You will need to set SSH_CONNECTION and either REMCTL_USER
  (if using <b>-c</b>) or SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND (if passing the user on the
  command line).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="selflink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<b>remctl-shell</b> was added in the remctl 3.12 release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The forced command mode where the user can be passed on the command line and the
  command retrieved from SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND was added in the remctl 3.13
  release.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
Most of the caveats and differences between <b>remctl-shell</b> and the normal
  <b>remctld</b> server are from quoting and the limitations of passing
  arguments via the command line. Review the section on quoting above for more
  information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, <b>remctl-shell</b> runs as a dedicated non-root user (as opposed to
  often running as root like <b>remctld</b>), which means that all commands will
  normally run as that user and the &quot;user&quot; configuration option will
  not work. The easiest way to run commands as other users is to have the
  underlying command use <b>sudo</b> or some other user switching mechanism,
  which will normally require additional local configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
User environment setting has to be enabled in <b>sshd</b> by setting the
  non-default &quot;PermitUserEnvironment&quot; configuration option. A future
  version of <b>remctl-shell</b> may use forced commands with an argument
  instead of a shell to avoid this.
