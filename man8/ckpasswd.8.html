<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ckpasswd - nnrpd password authenticator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ckpasswd [-gs] [-d database] [-f filename] [-u username -p
password]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ckpasswd is the basic password authenticator for nnrpd,
suitable for being run from an auth stanza in readers.conf.
See readers.conf(5) for more information on how to configure
<br>
an nnrpd authenticator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ckpasswd accepts a username and
password from nnrpd and tells nnrpd(8) whether that&rsquo;s
the correct password for that username. By default, when
given no arguments, it tries to <br>
check the password using PAM if support for PAM was found
when INN was built. Failing that, it tries to check the
password against the password field returned by getpwnam(3).
<br>
Note that these days most systems no longer make real
passwords available via getpwnam(3) (some still do if and
only if the program calling getpwnam(3) is running as
root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using PAM, ckpasswd
identifies itself as &quot;nnrpd&quot;, not as
&quot;ckpasswd&quot;, and the PAM configuration must be set
up accordingly. The details of PAM configuration are
different on <br>
different operating systems (and even different Linux
distributions); see EXAMPLES below for help getting started,
and look for a pam(7) or pam.conf(4) manual page on your
<br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using any method other than
PAM, ckpasswd expects all passwords to be stored encrypted
by the system crypt(3) function and calls crypt(3) on the
supplied password before <br>
comparing it to the expected password. If you&rsquo;re using
a different password hash scheme (like MD5), you must use
PAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d database <br>
Read passwords from a database (ndbm, gdbm or dbm format
depending on what your system has) rather than by using
getpwnam(3). ckpasswd expects database.dir and database.pag
<br>
to exist and to be a database keyed by username with the
encrypted passwords as the values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While INN doesn&rsquo;t come
with a program intended specifically to create such
databases, on most systems it&rsquo;s fairly easy to write a
Perl script to do so. Something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
use NDBM_File; <br>
use Fcntl; <br>
tie (%db, &rsquo;NDBM_File&rsquo;,
&rsquo;/path/to/database&rsquo;, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640) <br>
or die &quot;Cannot open /path/to/database: $!0; <br>
$| = 1; <br>
print &quot;Username: &quot;; <br>
my $user = &lt;STDIN&gt;; <br>
chomp $user; <br>
print &quot;Password: &quot;; <br>
my $passwd = &lt;STDIN&gt;; <br>
chomp $passwd; <br>
my @alphabet = (&rsquo;.&rsquo;, &rsquo;/&rsquo;, 0..9,
&rsquo;A&rsquo;..&rsquo;Z&rsquo;,
&rsquo;a&rsquo;..&rsquo;z&rsquo;); <br>
my $salt = join &rsquo;&rsquo;, @alphabet[rand 64, rand 64];
<br>
$db{$user} = crypt ($passwd, $salt); <br>
untie %db;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this will echo back
the password when typed; there are obvious improvements that
could be made to this, but it should be a reasonable start.
Sometimes a program <br>
like this will be available with the name dbmpasswd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will not be
available on systems without ndbm, gdbm or dbm
libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Read passwords from the given file rather than using
getpwnam(3). The file is expected to be formatted like a
system password file, at least vaguely. That means each line
<br>
should look something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">username:pdIh9NCNslkq6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(and each line may have an
additional colon after the encrypted password and additional
data; that data will be ignored by ckpasswd). Lines starting
with a number sign (&quot;#&quot;) <br>
are ignored. INN does not come with a utility to create the
encrypted passwords, but htpasswd (which comes with Apache)
can do so and it&rsquo;s a quick job with Perl (see the <br>
example script under -d, or also below). If using
Apache&rsquo;s htpasswd program, be sure to give it the -d
option so that it will use crypt(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line in filename for the user
&quot;user&quot; with the password &quot;pass&quot; would be
&quot;user:LIfOpbjNaEQYE&quot; as obtained by the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% htpasswd -nbd user pass <br>
user:LIfOpbjNaEQYE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case htpasswd is not
installed or if you do not want to depend on it, another
command involving Perl does a similar job:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% perl -e &rsquo;print
&quot;user:&quot;.crypt(&quot;pass&quot;,
&quot;LI&quot;).&quot;0;&rsquo; <br>
user:LIfOpbjNaEQYE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Attempt to look up system
group corresponding to username and return a string like
&quot;user@group&quot; to be matched against in
readers.conf. This option is incompatible with the <br>
-d and -f options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p password <br>
Use password as the password for authentication rather than
reading a password using the nnrpd authenticator protocol.
This option is useful only for testing your <br>
authentication system (particularly since it involves
putting a password on the command line), and does not work
when ckpasswd is run by nnrpd. If this option is given, -u
<br>
must also be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Check passwords against the
result of getspnam(3) instead of getpwnam(3). This function,
on those systems that supports it, reads from /etc/shadow or
similar more restricted <br>
files. If you want to check passwords supplied to nnrpd(8)
against system account passwords, you will probably have to
use this option on most systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most systems require special
privileges to call getspnam(3), so in order to use this
option you may need to make ckpasswd setgid to some group
(like group &quot;shadow&quot;) or even <br>
setuid root. ckpasswd has not been specifically audited for
such uses! It is, however, a very small program that you
should be able to check by hand for security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This configuration is not
recommended if it can be avoided, for serious security
reasons. See &quot;SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS&quot; in
readers.conf(5) for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username <br>
Authenticate as username. This option is useful only for
testing (so that you can test your authentication system
easily) and does not work when ckpasswd is run by nnrpd.
<br>
If this option is given, -p must also be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
See readers.conf(5) for examples of nnrpd(8) authentication
configuration that uses ckpasswd to check passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example PAM configuration for
/etc/pam.conf that tells ckpasswd to check usernames and
passwords against system accounts is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nnrpd auth required pam_unix.so
<br>
nnrpd account required pam_unix.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your system may want you to
instead create a file named nnrpd in /etc/pam.d with lines
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth required pam_unix.so <br>
account required pam_unix.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is only the simplest
configuration. You may be able to include common shared
files, and you may want to stack other modules, either to
allow different authentication <br>
methods or to apply restrictions like lists of users who
can&rsquo;t authenticate using ckpasswd. The best guide is
the documentation for your system and the other PAM
configurations <br>
you&rsquo;re already using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To test to make sure that
ckpasswd is working correctly, you can run it manually and
then give it the username (prefixed with
&quot;ClientAuthname:&quot;) and password (prefixed with
<br>
&quot;ClientPassword:&quot;) on standard input. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(echo &rsquo;ClientAuthname:
test&rsquo; ; echo &rsquo;ClientPassword: testing&rsquo;) |
ckpasswd -f /path/to/passwd/file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will check a username of
&quot;test&quot; and a password of &quot;testing&quot;
against the username and passwords stored in
/path/to/passwd/file. On success, ckpasswd will print
&quot;User:test&quot; and <br>
exit with status 0. On failure, it will print some sort of
error message and exit a non-zero status.</p>
