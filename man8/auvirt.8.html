<p>AUVIRT(8) System Administration Utilities AUVIRT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
auvirt - a program that shows data related to virtual
machines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
auvirt [ OPTIONS ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
auvirt shows a list of guest sessions found in the audit
logs. If a guest is specified, only the events related to
that guest is considered. To specify a guest, both UUID or
VM <br>
name can be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each guest session the tool
prints a record with the domain name, the user that started
the guest, the time when the guest was started and the time
when the guest was <br>
stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option
&quot;--all-events&quot; is given a more detailed output is
shown. In this mode other records are shown for
guest&rsquo;s stops, resource assignments, host shutdowns
and AVC and <br>
anomaly events. The first field indicates the event type and
can have the following values: start, stop, res, avc, anom
and down (for host shutdowns).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resource assignments have the
additional fields: resource type, reason and resource. And
AVC records have the following additional fields: operation,
result, command and target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, auvirt reads records
from the system audit log file. But --stdin and --file
options can be specified to change this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--all-events <br>
Show records for all virtualization related events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Print debug messages to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --file file <br>
Read records from the given file instead from the system
audit log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proof <br>
Add after each event a line containing all the identifiers
of the audit records used to calculate the event. Each
identifier consists of unix time, milliseconds and serial
<br>
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-uuid <br>
Add the guest&rsquo;s UUID to each record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
Read records from the standard input instead from the system
audit log file. This option cannot be specified with
--file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary <br>
Print a summary with information about the events found. The
summary contains the considered range of time, the number of
guest starts and stops, the number of resource <br>
assignments, the number of AVC and anomaly events, the
number of host shutdowns and the number of failed
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-te, --end [end-date] [end-time]
<br>
Search for events with time stamps equal to or before the
given end time. The format of end time depends on your
locale. If the date is omitted, today is assumed. If the
<br>
time is omitted, now is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time
rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using
the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of <br>
time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced by
the LC_TIME environmental variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use the word: now,
recent, today, yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month,
this-year. Today means starting now. Recent is 10 minutes
ago. Yesterday is 1 <br>
second after midnight the previous day. This-week means
starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week
determined by your locale (see localtime). This-month means
<br>
1 second after midnight on day 1 of the month. This-year
means the 1 second after midnight on the first day of the
first month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ts, --start [start-date]
[start-time] <br>
Search for events with time stamps equal to or after the
given end time. The format of end time depends on your
locale. If the date is omitted, today is assumed. If the
<br>
time is omitted, midnight is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time
rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using
the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of <br>
time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced by
the LC_TIME environmental variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use the word: now,
recent, today, yesterday, this-week, this-month, this-year.

This-week means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of
the week determined by your locale (see localtime). <br>
This-month means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of the
