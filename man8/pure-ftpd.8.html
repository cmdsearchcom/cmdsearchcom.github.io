<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Pure-FTPd is a small, simple server for the old and hairy
File Transfer Protocol, designed to use less resources than
older servers, be smaller and very secure, and to never
exe&acirc; <br>
cute any external program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It support most-used features
and commands of FTP (including many modern extensions), and
leaves out everything which is deprecated, meaningless,
insecure, or correlates with <br>
trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 is fully supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-0 When a file is uploaded and there is already a previous
version of the file with the same name, the old file will
neither get removed nor truncated. Upload will take <br>
place in a temporary file and once the upload is complete,
the switch to the new version will be atomic. This option
should not be used together with virtual quotas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Add the PID to the syslog
output. Ignored if -f none is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 file <br>
When using TLS, set the path to the certificate file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Listen only to IPv4
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Listen only to IPv6
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a gid Regular users will be
chrooted to their home directories, unless they belong to
the specified gid. Note that root is always trusted, and
that chroot() occurs only for <br>
anonymous ftp without this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Chroot() everyone, but
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Be broken. Turns on some
compatibility hacks for shoddy clients, and for broken
Netfilter gateways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Start the standalone server
in background (daemonize).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c clients <br>
Allow a maximum of clients to be connected. clients must be
at least 1, and if you combine it with -p it will be forced
down to half the number of ports specified by -p. <br>
If more than clients are connected, new clients are rejected
at once, even clients wishing to upload, or to log in as
normal users. Therefore, it is advisable to use -m as <br>
primary overload protection. The default value is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C max connection per ip <br>
Limit the number of simultanous connections coming from the
same IP address. This is yet another very effective way to
prevent stupid denial of services and bandwidth <br>
starvation by a single user. It works only when the server
is launched in standalone mode (if you use a super-server,
it is supposed to do that). If the server is <br>
launched with -C 2 , it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the total
number of connection is limited to 2. But the same client,
coming from the same machine (or at least the same IP), <br>
can&rsquo;t have more than two simultaneous connections.
This features needs some memory to track IP addresses, but
it&rsquo;s recommended to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d turns on debug logging. Every
command is logged, except that the argument to PASS is
changed to &quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot;. If you repeat -d ,
responses too are logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Only allow anonymous users to
log in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Only allow authenticated
login. Anonymous users are prohibited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f facility <br>
makes ftpd use facility for all syslog(3) messages. facility
defaults to ftp. The facility names are normally listed in
/usr/include/sys/syslog.h. Note that if -f is <br>
not the first option on the command line, a couple of
messages may be logged to local2 before the -f option is
parsed. Use -f none to disable logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F fortunes file <br>
Display a funny random message in the initial login banner.
The random cookies are extracted from a text file, in the
standard fortune format. If you installed the fortune <br>
package, you should have a directory (usually
/usr/share/fortune ) with binary files ( xxxx.dat ) and text
files (without the .dat extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g pidfile <br>
In standalone mode, write the pid to that file in instead of
/var/run/pure-ftpd.pid .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G When this option is enabled,
people can no more change the name of already uploaded
files, even if they own those files or their directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Don&rsquo;t resolve host
names (&quot;192.0.34.166&quot; will be logged instead of
&quot;www.example.com&quot;). It can significantly speed up
connections and reduce bandwidth usage on busy <br>
servers. Use it especially on public FTP sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Disallow upload for anonymous
users, whatever directory permissions are. This option is
especially useful for virtual hosting, to avoid your users
create warez sites in <br>
their account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I timeout <br>
Change the maximum idle time. The timeout is in minutes, and
defaults to 15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j If the home directory of a
user doesn&rsquo;t exist, automatically create it. The newly
created home directory belongs to the user, and permissions
are set according to the cur&acirc; <br>
rent directory mask. To avoid local attacks, the parent
directory should never belong to an untrusted user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J ciphers <br>
Set the list of ciphers that will be accepted for SSL/TLS
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k percentage <br>
Disallow upload if the partition is more than percentage
full. Example: -k 95 will ensure that your disk will never
get filled more than 95% by FTP users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Allow users to resume and
upload files, but NOT to delete them. Directories can be
removed, but only if they are empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l authentication:file <br>
Enable a new authentication method. It can be one of : -l
unix For standard (/etc/passwd) authentication. -l pam For
PAM authentication. -l ldap:LDAP config file For <br>
LDAP directories. -l mysql:MySQL config file For MySQL
databases. -l pgsql:Postgres config file For Postgres
databases. -l puredb:PureDB database file For PureDB
data&acirc; <br>
bases. -l extauth:path to pure-authd socket For external
authentication handlers. <br>
Different authentication methods can be mixed together. For
instance if you run the server with
-lpuredb:/etc/pure-ftpd/pwd.pdb -lmysql:/etc/pure-ftpd/my.cf
-lunix <br>
Accounts will first be authenticated from a PureDB database.
If it fails, a MySQL server will be asked. If the account is
still not found is the database, standard unix <br>
accounts will be scanned. Authentication methods are tried
in the order you give the -l options, if you do not give -l,
then the decision comes from configure, if PAM is <br>
built in, it is used, if not, then UNIX (/etc/passwd) is
used by default. <br>
See the README.LDAP and README.MySQL files for info about
the built-in LDAP and SQL directory support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L max files:max depth <br>
Avoid denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of
displayed files in a &rsquo;ls&rsquo; and the maximum depth
of a recursive &rsquo;ls&rsquo;. Defaults are 2000:5 (2000
files displayed <br>
for a single &rsquo;ls&rsquo; and walk through 5
subdirectories max).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m load <br>
Do not allow anonymous users to download files if the load
is above load when the user connects. Uploads and file
listings are still allowed, as are downloads by real <br>
users. The user is not told about this until he/she tries to
download a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Allow anonymous users to
create directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n maxfiles:maxsize <br>
Enable virtual quotas When virtual quotas are enabled,
.ftpquota files are created, and the number of files for a
user is restricted to &rsquo;maxfiles&rsquo;. The max total
size of <br>
his directory is also restricted to &rsquo;maxsize&rsquo;
Megabytes. Members of the trusted group aren&rsquo;t subject
to quotas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N NAT mode. Force active mode.
If your FTP server is behind a NAT box that doesn&rsquo;t
support applicative FTP proxying, or if you use port
redirection without a transparent FTP <br>
proxy, use this. Well... the previous sentence isn&rsquo;t
very clear. Okay: if your network looks like this: <br>
FTP--NAT.gateway/router--Internet <br>
and if you want people coming from the internet to have
access to your FTP server, please try without this option
first. If Netscape clients can connect without any
prob&acirc; <br>
lem, your NAT gateway rulez. If Netscape doesn&rsquo;t
display directory listings, your NAT gateway sucks. Use -N
as a workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Enable pure-uploadscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O format:log file <br>
Record all file transfers into a specific log file, in an
alternative format. Currently, three formats are supported :
CLF, Stats, W3C and xferlog. <br>
If you add <br>
-O clf:/var/log/pureftpd.log <br>
to your starting options, Pure-FTPd will log transfers in
/var/log/pureftpd.log in a format similar to the Apache web
server in default configuration. <br>
If you add <br>
-O stats:/var/log/pureftpd.log <br>
to your starting options, Pure-FTPd will create accurate log
files designed for traffic analys software like ftpStats.
<br>
If you add <br>
-O w3c:/var/log/pureftpd.log <br>
to your starting options, Pure-FTPd will create
W3C-conformant log files. <br>
For security purposes, the path must be absolute (eg.
/var/log/pureftpd.log, not ../log/pureftpd.log).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p first:last <br>
Use only ports in the range first to last inclusive for
passive-mode downloads. This means that clients will not try
to open connections to TCP ports outside the range <br>
first - last, which makes pure-ftpd more compatible with
packet filters. Note that the maximum number of clients
(specified with -c) is forced down to (last + 1 - first)/2
<br>
if it is greater, as the default is. (The syntax for the
port range is, conveniently, the same as that of
iptables).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P ip address or host name <br>
Force the specified IP address in reply to a PASV/EPSV/SPSV
command. If the server is behind a masquerading (NAT) box
that doesn&rsquo;t properly handle stateful FTP
masquerad&acirc; <br>
ing, put the ip address of that box here. If you have a
dynamic IP address, you can use a symbolic host name
(probably the one of your gateway), that will be resolved
<br>
every time a new client will connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q upload:download <br>
Enable an upload/download ratio for anonymous users (ex: -q
1:5 means that 1 Mb of goodies have to be uploaded to leech
5 Mb).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q upload:download <br>
Enable ratios for anonymous and non-anonymous users. If the
-a option is also used, users from the trusted group have no
ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Never overwrite existing
files. Uploading a file whose name already exists cause an
automatic rename. Files are called xyz.1, xyz.2, xyz.3,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Disallow users (even
non-anonymous ones) usage of the CHMOD command. On hosting
services, it may prevent newbies from doing mistakes, like
setting bad permissions on their <br>
home directory. Only root can use CHMOD when this switch is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Don&rsquo;t allow anonymous
users to retrieve files owned by &quot;ftp&quot; (generally,
files uploaded by other anonymous users).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S [{ip address|hostname}]
[,{port|service name}] <br>
This option is only effective when the server is launched as
a standalone server. Connections are accepted on the
specified IP and port. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. <br>
Numeric and fully-qualified host names are accepted. A
service name (see /etc/services) can be used instead of a
numeric port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t bandwidth <br>
or -t upload bandwidth:download bandwidth Enable process
priority lowering and bandwidth throttling for anonymous
users. Delay should be in kilobytes/seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T bandwidth <br>
or -T upload bandwidth:download bandwidth Enable process
priority lowering and bandwidth throttling for *ALL* users.
Pure-FTPd should have been explicitely compiled with <br>
throttling support to have these flags work. It is possible
to have different bandwidth limits for uploads and for
downloads. &rsquo;-t&rsquo; and &rsquo;-T&rsquo; can indeed
be followed by two <br>
numbers delimited by a column (&rsquo;:&rsquo;). The first
number is the upload bandwidth and the next one applies only
to downloads. One of them can be left blank which means
infin&acirc; <br>
ity. A single number without any column means that the same
limit applies to upload and download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u uid Do not allow uids below
uid to log in (typically, low-numbered uids are used for
administrative accounts). -u 100 is sufficient to deny
access to all administrative <br>
accounts on many linux boxes, where 99 is the last
administrative account. Anonymous FTP is allowed even if the
uid of the ftp user is smaller than uid. -u 1 denies <br>
access only to root accounts. The default is to allow FTP
access to all accounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U umask files:umask dirs <br>
Change the mask for creation of new files and directories.
The default are 133 (files are readable -but not writable-
by other users) and 022 (same thing for directory, <br>
with the execute bit on). If new files should only be
readable by the user, use 177:077. If you want uploaded
files to be executable, use 022:022 (files will be readable
<br>
by other people) or 077:077 (files will only be readable by
their owner).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v bonjour name <br>
Set the Bonjour name of the service (only available on MacOS
X when Bonjour support is compiled in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V ip address <br>
Allow non-anonymous FTP access only on this specific local
IP address. All other IP addresses are only anonymous. With
that option, you can have routed IPs for public <br>
access, and a local IP (like 10.x.x.x) for administration.
You can also have a routable trusted IP protected by
firewall rules, and only that IP can be used to login as a
<br>
non-anonymous user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Enable support for the FXP
protocol, for non-anonymous users only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Enable the FXP protocol for
everyone. FXP IS AN UNSECURE PROTOCOL. NEVER ENABLE IT ON
UNTRUSTED NETWORKS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x In normal operation mode,
authenticated users can read/write files beginning with a
dot (&rsquo;.&rsquo;). Anonymous users can&rsquo;t, for
security reasons (like changing banners or a for&acirc; <br>
gotten .rhosts). When &rsquo;-x&rsquo; is used,
authenticated users can download dot-files, but not
overwrite/create them, even if they own them. That way, you
can prevent hosted <br>
users from messing .qmail files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X This flag is identical to the
previous one (writing dot-files is prohibited), but in
addition, users can&rsquo;t even *read* files and
directories beginning with a dot (like &quot;cd <br>
.ssh&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y per user max sessions:max
anonymous sessions <br>
This switch enables per-user concurrency limits. Two values
are separated by a column. The first one is the max number
of concurrent sessions for a single login. The sec&acirc;
<br>
ond one is the maximum number of anonoymous sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y tls behavior <br>
-Y 0 (default) disables SSL/TLS security mechanisms. <br>
-Y 1 Accept both normal sessions and SSL/TLS ones. <br>
-Y 2 refuses connections that aren&rsquo;t using SSL/TLS
security mechanisms, including anonymous ones. <br>
-Y 3 refuses connections that aren&rsquo;t using SSL/TLS
security mechanisms, and refuse cleartext data channels as
well. <br>
The server must have been compiled with SSL/TLS support and
a valid certificate must be in place to accept encrypted
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Allow anonymous users to read
files and directories starting with a dot
(&rsquo;.&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Add safe guards against
common customer mistakes (like chmod 0 on their own files)
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
Some of the complexities of older servers are left out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of pure-ftpd can
use PAM for authentication. If you wan&rsquo;t it to consult
any files like /etc/shells or /etc/ftpd/ftpusers consult pam
docs. LDAP directories and SQL <br>
databases are also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anonymous users are
authenticated in any of three ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The user logs in as
&quot;ftp&quot; or &quot;anonymous&quot; and there is an
account called &quot;ftp&quot; with an existing home
directory. This server does not ask anonymous users for an
email address or <br>
other password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The user connects to an IP
address which resolves to the name of a directory in
/etc/pure-ftpd/pure-ftpd (or a symlink in that directory to
a real directory), and there is an <br>
account called &quot;ftp&quot; (which does not need to have
a valid home directory). See Virtual Servers below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ftpd does a chroot(2) to the
relevant base directory when an anonymous user logs in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ftpd allows remote
users to log in as root if the password is known and -u not
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNUSUAL FEATURES <br>
If a user&rsquo;s home directory is /path/to/home/./, FTP
sessions under that UID will be chroot()ed. In addition, if
a users&rsquo;s home directory is /path/to/home/./directory
the session <br>
will be chroot()ed to /path/to/home and the FTP session will
start in &rsquo;directory&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As noted above, this pure-ftpd
omits several features that are required by the RFC or might
be considered useful at first. Here is a list of the most
important omissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On-the-fly tar is not supported,
for several reasons. I feel that users who want to get many
files should use a special FTP client such as
&quot;mirror,&quot; which also supports incremen&acirc; <br>
tal fetch. I don&rsquo;t want to either add several hundred
lines of code to create tar files or execute an external
tar. Finally, on-the-fly tar distorts log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On-the-fly compression is left
out too. Most files on an FTP site are compressed already,
and if a file isn&rsquo;t, there presumably is a reason why.
(As for decompression: Don&rsquo;t FTP <br>
users waste bandwidth enough without help from on-the-fly
decompression?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORY ALIASES <br>
Shortcuts for the &quot;cd&quot; command can be set up if
the server has been compiled with the --with-diraliases
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable directory aliases,
create a file called /etc/pure-ftpd/pureftpd-dir-aliases and
alternate lines of alias names and associated
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANONYMOUS FTP <br>
This server leaves out some of the commands and features
that have been used to subvert anonymous FTP servers in the
past, but still you have to be a little bit careful in order
<br>
to support anonymous FTP without risk to the rest of your
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make ~ftp and all files and
directories below this directory owned by some user other
than &quot;ftp,&quot; and only the .../incoming
directory/directories writable by &quot;ftp.&quot; It is
proba&acirc; <br>
bly best if all directories are writable only by a special
group such as &quot;ftpadmin&quot; and &quot;ftp&quot; is
not a member of this group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not trust the local
users, put ~ftp on a separate partition, so local users
can&rsquo;t hard-link unapproved files into the anonymous
FTP area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of the -s option is strongly
suggested. (Simply add &quot;-s&quot; to the end of the ftpd
line in /etc/inetd.conf to enable it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most other FTP servers require
that a number of files such as ~ftp/bin/ls exist. This
server does not require that any files or directories within
~/ftp whatsoever exist, and I <br>
recommend that all such unnecessary files are removed (for
no real reason).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may be worth considering to
run the anonymous FTP service as a virtual server, to get
automatic logins and to firewall off the FTP address/port to
which real users can log in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your server is a public FTP
site, you may want to allow only &rsquo;ftp&rsquo; and
&rsquo;anonymous&rsquo; users to log in. Use the -e option
for this. Real accounts will be ignored and you will get
<br>
a secure, anonymous-only FTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAGIC FILES <br>
The files &lt;ftproot&gt;/.banner and .message are
magical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a file called
.banner in the root directory of the anonymous FTP area, or
in the root directory of a virtual host, and it is shorter
than 1024 bytes, it is printed <br>
upon login. (If the client does not log in explicitly, and
an implicit login is triggered by a CWD or CDUP command, the
banner is not printed. This is regrettable but hard to <br>
avoid.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a file called
.message in any directory and it is shorter than 1024 bytes,
that file is printed whenever a user enters that directory
using CWD or CDUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIRTUAL SERVERS <br>
You can run several different anonymous FTP servers on one
host, by giving the host several IP addresses with different
DNS names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are the steps needed to
create an extra server using an IP alias on linux 2.4.x,
called &quot;ftp.example.com&quot; on address 10.11.12.13.
on the IP alias eth0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Create an &quot;ftp&quot;
account if you do not have one. It it best if the account
does not have a valid home directory and shell. I prefer to
make /dev/null the ftp account&rsquo;s home <br>
directory and shell. Ftpd uses this account to set the
anonymous users&rsquo; uid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Create a directory as
described in Anonymous FTP and make a symlink called
/etc/pure-ftpd/pure-ftpd/10.11.12.13 which points to this
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Make sure your kernel has
support for IP aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Make sure that the following
commands are run at boot:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/sbin/ifconfig eth0:1
10.11.12.13</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That should be all. If you have
problems, here are some things to try.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, symlink
/etc/pure-ftpd/pure-ftpd/127.0.0.1 to some directory and say
&quot;ftp localhost&quot;. If that doesn&rsquo;t log you in,
the problem is with ftpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not, &quot;ping -v
10.11.12.13&quot; and/or &quot;ping -v ftp.example.com&quot;
from the same host. If this does not work, the problem is
with the IP alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, try &quot;ping -v
10.11.12.13&quot; from a host on the local ethernet, and
afterwards &quot;/sbin/arp -a&quot;. If 10.11.12.13 is
listed among the ARP entries with the correct hardware <br>
address, the problem is probably with the IP alias. If
10.11.12.13 is listed, but has hardware address 0:0:0:0:0:0,
then proxy-ARP isn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of that helps, I&rsquo;m
stumped. Good luck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: If you setup a virtual
hosts, normal users will not be able to login via this name,
so don&rsquo;t create link/directory in
/etc/pure-ftpd/pure-ftpd for your regular hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/passwd is used via libc (and PAM is this case), to get
the uid and home directory of normal users, the uid and home
directory of &quot;ftp&quot; for normal anonymous ftp, and
just the <br>
uid of &quot;ftp&quot; for virtual ftp hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/shadow is used like
/etc/passwd if shadow support is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/group is used via libc, to
get the group membership of normal users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/net/tcp is used to count
existing FTP connections, if the -c or -p options are
used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/pure-ftpd/pure-ftpd/&lt;ip
address&gt; is the base directory for the &lt;ip address&gt;
virtual ftp server, or a symbolic link to its base
directory. Ftpd does a chroot(2) into this <br>
directory when a user logs in to &lt;ip address&gt;, thus
symlinks outside this directory will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ftp is the base directory for
&quot;normal&quot; anonymous FTP. Ftpd does a chroot(2) into
this directory when an anonymous user logs in, thus symlinks
outside this directory will not <br>
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LS <br>
The behaviour of LIST and NLST is a tricky issue. Few
servers send RFC-compliant responses to LIST, and some
clients depend on non-compliant responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This server uses glob(3) to do
filename globbing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The response to NLST is by
default similar to that of ls(1), and that to LIST is by
default similar to that of ls -l or ls -lg on most Unix
systems, except that the &quot;total&quot; count <br>
is meaningless. Only regular files, directories and symlinks
are shown. Only important ls options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Undoes -l and -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a lists even files/directories
whose names begin with &quot;.&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C lists files in as many colums
as will fit on the screen. Undoes -1 and -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d lists argument
directories&rsquo; names rather their contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D List files beginning with a
dot (&rsquo;.&rsquo;) even when the client doesn&rsquo;t
append the -a option to the list command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F appends &rsquo;*&rsquo; to
executable regular files, &rsquo;@&rsquo; to symlinks and
&rsquo;/&rsquo; to directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l shows various details about
the file, including file group. See ls(1) for details.
Undoes -1 and -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r reverses the sorting order
(modifies -S and -t and the default alphabetical
ordering).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R recursively descends into
subdirectories of the argument directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Sorts by file size instead of
by name. Undoes -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Sorts by file modification
time instead of by name. Undoes -S.</p>
