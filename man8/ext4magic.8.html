<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ext4magic - recover deleted files on ext3/4 filesystems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ext4magic {-M|-m} [-j &lt;journal_file&gt;] [-d
&lt;target_dir&gt;] &lt;filesystem&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ext4magic [-S|-J|-H|-V|-T] [-x]
[-j &lt;journal_file&gt;] [-B n|-I n|-f &lt;file_name&gt;|-i
&lt;input_list&gt;] [-t n|[[-a n][-b n]]] [-d
&lt;target_dir&gt;] [-R|-r|-L|-l] [-Q]
&lt;filesystem&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The deletion of files in ext3/4 filesystems can not be
easily reversed. Zero out of the block references in the
Inodes makes that impossible. Experience with other programs
<br>
have proved, it is often possible, to restore sufficient
information for a recover of many data files, directly from
the filesystem Journal. ext4magic can extract the
information <br>
from the Journal, and can restore files in entire directory
trees, provided that the information in the Journal are
sufficient. This tool can recover the most file types, can
<br>
recover large and sparse files, recovered files with
original filename, with the original owner an group, the
original file mode bits, and also the old atime/mtime
stamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem Journal has a
very different purpose, and it will not be possible to
recover any file at any time. Many factors affects which
data and how long the data store in <br>
the Journal. Read the ext4magic documentation for more
extensive information about the filesystem Journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Magic Options: These options are for a mulit-stage recover
especially for file restore after a recursiv deletion of
parts or the whole file system. (third step currently
avail&acirc; <br>
able for ext3 by versions 0.2.x ; a for ext4 is included in
version 0.3.x )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Umount the file system directly
after an accidentally destroy and use these options with the
umount file system or with a copy of this file system. The
program automatically <br>
determines the correct time options if the deletion has only
worked a short time (&lt; 5 min) . For very large deletions,
you must use the &quot; after time &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first and second step
files restored by copies of inodes. The third step is trying
to restore the remaining files without inode copies. This
may take a long time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Try to recover all files.
This option should be used if the entire Filessytem was
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Try to recover only all
deleted files. Use this option with a partially deleted
Filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information Options: These
options generate generic status information from the
filesystem and the Journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Print the filesystem
superblock, the option. -x allows the additional display of
content of the group descriptor table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Print the content of the
Journal superblock. This option also can used to force
loading the Journal. This has a flow control effect in
ext4magic with some other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Output a histogram of time
stamps from all filesystem Inodes. Allows you to determine
the exact time of changes in the filesystem. In connection
with a directory name or a <br>
directory Inode, only the time stamps of this directory tree
will be displayed. There are not evaluated any changes, only
one per Inode. either the last change or the <br>
deletion time per Inode arrives to display. If present
(ext4), it also create a histogram of create time
stamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional option -x allows
additional a better resolution of the time intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version of
ext4magic and libext2fs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Display the entire
transaction list of all copies of data blocks in the
Journal. In conjunction with the -B ; -I and -f , only
display the corresponding data blocks for <br>
this data . The optional option -x allows an additional
transmission time of the transactions, but only if the block
is a Inode block. The print is in the same order as <br>
the data in journal. You can make conclusions from the data
received in the Journal. After the import of backups or
after change of timestamps of files, the additional <br>
transmission time will display not always the real
transmission time. If here absolutely incorrect time
entries, then check if you using a journal of a read-write
open <br>
file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x controls optional the output
format and the information content of certain commands.
Affects the following options: -S ; -H ; -T ; -B ; -I ; -f ;
-L ; -l Detailed descrip&acirc; <br>
tion see there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selection Options: These options
specify the exact files, directories, and data blocks. One
hand, they produce specific information, and on the other
hand, be used to address the <br>
data for the Action Options. ext4magic will accept only one
of these options at command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B n n is the data block number
of a filesystem datablock. Without further options it print
a &quot;one-byte&quot; hex+ASCII dump from the data block on
the filesystem, like the &quot;hexdump <br>
-C&quot; command. The optional option -x produced a
&quot;four byte&quot; hex+ASCII output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -t n it print a
copy of the filesystem data block with this transaction
number from the Journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ext4magic /dir/filesystem.iso
-B 97 -t 22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print a hexdump of the copy from
filesystem block number 97, which has been writing to the
Journal with the transaction number 22. All copies of a
particular data block in <br>
the Journal and the associated transaction numbers you can
find with the optional Option -T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ext4magic /dir/filesystem.iso
-B 97 -T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will print a list with all
copies of filesystem block number 97 with the transaction
numbers. If this data block is a Inode block, print out the
exact time for the trans&acirc; <br>
action with the optional option -x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I n n is the Inode number.
Without any other option, the output is the content of the
real filesystem Inode. With a optional -x additional output
of a list of all data blocks <br>
addressed by this Inode. If Inode is a directory Inode, the
content of the directory entries also printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Together with one of the
following option -T ; -J the output is not the content from
the real filesystem Inode. The content of all differend
Inode copies found in the <br>
Journal are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with the option -t n only the
content of the Inode from transaction &quot; n &quot; are
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the option -I n can also be used
in conjunction with the options -L ; -l ; -r or -R (show
there)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;filename&gt; <br>
the function is the same as -I n only here is the
&lt;filename&gt; given instead the Inode number. ext4magic
search the filesystem to find the Inode number. The filename
can be <br>
a directory or a filename and must be specified here from
the root directory of this filesystem, and not from the root
directory of the LINUX system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example: the mount point for
this filesystem is &quot; /home &quot; an the filename for
Linux is &quot; /home/usr1/Document &quot; you can use now
<br>
# ext4magic /dev/sda3 -f usr1/Document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The root directory of the
filesystem you can use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f / <br>
or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &quot;&quot; <br>
for ext4magic this is the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you should specify no leading
&quot;/&quot; for all other filename. And directory names
you should specify without final &quot;/&quot; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expert Options: (new 0.2.1) The
optional Expert-Mode must be enabled with the option
&quot;--enable-expert-mode&quot; by configure. This makes it
possible to open and recover front cor&acirc; <br>
rupted file systems. In the current version it is possible
to address backup superblocks and the attempt to recover of
the Journal address from the data of the super block, and
<br>
recover all undamaged files after the filesystem was
partially damaged or overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s blocksize -n blocknumber <br>
with this options you can select the backup superblock.
blocksize can be 1024, 2048 or 4096. blocknumber is the
block number of the backup superblock this depends on the
<br>
block size. Use the same values as with &quot;fsck&quot; or
&quot;debugfs&quot; or use the output of &quot;mkfs -n
..&quot; to determine the correct value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the options necessarily in
the order &quot;-s ... -n ...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c This will attempt to find the
journal using the data of the superblock. Can help if the
first inode blocks of the file system are damaged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D trying a restore of all files
from a badly damaged file system. The combination of all
these Expert Options try a file system restore if the
superblock broken and the <br>
beginning of the file system is corrupted or overwritten.
This can only work if e2fsck has not yet changed the faulty
file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example : the first few
megabytes of the file system are overwritten. The following
tries a copy of all undamaged files of the filesystem.
Target directory is <br>
&quot;/tmp/recoverdir&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ext4magic /dev/sda1 -s 4096 -n
32768 -c -D -d /tmp/recoverdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q This is a optional high
quality Option for recover and only impact with &quot; -r
&quot; and &quot; -R &quot;. Without this option, any valid
file name restored from the directories and you <br>
can set the &quot; before &quot; time stamp to a time in
which all files are deleted. So you will find the maximum
possible number of files. It need not necessarily be found
old <br>
directory data blocks in the Journal. However, there are
some files found too much. In this mode, re-used file name
and reused Inode can not be noticed. As a result some <br>
file will be created with the extension &quot; &quot;#&quot;
or some files created with wrong content. You have to check
the files and find bad files and delete itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With option &quot; -Q &quot;
works ext4magic more accurately, and can avoid such false
and duplicate files. This requires old data blocks of the
directories in the Journal. You will <br>
not find of all directories those old blocks in the Journal.
Only directories in which files have been previously created
or deleted, but not of directories in which no <br>
change has been a long time. You should set the time stamp
&quot; before &quot; immediately before destruction time of
the files. Are not sufficient directory data available, may
<br>
be, ext4magic can&rsquo;t found deleted files or entire
directory content. This option should be used very carefully
and will achieve good results only in a few directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time Options: With this options
you specify a time window at which the program searches for
matching time stamps in the Journal data. ext4magic required
for most internaly func&acirc; <br>
tions two times. A time &quot;after&quot; and a time
&quot;before&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Found Inode only accepted, if
not deleted and there time stamp less than
&quot;before&quot;. If the delete time is less then
&quot;after&quot;, the Inode are also not used. ext4magic is
still trying <br>
to find for valid directory Inode also a time-matching
directory data. For a recover action &quot;before&quot; set
to a value at which the data deleted, and &quot;after&quot;
set to a value at which <br>
the data available. Inodes and directory data with other
timestamps will be skipped and not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default, without any time
option, ext4magic will search with &quot;now&quot; for the
internal time &quot;before&quot;, and &quot;now -24
hour&quot; for the internal time &quot;after&quot;. If you
try to recover without <br>
any time option, so you search only over the last 24 hours.
If you wait a couple of days before you try to recover
deleted data, you must always use time options, or you find
<br>
nothing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a n with this option you can
set the &quot; after &quot; time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b n with this option you can
set the &quot; before &quot; time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n is the number of seconds since
1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. This time information can you find
in many prints of ext4magic, and you can it produce on the
console with the <br>
command &quot;date&quot; and also insert directly in the
ext4magic command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a $(date -d &quot;-3day&quot;
+%s) -b $(date -d &quot;-2day&quot; +%s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this example set
&quot;after=now-36h&quot; and &quot;before=now-24h&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t n is an indirect time option.
you can use it with the options -B ; -I ; -f The value n is
the transaction number. With this option you can print,
list, or recover the data <br>
from this transaction number. you can find the transaction
numbers with the option -T or in the print of the Inode
content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File-, IN- and OUT-Options: With
these options group, you select the filesystem, and other
optional file input and output for control of ext4magic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;filesystem&gt; <br>
selects the filesystem and must always be set.
&lt;filesystem&gt; can be a blockdevice with ext3/4
filesystem, it can also be a uncompressed file image of such
a partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j &lt;journal_file&gt; <br>
optional you can select a external copy of the Journal file.
Without this option, automatically the internal Journal or,
if configured, the external Journal on a block <br>
device will used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d &lt;target_dir&gt; <br>
select the output directory. There, the recovered files were
written. If it does not exist, it is created. By default,
created files are written to the subdirectory &quot; <br>
RECOVERDIR &quot; in the workpath of the actual shell. This
output directory can not be on the same filesystem to be
tested filesystem, and should have sufficient space to <br>
write the recovered files. The filesystem on this directory
should be also ext3/4, otherwise, not LINUX like filesystems
generate some errors while writing the file prop&acirc; <br>
erties. Either you must first changed with the shell in such
a suitable filesystem, or you must specify the -d with a
target to such a directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;input_list&gt; <br>
input_list is a input file. Must contain a list with
double-quoted filenames. The files from the list will be
restored with option -r or -R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines, not cleanly double
quoted filenames and all areas before and after &quot; will
be ignored. Such a double-quoted list of file names can
create with options -l -x <br>
or -L -x by ext4magic and edited by script or by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Action Options: This option
group includes list and recover options. All functions
together, they work recursiv controlled by the time options
through directory trees. The start&acirc; <br>
ing point for search is determined by a directory name or a
directory Inode number. Default is root of this Filesystem.
Matching the time options, the filesystem data, inclusive
<br>
directory data, taken from the Journal. If good data from
the file system sections available in Journal, it is
possible to see or recover the state of the filesystem at
different <br>
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Prints the list of all
filenames and Inode number of the selected directory tree.
Included here also are deleted files and deleted directory
trees. With the additional <br>
option. -x the file names are printed double-quoted. You can
use it for a &quot;Input list&quot; with option -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Prints a list of all
filenames which have not allocated data blocks. At the
beginning of the line are the percentage of unallocated data
blocks. After deletion you find <br>
here all the file names you can recover with the Journal
data. If you use a very old value for the &quot;before&quot;
time, it is possible there are files whose data blocks
reused <br>
and these files in the interim also been deleted. Also
included in the list all files without data blocks, symbolic
links, empty and other special files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise double-quoted file
names with optional -x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r applied to directories, all
files without conflicts with the occupied blocks will
recovered. This are all you can sea with the option -l and
be 100% unallocated. This <br>
options only recover deleted files and files without data
blocks, in example: symbolic links or empty files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recovered files written to
the RECOVERDIR/ This can also set to an alternate
&lt;target_dir&gt; with the option -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files become the old
filename and if possible, also the old file properties. A
subdirectory tree can set with &quot;-f dirname&quot; oder
&quot;-I inodenumber&quot; If use with a given <br>
Inode number, the directory name is set to
&lt;inodenumber&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Time options affect the
search. If a file name already exists, or you recover again,
it not overwrite files, and a new filename by added a final
&quot;#&quot; will created. The <br>
maximum ist the extension &quot; ##### &quot; for a
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">single files also can recovered,
possible search with time-stamps or transaction number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(new 0.2.1): Starts this
function from the root directory the first stage of the
magic functions will follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This starts &quot;lost directory
search&quot; and &quot;lost file search&quot; and recovers
all the deleted inode that can not be assigned to a file
name. These files you can find in the <br>
directories MAGIC-1 and MAGIC-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R recovers directory tree, is
the same as -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But two very important
differences: Recover of all matched Inodes, even if the
blocks allocated, and recover if possible the old directory
properties. Also empty directo&acirc; <br>
ries will be restored. This recovers all deleted and all
undeleted files, and it&rsquo;s possible to recover older
file versions or directory versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In completely deleted
directories the behavior &quot; -R &quot; and &quot; -r
&quot; is identical. The difference is there only the
complete recover of all directories with option &quot; -R
&quot;. <br>
You can also restore individual files with time options or a
transaction number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all recover cases ACL, SEL
and other extended attribute can not recovered in the
current version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output starts at line with a
string &quot;--------&quot; before the recovered file name.
This is a sign of successful recover. Are not enough
permissions to write the recovered files, <br>
then you will see there some &quot;x&quot; in the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of the process,
possibly an issue comes from the hardlink database. A
positive number before a file name means : not found all
hardlinks to this file. A negative num&acirc; <br>
ber means : it created too many hardlinks to this file
(possible are, reused filenames or reused Inodes, and so,
too many or wrong old filenames for this hardlink. But also
pos&acirc; <br>
sible, all files for this hardlink are correct, the time
options was not set correct and because of that, the
selected inode for the recover was not up to date. You
should check <br>
such reports.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Re-used data blocks can&rsquo;t
realize and so it&rsquo;s possible, it ends in some
corrupted files. Check in any case, all the recoverd files
before you use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Print the content of a Inode, there are some
possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ext4magic /dev/sda3 -f /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ext4magic /dev/sda3 -I 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Direct use of the Journal of a currently read-write open
filesystem produce reading of bad blocks. Such bad blocks
provide program errors and false results. You shall

never use the Journal of such a read-write open file system
directly. Should it be necessary to use a mounted file
system, create a copy of the file system journal and used
the <br>
option -j</p>
