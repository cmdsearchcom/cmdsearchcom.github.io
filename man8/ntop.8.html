<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntop shows the current network usage. It displays a list of
hosts that are currently using the network and reports
information concerning the (IP and non-IP) traffic generated
<br>
and received by each host. ntop may operate as a front-end
collector (sFlow and/or netFlow plugins) or as a stand-alone
collector/display program. A web browser is needed to <br>
access the information captured by the ntop program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop is a hybrid layer 2 / layer
3 network monitor, that is by default it uses the layer 2
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses AND the layer 3 tcp/ip
addresses. ntop is capable <br>
of associating the two, so that ip and non-ip traffic (e.g.
arp, rarp) are combined for a complete picture of network
activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
@filename <br>
The text of filename is copied - ignoring line breaks and
comment lines (anything following a #) - into the command
line. ntop behaves as if all of the text had simply been
<br>
typed directly on the command line. For example, if the
command line is &quot;-t 3 @d -u ntop&quot; and file d
contains just the line &rsquo;-d&rsquo;, then the effective
command line is -t 3 -d -u <br>
ntop. Multiple @s are permitted. Nested @s (an @ inside the
file) are not permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember, most ntop options are
&quot;sticky&quot;, that is they just set an internal flag.
Invoking them multiple times doesn&rsquo;t change
ntop&rsquo;s behavior. However, options that set a value,
<br>
such as --trace-level, will use the LAST value given:
--trace-level 2 --trace-level 3 will run as --trace-level
3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with 3.1, many
command-line options may also be set via the web browser
interface. These changes take effect on the next run of and
on each subsequent run until <br>
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a | --access-log-file <br>
By default ntop does not maintain a log of HTTP requests to
the internal web server. Use this parameter to request
logging and to specify the location of the file where these
<br>
HTTP requests are logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each log entry is in Apache-like
style. The only difference between Apache and ntop logs is
that an additional column has been added which has the time
(in milliseconds) that <br>
ntop needed to serve the request. Log entries look like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.168.1.1 - -

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter is the complete
file name of the access log. In prior releases it was
erroneously called --access-log-path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b | --disable-decoders <br>
This parameter disables protocol decoders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protocol decoders examine and
collect information about layer 2 protocols such as NetBIOS
or Netware SAP, as well as about specific tcp/ip (layer 3)
protocols, such as DNS, http <br>
and ftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This support is specifically
coded for each protocol and is different from the capability
to count raw information (packets and bytes) by protocol
specified by the -p | --proto&acirc; <br>
cols parameter, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decoding protocols is a
significant consumer of resources. If the ntop host is
underpowered or monitoring a very busy network, you may wish
to disable protocol decoding via this <br>
parameter. It may also be appropriate to use this parameter
if you believe that ntop has problems handling some
protocols that occur on your network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if decoding is disabled,
ftp-data traffic is still decoded to look for passive ftp
port commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c | --sticky-hosts <br>
Use this parameter to prevent idle hosts from being purged
from memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default idle hosts are
periodically purged from memory. An idle host is identified
when no packets from or to that host have been monitored for
the period of time defined by <br>
the value of PARM_HOST_PURGE_MINIMUM_IDLE in
globals-defines.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use this option, all
hosts - active and idle - are retained in memory for the
duration of the ntop run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P2P users, port scans, popular
web servers and other activity will cause ntop to record
data about a large number of hosts. On an active network,
this will consume a signifi&acirc; <br>
cant - and always growing - amount of memory. It is strongly
recommended that you use a filtering expression to limit the
hosts which are stored if you use --sticky-hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idle purge is a statistical
one - a random selection of the eligible hosts will be
purged during each cycle. Thus it is possible on a busy
system for an idle host to remain <br>
in the ntop tables and appear &rsquo;active&rsquo; for some
considerable time after it is truly idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d | --daemon <br>
This parameter causes ntop to become a daemon, i.e. a task
which runs in the background without connection to a
specific terminal. To use ntop other than as a casual
monitoring <br>
tool, you probably will want to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: If you are running as a
daemon, the messages from ntop will be &rsquo;printed&rsquo;
on to stdout and thus dropped. You probably don&rsquo;t want
to do this. So remember to also use <br>
the -L or --use-syslog options to save the messages into the
system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e | --max-table-rows <br>
This defines the maximum number of lines that ntop will
display on each generated HTML page. If there are more lines
to be displayed than this setting permits, only part of the
<br>
data will be displayed. There will be page forward/back
arrows placed at the bottom of the page for navigation
between pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f | --traffic-dump-file <br>
By default, ntop captures traffic from network interface
cards (NICs) or from netFlow/sFlow probes. However, ntop can
also read data from a file - typically a tcpdump capture
<br>
or the output from one of the ntop packet capture
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if you specify -f, ntop will not
capture any traffic from NICs during or after the file has
been read. netFlow/sFlow capture - if enabled - would still
be active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mostly used for
debug purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g | --track-local-hosts <br>
By default, ntop tracks all hosts that it sees from packets
captured on the various NICs. Use this parameter to tell
ntop to capture data only about local hosts. Local hosts
<br>
are defined based on the addresses of the NICs and those
networks identified as local via the -m | --local-subnets
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter is useful on
large networks or those that see many hosts, (e.g. a border
router or gateway), where information about remote hosts is
not desired/required to be <br>
tracked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h | --help <br>
Print help information for ntop, including usage and
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i | --interface <br>
Specifies the network interface or interfaces to be used by
ntop for network monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple interfaces are used
(this feature is available only if ntop is compiled with
thread support) their names must be separated with a comma.
For instance -i &quot;eth0,lo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not specified, the default is
the first Ethernet device, e.g. eth0. The specific device
that is &rsquo;first&rsquo; is highly system dependent.
Especially on systems where the device <br>
name reflects the driver name instead of the type of
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, traffic information
obtained by all the interfaces is merged together as if the
traffic was seen by only one interface. Use the -M parameter
to keep traffic sepa&acirc; <br>
rate by interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not want ntop to
monitor any interfaces, use -i none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Windows, the parameter
value is either the number of the interface or its name,
e.g. {6252C14C-44C9-49D9-BF59-B2DC18C7B811}. Run ntop -h to
see a list of interface name- <br>
number mappings (at the end of the help information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l | --pcap-log <br>
This parameter causes a dump file to be created of the
network traffic captured by ntop in tcpdump (pcap) format.
This file is useful for debug, and may be read back into
ntop <br>
by the -f | --traffic-dump-file parameter. The dump is made
after processing any filter expression ( never even sees
filtered packets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output file will be named
&lt;path&gt;/&lt;log&gt;.&lt;device&gt;.pcap (Windows:
&lt;path&gt;/&lt;log&gt;.pcap ), where &lt;path&gt; is
defined by the -O | --output-packet-path parameter and
&lt;log&gt; is defined <br>
by this -l | --pcap-log parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m | --local-subnets <br>
ntop determines the ip addresses and netmasks for each
active interface. Any traffic on those networks is
considered local. This parameter allows the user to define
additional <br>
networks and subnetworks whose traffic is also considered
local in ntop reports. All other hosts are considered
remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commas separate multiple network
values. Both netmask and CIDR notation may be used, even
mixed together, for instance
&quot;131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local subnet - as defined by
the interface address(es) - is/are always local and do not
need to be specified. If you do give the same value as a
NIC&rsquo;s local address, a <br>
harmless warning message is issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n | --numeric-ip-addresses <br>
By default, ntop resolves IP addresses using a combination
of active (explicit) DNS queries and passive sniffing.
Sniffing of DNS responses occurs when ntop receives a
network <br>
packet containing the response to some other user&rsquo;s
DNS query. ntop captures this information and enters it into
ntop&rsquo;s DNS cache, in expectation of shortly seeing
traffic <br>
addressed to that host. This way ntop significantly reduces
the number of DNS queries it makes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter causes ntop to
skip DNS resolution, showing only numeric IP addresses
instead of the symbolic names. This option can useful when
the DNS is not present or quite <br>
slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p | --protocols <br>
This parameter is used to specify the TCP/UDP protocols that
ntop will monitor. The format is &lt;label&gt;=&lt;protocol
list&gt; [, &lt;label&gt;=&lt;protocol list&gt;], where
label is used to symbol&acirc; <br>
ically identify the &lt;protocol list&gt;. The format of
&lt;protocol list&gt; is
&lt;protocol&gt;[|&lt;protocol&gt;], where &lt;protocol&gt;
is either a valid protocol specified inside the
/etc/services <br>
file or a numeric port range (e.g. 80, or 6000-6500).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple example is
--protocols=&quot;HTTP=http|www|https|3128,FTP=ftp|ftp-data&quot;,
which reduces the protocols displayed on the &quot;IP&quot;
pages to three:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host Domain Data HTTP FTP Other
IP <br>
ns2.attbi.com &lt;flag&gt; 954 63.9 % 0 0 954 <br>
64.124.83.112.akamai.com &lt;flag&gt; 240 16.1 % 240 0 0
<br>
64.124.83.99.akamai.com &lt;flag&gt; 240 16.1 % 240 0 0 <br>
toolbarqueries.google.com &lt;flag&gt; 60 4.0 % 60 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &lt;protocol list&gt; is
very long you may store it in a file (for instance
protocol.list). To do so, specify the file name instead of
the &lt;protocol list&gt; on the command line. <br>
e.g. ntop -p protocol.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -p parameter is omitted
the following default value is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTP=ftp|ftp-data <br>
HTTP=http|www|https|3128 3128 is Squid, the HTTP cache <br>
DNS=name|domain <br>
Telnet=telnet|login <br>
NBios-IP=netbios-ns|netbios-dgm|netbios-ssn <br>
Mail=pop-2|pop-3|pop3|kpop|smtp|imap|imap2 <br>

SNMP=snmp|snmp-trap <br>
NNTP=nntp <br>
NFS=mount|pcnfs|bwnfs|nfsd|nfsd-status <br>
X11=6000-6010 <br>
SSH=22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Peer-to-Peer Protocols <br>
---------------------- <br>
Gnutella=6346|6347|6348 <br>
Kazaa=1214 <br>
WinMX=6699|7730 <br>
DirectConnect=0 Dummy port as this is a pure P2P protocol
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instant Messenger <br>
----------------- <br>
Messenger=1863|5000|5001|5190-5193</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: To resolve protocol names
to port numbers, they must be specified in the system file
used to list tcp/udp protocols and ports, which is typically
/etc/services file. You <br>
will have to match the names in that file, exactly. Missing
or unspecified (non-standard) ports must be specified by
number, such as 3128 in our examples above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a file named
/etc/protocols, don&rsquo;t get confused by it, as
that&rsquo;s the Ethernet protocol numbers, which are not
what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q | --create-suspicious-packets
<br>
This parameter tells ntop to create a dump file of
suspicious packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many, many, things
that cause a packet to be labeled as
&rsquo;suspicious&rsquo;, including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detected ICMP fragment <br>
Detected Land Attack against host <br>
Detected overlapping/tiny packet fragment <br>
Detected traffic on a diagnostic port <br>
Host performed ACK/FIN/NULL scan <br>
Host rejected TCP session <br>
HTTP/FTP/SMTP/SSH detected at wrong port <br>
Malformed TCP/UDP/ICMP packet (packet too short) <br>
Packet # %u too long <br>
Received a ICMP protocol Unreachable from host <br>
Sent ICMP Administratively Prohibited packet to host <br>
Smurf packet detected for host <br>
TCP connection with no data exchanged <br>
TCP session reset without completing 3-way handshake <br>
Two MAC addresses found for the same IP address <br>
UDP data to a closed port <br>
Unknown protocol (no HTTP/FTP/SMTP/SSH) detected (on port
80/21/25/22) <br>
Unusual ICMP options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this parameter is used, one
file is created for each network interface where suspicious
packets are found. The file is in tcpdump (pcap) format and
is named &lt;path&gt;/ntop- <br>
suspicious-pkts.&lt;device&gt;.pcap, where &lt;path&gt; is
defined by the -O | --output-packet-path parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r | --refresh-time <br>
Specifies the delay (in seconds) between automatic screen
updates for those generated HTML pages which support them.
This parameter allows you to leave your browser window open
<br>
and have it always displaying nearly real-time data from
ntop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 3 seconds. Please
note that if the delay is very short (1 second for
instance), ntop might not be able to process all of the
network traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s | --no-promiscuous <br>
Use this parameter to prevent from setting the interface(s)
into promiscuous mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An interface in promiscuous mode
will accept ALL Ethernet frames, regardless of whether they
directed (addressed) to the specific network interface (NIC)
or not. This is an <br>
essential part of enabling ntop to monitor an entire
network. (Without promiscuous mode, ntop will only see
traffic directed to the specific host it is running on, plus
broad&acirc; <br>
cast traffic such as the arp and dhcp protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if you use this parameter,
the interface could well be in promiscuous mode if another
application enabled it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop passes this setting on to
libpcap, the packet capture library. On many systems, a
non-promiscuous open of the network interface will fail,
since the libpcap function on <br>
most systems require it to capture raw packets ( ntop
captures raw packets so that we may view and analyze the
layer 2 - MAC - information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus on most systems, ntop must
probably still be started as root, and this option is
largely ornamental. If it fails, you will see a
***FATALERROR*** message referring to <br>
pcap_open_live() and then an information message,
&quot;Sorry, but on this system, even with -s, it appears
that ntop must be started as root&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t | --trace-level <br>
This parameter specifies the &rsquo;information&rsquo; level
of messages that you wish ntop to display (on stdout or to
the log). The higher the trace level number the more
information <br>
that is displayed. The trace level ranges between 0 (no
trace) and 5 (full debug tracings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default trace value is
3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace level 0 is not quite zero
messages. Fatal errors and certain startup/shutdown messages
are always displayed. Trace level 1 is used to display
errors only, level 2 for <br>
both errors and warnings, and level 3 displays error,
warning and informational messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace level 4 is called
&rsquo;noisy&rsquo; and it is - generating many messages
about the internal functioning of ntop. Trace level 5 and
above are &rsquo;noisy&rsquo; plus extra logs, i.e. all
pos&acirc; <br>
sible messages, with a file:line tag prepended to every
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u | --user <br>
Specifies the user ntop should run as after it
initializes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop must normally be started as
root so that it has sufficient privileges to open the
network interfaces in promiscuous mode and to receive raw
frames. See the discussion of <br>
-s | --no-promiscuous above, if you wish to try starting
ntop as a non-root user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shortly after starting up, ntop
becomes the user you specify here, which normally has
substantially reduced privileges, such as no login shell.
This is the userid which owns <br>
ntop&rsquo;s database and output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value specified may be
either a username or a numeric user id. The group id used
will be the primary group of the user specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this parameter is not
specified, ntop will try to switch first to
&rsquo;nobody&rsquo; and then to &rsquo;anonymous&rsquo;
before giving up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This should not be root
unless you really understand the security risks. In order to
prevent this by accident, the only way to run ntop as root
is to explicitly specify -u <br>
root. Don&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X <br>
ntop creates a new hash/list entry for each new host/TCP
session seen. In case of DOS (Denial Of Service) an attacker
can easily exhaust all the host available memory because
<br>
ntop is creating entries for dummy hosts. In order to avoid
this you can set an upper limit in order to limit the memory
ntop can use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w | --http-server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W | --https-server <br>
ntop offers an embedded web server to present the
information that has been so painstakingly gathered. An
external HTTP server is NOT required NOR supported. The ntop
web <br>
server is embedded into the application. These parameters
specify the port (and optionally the address (i.e.
interface)) of the ntop web server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if started with -w
3000 (the default port), the URL to access ntop is
http://hostname:3000/. If started with a full specification,
e.g. -w 192.168.1.1:3000, ntop <br>
listens on only that address/port combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -w is set to 0 the web server
will not listen for http:// connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W operates similarly, but
controls the port for the https:// connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop -w 3000 -W 0 (this is the
default setting) HTTP requests on port 3000 and no
HTTPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop -w 80 -W 443 Both HTTP and
HTTPS have been enabled on their most common ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop -w 0 -W 443 HTTP disabled,
HTTPS enabled on the common port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain sensitive, configuration
pages of the ntop web server are protected by a
userid/password. By default, these are the user/URL
administration, filter, shutdown and reset <br>
stats are password protected <br>
and are accessible initially only to user admin with a
password set during the first run of ntop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users can modify/add/delete
users/URLs using ntop itself - see the Admin tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The passwords, userids and URLs
to protect with passwords are stored in a database file.
Passwords are stored in an encrypted form in the database
for further security. Best <br>
practices call for securing that database so that only the
ntop user can read it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a discussion in
docs/FAQ about further securing the ntop environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z | --disable-sessions <br>
This parameter disables TCP session tracking. Use it for
better performance or when you don&rsquo;t really need/care
to track sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A | --set-admin-password <br>
This parameter is used to start ntop , set the admin
password and quit. It is quite useful for installers that
need to automatically set the password for the admin
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A and --set-admin-password
(without a value) will prompt the user for the password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use this parameter
to set a specific value using --set-admin-password=value.
The = is REQUIRED and no spaces are permitted!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you attempt to run ntop as a
daemon without setting a password, a FATAL ERROR message is
generated and ntop stops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B | --filter-expression <br>
Filters allows the user to restrict the traffic seen by ntop
on just about any imaginable item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter expression is set at
run time by this parameter, but it may be changed during the
ntop run on the Admin | Change Filter web page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic format is -B filter ,
where the quotes are REQUIRED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of the filter
expression uses the same BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)
expressions used by other packages such as tcpdump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, suppose you are
interested only in the traffic generated/received by the
host jake.unipi.it. ntop can then be started with the
following filter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop -B src host jake.unipi.it
or dst host jake.unipi.it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or in shorthand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntop -B host jake.unipi.it or
host jake.unipi.it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the &rsquo;expression&rsquo;
section of the tcpdump man page - usually available at
http://www.tcpdump.org/tcpdump_man.html - for further
information and the best quick guide to BPF <br>
filters currently available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: If you are using
complex filter expressions, especially those with =s or
meaningful spaces in them, be sure and use the long option
format, --filter-expression=&quot;xxxx&quot; <br>
and not -B &quot;xxxx&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C | <br>
This instruments ntop to be used in two configurations: host
and network mode. In host mode (default) ntop works as
usual: the IP addresses received are those of real hosts. In
<br>
host mode the IP addresses received are those of the C-class
network to which the address belongs. Using ntop in network
mode is extremely useful when installed in a traffic <br>
exchange (e.g. in the middle of the Internet) whereas the
host mode should be used when ntop is installed on the edge
of a network (e.g. inside a company). The network mode
sig&acirc; <br>
nificantly reduces the amount of work ntop has to perform
and it has to be used whenever ntop is used to find out how
the network traffic flows and not to pin-point specific <br>
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D | --domain <br>
This identifies the local domain suffix, e.g. ntop.org. It
may be necessary, if ntop is having difficulty determining
it from the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F | --flow-spec <br>
It is used to specify network flows similar to more powerful
applications such as NeTraMet. A flow is a stream of
captured packets that match a specified rule. The format
is</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;flow-label&gt;=&rsquo;&lt;matching
expression&gt;&rsquo;[,&lt;flow-label&gt;=&rsquo;&lt;matching
expression&gt;&rsquo;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">, where the label is used to
symbolically identify the flow specified by the expression.
The expression is a bpf (Berkeley Packet Filter) expression.
If an expression is speci&acirc; <br>
fied, then the information concerning flows can be accessed
following the HTML link named &rsquo;List
NetFlows&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance define two flows
with the following expression LucaHosts=&rsquo;host
jake.unipi.it or host
pisanino.unipi.it&rsquo;,GatewayRoutedPkts=&rsquo;gateway
gateway.unipi.it&rsquo; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the traffic sent/received by
hosts jake.unipi.it or pisanino.unipi.it is collected by
ntop and added to the LucaHosts flow, whereas all the packet
routed by the gateway <br>
gateway.unipi.it are added to the GatewayRoutedPkts flow. If
the flows list is very long you may store in a file (for
instance flows.list) and specify the file name instead of
<br>
the actual flows list (in the above example, this would be
&rsquo;ntop -F flows.list&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the double quotations
around the entire flow expression are required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K | --enable-debug <br>
Use this parameter to simplify application debug. It does
three things: 1. Does not fork() on the &quot;read
only&quot; html pages. 2. Displays mutex values on the
configuration <br>
(info.html) page. 3. (If available - glibc/gcc) Activates an
automated backtrace on application errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L | --use-syslog=facility <br>
Use this parameter to send log messages to the system log
instead of stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L and the simple form
--use-syslog use the default log facility, defined as
LOG_DAEMON in the #define symbol DEFAULT_SYSLOG_FACILITY in
globals-defines.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complex form,
--use-syslog=facility will set the log facility to whatever
value (e.g. local3, security) you specify. The = is REQUIRED
and no spaces are allowed!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting applies both to
ntop and to any child fork()ed for reporting. If this
parameter is not specified, any fork()ed child will use the
default value and will log it&rsquo;s <br>
messages to the system log (this occurs because the fork()ed
child must give up it&rsquo;s access to the parents
stdout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because various systems do not
make the permissible names available, we have a table at the
end of globals-core.c. Look for myFacilityNames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M | --no-interface-merge <br>
By default, ntop merges the data collected from all of the
interfaces (NICs) it is monitoring into a single set of
counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a simple network,
say a small LAN with a connection to the internet, merging
data is good as it gives you a better picture of the whole
network. For larger, more <br>
complex networks, this may not be desirable. You may also
have other reasons for wishing to monitor each interface
separately, for example DMZ vs. LAN traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs ntop not
to merge network interfaces together. This means that ntop
will collect statistics for each interface and report them
separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only ONE interface may be
reported on at a time - use the Admin | Switch NIC option on
the web server to select which interface to report upon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that activating either the
netFlow and/or sFlow plugins will force the setting of -M.
Once enabled, you cannot go back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N | --wwn-map <br>
This options names the file providing the map of WWN to
FCID/VSAN ids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O | --output-packet-path <br>
This parameter defines the base path for the
ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap and normal packet dump
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this parameter is not
specified, the default value is the config.h parameter
CFG_DBFILE_DIR, which is set during ./configure from the
--localstatedir= parameter. If --local&acirc; <br>
statedir is not specified, it defaults to the --prefix value
plus /var (e.g. /usr/local/var).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that this may not be
what you expect when running ntop as a daemon or Windows
service. Setting an explicit and absolute path value is
STRONGLY recommended if you use <br>
this facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P | --db-file-path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q | --spool-file-path <br>
These parameters specify where ntop stores database
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two types,
&rsquo;temporary&rsquo; - that is ones which need not be
retained from ntop run to ntop run, and
&rsquo;permanent&rsquo;, which must be retained (or
recreated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;permanent&rsquo;
databases are the preferences, &quot;prefsCache.db&quot; and
the password file, &quot;ntop_pw.db&quot;. These are stored
in the -P | --db-file-path specified location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain plugins use the -P |
--db-file-path specified location for their database
(&quot;LsWatch.db&quot;) or (as a default value) for files
(.../rrd/...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;temporary&rsquo;
databases are the address queue,
&quot;addressQueue.db&quot;, the cached DNS resolutions,
&quot;dnsCache.db&quot; and the MAC prefix (vendor table),
&quot;macPrefix.db&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only -P | --db-file-path is
specified, it is used for both types of databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directories named must allow
read/write and file creation by the ntop user. For security,
nobody else should have even read access to these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the default value is
the config.h parameter CFG_DBFILE_DIR. This is set during
./configure from the --localstatedir= parameter. If
--localstatedir is not specified, <br>
it defaults to the --prefix value plus /var (e.g.
/usr/local/var).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may not be what you expect
when running ntop as a daemon or Windows service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on versions of ntop
prior to 2.3, these parameters defaulted to &quot;.&quot;
(the current working directory, e.g. the value returned by
the pwd command) and caused havoc as it <br>
was different when ntop was run from the command line, vs.
run via cron, vs. run from an initialization script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting an explicit and absolute
path value is STRONGLY recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U | --mapper <br>
Specifies the URL of the mapper.pl utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If provided, ntop creates a
clickable hyperlink on the &rsquo;Info about host
xxxxxx&rsquo; page to this URL by appending ?host=xxxxx. Any
type of host lookup could be performed, but this <br>
is intended to lookup the geographical location of the
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A cgi-based mapper interface to
http://www.multimap.com is part of the ntop distribution
[see www/Perl/mapper.pl]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V | --version <br>
Prints ntop version information and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W | --https-server <br>
(See the joint documentation with the -w parameter,
above)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-instantsessionpurge
<br>
ntop sets completed sessions as &rsquo;timed out&rsquo; and
then purge them almost instantly, which is not the behavior
you might expect from the discussions about purge timeouts.
This <br>
switch makes ntop respect the timeouts for completed
sessions. It is NOT the default because a busy web server
may have 100s or 1000s of completed sessions and this would
sig&acirc; <br>
nificantly increase the amount of memory ntop uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-mutexextrainfo <br>
ntop stores extra information about the locks and unlocks of
the protective mutexes it uses. Since ntop uses fine-grained
locking, this information is updated frequently. On <br>
some OSes, the system calls used to collect this informatio
(getpid() and gettimeofday()) are expensive. This option
disables the extra information. It should have no
process&acirc; <br>
ing impact on ntop <br>
- however should ntop actually deadlock, we would lose the
information that sometimes tells us why.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-ndpi <br>
ntop is started without nDPI support thus application
protocols are not recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-python <br>
ntop is started without the Python interpreter. Beware as
some ntop reports are based on python, thus disabling it
will prevent some reports to work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run multiple instances
of ntop simultaneously by specifying different -P values
(typically through separate ntop.conf files). If you set a
value for this parameter <br>
(available only on the command line), you (1) display the
&rsquo;instance&rsquo; name on every web page and (2) alter
the log prefix from &quot;NTOP&quot; to your chosen
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to make the tag more
obvious, create a .instance class in style.css, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.instance { <br>
color: #666666; <br>
font-size: 18pt; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note (UNIX): To run completely
different versions of the ntop binary, you need to compile
and install into a different library (using ./configure
--prefix) and then specify the <br>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH before invoking, e.g.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/devel/lib/ntop/:...
/devel/bin/ntop ...args...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If present, a file of the form
&lt;instance&gt;_ntop_logo.gif will be used instead of the
normal ntop_logo.gif. This is tested for ONLY once, at the
beginning of the run. The EXACT <br>
word(s) of the --instance flag are used, without testing if
they make a proper file name. If - for any reason - the file
is not found, an informational message is logged and <br>
the normal logo file is used. To construct your own logo,
make it a 300x40 transparent gif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: On the web pages, ntop
uses the dladdr() function. The original Solaris routine had
a bug, replicated in FreeBSD (and possibly other places)
where it uses the ARGV[0] <br>
value - which might be erroneous - instead of the actual
file name. If the &rsquo;running from&rsquo; value looks
bogus but the &rsquo;libaries in&rsquo; value looks ok, go
with the libarary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--p3p-cp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--p3p-uri</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P3P is a W3C recommendation -
http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/ - for specifying personal
information a site collects and what it does with the
information. These parameters allow to <br>
return P3P information. We do not supply samples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pcap_setnonblock <br>
On some platforms, the ntop web server will hang or appear
to hang (it actually just responds incredibly slowly to the
first request from a browser session), while the rest of
<br>
ntop runs just fine. This is known to be an issue under
FreeBSD 4.x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets the
non-blocking option (assuming it&rsquo;s available in the
version of libpcap that is installed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While this works around the
problem (by turing an interupt driven process into a poll),
it also MAY signifcantly increases the cpu usage of ntop.
Although it does not actually <br>
interfere with other work, seeing ntop use 80-90% or more of
the cpu is not uncommon - don&rsquo;t say we didn&rsquo;t
warn you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THIS OPTION IS OFFICIALLY
UNSUPPORTED and used at your own risk. Read the docs/FAQ
write-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-version-check <br>
By default, ntop accesses a remote file to periodically
check if the most current version is running. This option
disables that check. Please review the privacy notice at the
<br>
bottom of this page for more information. By default, the
recheck period is slightly more than 15 days. This can be
adjusted via a constant in globals-defines.h. If the <br>
result of the initial check indicates that the ntop version
is a &rsquo;new development&rsquo; version (that is newer
than the latest published development version), the recheck
is dis&acirc; <br>
abled. This is because which fixes and enhancements were
present/absent from the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: At present, the recheck
does not work under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl-watchdog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable a watchdog for webserver
hangs. These usually happen when connecting with older
browsers. The user gets nothing back and other users
can&rsquo;t connect. Internally, packet <br>
processing continues but there is no way to access the data
through the web server or shutdown ntop cleanly. With the
watchdog, a timeout occurs after 3 seconds, and processing
<br>
continues with a log message. Unfortunately, the user sees
nothing - it just looks like a failed connection. (also
available as a ./configure option, --enable-sslwatchdog)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--w3c <br>
By default, ntop generates displayable but not great html.
There are a number of tags we do not generate because they
cause problems with older browsers which are still
com&acirc; <br>
monly used or are important to look good on real-world
browsers. This flag tells ntop to generate
&rsquo;BETTER&rsquo; (but not perfect) w3c compliant html
4.01 output. This in no way <br>
addresses all of the compatibility and markup issues. Over
time, we would like to make ntop more compatible, but it
will never be 100%. If you find any issues, please report
<br>
them to ntop-dev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 | --ipv4 <br>
Use IPv4 connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 | --ipv6 <br>
Use IPv6 connections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WEB VIEWS <br>
While ntop is running, multiple users can access the traffic
information using their web browsers. ntop does not generate
&rsquo;fancy&rsquo; or &rsquo;complex&rsquo; html, although
it does use frames, <br>
shallowly nested tables and makes some use of JavaScript and
Cascading Style Sheets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with release 3.1, the
menus are cascading dropdowns via JSCookMenu. With release
3.2, this extends to plugins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We do not expect problems with
any current web browser, but our ability to test with less
common ones is very limited. Testing has included Firefox

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
ntop requires a number of external tools and libraries to
operate. Certain other tools are optional, but add to the
program&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--webserver-queue <br>
Specifies the maximum number of web server requests for the
tcp/ip stack to retain in it&rsquo;s queue awaiting delivery
to the ntop web server. Requests in excess of this queue may
<br>
be dropped (allowing for retransmission) or rejected at the
tcp/ip stack level, depending upon the OS. Whatever happens,
happens at the OS level, without any information being <br>
delivered to ntop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRIVACY NOTICE <br>
By default at startup and at periodic intervals, the ntop
program will retrieve a file containing current ntop program
version information. Retrieving this file allows this ntop
<br>
instance to confirm that it is running the most current
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The retrieval is done using
standard http:// requests, which will create log records on
the hosting system. These log records do contain information
which identifies a specific <br>
ntop site. Accordingly, you are being notified that this
individually identifiable information is being transmitted
and recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may request - via the
--skip-version-check run-time option - that this check be
eliminated. If you use this option, no individually
identifiable information is transmitted <br>
or recorded, because the entire retrieval and check is
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We ask you to allow this
retrieval and check, because it benefits both you and the
ntop developers. It benefits you because you will be
automatically notified if the ntop pro&acirc; <br>
gram version is obsolete, becomes unsupported or is no
longer current. It benefits the developers of ntop because
it allows us to determine the number of active ntop
instances, <br>
and the operating system/versions that users are running
ntop under. This allows us to focus development resources on
systems like those our users are using ntop on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The individually identifiable
information is contained in the web server log records which
are automatically created each time the version file is
retrieved. This is a function <br>
of the web server and not of ntop , but we do take advantage
of it. The log record shows the IP address of the requestor
(the ntop instance) and a User-Agent header field. We <br>
place information in the User-Agent header as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Distro and release information
is determined at compile time and consists of information
typically found in the /etc/release (or similar) file. See
the ntop tool linuxrelease for <br>
how this is determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc compiler version (if
available) is the internal version #s for the gcc compiler,
e.g. 3.2.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernrlse is the Linux Kernel
version or the xBSD &rsquo;release&rsquo; such as
4.9-RELEASE and is determined from the uname data (if
it&rsquo;s available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ./configure parameters are
stripped of directory paths, leading -s, etc. to create a
short form that shows us what ./configure parameters people
are using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the run time
parameters are stripped of data and paths, just showing
which flags are being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The libpcap, gdbm, openssl and
zlib versions come from the strings returned by the various
inquiry functions (if they&rsquo;re availabe).</p>
