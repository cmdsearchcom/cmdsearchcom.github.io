<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
news2mail - Channel script to gateway news into e-mails</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
news2mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
news2mail runs as a channel process underneath innd. It is
set up as channel feed in newsfeeds, with different
mailing-lists as funnel entries pointing to it (see below);
<br>
news2mail expects the token of an article followed by a
sequence of list names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">news2mail uses the configuration
file pathetc/news2mail.cf to map mailing-list names to
e-mail addresses. news2mail causes sendmail to queue the
messages for later delivery (to <br>
avoid DOS attacks by mass postings). You must run
&quot;sendmail -q&quot; periodically to get the queue
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file format is simple: comments (starting
with a hash sign &quot;#&quot;) and blank lines are ignored.
All other lines have two or three fields on them. The first
is <br>
the list name and is what innd uses (i.e. the site field of
the entry in the newsfeeds file). The second field is the
actual e-mail address to send the article to. The third <br>
field is optional: it sets the envelope-from address (for
instance a list member&rsquo;s address; if not set, it
defaults to the &quot;news&quot; user).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In e-mail messages, the To:
header will have the mailing-list address (i.e. the second
field). Besides, news2mail strips most article headers from
the article before mailing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In newsfeeds, the channel feed
should look like:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">news2mail!:!*:Ac,Tc,Wn*:&lt;pathbin&gt;/news2mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and for each mailing-list, you
only have to add to newsfeeds an entry list like:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-big-red-ants/lists.ucsd.edu:!*,rec.pets.red-ants:Ap,Tm:news2mail!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note the use of
&quot;Ap&quot; and the exclusion of the list owner domain to
protect the list from feeding back new arrivals from the
list. The site name used in the newfeeds entry <br>
for a mailing-list (above &quot;list-big-red-ants&quot;)
must be the same as the first field in an entry in
news2mail.cf. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Newsfeeds-name List-to-address
[List-sender-address] <br>
list-big-red-ants big-red-ants@lists.ucsd.edu
news+big-red-ants@local.news.server.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
pathbin/news2mail <br>
The Perl program itself used to gateway news into
e-mails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathetc/news2mail.cf <br>
The configuration file which specifies the mapping to use
for gatewaying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The news2mail program is set up as a funneled channel in
newsfeeds, implying multiple matches should be handled as
one - and multiple matching funneled feeds will result in a
<br>
single call to the script. Therefore, since only one mail is
sent, crossposts are not currently properly handled as for
the envelope-from address (which then defaults to the <br>
&quot;news&quot; user).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
news2mail was written by Brian Kantor in 1998. This man page
was written by James Brister and converted to POD by Julien
Elie. The third optional field in news2mail.cf was <br>
added by D. Stussy in 2008.</p>
