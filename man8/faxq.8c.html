<p>FAXQ(8C) FAXQ(8C)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faxq - HylaFAX queue manager process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/faxq [ -D ] [ -q queue-dir ] [ -c config ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
faxq is the central queueing agent for HylaFAX. One (and
only one) faxq process is normally running at all times.
faxq is responsible for scheduling, preparing, and
initiating <br>
outbound facsimile jobs (and potentially other types of jobs
as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxq may be run by itself to
provide outbound-only services or it may be run together
with one or more faxgetty(8C) processes, in which case
inbound services (e.g. receiving fac&acirc; <br>
simile) are provided. When faxq is run by itself the set of
available modems must be specified using the faxmodem(8C)
command. Each modem specified in this way is assumed to <br>
exist and to be capable of use as a facsimile modem. When
faxq is run in conjunction with faxgetty processes, it is
not necessary to use faxmodem to specify modems; instead the
<br>
programs communicate information about the status and
capabilities of each modem. The latter setup provides a more
robust and powerful system and is the intended way for the
<br>
software to operate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxq receives notification of
outbound jobs to process from the hfaxd(8C) process that
implements the server-side of the HylaFAX client-server
protocol. Notification is through <br>
messages sent to a FIFO special file that faxq listens to.
This file is also used by other administrative programs such
as faxquit(8C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many aspects of faxq operation
may be controlled through a configuration file. This file is
located in the spooler hierarchy in the etc subdirectory and
is named config (as <br>
opposed to the per-modem configuration files named
config.devid); consult hylafax-config(5F) for detailed
information on this configuration file. Note that faxq
automatically <br>
re-reads its configuration file if it has been changed. It
is also possible to dynamically change configuration
parameters in a running process with the faxconfig(8C)
program. <br>
Beware however that parameters changed in this way will be
reset to the values specified in the configuration file if
the file is re-read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q dir The specified directory is treated as the spooling
area. The default spooling area, /var/spool/hylafax, is
defined at the time the software is built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D This option forces faxq to
remain attached to the controlling tty from which it was
invoked. In normal operation faxq will fork(2) and
disassociate itself from the <br>
controlling tty. This option is useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config Treat config as a
configuration parameter specification that is interpreted
after reading the configuration file. For example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;-c servertracing:0x4f&rsquo;&rsquo; would set
the <br>
ServerTracing configuration parameter to
&lsquo;&lsquo;0x4f&rsquo;&rsquo;, overriding any setting in
the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/spool/hylafax/FIFO FIFO special file for submitting
commands <br>
/var/spool/hylafax/etc/config configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consult hylafax-server(5F) for a
complete discussion of the structure and content of the
spooling area.</p>
