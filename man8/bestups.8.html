<p>BESTUPS(8) NUT Manual BESTUPS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bestups - Driver for Best Power / SOLA (Phoenixtec protocol)
UPS equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the bestups driver. For information about the core
driver, see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
bestups was designed to monitor Best Power UPS hardware like
the Fortress, Fortress Telecom, Axxium Rackmount and Patriot
Pro. It also recognizes and supports SOLA units such as <br>
the 325, 520 and 620. In addition, the Best 610 is supported
using the &acirc;ID&acirc; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other UPS hardware using the
Phoenixtec protocol should also work, but they will generate
a warning since their battery information is not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This driver does not support
some older Best/SOLA units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following optional settings in the
ups.conf(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nombattvolt=num <br>
Override the battery float voltage which is normally
determined by asking the hardware. This is useful if your
UPS constantly reports battery.charge values just below 100%
<br>
even when it&acirc;s completely charged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have this problem, set
this to whatever battery.voltage reports when the UPS is
known to be completely charged with a good battery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The author&acirc;s Best Fortress
750 uses nombattvolt=27.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battvoltmult=num <br>
Multiply the reported battery voltage by this number. Some
devices report only a fraction of the total battery
voltage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the SOLA 610 700VA
UPS (with a 24V battery) reports the single cell voltage
(about 2.27V when fully charged). In this particular case
you can set battvoltmult = <br>
12 in ups.conf(8) to fix this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID=string <br>
Set the Identification response string. This should only be
used with hardware that supports the Phoenixtec protocol
status inquiry commands, but not the &quot;ID&quot; command,
such <br>
as the Best/SOLA 610. Format of the ID string is:
AAA,BBBB,CCC,DDD,EE.E,FF.F</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AAA is the three-character
identification for the UPS model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BBBB is the output power in VA
(volt amperes). B is an integer number ranging from 0 to
9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCC is the Nominal Input
Voltage. C is an integer number ranging from 0 to 9. The
unit is Volts AC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DDD is the Nominal Output
Voltage. D is an integer number ranging from 0 to 9. The
unit is Volts AC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EE.E is the Battery Voltage that
will cause the UPS to shut itself off. E is an integer
number ranging from 0 to 9. Then unit is Volts DC and a
decimal point is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF.F or FFF.F is the Battery
Voltage at full charge. F is an integer number ranging from
0 to 9. Then unit is Volts DC. Typically, for 700VA, 1KVA
and 1.5KVA units, the <br>
format is FF.F. For 2KVA and 3KVA units, the format is
FFF.F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: a Best 610 1.5KVA unit
would use the string
&quot;610,1500,120,120,10.0,48.0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The battery charge percentage value (in battery.charge) is
derived from the voltage data that the UPS returns, since
the UPS doesn&acirc;t return that value directly. On some
hardware, <br>
the charge will remain at 100% for a long time and then
drops quickly shortly before the battery runs out. You can
confirm from the battery.voltage readings that this is a
<br>
problem with the UPS and not this driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the float from the
charger in some models forces the battery charge percentage
back up to 100% immedately after the UPS goes back on-line,
so you can&acirc;t tell when it is <br>
really recharged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, some models give one
value for the battery&acirc;s nominal voltage and yet
actually have a nominal voltage slightly below that. This
leads to things such as the perpetual <br>
98.7% charge on the author&acirc;s Fortress 750, even when
it&acirc;s been charging for weeks. You can use nombattvolt=
in ups.conf(8) to fix this.</p>
