<b>chiark-named-conf</b> is a tool for managing nameserver configurations and
  checking for suspected DNS problems. Its main functions are to check that
  delegations are appropriate and working, that secondary zones are slaved from
  the right places, and to generate a configuration for <b>BIND</b>, from its
  own input file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, for each zone, in addition to any warnings, the output lists the
  zone's configuration type. If the zone is checked, the serial number at each
  of the nameservers is shown, with any unpublished primary having <b>*</b>
  after the serial number.

If one of the options <b>-n</b>, <b>-y</b>, or <b>-f</b> is supplied then
  chiark-named-conf will read its main configuration file for the list of
  relevant zones. It will then check the configuration and delegation for each
  zone and/or generate and install a new configuration file for the nameserver:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-y</b>|<b>--yes</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Generate and install new nameserver config, as well as

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      store the results; --mail-final also sends a mail to the zone SOA MNAME or
      local administrator, if too many of the calls had errors or warnings
      (calls before the most recent --mail-first being ignored).</dd>

Alternatively, one or more zone names may be supplied as arguments, in which
  case their delegations will be checked, and compared with the data for that
  zone in the main configuration (if any). In this case no new configuration
  file for the nameserver will be made.

The file <b>/etc/bind/chiark-conf-gen.zones</b> (or other file specified with
  the <b>-C</b> option) contains a sequence of directives, one per line. Blank
  lines are permitted. Leading and trailing whitespace on each line is ignored.
  Comments are lines starting with <b>#</b>. Ending a line with a <b></b> joins
  it to the next line, so that long directives can be split across several
  physical lines.

These directives specify general configuration details. They should appear
  before directives specifying zones, as each will affect only later zone
  directives. Foreign zones (zones explicitly specified on the command line but
  not mentioned in the configuration) use the configuration settings prevailing
  at the end of the config file.

    To avoid indefinitely long or even circularly glueless referrals (which
      delay or prevent lookups) it is necessary for all sites to effectively
      implement similar conventions; currently the author believes that only the
      reverse lookup namespaces are conventionally devoid of (glueless)
      nameservers, and therefore fine to provide glueless referrals for. See

      <b>allow-indirect-glue</b> <i>nameserver-superdomain</i>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This supports to common configuration style where DNS operator(s) set up all
      of their nameservers with names within a small subsection of the DNS (the
      portions under <i>nameserver-superdomain</i>s), and provide glueless
      referrals naming these nameservers for all other zones. This provides at
      most one level of missing glue.

    Note that if the DNS administrators collectively able to influence the
      service for some zone (including the admins for its superzones, the zones
      containing its nameservers, and their superzones and so forth) are not in
      sufficiently close communication do not all agree on the proper set of
      <i>nameserver-superdomain</i> then they might still set up circular glue

chiark-named-conf makes the following checks:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Delegations: Each delegation from a server for the superzone should contain the
  same set of nameservers. None of the delegations should lack glue. The glue
  addresses should be the same in each delegation, and agree with the local
  default nameserver.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Delegated servers: Each server mentioned in the delegation should have the same
  SOA record (and obviously, should be authoritative).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All published nameservers - including delegated servers and servers named in the
  zone's nameserver set: All nameservers for the zone should supply the same
  list of nameservers for the zone, and none of this authority information
  should be glueless. All the glue should always give the same addresses.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Origin server's data: The set of nameservers in the origin server's version of
  the zone should be a superset of those in the delegations.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Our zone configuration: For primary zones, the SOA origin should be one of the
  names specified with <b>self-soa</b> (or <b>self</b>). For published zones,
  the address should be that of the SOA origin. For stealth zones, the address
  should be that of the SOA origin or one of the published nameservers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GLUELESSNESS"><a class="selflink" href="#GLUELESSNESS">GLUELESSNESS</a></h1>
Glue is the name given for the addresses of nameservers which are often supplied
  in a referral. In fact, it turns out that it is important for the reliability
  and performance of the DNS that referrals, in general, always come with glue.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Firstly, glueless referrals usually cause extra delays looking up names. BIND 8,
  when it receives a completely glueless referral and does not have the
  nameservers' addresses in its cache, will start queries for the nameserver
  addresses; but it will throw the original client's question away, so that when
  these queries arrive, it won't restart the query from where it left off. This
  means that the client won't get its answer until it retries, typically at
  least 1 second later - longer if you have more than one nameserver listed.
  Worse, if the nameserver to which the glueless referral points is itself under
  another glueless referral, another retry will be required.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Even for better resolvers than BIND 8, long chains of glueless referrals can
  cause performance and reliability problems, turning a simple two or three
  query exchange into something needing more than a dozen queries.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Even worse, one might accidentally create a set of circularly glueless referrals
  such as
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>example.com NS ns0.example.net.uk</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>example.com NS ns1.example.net.uk</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>example.net.uk NS ns0.example.com</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>example.net.uk NS ns1.example.com</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Here it is impossible to look up anything in either example.com or
  example.net.uk.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are, as far as the author is aware, no generally agreed conventions or
  standards for avoiding unreasonably long glueless chains, or even circular
  glueless situations. The only way to guarantee that things will work properly
  is therefore to always supply glue.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, the situation is further complicated by the fact that many
  implementations (including BIND 8.2.3, and many registry systems), will refuse
  to accept glue RRs for delegations in a parent zonefile unless they are under
  the parent's zone apex. In these cases it can be necessary to create names for
  the child's nameservers which are underneath the child's apex, so that the
  glue records are both in the parent's bailiwick and obviously necessary.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the past, the `shared registry system' managing .com, .net and .org did not
  allow a single IPv4 address to be used for more than one nameserver name.
  However, at the time of writing (October 2002) this problem seems to have been
  fixed, and the workaround I previously recommended (creating a single name for
  your nameserver somewhere in .com, .net or .org, and using that for all the
  delegations from .com, .net and .org) should now be avoided.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, a note about `reverse' zones, such as those in in-addr.arpa: It does
  not seem at all common practice to create nameservers in in-addr.arpa zones
  (ie, no NS RRs seem to point into in-addr.arpa, even those for in-addr.arpa
  zones). Current practice seems to be to always use nameservers for
  in-addr.arpa which are in the normal, forward, address space. If everyone
  sticks to the rule of always publishing nameservers names in the `main' part
  of the namespace, and publishing glue for them, there is no chance of anything
  longer than a 1-step glueless chain might occur for a in-addr.arpa zone. It is
  probably best to maintain this as the status quo, despite the performance
  problem this implies for BIND 8 caches. This is what the serverless-glueless
  directive is for.

Dan Bernstein has some information and examples about this at
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/notes.html#gluelessness">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/notes.html#gluelessness</a>
  but be warned that it is rather opinionated.

  SUMMARY</a></h2>
I recommend that every nameserver should have its own name in every forward zone
  that it serves. For example:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>zone.example.com NS servus.ns.example.com</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>servus.ns.example.com A 127.0.0.2</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>2.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa PTR servus.example.net</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>servus.example.net A 127.0.0.2</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Domain names in <b>in-addr.arpa</b> should not be used in the right hand side of
  NS records.

chiark-named-conf is supposed to be resistant to malicious data in the DNS. It
  is not resistant to malicious data in its own options, configuration file or
  environment. It is not supposed to read its stdin, but is not guaranteed to be
  safe if stdin is dangerous.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Killing chiark-named-conf suddenly should be safe, even with <b>-y</b> or
  <b>-f</b> (though of course it may not complete its task if killed), provided
  that only one invocation is made at once.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Slow remote nameservers will cause chiark-named-conf to take excessively long.

Setting variables used by <b>dig</b>(1) and <b>adnshost</b>(1) will affect the
  operation of chiark-named-conf. Avoid messing with these if possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PATH</b> is used to find subprograms such as <b>dig</b> and <b>adnshost</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The determination of the parent zone for each zone to be checked, and its
  nameservers, is done simply using the system default nameserver.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The processing of output from <b>dig</b> is not very reliable or robust, but
  this is mainly the fault of dig. This can lead to somewhat unhelpful error
  reporting for lookup failures.
