CHIARK-NAMED-CONF(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chiark-named-conf - check and generate nameserver
configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chiark-named-conf [options] -n|-y|-f <br>
chiark-named-conf [options] zone ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
chiark-named-conf is a tool for managing nameserver
configurations and checking for suspected DNS problems. Its
main functions are to check that delegations are appropriate
and <br>
working, that secondary zones are slaved from the right
places, and to generate a configuration for BIND, from its
own input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, for each zone, in
addition to any warnings, the output lists the zone&rsquo;s
configuration type. If the zone is checked, the serial
number at each of the nameservers is <br>
shown, with any unpublished primary having * after the
serial number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
MODE OPTIONS <br>
If one of the options -n, -y, or -f is supplied then
chiark-named-conf will read its main configuration file for
the list of relevant zones. It will then check the
configuration <br>
and delegation for each zone and/or generate and install a
new configuration file for the nameserver:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y|--yes <br>
Generate and install new nameserver config, as well as
checking configuration, for all listed zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n|--no <br>
Check configuration, for all listed zones, but do not
generate new nameserver config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f|--force <br>
Generate and install new nameserver config, without doing
any configuration cross-checking. (Syntax errors in our
input configuration will still abort this operation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nothing <br>
Do nothing: do no checks, and don&rsquo;t write a new
config. This can be used to get a list of the zones being
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mail-first | --mail-middle |
--mail-final <br>
Send mails to zone SOA MNAMEs reporting zones with problems.
You must call chiark-named-conf at least twice, once with
--mail-first, and later with --mail-final, and <br>
preferably with one or more calls to --mail-middle in
between. All three options carry out a check and store the
results; --mail-final also sends a mail to the zone SOA <br>
MNAME or local administrator, if too many of the calls had
errors or warnings (calls before the most recent
--mail-first being ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mail-final-test <br>
just like --mail-final except that it always sends mail to
the local server admin and never to remote zone contacts,
adding (testing!) to the start of the To: field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, one or more zone
names may be supplied as arguments, in which case their
delegations will be checked, and compared with the data for
that zone in the main configu&acirc; <br>
ration (if any). In this case no new configuration file for
the nameserver will be made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDITIONAL OPTIONS <br>
-A|--all <br>
Checks even zones known to be broken. Ie, ignores the ? zone
style modifier in the configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C|--config config-file <br>
Use config-file instead of /etc/bind/chiark-conf-gen.zones.
Also changes the default directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enables debugging. Useful for
debugging chiark-named-conf, but probably not useful for
debugging your DNS configuration. Repeat to increase the
debugging level. (Maxi&acirc; <br>
mum is -DD.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g|--glueless <br>
Do not warn about glueless referrals (strictly, makes the
zone style modifier ~ the default). Not recommended - see
the section GLUELESSNESS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l|--local <br>
Only checks for mistakes which are the responsibility of the
local administrator (to fix or get fixed). This means that
for published and stealth zones we only check that <br>
we&rsquo;re slaving from the right place and that any names
and addresses for ourself are right. For primary zones all
checks are still done. It is a mistake to specify -l <br>
with foreign zones (zones supplied explictly on the command
line but not relevant to the local server); doing so
produces a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgroup!*$@~? <br>
Overrides a modifiers directive in the configuration file.
The modifiers specified in the directive are completely
replaced by those specified in this command line <br>
option. (Note that modifiers specified in per-zone
directives still override these per-group settings.) If more
than one modifiers directive specifies the same group, <br>
they are all affected. modifiers directives which
don&rsquo;t specify a group cannot be affected. It is an
error if the group does not appear in the config file. See
ZONE <br>
STYLE MODIFIERS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special group foreign is
used for zones which don&rsquo;t appear in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q|--quiet <br>
Suppress the usual report of the list of nameservers for
each zone and the serial number from each. When specified
twice, do not print any information except warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r|--repeat <br>
When a problem is detected, warn for all sources of the same
imperfect data, rather than only the first we come
across</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v|--verbose <br>
Print additional information about what is being checked, as
we go along.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The file /etc/bind/chiark-conf-gen.zones (or other file
specified with the -C option) contains a sequence of
directives, one per line. Blank lines are permitted. Leading
and <br>
trailing whitespace on each line is ignored. Comments are
lines starting with #. Ending a line with a .ft R joins it
to the next line, so that long directives can be split <br>
across several physical lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL DIRECTIVES <br>
These directives specify general configuration details. They
should appear before directives specifying zones, as each
will affect only later zone directives. Foreign zones <br>
(zones explicitly specified on the command line but not
mentioned in the configuration) use the configuration
settings prevailing at the end of the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">admin email-address <br>
Specifies the email address of the local administrator. This
is used in the From: line of mails sent out, and will also
receive copies of the reports. There is no <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-dir directory <br>
Makes directory be the default directory (which affects the
interpretation of relative filenames). The default is the
directory containing the main configuration file, ie <br>
/etc/bind if no -C option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forbid-addr [ip-address ...]
<br>
Specifies the list of addresses that are forbidden as any
nameserver for any zone. The default is no such
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forbid-addr [ip-address ...]
<br>
Specifies the list of addresses that are forbidden as a
nameserver for a zone for which we are the primary - ie, the
list of our old or to-be-obsoleted slaves. The <br>
default is no such addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serverless-glueless domain ...
<br>
Specifies a list of domains under which we do not expect to
find any nameservers without glue; for these zones it is OK
to find glueless referrals. Each domain listed <br>
names a complete subtree of the DNS, starting at the named
point. The default is in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa ip6.int.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid indefinitely long or
even circularly glueless referrals (which delay or prevent
lookups) it is necessary for all sites to effectively
implement similar conven&acirc; <br>
tions; currently the author believes that only the reverse
lookup namespaces are conventionally devoid of (glueless)
nameservers, and therefore fine to provide glueless <br>
referrals for. See GLUELESSNESS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow--indirect-glue
nameserver-superdomain ... <br>
Specifies a list of domains under which we expect to find
glueless nameservers, with up to one layer of indirection.
For nameservers under these domains it is OK to to <br>
find glueless referrals, but only when listed as a
nameserver for a zone which is not itself a subdomain of an
allow-indirect-glue nameserver-superdomain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This supports to common
configuration style where DNS operator(s) set up all of
their nameservers with names within a small subsection of
the DNS (the portions under name&acirc; <br>
server-superdomains), and provide glueless referrals naming
these nameservers for all other zones. This provides at most
one level of missing glue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the DNS
administrators collectively able to influence the service
for some zone (including the admins for its superzones, the
zones containing its name&acirc; <br>
servers, and their superzones and so forth) are not in
sufficiently close communication do not all agree on the
proper set of nameserver-superdomain then they might still
<br>
set up circular glue and chiark-named-conf would not
necessarily be able to detect this even if it was run on
every relevant nameserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail-state-dir directory <br>
Uses directory for storing information about recent failures
for mailing to zone admins. See --mail-first et al. Old
files in here should be cleaned up periodically out <br>
of cron. There is no default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail-max-warnfreq percentage
<br>
When --mail-final is used, a mail will be sent to all zones
which had warnings or errors more than percentage% of the
times --mail-* was used (since the last <br>
--mail-first). The default is 50%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modifiers !*$@~?] [group] <br>
Applies the specified zone style modifiers (see below) to
subsequently declared zones (until the next modifiers
directive), as if the modifiers specified were written out
<br>
for each zone. You must specify at least one character for
the modifiers; if you want to reset everything to the
default, just say !. If style modifiers specified in the
<br>
zone directive conflict with the modifiers directive, those
specified in the zone directive take effect. group may
contain alphanumerics and underscores, and is used for <br>
the -m command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">self-addr ip-address ... <br>
Specifies the list of addresses that this server may be
known by in A records. There is no default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output format filename [format
filename ...] <br>
Arranges that each filename will be overwritten when -y or
-f are used; its new contents will be configuration
directives for the zones which follow for the nameserver in
<br>
question. Currently the only format supported is bind8 which
indicates new-style BIND 8. If no zones follow, then each
file will still be overwritten, by an effectively <br>
empty file. Default: if there is no output directive in the
configuration then the default is to use bind8
chiark-conf-gen.bind8; otherwise it is an error for there to
be <br>
any zones in the configuration before the first output
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">self-ns fqdn ... <br>
Specifies the list of names that this server may be known by
in NS records. There is no default. Any trailing * is
replaced by the name of the zone being checked, so for <br>
example self-ns isp.ns.* before the zone example.com would
mean to expect us to be listed as isp.ns.example.com in the
NS RRset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">self-soa fqdn ... <br>
Specifies the list of names that this server may be known by
in the ORIGIN field of SOA records. There is no default. Any
trailing * is replaced by the name of the zone, <br>
as for self-ns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">self fqdn ... <br>
Equivalent to both self-ns and self-soa with the same set of
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slave-dir directory [[prefix]
suffix] <br>
Specifies the directory in which slave (published and
stealth) zonefiles should be placed. The default directory
is /var/cache/bind/chiark-slave. The default suffix and <br>
prefix are empty; they also will be reset to these defaults
by a slave-dir directive which does not specify them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZONE DIRECTIVES <br>
These directives specify one or more zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary[!*$@~?] zone filename
<br>
Specifies that this server is supposed to be the primary
nameserver for zone and that the zone data is to be found in
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary-dir[!*$@~?]
directory[/prefix] [suffix[/subfile]] <br>
Search directory for files whose names start with prefix and
end with suffix. Each such file is taken to represent a zone
file for which this server is supposed to be the <br>
primary; the part of the filename between prefix and suffix
is the name of the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If /subfile is specified, then
instead of looking for files, we search for directories
containing subfile; directories which do not contain the
subfile are simply skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If directory[/prefix] exists as
specified and is a directory then it is interpreted as
directory with an empty prefix; otherwise the final path
component is assumed to be <br>
the prefix. If no suffix/subfile is specified then the
default is _db.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">published[!*$@~?] zone
origin-addr <br>
Specifies that this server is supposed to be a published
slave nameserver for the zone in question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stealth[!*$@~?] zone server-addr
... <br>
Specifies that this server is supposed to be an unpublished
secondary (aka stealth secondary) for the zone in
question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZONE STYLE MODIFIERS <br>
Each of the zone directives may optionally be followed by
one or more of the following characters (each at most
once):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Reverses the meaning of all
style modifiers after the !. Only one ! must appear in the
modifier list. In this list, other modifiers which default
to &lsquo;enabled&rsquo; are <br>
described by describing the effect of their inverse - see
the description for !@ below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Indicates that the zone is
unofficial, ie that it is not delegated as part of the
global Internet DNS and that no attempt should be made to
find the superzone and check <br>
delegations. Note that unofficial, local zones should be
created with caution. They should be in parts of the
namespace which are reserved for private use, or belong to
<br>
the actual zone maintainer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ Indicates that any mails
should be sent about the zone to the nameserver admin rather
than to the zone SOA MNAME. This is the default unless we
are supposedly a published <br>
server for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!@ Indicates that no mails
should be sent about the zone to anyone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ Indicates that the
zone&rsquo;s delegation is known to be glueless, and that
lack of glue should not be flagged. Not recommended - see
the section GLUELESSNESS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Indicates that the zone is
known to be broken and no checks should be carried out on
it, unless the -A option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER DIRECTIVES <br>
include file <br>
Reads file as if it were included here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">end Ends processing of this
file; any data beyond this point is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECKS <br>
chiark-named-conf makes the following checks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delegations: Each delegation
from a server for the superzone should contain the same set
of nameservers. None of the delegations should lack glue.
The glue addresses should be <br>
the same in each delegation, and agree with the local
default nameserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delegated servers: Each server
mentioned in the delegation should have the same SOA record
(and obviously, should be authoritative).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All published nameservers -
including delegated servers and servers named in the
zone&rsquo;s nameserver set: All nameservers for the zone
should supply the same list of nameservers <br>
for the zone, and none of this authority information should
be glueless. All the glue should always give the same
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Origin server&rsquo;s data: The
set of nameservers in the origin server&rsquo;s version of
the zone should be a superset of those in the
delegations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Our zone configuration: For
primary zones, the SOA origin should be one of the names
specified with self-soa (or self). For published zones, the
address should be that of the <br>
SOA origin. For stealth zones, the address should be that of
the SOA origin or one of the published nameservers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLUELESSNESS <br>
Glue is the name given for the addresses of nameservers
which are often supplied in a referral. In fact, it turns
out that it is important for the reliability and performance
of <br>
the DNS that referrals, in general, always come with
glue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firstly, glueless referrals
usually cause extra delays looking up names. BIND 8, when it
receives a completely glueless referral and does not have
the nameservers&rsquo; addresses in <br>
its cache, will start queries for the nameserver addresses;
but it will throw the original client&rsquo;s question away,
so that when these queries arrive, it won&rsquo;t restart
the query <br>
from where it left off. This means that the client
won&rsquo;t get its answer until it retries, typically at
least 1 second later - longer if you have more than one
nameserver listed. <br>
Worse, if the nameserver to which the glueless referral
points is itself under another glueless referral, another
retry will be required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even for better resolvers than
BIND 8, long chains of glueless referrals can cause
performance and reliability problems, turning a simple two
or three query exchange into some&acirc; <br>
thing needing more than a dozen queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even worse, one might
accidentally create a set of circularly glueless referrals
such as <br>
example.com NS ns0.example.net.uk <br>
example.com NS ns1.example.net.uk <br>
example.net.uk NS ns0.example.com <br>
example.net.uk NS ns1.example.com <br>
Here it is impossible to look up anything in either
example.com or example.net.uk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are, as far as the author
is aware, no generally agreed conventions or standards for
avoiding unreasonably long glueless chains, or even circular
glueless situations. The <br>
only way to guarantee that things will work properly is
therefore to always supply glue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the situation is
further complicated by the fact that many implementations
(including BIND 8.2.3, and many registry systems), will
refuse to accept glue RRs for delega&acirc; <br>
tions in a parent zonefile unless they are under the
parent&rsquo;s zone apex. In these cases it can be necessary
to create names for the child&rsquo;s nameservers which are
underneath the <br>
child&rsquo;s apex, so that the glue records are both in the
parent&rsquo;s bailiwick and obviously necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the past, the &lsquo;shared
registry system&rsquo; managing .com, .net and .org did not
allow a single IPv4 address to be used for more than one
nameserver name. However, at the time of <br>
writing (October 2002) this problem seems to have been
fixed, and the workaround I previously recommended (creating
a single name for your nameserver somewhere in .com, .net or
<br>
.org, and using that for all the delegations from .com, .net
and .org) should now be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, a note about
&lsquo;reverse&rsquo; zones, such as those in in-addr.arpa:
It does not seem at all common practice to create
nameservers in in-addr.arpa zones (ie, no NS RRs seem to
<br>
point into in-addr.arpa, even those for in-addr.arpa zones).
Current practice seems to be to always use nameservers for
in-addr.arpa which are in the normal, forward, address <br>
space. If everyone sticks to the rule of always publishing
nameservers names in the &lsquo;main&rsquo; part of the
namespace, and publishing glue for them, there is no chance
of anything <br>
longer than a 1-step glueless chain might occur for a
in-addr.arpa zone. It is probably best to maintain this as
the status quo, despite the performance problem this implies
for <br>
BIND 8 caches. This is what the serverless-glueless
directive is for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dan Bernstein has some
information and examples about this at
http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/notes.html#gluelessness
&acirc;&uml;http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/notes.html#gluelessness&acirc;&copy;
but be warned that <br>
it is rather opinionated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLUELESSNESS SUMMARY <br>
I recommend that every nameserver should have its own name
in every forward zone that it serves. For example: <br>
zone.example.com NS servus.ns.example.com <br>
servus.ns.example.com A 127.0.0.2 <br>
2.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa PTR servus.example.net <br>
servus.example.net A 127.0.0.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Domain names in in-addr.arpa
should not be used in the right hand side of NS records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
chiark-named-conf is supposed to be resistant to malicious
data in the DNS. It is not resistant to malicious data in
its own options, configuration file or environment. It is
<br>
not supposed to read its stdin, but is not guaranteed to be
safe if stdin is dangerous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Killing chiark-named-conf
suddenly should be safe, even with -y or -f (though of
course it may not complete its task if killed), provided
that only one invocation is made at <br>
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slow remote nameservers will
cause chiark-named-conf to take excessively long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 All went well and there were no warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">any other <br>
There were warnings or errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/bind/chiark-conf-gen.zones <br>
Default input configuration file. (Override with -C.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/bind <br>

Default output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/cache/bind/chiark-slave
<br>
Default location for slave zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Setting variables used by dig(1) and adnshost(1) will affect
the operation of chiark-named-conf. Avoid messing with these
if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH is used to find subprograms
such as dig and adnshost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The determination of the parent zone for each zone to be
checked, and its nameservers, is done simply using the
system default nameserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The processing of output from
dig is not very reliable or robust, but this is mainly the
fault of dig. This can lead to somewhat unhelpful error
reporting for lookup failures.</p>
