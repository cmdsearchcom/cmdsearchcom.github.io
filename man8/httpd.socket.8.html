<p>HTTPD.SERVICE(8) httpd systemd units
HTTPD.SERVICE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
httpd.service, httpd.socket - httpd unit files for
systemd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service,
/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page describes the systemd unit files used to
integrate the httpd daemon with systemd. Two unit files are
available: httpd.service allows the httpd daemon to be run
<br>
as a system service, and httpd.socket allows httpd to be
started via socket-based activation. Most systems will use
httpd.service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The apachectl command has been
modified to invoke systemctl for most uses, so for example,
running apachectl start is equivalent to running systemctl
start httpd.service. This <br>
ensures that the running httpd daemon is tracked and managed
by systemd. In contrast, running httpd directly from a root
shell will start the service outside of systemd; in this
<br>
case, default security restrictions described below
(including, but not limited to, SELinux) will not be
enforced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing default behaviour <br>
To change the default behaviour of the httpd service, an
over-ride file should be created, rather than changing
/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service directly, since such
changes <br>
would be lost over package upgrades. Running systemctl edit
httpd.service or systemctl edit httpd.socket as root will
create a drop-in file in /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d
<br>
which over-rides the system defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for the daemon, run
systemctl edit httpd.service and enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Service] <br>
Environment=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/vendor/lib</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting the service at boot
time <br>
The httpd.service and httpd.socket units are disabled by
default. To start the httpd service at boot time, run:
systemctl enable httpd.service. In the default
configuration, the <br>
httpd daemon will accept connections on port 80 (and, if
mod_ssl is installed, TLS connections on port 443) for any
configured IPv4 or IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If httpd is configured to depend
on any specific IP address (for example, with a
&quot;Listen&quot; directive) which may only become
available during startup, or if httpd depends on other <br>
services (such as a database daemon), the service must be
configured to ensure correct startup ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to ensure httpd is
only running after all configured network interfaces are
configured, create a drop-in file (as described above) with
the following section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Unit] <br>
After=network-online.target <br>
Wants=network-online.target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/NetworkTarget/
for more information on startup ordering with systemd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reloading and stopping the
service <br>
When running systemctl reload httpd.service, a graceful
restart is used, which sends a signal to the httpd parent
process to reload the configuration and re-open log files.
Any <br>
children with open connections at the time of reload will
terminate only once they have completed serving requests.
This prevents users of the server seeing errors (or <br>
potentially losing data) due to the reload, but means some
there is some delay before any configuration changes take
effect for all users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, a graceful stop is
used when systemctl stop httpd.service is run, which
terminates the server only once active connections have been
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd integration and
mod_systemd <br>
The httpd service uses the notify systemd service type. The
mod_systemd module must be loaded (as in the default
configuration) for this to work correctly - the service will
fail <br>
if this module is not loaded. mod_systemd also makes worker
and request statistics available when running systemctl
status httpd. See systemd.exec(5) for more information on
<br>
systemd service types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security and SELinux <br>
The default SELinux policy restricts the httpd service in
various ways. For example, the default policy limits the
ports to which httpd can bind (using the Listen directive),
<br>
which parts of the filesystem can be accessed, and whether
outgoing TCP connections are possible. Many of these
restrictions can be adjusted using semanage to change
booleans or <br>
other types. See httpd_selinux(8) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The httpd service enables
PrivateTmp by default. The /tmp and /var/tmp directories
available within the httpd process (and CGI scripts, etc)
are not shared by other processes. <br>
See systemd.exec(5) for more information.</p>
