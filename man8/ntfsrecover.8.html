<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntfsrecover - Recover updates committed by Windows on an
NTFS volume</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntfsrecover [options] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntfsrecover applies to the metadata the updates which were
requested on Windows but could not be completed because they
were interrupted by some event such as a power failure, a
<br>
hardware crash, a software crash or the device being
unplugged. Doing so, the file system is restored to a
consistent state, however updates to user data may still be
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updating the file system
generally requires updating several records which should all
be made for the file system to be kept consistent. For
instance, creating a new file <br>
requires reserving an inode number (set a bit in a bit map),
creating a file record (store the file name and file
attributes), and registering the file in a directory (locate
the <br>
file from some path). When an unfortunate event occurs, and
one of these updates could be done but not all of them, the
file system is left inconsistent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A group of updates which have
all to be done to preserve consistency is called a
transaction, and the end of updates within a transaction is
called the commitment of the transac&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To protect from unfortunate
events, Windows first logs in a special file all the
metadata update requests without applying any, until the
commitment is known. If the event occurs <br>
before the commitment, no update has been made and the file
system is consistent. If the event occurs after the update,
the log file can be analyzed later and the transactions <br>
which were committed can be executed again, thus restoring
the integrity of the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfsrecover similarly examines
the log file and applies the updates within committed
transactions which could not be done by Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, ntfs-3g does not log
updates, so ntfsrecover cannot be used to restore
consistency after an unfortunate event occurred while the
file system was updated by Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsrecover
accepts. The normal usage is to use no option at all, as
most of these options are oriented towards developers
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nearly all options have two
equivalent names. The short name is preceded by - and the
long name is preceded by --. Any single letter options, that
don&rsquo;t take an argument, can <br>
be combined into a single command, e.g. -bv is equivalent to
-b -v. Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique
prefix of their name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --backward <br>
Examine the actions described in the logfile backward from
the latest one to the earliest one without applying any
update. This may encompass records generated during
sev&acirc; <br>
eral sessions, and when Windows is restarted, it often does
not restart writing where it ended the previous session, so
this leads to errors and bad sequencing when exam&acirc;
<br>
ining the full log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --clusters CLUSTER-RANGE
<br>
Restrict the output generated when using options -b -f -u -p
to the actions operating on a cluster within the given
cluster range. CLUSTER-RANGE is defined by the first <br>
and last cluster numbers separated by a hyphen, for instance
100-109 or 0x3e8-0x3ff. A single number means restricting to
a single cluster. The first four log blocks have <br>
a special role and they are always shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --forward NUM <br>
Examine the actions described in the logfile forward from
the first one to the last one without applying any update.
As the log file is reused circularly, the first one is <br>
generally not the earliest. Moreover when Windows is
restarted, it often does not restart writing where it ended
the previous sessions, and this leads to errors when
exam&acirc; <br>
ining a log file generated during several sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show some help information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-action <br>
Do not apply any modification, useful when using the options
-p, -s or -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --play COUNT <br>
Undo COUNT transaction sets and redo a single one, a
transaction set being all transactions between two
consecutive checkpoints. This is useful for replaying some
transac&acirc; <br>
tion in the past. As a few actions are not undoable, this is
not always possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --range BLOCK-RANGE <br>
Examine the actions described in the logfile forward
restricted to the requested log file block range without
applying any update. The first four log blocks have a
special <br>
role and they are always examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sync <br>
Sync the file system by applying the committed actions which
have not been synced previously. This is the default option,
used when none of the options -n, -f, -r, -p and <br>
-u are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -s can be repeated to
request applying the committed actions mentioned in the
obsolete restart page. This is useful for testing the
situations where the latest <br>
restart page cannot be read though it can actually be
read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --transactions COUNT <br>
Display the transaction parameters when examining the log
file with one of the options --forward, --backward or
--range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --undo COUNT <br>
Undo COUNT transaction sets, thus resetting the file system
to some checkpoint in the past, a transaction set being all
transactions between two consecutive checkpoints. <br>
As a few actions are not undoable, this is not always
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Display more debug/warning/error messages. This option may
be used twice to display even more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show the version number, copyright and license of
ntfsrecover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Sync an NTFS volume on /dev/sda1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfsrecover -s /dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display all actions which
updated a cluster in range 100 to 119 :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfsrecover --verbose --backward
--clusters=100-119 /dev/sda1</p>
