ntfsrecover - Recover updates committed by Windows on an NTFS volume
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>ntfsrecover</b> [<i>options</i>] <i>device</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>ntfsrecover</b> applies to the metadata the updates which were requested on
  Windows but could not be completed because they were interrupted by some event
  such as a power failure, a hardware crash, a software crash or the device
  being unplugged. Doing so, the file system is restored to a consistent state,
  however updates to user data may still be lost.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Updating the file system generally requires updating several records which
  should all be made for the file system to be kept consistent. For instance,
  creating a new file requires reserving an inode number (set a bit in a bit
  map), creating a file record (store the file name and file attributes), and
  registering the file in a directory (locate the file from some path). When an
  unfortunate event occurs, and one of these updates could be done but not all
  of them, the file system is left inconsistent.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A group of updates which have all to be done to preserve consistency is called a
  transaction, and the end of updates within a transaction is called the
  commitment of the transaction.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To protect from unfortunate events, Windows first logs in a special file all the
  metadata update requests without applying any, until the commitment is known.
  If the event occurs before the commitment, no update has been made and the
  file system is consistent. If the event occurs after the update, the log file
  can be analyzed later and the transactions which were committed can be
  executed again, thus restoring the integrity of the file system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>ntfsrecover</b> similarly examines the log file and applies the updates
  within committed transactions which could not be done by Windows.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Currently, ntfs-3g does not log updates, so <b>ntfsrecover</b> cannot be used to
  restore consistency after an unfortunate event occurred while the file system
  was updated by Linux.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Below is a summary of all the options that <b>ntfsrecover</b> accepts. The
  normal usage is to use no option at all, as most of these options are oriented
  towards developers needs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Nearly all options have two equivalent names. The short name is preceded by
  <b>-</b> and the long name is preceded by <b>--</b>. Any single letter
  options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a single command,
  e.g. <b>-bv</b> is equivalent to <b>-b -v</b>. Long named options can be
  abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b>, <b>--backward</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Examine the actions described in the logfile backward from
      the latest one to the earliest one without applying any update. This may
      encompass records generated during several sessions, and when Windows is
      restarted, it often does not restart writing where it ended the previous
      session, so this leads to errors and bad sequencing when examining the
      full log file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b>, <b>--clusters</b> <b>CLUSTER-RANGE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Restrict the output generated when using options -b -f -u
      -p to the actions operating on a cluster within the given cluster range.
      CLUSTER-RANGE is defined by the first and last cluster numbers separated
      by a hyphen, for instance 100-109 or 0x3e8-0x3ff. A single number means
      restricting to a single cluster. The first four log blocks have a special
      role and they are always shown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b>, <b>--forward</b> <b>NUM</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Examine the actions described in the logfile forward from
      the first one to the last one without applying any update. As the log file
      is reused circularly, the first one is generally not the earliest.
      Moreover when Windows is restarted, it often does not restart writing
      where it ended the previous sessions, and this leads to errors when
      examining a log file generated during several sessions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Show some help information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b>, <b>--no-action</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not apply any modification, useful when using the
      options -p, -s or -u.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b>, <b>--play</b> <b>COUNT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Undo COUNT transaction sets and redo a single one, a
      transaction set being all transactions between two consecutive
      checkpoints. This is useful for replaying some transaction in the past. As
      a few actions are not undoable, this is not always possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r</b>, <b>--range</b> <b>BLOCK-RANGE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Examine the actions described in the logfile forward
      restricted to the requested log file block range without applying any
      update. The first four log blocks have a special role and they are always
      examined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b>, <b>--sync</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sync the file system by applying the committed actions
      which have not been synced previously. This is the default option, used
      when none of the options -n, -f, -r, -p and -u are present.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The option -s can be repeated to request applying the committed actions
      mentioned in the obsolete restart page. This is useful for testing the
      situations where the latest restart page cannot be read though it can
      actually be read.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b>, <b>--transactions</b> <b>COUNT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Display the transaction parameters when examining the log
      file with one of the options --forward, --backward or --range.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-u</b>, <b>--undo</b> <b>COUNT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Undo COUNT transaction sets, thus resetting the file system
      to some checkpoint in the past, a transaction set being all transactions
      between two consecutive checkpoints. As a few actions are not undoable,
      this is not always possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Display more debug/warning/error messages. This option may
      be used twice to display even more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Show the version number, copyright and license of
      <b>ntfsrecover</b>.</dd>
