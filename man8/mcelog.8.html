<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mcelog - Decode kernel machine check log on x86 machines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mcelog [options] [device] <br>
mcelog [options] --daemon <br>
mcelog [options] --client <br>
mcelog [options] --ascii <br>
mcelog [options] --is-cpu-supported <br>
mcelog --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
X86 CPUs report errors detected by the CPU as machine check
events (MCEs). These can be data corruption detected in the
CPU caches, in main memory by an integrated memory
con&acirc; <br>
troller, data transfer errors on the front side bus or CPU
interconnect or other internal errors. Possible causes can
be cosmic radiation, instable power supplies, cooling
prob&acirc; <br>
lems, broken hardware, running systems out of specification,
or bad luck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most errors can be corrected by
the CPU by internal error correction mechanisms. Uncorrected
errors cause machine check exceptions which may kill
processes or panic the machine. <br>
A small number of corrected errors is usually not a cause
for worry, but a large number can indicate future
failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a corrected or recovered
error happens the x86 kernel writes a record describing the
MCE into a internal ring buffer available through the
/dev/mcelog device mcelog <br>
retrieves errors from /dev/mcelog, decodes them into a human
readable format and prints them on the standard output or
optionally into the system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally it can also take more
options like keeping statistics or triggering shell scripts
on specific events. By default mcelog supports offlining
memory pages with persistent <br>
corrected errors, offlining CPU cores if they developed
cache problems, and otherwise logging specific events to the
system log after they crossed a threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The normal operating modi for
mcelog are running as a regular cron job (traditional way,
deprecated), running as a trigger directly executed by the
kernel, or running as a daemon <br>
with the --daemon option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an uncorrected machine
check error happens that the kernel cannot recover from then
it will usually panic the system. In this case when there
was a warm reset after the <br>
panic mcelog should pick up the machine check errors after
reboot. This is not possible after a cold reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition mcelog can be used
on the command line to decode the kernel output for a fatal
machine check panic in text format using the --ascii option.
This is typically used to <br>
decode the panic console output of a fatal machine check, if
the system was power cycled or mcelog didn&rsquo;t run
immediately after reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the panic triggers a kdump
kexec crash kernel the crash kernel boot up script should
log the machine checks to disk, otherwise they might be
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that after mcelog retrieves
an error the kernel doesn&rsquo;t store it anymore
(different from dmesg(1)), so the output should be always
saved somewhere and mcelog not run in <br>
uncontrolled ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked with the
--is-cpu-supported option mcelog exits with code 0 if the
current CPU is supported, 1 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
When the --syslog option is specified redirect output to
system log. The --syslog-error option causes the normal
machine checks to be logged as LOG_ERR (implies --syslog ).
Nor&acirc; <br>
mally only fatal errors or high level remarks are logged
with error level. High level one line summaries of specific
errors are also logged to the syslog by default unless <br>
mcelog operates in --ascii mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --logfile=file option
is specified append log output to the specified file. With
the --no-syslog option mcelog will never log anything to the
syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --cpu=cputype option is
specified set the to be decoded CPU to cputype. See mcelog
--help for a list of valid CPUs. Note that specifying an
incorrect CPU can lead to <br>
incorrect decoding output. Default is either the CPU of the
machine that reported the machine check (needs a newer
kernel version) or the CPU of the machine mcelog is running
<br>
on, so normally this option doesn&rsquo;t have to be used.
Older versions of mcelog had separate options for different
CPU types. These are still implemented, but deprecated and
undoc&acirc; <br>
umented now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --dmi option mcelog
will look up the DIMMs reported in machine checks in the
SMBIOS/DMI tables of the BIOS and map the DIMMs to board
identifiers. This only works when <br>
the BIOS reports the identifiers correctly. Unfortunately
often the information reported by the BIOS is either subtly
or obviously wrong or useless. This option requires that
<br>
mcelog has read access to /dev/mem (normally requires root)
and runs on the same machine in the same hardware
configuration as when the machine check event happened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --ignorenodev is specified
then mcelog will exit silently when the device cannot be
opened. This is useful in virtualized environment with
limited devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --filter is specified
mcelog will filter out known broken machine check events
(default on). When the --no-filter option is specified
mcelog does not filter events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --raw is specified mcelog
will not decode, but just dump the mcelog in a raw hex
format. This can be useful for automatic post
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a device is specified the
machine check logs are read from device instead of the
default /dev/mcelog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --ascii option mcelog
decodes a fatal machine check panic generated by the kernel
(&quot;CPU n: Machine Check Exception ...&quot;) in ASCII
from standard input and exits after&acirc; <br>
wards. Note that when the panic comes from a different
machine than where mcelog is running on you might need to
specify the correct cputype on older kernels. On newer
kernels <br>
which output the PROCESSOR field this is not needed
anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --file filename option
is specified mcelog --ascii will read the ASCII machine
check record from input file filename instead of standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --config-file file
option mcelog reads the specified config file. Default is
/etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf See also CONFIG FILE below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --daemon option mcelog
will run in the background. This gives the fastest reaction
time and is the recommended operating mode. If an output
option isn&rsquo;t selected ( <br>
--logfile or --syslog or --syslog-error ), this option
implies --logfile=/var/log/mcelog. Important messages will
be logged as one-liner summaries to syslog unless
--no-syslog <br>
is given. The option --foreground will prevent mcelog from
giving up the terminal in daemon mode. This is intended for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --client option mcelog
will query a running daemon for accumulated errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --cpumhz=mhz option
assume the CPU has mhz frequency for decoding the time of
the event using the CPU time stamp counter. This also forces
decoding. Note this can be <br>
unreliable. on some systems with CPU frequency scaling or
deep C states, where the CPU time stamp counter does not
increase linearly. By default the frequency of the current
<br>
CPU is used when mcelog determines it is safe to use. Newer
kernels report the time directly in the event and
don&rsquo;t need this anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --pidfile file option writes
the process id of the daemon into file file. Only valid in
daemon mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mcelog will enable extended
error reporting from the memory controller on processors
that support it unless you tell it not to with the
--no-imc-log option. You might need this <br>
option when decoding old logs from a system where this mode
was not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version displays the version
of mcelog and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
mcelog supports a config file to set defaults. Command line
options override the config file. By default the config file
is read from /etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf unless overridden <br>
with the --config-file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The general format is optionname
= value White space is not allowed in value currently,
except at the end where it is dropped Comments start with
#.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All command line options that
are not commands can be specified in the config file. For
example t to enable the --no-syslog option use no-syslog =
yes (or no to disable). When <br>
the option has a argument use logfile = /tmp/logfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on the
config file please see mcelog.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The kernel prefers old messages over new. If the log buffer
overflows only old ones will be kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact output in the log file
depends on the CPU, unless the --raw option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcelog will report serious
errors to the syslog during decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
When mcelog runs in daemon mode and receives a SIGUSR1 it
will close and reopen the log files. This can be used to
rotate logs without restarting the daemon.</p>
