qterm - terminate processing by a PBS batch server

qterm [-t&#x00A0;type] [server...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>qterm</b> command terminates a PBS batch server. When a server receives a
  terminate command, the server will go into a <i>terminating</i> state. While
  in this state, the server will not allow new jobs to be started or enqueued.
  By default, qterm will request a &quot;quick&quot; shutdown of the PBS server.
  Other ways of shutting down the server (specified with the -t argument), and
  their impact on running jobs, are described below. The qterm command will not
  exit until the server has completed its shutdown procedure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to execute qterm, the user must have PBS Operation or Manager
  privilege.

  <dd class="It-tag">This option is used when you wish that running jobs be left

      server's absence will be placed into the exiting state.</dd>

The operand specifies which servers are to shutdown. If no servers are given,
  then the default server will be terminated.

The qterm command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each

Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qterm command,

If the qterm command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a
