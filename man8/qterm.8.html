<p>qterm(8B) PBS qterm(8B)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qterm - terminate processing by a PBS batch server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qterm [-t type] [server...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The qterm command terminates a PBS batch server. When a
server receives a terminate command, the server will go into
a terminating state. While in this state, the server will
<br>
not allow new jobs to be started or enqueued. By default,
qterm will request a &quot;quick&quot; shutdown of the PBS
server. Other ways of shutting down the server (specified
with the -t <br>
argument), and their impact on running jobs, are described
below. The qterm command will not exit until the server has
completed its shutdown procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to execute qterm, the
user must have PBS Operation or Manager privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-t type Specifies the type of shut down. The types are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">immediate <br>
All running jobs are to immediately stop execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If checkpoint is supported,
running jobs that were submitted with &quot;-c
shutdown&quot; are checkpointed, terminated, and requeued.
If checkpoint is not supported or <br>
the job cannot be checkpointed, running jobs are requeued if
the rerunable attribute is true. Otherwise, jobs are
killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the server will not
shutdown until there are no jobs in the running state. If
the server is unable to contact the MOM of running job, the
job is still <br>
listed as running. The server may be forced down by a second
qterm -t immediate command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delay If checkpoint is
supported, running jobs that were submitted with &quot;-c
shutdown&quot; are checkpointed, terminated, and requeued.
If a job cannot be checkpointed, but <br>
can be rerun, the job is terminated and requeued. Otherwise,
running jobs are allowed to continue to run. Note, the
operator or administrator may use the qre&acirc; <br>
run and qdel commands to remove running jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quick This option is used when
you wish that running jobs be left running when the server
shuts down. The server will cleanly shutdown and can be
restarted when <br>
desired. Upon restart of the server, jobs that continue to
run are shown as running; jobs that terminated during the
server&rsquo;s absence will be placed into the <br>
exiting state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The server operand specifies which servers are to shutdown.
If no servers are given, then the default server will be
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD ERROR <br>
The qterm command will write a diagnostic message to
standard error for each error occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to
the qterm command, the exit status will be a value of
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the qterm command fails to
process any operand, the command exits with a value greater
than zero.</p>
