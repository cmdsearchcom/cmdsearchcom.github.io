<p>DEBUGFS(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual DEBUGFS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debugfs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system debugger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debugfs [ -DVwci ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -s superblock ] [ -f
cmd_file ] [ -R request ] [ -d data_source_device ] [ device
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The debugfs program is an interactive file system debugger.
It can be used to examine and change the state of an ext2,
ext3, or ext4 file system. <br>
device is the special file corresponding to the device
containing the file system (e.g /dev/hdXX).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-w Specifies that the file system should be opened in
read-write mode. Without this option, the file system is
opened in read-only mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Specifies that the file
system should be opened in catastrophic mode, in which the
inode and group bitmaps are not read initially. This can be
useful for filesystems with <br>
significant corruption, but because of this, catastrophic
mode forces the filesystem to be opened read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Specifies that device
represents an ext2 image file created by the e2image
program. Since the ext2 image file only contains the
superblock, block group descriptor, block <br>
and inode allocation bitmaps, and the inode table, many
debugfs commands will not function properly. Warning: no
safety checks are in place, and debugfs may fail in <br>
interesting ways if commands such as ls, dump, etc. are
tried without specifying the data_source_device using the -d
option. debugfs is a debugging tool. It has rough <br>
edges!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d data_source_device <br>
Used with the -i option, specifies that data_source_device
should be used when reading blocks not found in the ext2
image file. This includes data, directory, and indi&acirc;
<br>
rect blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
Forces the use of the given block size for the file system,
rather than detecting the correct block size as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s superblock <br>
Causes the file system superblock to be read from the given
block number, instead of using the primary superblock
(located at an offset of 1024 bytes from the beginning of
<br>
the filesystem). If you specify the -s option, you must also
provide the blocksize of the filesystem via the -b
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f cmd_file <br>
Causes debugfs to read in commands from cmd_file, and
execute them. When debugfs is finished executing those
commands, it will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Causes debugfs to open the
device using Direct I/O, bypassing the buffer cache. Note
that some Linux devices, notably device mapper as of this
writing, do not support <br>
Direct I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R request <br>
Causes debugfs to execute the single command request, and
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print the version number of
debugfs and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFYING FILES <br>
Many debugfs commands take a filespec as an argument to
specify an inode (as opposed to a pathname) in the
filesystem which is currently opened by debugfs. The
filespec argument <br>
may be specified in two forms. The first form is an inode
number surrounded by angle brackets, e.g., &lt;2&gt;. The
second form is a pathname; if the pathname is prefixed by a
for&acirc; <br>
ward slash (&rsquo;/&rsquo;), then it is interpreted
relative to the root of the filesystem which is currently
opened by debugfs. If not, the pathname is interpreted
relative to the current <br>
working directory as maintained by debugfs. This may be
modified by using the debugfs command cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
This is a list of the commands which debugfs supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blocks filespace <br>
Print the blocks used by the inode filespec to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bmap filespec logical_block <br>
Print the physical block number corresponding to the logical
block number logical_block in the inode filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block_dump [-f filespec]
block_num <br>
Dump the filesystem block given by block_num in hex and
ASCII format to the console. If the -f option is specified,
the block number is relative to the start of the given <br>
filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat filespec <br>
Dump the contents of the inode filespec to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd filespec <br>
Change the current working directory to filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chroot filespec <br>
Change the root directory to be the directory filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close [-a] <br>
Close the currently open file system. If the -a option is
specified, write out any changes to the superblock and block
group descriptors to all of the backup superblocks, <br>
not just to the master superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clri filespec <br>
Clear the contents of the inode filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirsearch filespec filename <br>
Search the directory filespec for filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirty Mark the filesystem as
dirty, so that the superblocks will be written on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump [-p] filespec out_file <br>
Dump the contents of the inode filespec to the output file
out_file. If the -p option is given set the owner, group and
permissions information on out_file to match file&acirc;
<br>
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump_mmp <br>
Display the multiple-mount protection (mmp) field
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dx_hash [-h hash_alg] [-s
hash_seed] filename <br>
Calculate the directory hash of filename. The hash algorithm
specified with -h may be legacy, half_md4, or tea. The hash
seed specified with -s must be in UUID format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump_extents [-n] [-l] filespec
<br>
Dump the the extent tree of the inode filespec. The -n flag
will cause dump_extents to only display the interior nodes
in the extent tree. The -l flag will cause <br>
dump_extents to only display the leaf nodes in the extent
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Please note that the length and
range of blocks for the last extent in an interior node is
an estimate by the extents library functions, and is not
stored in filesystem <br>
data structures. Hence, the values displayed may not
necessarily by accurate and does not indicate a problem or
corruption in the file system.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expand_dir filespec <br>
Expand the directory filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feature [fs_feature]
[-fs_feature] ... <br>
Set or clear various filesystem features in the superblock.
After setting or clearing any filesystem features that were
requested, print the current state of the filesys&acirc;
<br>
tem feature set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filefrag [-dvr] filespec <br>
Print the number of contiguous extents in filespec. If
filespec is a directory and the -d option is not specified,
filefrag will print the number of contiguous extents <br>
for each file in the directory. The -v option will cause
filefrag print a tabular listing of the contiguous extents
in the file. The -r option will cause filefrag to do <br>
a recursive listing of the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find_free_block [count [goal]]
<br>
Find the first count free blocks, starting from goal and
allocate it. Also available as ffb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find_free_inode [dir [mode]]
<br>
Find a free inode and allocate it. If present, dir specifies
the inode number of the directory which the inode is to be
located. The second optional argument mode speci&acirc; <br>
fies the permissions of the new inode. (If the directory bit
is set on the mode, the allocation routine will function
differently.) Also available as ffi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freeb block [count] <br>
Mark the block number block as not allocated. If the
optional argument count is present, then count blocks
starting at block number block will be marked as not
allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freefrag [-c chunk_kb] <br>
Report free space fragmentation on the currently open file
system. If the -c option is specified then the filefrag
command will print how many free chunks of size <br>
chunk_kb can be found in the file system. The chunk size
must be a power of two and be larger than the file system
block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freei filespec [num] <br>
Free the inode specified by filespec. If num is specified,
also clear num-1 inodes after the specified inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Print a list of commands
understood by debugfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htree_dump filespec <br>
Dump the hash-indexed directory filespec, showing its tree
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icheck block ... <br>
Print a listing of the inodes which use the one or more
blocks specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imap filespec <br>
Print the location of the inode data structure (in the inode
table) of the inode filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init_filesys device blocksize
<br>
Create an ext2 file system on device with device size
blocksize. Note that this does not fully initialize all of
the data structures; to do this, use the mke2fs(8)
pro&acirc; <br>
gram. This is just a call to the low-level library, which
sets up the superblock and block descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill_file filespec <br>
Deallocate the inode filespec and its blocks. Note that this
does not remove any directory entries (if any) to this
inode. See the rm(1) command if you wish to unlink a <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcd directory <br>
Change the current working directory of the debugfs process
to directory on the native filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln filespec dest_file <br>
Create a link named dest_file which is a hard link to
filespec. Note this does not adjust the inode reference
counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logdump [-acs] [-b block] [-i
filespec] [-f journal_file] [output_file] <br>
Dump the contents of the ext3 journal. By default, dump the
journal inode as specified in the superblock. However, this
can be overridden with the -i option, which dumps <br>
the journal from the internal inode given by filespec. A
regular file containing journal data can be specified using
the -f option. Finally, the -s option utilizes the <br>
backup information in the superblock to locate the
journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a option causes the logdump
program to print the contents of all of the descriptor
blocks. The -b option causes logdump to print all journal
records that are refer <br>
to the specified block. The -c option will print out the
contents of all of the data blocks selected by the -a and -b
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls [-d] [-l] [-p] filespec <br>
Print a listing of the files in the directory filespec. The
-d flag will list deleted entries in the directory. The -l
flag will list files using a more verbose format. <br>
The -p flag will list the files in a format which is more
easily parsable by scripts, as well as making it more clear
when there are spaces or other non-printing charac&acirc;
<br>
ters at the end of filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_deleted_inodes [limit] <br>
List deleted inodes, optionally limited to those deleted
within limit seconds ago. Also available as lsdel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command was useful for
recovering from accidental file deletions for ext2 file
systems. Unfortunately, it is not useful for this purpose if
the files were deleted <br>
using ext3 or ext4, since the inode&rsquo;s data blocks are
no longer available after the inode is released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modify_inode filespec <br>
Modify the contents of the inode structure in the inode
filespec. Also available as mi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir filespec <br>
Make a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mknod filespec [p|[[c|b] major
minor]] <br>
Create a special device file (a named pipe, character or
block device). If a character or block device is to be made,
the major and minor device numbers must be speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncheck [-c] inode_num ... <br>
Take the requested list of inode numbers, and print a
listing of pathnames to those inodes. The -c flag will
enable checking the file type information in the directory
<br>
entry to make sure it matches the inode&rsquo;s type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open [-weficD] [-b blocksize]
[-s superblock] device <br>
Open a filesystem for editing. The -f flag forces the
filesystem to be opened even if there are some unknown or
incompatible filesystem features which would normally
pre&acirc; <br>
vent the filesystem from being opened. The -e flag causes
the filesystem to be opened in exclusive mode. The -b, -c,
-i, -s, -w, and -D options behave the same as the <br>
command-line options to debugfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punch filespec start_blk
[end_blk] <br>
Delete the blocks in the inode ranging from start_blk to
end_blk. If end_blk is omitted then this command will
function as a truncate command; that is, all of the blocks
<br>
starting at start_blk through to the end of the file will be
deallocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlink filespec target <br>
Make a symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwd Print the current working
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Quit debugfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdump directory destination <br>
Recursively dump directory and all its contents (including
regular files, symbolic links, and other directories) into
the named destination which should be an existing <br>
directory on the native filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm pathname <br>
Unlink pathname. If this causes the inode pointed to by
pathname to have no other references, deallocate the file.
This command functions as the unlink() system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmdir filespec <br>
Remove the directory filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setb block [count] <br>
Mark the block number block as allocated. If the optional
argument count is present, then count blocks starting at
block number block will be marked as allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_block_group bgnum field
value <br>
Modify the block group descriptor specified by bgnum so that
the block group descriptor field field has value value. Also
available as set_bg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seti filespec [num] <br>
Mark inode filespec as in use in the inode bitmap. If num is
specified, also set num-1 inodes after the specified
inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_inode_field filespec field
value <br>
Modify the inode specified by filespec so that the inode
field field has value value. The list of valid inode fields
which can be set via this command can be displayed by <br>
using the command: set_inode_field -l Also available as
sif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_mmp_value field value <br>
Modify the multiple-mount protection (MMP) data so that the
MMP field field has value value. The list of valid MMP
fields which can be set via this command can be dis&acirc;
<br>
played by using the command: set_mmp_value -l Also available
as smmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_super_value field value <br>
Set the superblock field field to value. The list of valid
superblock fields which can be set via this command can be
displayed by using the command: set_super_value -l <br>
Also available as ssv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show_super_stats [-h] <br>
List the contents of the super block and the block group
descriptors. If the -h flag is given, only print out the
superblock contents. Also available as stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat filespec <br>
Display the contents of the inode structure of the inode
filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testb block [count] <br>
Test if the block number block is marked as allocated in the
block bitmap. If the optional argument count is present,
then count blocks starting at block number block <br>
will be tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testi filespec <br>
Test if the inode filespec is marked as allocated in the
inode bitmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undel &lt;inode_number&gt;
[pathname] <br>
Undelete the specified inode number (which must be
surrounded by angle brackets) so that it and its blocks are
marked in use, and optionally link the recovered inode to
<br>
the specified pathname. The e2fsck command should always be
run after using the undel command to recover deleted
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you are recovering
a large number of deleted files, linking the inode to a
directory may require the directory to be expanded, which
could allocate a block <br>
that had been used by one of the yet-to-be-undeleted files.
So it is safer to undelete all of the inodes without
specifying a destination pathname, and then in a separate
<br>
pass, use the debugfs link command to link the inode to the
destination pathname, or use e2fsck to check the filesystem
and link all of the recovered inodes to the <br>
lost+found directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlink pathname <br>
Remove the link specified by pathname to an inode. Note this
does not adjust the inode reference counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write source_file out_file <br>
Copy the contents of source_file into a newly-created file
in the filesystem named out_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zap_block [-f filespec] [-o
offset] [-l length] [-p pattern] block_num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overwrite the block specified by
<br>
block_num with zero (NUL) bytes, or if -p is given use the
byte specified by pattern. If -f is given then block_num is
relative to the start of the file given by file&acirc; <br>
spec. The -o and -l options limit the range of bytes to zap
to the specified offset and length relative to the start of
the block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zap_block [-f filespec] [-b bit]
block_num <br>
Bit-flip portions of the physical block_num. If -f is given,
then block_num is a logical block relative to the start of
filespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DEBUGFS_PAGER, PAGER <br>
The debugfs program always pipes the output of the some
commands through a pager program. These commands include:
show_super_stats (stats), list_directory (ls), <br>
show_inode_info (stat), list_deleted_inodes (lsdel), and
htree_dump. The specific pager can explicitly specified by
the DEBUGFS_PAGER environment variable, and if it is <br>
not set, by the PAGER environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since a pager is
always used, the less(1) pager is not particularly
appropriate, since it clears the screen before displaying
the output of the command and <br>
clears the output the screen when the pager is exited. Many
users prefer to use the less(1) pager for most purposes,
which is why the DEBUGFS_PAGER environment variable <br>
is available to override the more general PAGER environment
variable.</p>
