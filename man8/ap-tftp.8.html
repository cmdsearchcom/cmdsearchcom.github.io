The <b>ap-tftp</b> utility is used to upgrade or downgrade firmware in Access
  Points based on ATMEL AT76C510 VNET-B WiSOC (Wireless System On Chip). It
  should work for most (if not all) models with INTERSIL radio chipset, as well
  as those based on RFMD radio. However, so far it has only been tested on the
  following hardware: WLink WEN-2021, i-Tec AP GOLD, smartBridges airPOINT PRO
  (all with INTERSIL radio), and Tellus A14 (RFMD radio). If you have an AP with
  ATMEL AT76C510 and either INTERSIL or RFMD radio chipset, there's near 100%
  chance it will work for you, too.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREFACE:_FIRMWARE_TYPES"><a class="selflink" href="#PREFACE:_FIRMWARE_TYPES">PREFACE:
  FIRMWARE TYPES</a></h1>
Functionally, there basically exist 2 types of firmware for ATMEL-based APs: an
  &quot; <b>Access Point</b> firmware (often referred to as <b>AP firmware</b>
  ), and <b>Wireless Adapter</b> firmware (referred to as <b>WA firmware</b> ).
  Many hardware vendors produce their own more or less modified firmware
  derivatives, but usually they keep up with the naming scheme introduced by
  ATMEL:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="APs_with_INTERSIL_radios"><a class="selflink" href="#APs_with_INTERSIL_radios">APs
  with INTERSIL radios</a></h2>
For APs with INTERSIL radios, the AP firmware file typically uses naming scheme
  such as &quot;1.4x.y.rom&quot; (for example &quot;1.4j.1.rom&quot;,
  &quot;1.4k.2.rom&quot;, etc.), while the WA firmware files typically exist
  under names such as &quot;0.01.ab.rom&quot; (for example
  &quot;0.01.09.rom&quot;, &quot;0.01.11.rom&quot;, etc.). The values
  &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;ab&quot; indicate the firmware
  revision.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="APs_with_RFMD_radios"><a class="selflink" href="#APs_with_RFMD_radios">APs
  with RFMD radios</a></h2>
For APs with RFMD radios, the AP firmware files are known under names like
  &quot;0.2.x.yz.rom&quot; (such as &quot;0.2.2.11.rom&quot;,
  &quot;0.2.2.18.rom&quot;, etc.), while the WA firmware uses names as
  &quot;0.3.b.c.rom&quot; (for example &quot;0.3.2.5.rom&quot;,
  &quot;0.3.2.6.rom&quot;), or &quot;0.4.b.c.rom&quot; for WA+ firmware (which
  is a variant of WA firmware that offers limited multiple MACs transparency in
  client mode) - for example &quot;0.4.2.7.rom&quot;. Again, the numbers change
  according to the firmware revision.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To descend in even greater complexity, there usually exist 2 files for each
  firmware revision in the ATMEL+RFMD world: one so-called <b>primary
  firmware</b> (the bigger file of the two; it contains base firmware as well as
  the embedded webserver), and a second file with so-called <b>backup
  firmware</b> (the smaller file of the two, it contains just the base
  firmware). The name of secondary firmware always uses '0' in the third number
  field (such as &quot;0.2.0.18.rom&quot;). <b>You'll always need to upgrade
  with backup firmware FIRST, unless its manufacturer states otherwise.</b>

  <dd class="It-tag">Since some hardware vendors keep up the bad habit of
      producing their own firmwares using the original ATMEL firmware naming
      scheme, it is easy to find firmwares from different hardware vendors for
      ATMEL-based APs with <b>exactly the same name and sometimes even the
      length</b> (for example, firmware &quot;1.4j.1.rom&quot; exists in many
      incarnations, but their content differs). They may use different
      structures and offsets for reading configuration data in the flash memory
      without content validity checks, so <b>NEVER EVER USE FIRMWARE FROM
      ANOTHER HARDWARE VENDOR THAN THE ONE THAT IS MANUFACTURING YOUR AP, UNLESS

  <dd class="It-tag">BEWARE! AP boards from several vendors may contain hardware
      design bugs, that will totally prevent it from successfull upgrade. <b>Any
      attempt to upgrade such device, either via TFTP or DFU utility will fail
      and irreversibly damage content of its flash memory! If your vendor does
      NOT provide ANY firmware nor tools to perform upgrade for your device, it
      means (unless stated otherwise), that IT IS UNSAFE TO TRY UPGRADING and
      YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO UPGRADE YOUR DEVICE AT ALL!</b> Example of such

  <dd class="It-tag">ATMEL AT76C510-based APs are notoriously known for their
      firmware upgrade design flaw: firmware validation checks and subsequent
      permission for upgrade are not performed by the AP itself, but in the TFTP
      upgrade client. This means that anyone with proper TFTP client, having
      access to your AP via its ethernet port, may _try_ to upload incorrect
      firmware (or even no-firmware file!) to your AP, causing irreversible
      damage to your AP. Hence:</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Avoid upgrading your AP via its wireless port, if possible.
      Due to the unreliable nature of wireless media and UDP protocol used for
      upgrade, anything could happen - although there is CRC-like check in the
      firmware, that prevents flashing of (firmware) file that has possibly been
      altered during transmission, upgrade process interruption might cause
      damage (but even this is not very likely). You may upgrade AP via its
      wireless port only if you're 101% sure the wireless connection to the
      target device is reliable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you experience upgrade timeout in the 'middle' of the
      upgrade progress, it is usually ok to wait until the utility completely
      times out, and repeat the command afterwards. You may also experience
      'catch up' (very short network break, so utility will resume uploading
      firmware to your AP).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In case when firmware upgrade fails, <b>ap-tftp</b> will
      show an error code returned by the TFTP server in AP. Note that although
      RFC 1350 defines 8 TFTP error messages, the TFTP server in the AP is not
      compliant to this RFC and the error codes returned may NOT correspond to
      those messages (but ap-tftp will always display corresponding RFC-defined
      error message, if possible, although it may really have nothing to do with
      the returned error code meaning). In the case the message for error code
      returned is not defined in RFC 1350, just the error code alone will be
      displayed.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you want to upgrade firmware in an AP on a network where
      no DHCP server is available, it is advisable to assign static IP address
      and disable DHCP option on the device, so that you can verify, whether it
      is alive, using 'ping' command immediately after the upgrade succeeds
      (generally immediately after the device boots up), and you dont have to
      wait until AP's attempts to contact DHCP server time out. This is also
      especially useful if you need to do 2-step upgrade (using 'backup' and
      'primary' firmware) - see above.</dd>

      provided that within certain time period (several tens of seconds after
