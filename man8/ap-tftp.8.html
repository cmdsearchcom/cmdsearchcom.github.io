<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ap-tftp - TFTP client for upgrading ATMEL AT76C510
WiSOC-based APs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please read the entire manpage
prior using this utility. It may prevent you from problems
arising later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ap-tftp -i IP -f firmware.rom [-c community ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ap-tftp utility is used to upgrade or downgrade firmware
in Access Points based on ATMEL AT76C510 VNET-B WiSOC
(Wireless System On Chip). It should work for most (if not
all) <br>
models with INTERSIL radio chipset, as well as those based
on RFMD radio. However, so far it has only been tested on
the following hardware: WLink WEN-2021, i-Tec AP GOLD,
smart&acirc; <br>
Bridges airPOINT PRO (all with INTERSIL radio), and Tellus
A14 (RFMD radio). If you have an AP with ATMEL AT76C510 and
either INTERSIL or RFMD radio chipset, there&rsquo;s near
100% <br>
chance it will work for you, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREFACE: FIRMWARE TYPES <br>
Functionally, there basically exist 2 types of firmware for
ATMEL-based APs: an &quot; Access Point firmware (often
referred to as AP firmware ), and Wireless Adapter firmware
<br>
(referred to as WA firmware ). Many hardware vendors produce
their own more or less modified firmware derivatives, but
usually they keep up with the naming scheme introduced by
<br>
ATMEL:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APs with INTERSIL radios <br>
For APs with INTERSIL radios, the AP firmware file typically
uses naming scheme such as &quot;1.4x.y.rom&quot; (for
example &quot;1.4j.1.rom&quot;, &quot;1.4k.2.rom&quot;,
etc.), while the WA firmware files <br>
typically exist under names such as &quot;0.01.ab.rom&quot;
(for example &quot;0.01.09.rom&quot;,
&quot;0.01.11.rom&quot;, etc.). The values &quot;x&quot;,
&quot;y&quot;, and &quot;ab&quot; indicate the firmware
revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APs with RFMD radios <br>
For APs with RFMD radios, the AP firmware files are known
under names like &quot;0.2.x.yz.rom&quot; (such as
&quot;0.2.2.11.rom&quot;, &quot;0.2.2.18.rom&quot;, etc.),
while the WA firmware uses names as <br>
&quot;0.3.b.c.rom&quot; (for example
&quot;0.3.2.5.rom&quot;, &quot;0.3.2.6.rom&quot;), or
&quot;0.4.b.c.rom&quot; for WA+ firmware (which is a variant
of WA firmware that offers limited multiple MACs
transparency in <br>
client mode) - for example &quot;0.4.2.7.rom&quot;. Again,
the numbers change according to the firmware revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To descend in even greater
complexity, there usually exist 2 files for each firmware
revision in the ATMEL+RFMD world: one so-called primary
firmware (the bigger file of the two; <br>
it contains base firmware as well as the embedded
webserver), and a second file with so-called backup firmware
(the smaller file of the two, it contains just the base
firmware). <br>
The name of secondary firmware always uses &rsquo;0&rsquo;
in the third number field (such as
&quot;0.2.0.18.rom&quot;). You&rsquo;ll always need to
upgrade with backup firmware FIRST, unless its
manufac&acirc; <br>
turer states otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!
WARNING!!! WARNING!!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o WA firmwares and their
derivatives ARE _NOT_ SUPPORTED by ap-utils!!! They may
appear to partially work with ap-utils, but you can cause
harm to your AP if you use ap-con&acirc; <br>
fig with such firmware. Do not complain if you use ap-config
with such firmware and it damages your AP!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Since some hardware vendors
keep up the bad habit of producing their own firmwares using
the original ATMEL firmware naming scheme, it is easy to
find firmwares from dif&acirc; <br>
ferent hardware vendors for ATMEL-based APs with exactly the
same name and sometimes even the length (for example,
firmware &quot;1.4j.1.rom&quot; exists in many incarnations,
but <br>
their content differs). They may use different structures
and offsets for reading configuration data in the flash
memory without content validity checks, so NEVER EVER USE
<br>
FIRMWARE FROM ANOTHER HARDWARE VENDOR THAN THE ONE THAT IS
MANUFACTURING YOUR AP, UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE!
IF YOU DO SO, YOU MAY IRREVERSIBLY DAMAGE YOUR AP!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o BEWARE! AP boards from several
vendors may contain hardware design bugs, that will totally
prevent it from successfull upgrade. Any attempt to upgrade
such device, either <br>
via TFTP or DFU utility will fail and irreversibly damage
content of its flash memory! If your vendor does NOT provide
ANY firmware nor tools to perform upgrade for your <br>
device, it means (unless stated otherwise), that IT IS
UNSAFE TO TRY UPGRADING and YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO
UPGRADE YOUR DEVICE AT ALL! Example of such board with bug
in <br>
hardware design is Tellus A13 (also sold as i-Tec AP GOLD
with blue front).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ATMEL AT76C510-based APs are
notoriously known for their firmware upgrade design flaw:
firmware validation checks and subsequent permission for
upgrade are not performed <br>
by the AP itself, but in the TFTP upgrade client. This means
that anyone with proper TFTP client, having access to your
AP via its ethernet port, may _try_ to upload <br>
incorrect firmware (or even no-firmware file!) to your AP,
causing irreversible damage to your AP. Hence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SECURE YOUR AP ON IP (LAYER 3)
BASIS! SET UP YOUR AP (AND ITS WIRELESS CLIENTS) WITH IP
FROM A DIFFERENT IP SEGMENT THAN THE ONE IT IS PHYSICALLY
ON. TO ACCESS AP ON <br>
SUCH DIFFERENT SEGMENT, YOU MAY USE IP-ALIAS INTERFACE (on
Linux).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- FOR APs IN Access Point client
MODE, USE ap-config AND IN &rsquo;Config -&gt; Bridge&rsquo;
MENU, CHANGE THE VALUE OF &rsquo;Configuration-enabled
port(s):&rsquo; TO &rsquo;Wireless&rsquo;. THIS WAY, USER
<br>
BEHIND Access Point client DEVICE WONT BE ABLE TO REACH ITS
MANAGEMENT IP, AND SUBSEQUENTLY (S)HE WONT BE ABLE TO CAUSE
ANY DAMAGE WITH TFTP. Note that setting <br>
Conf.-enabled port to &rsquo;Wireless&rsquo; may be risky if
you intend to reconfigure the device through Wireless media
(bad values could be written to the AP due to wireless <br>
media unreliability). You should choose what is of greater
risk for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Users of ATMEL+INTERSIL
devices: If your AP firmware vendor extensions are
auto-detected as SBRIDGES by ap-config, it means that your
AP uses firmware made by smartBridges <br>
PTE: you will need to pass extra &rsquo;-c community&rsquo;
to ap-tftp in order to perform actual upgrade. BY ALL MEANS,
AVOID UPGRADE OF DEVICE THAT CONTAINS smartBridges FIRMWARE,
<br>
with non-smartBridges FIRMWARE, AND VICE VERSA, even if the
firmware names may look similar (see the warning above).
Although there are checks in ap-tftp, that should <br>
avoid something such, be careful, and DO NOT TRY, UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES, to circumvent this protection - if you do,
you&rsquo;d most likely end up with damaged flash content
<br>
in your device. You got the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember: All firmware files
with revision &quot;1.4j.4&quot; onwards are from
smartBridges: unless you possess a device that is
autodetected with &rsquo;SBRIDGES&rsquo; vendor extension,
DO <br>
NOT TRY TO UPGRADE TO smartBridges FIRMWARE!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Users of ATMEL+RFMD devices:
If you are running primary firmware &lt; 0.2.2.20, you
should upgrade as soon as possible! AP firmware of version
0.2.2.19 and lower contains <br>
serious &rsquo;death by reconfiguration&rsquo; bug, which,
if triggered, may irreversibly damage content in flash
memory of your AP. The event to trigger is usually changing
&amp; writing <br>
some settings in the &rsquo;Bridge&rsquo; menu. So if you
run such firmware, please upgrade. You may also look into
README to see whether &rsquo;Firmware available free of
charge for <br>
ATMEL12350 MIB devices&rsquo; (section) applies to your
AP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL HINTS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS PRIOR UPGRADING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- IF POSSIBLE, PLACE YOUR AP
BEHIND A FIREWALL SO THAT YOU PREVENT ACCESS TO ITS
MANAGEMENT IP FOR UNWANTED THIRD PARTIES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Avoid upgrading your AP via
its wireless port, if possible. Due to the unreliable nature
of wireless media and UDP protocol used for upgrade,
anything could happen - <br>
although there is CRC-like check in the firmware, that
prevents flashing of (firmware) file that has possibly been
altered during transmission, upgrade process interrup&acirc;
<br>
tion might cause damage (but even this is not very likely).
You may upgrade AP via its wireless port only if
you&rsquo;re 101% sure the wireless connection to the target
device <br>
is reliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If you experience upgrade
timeout in the &rsquo;middle&rsquo; of the upgrade progress,
it is usually ok to wait until the utility completely times
out, and repeat the command after&acirc; <br>
wards. You may also experience &rsquo;catch up&rsquo; (very
short network break, so utility will resume uploading
firmware to your AP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- In case when firmware upgrade
fails, ap-tftp will show an error code returned by the TFTP
server in AP. Note that although RFC 1350 defines 8 TFTP
error messages, the TFTP <br>
server in the AP is not compliant to this RFC and the error
codes returned may NOT correspond to those messages (but
ap-tftp will always display corresponding RFC-defined <br>
error message, if possible, although it may really have
nothing to do with the returned error code meaning). In the
case the message for error code returned is not defined <br>
in RFC 1350, just the error code alone will be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If you want to upgrade
firmware in an AP on a network where no DHCP server is
available, it is advisable to assign static IP address and
disable DHCP option on the device, <br>
so that you can verify, whether it is alive, using
&rsquo;ping&rsquo; command immediately after the upgrade
succeeds (generally immediately after the device boots up),
and you dont <br>
have to wait until AP&rsquo;s attempts to contact DHCP
server time out. This is also especially useful if you need
to do 2-step upgrade (using &rsquo;backup&rsquo; and
&rsquo;primary&rsquo; firmware) - <br>
see above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Firmware of APs based on ATMEL
AT76C510 provides an interresting &rsquo;arp ping&rsquo;
feature. After AP boot-up, it is possible to remotely and
TEMPORARILY (to next AP reboot) <br>
reconfigure its IP address, provided that within certain
time period (several tens of seconds after boot-up), the AP
receives ICMP ECHO request with target MAC address <br>
equal to its own. To set up IP in the AP using this method,
do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. From the IP range your AP is
connected to, pick up an unused IP you want to set on the AP
using &rsquo;arp ping&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Set up static ARP entry
associating the MAC address of your AP with the IP you
selected in paragraph 1. Typically, you need to issue (as
root) something like: &rsquo;arp -s <br>
required_AP_IP AP_MAC&rsquo;. Consult manpage for
&rsquo;arp&rsquo; utility, if your &rsquo;arp&rsquo; utility
uses different syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Right after the AP boots, run
&rsquo;ping required_AP_IP&rsquo;. You need to wait few
seconds prior seeing first AP response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Users of ATMEL+RFMD devices:
To DOWNGRADE to AP firmware with lower revision number than
the one thats currently in the device, you&rsquo;ll need to
temporarily &rsquo;upgrade&rsquo; to any <br>
WA firmware available for your device (as
step-in-the-middle). This will &rsquo;unlock&rsquo; your
device for downgrading to previous AP firmware version.</p>
