<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
asmtpd is the central server daemon for Mail Avanger. Mail
Avenger is a highly-configurable MTA-independent SMTP
(Simple Mail Transport Protocol) server designed to let you
<br>
filter and fight SPAM before accepting incoming mail from a
client machine. Filtering spam before accepting a message
from a remote machine offers a number of benefits. First,
<br>
while mail is in the process of being sent over the network,
more information is available about the client machine,
allowing the possibility of more accurate decisions about
<br>
spam. (For example, machines infected with viruses may be
able to be detected by probing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second, filtering during mail
transfer allows more options for what to do with potential
spam. For instance, one can defer the mail--essentially
asking the client to send it <br>
again later--which legitimate mail clients will do
automatically, but &quot;spam &rsquo;bots&quot; typically
won&rsquo;t. Moreover, it is much safer to reject spam
before accepting a message. With <br>
typical after-delivery spam checkers, the only options are
to discard spam silently (risking false positives that
completely disappear), or to notify the sender, but if the
<br>
sender is forged, this causes more unwanted mail. By
rejecting mail during an SMTP transaction, this ensures
legitimate mail gets bounced to the sender, while most spam
will <br>
simply disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, filtering during an
SMTP transaction saves resources, since spam messages need
never to be spooled in the mail queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many ways of fighting
and detecting spam. Though Mail Avenger has a few basic
mechanisms built-in, the philosophy of the system is to let
system administrators and <br>
individual users plug in their own filtering criteria. The
intent is for Mail Avenger to do the hard part--talk the
SMTP network protocol, handle asynchronous DNS resolution,
<br>
SPF rule checking, probing of remote SMTP servers for
legitimacy, etc.--while users can set policy through
configuration files with simple shell commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic approach is for users
to create scripts in a directory called $HOME/.avenger that
specify policies for what mail to accept and what to reject
or defer. System-wide <br>
fallback policies can also be specified by files in
/etc/avenger/. The program that executes these scripts is
called avenger, and is described more fully in its own
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asmtpd can be configured to map
different email addresses and domains to different local
users, in addition to a large number of other configurable
features. These are described <br>
more fully in the asmtpd.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asmtpd also adds a new header
field to messages, &quot;X-Avenger:&quot;, containing
information that may be of use to spam filters.
&quot;X-Avenger:&quot; contains a list of
semi-colon-separated <br>
tokens, which if present mean the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version=number <br>
Specifies the version of Mail Avenger that received the
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receiver=hostname <br>
Specifies that asmtpd was running on hostname when it
received the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client-ip=IP-address <br>
client-port=port-number <br>
These specify that the client end of the TCP connection from
which the mail came used IP address IP-address and port
port-number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client-dnsfail=error <br>
Specifies that a reverse lookup on the client&rsquo;s IP
address (to determine the client&rsquo;s hostname) resulted
in error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bounce-res=code <br>
Specifies that attempts to send bounces to the bounce
address of the sender result in SMTP error code. (This is
the same value as the SENDER_BOUNCERES environment variable
<br>
described in the avenger(1) manual page.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syn-fingerprint=fingerprint <br>
Contains a description of the initial TCP SYN packet used by
the client to initiate the TCP connection over which the
mail was sent. See the description of CLIENT_SYNFP in <br>
the avenger(1) manual page for an explanation of the
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colon-space <br>
If present, means the client included a space between the
colon in the command &quot;MAIL FROM:&quot; or &quot;RCPT
TO:&quot; and the subsequent &quot;&lt;&quot; that begins an
email address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eager-pipelining <br>
If present, means that the client attempted to pipeline SMTP
commands before receiving the &quot;250 PIPELINING&quot;
response to the SMTP &quot;HELO&quot; or &quot;EHLO&quot;
command. This field has the <br>
same meaning as the CLIENT_PIPELINING environment variable
in avenger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post <br>
If present, means the client issued the invalid SMTP command
POST. See CLIENT_POST in avenger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">network-hops=nhops <br>
This is the number of network hops from the server to the
client that sent this mail (if Mail Avenger can figure this
out). See CLIENT_NETHOPS in avenger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">network-path=IP-list <br>
Set to a space-separated list of as many intermediary
network hops as Mail Avenger can efficiently discover on the
way from the server to the client that send the mail. See
<br>
CLIENT_NETHOPS in avenger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">network-path-time=time <br>
To save network traffic, Mail Avenger briefly caches routes
to a particular client. network-path-time specifies the
precise time at which the information in network-path was
<br>
discovered. The time is expressed as a standard Unix time
(number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RBL=domain (IP-addrs)[, domain
(IP-addrs), ...] <br>
For the each real-time blackhole list (RBL) domain specified
in asmtpd.conf (see the RBL directive in the asmtpd.conf(5)
man page), if the client shows up in the RBL, IP- <br>
addrs specifies what the RBL returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually, RBLs just return
127.0.0.1 to specify that a client is present in the
blacklist. However, some services use different IP addresses
to encode some information about <br>
why the client is listed. If an RBL returns multiple IP
addresses, asmtpd includes them all, separated by
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RBL-errors=domain (error)[,
domain (error), ...] <br>
Lists any RBL domains Mail Avenger was unable to query at
the time of receipt of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
The following is a brief description of how to get started
with asmtpd. More information is available in the
installation guide /usr/local/share/avenger/INSTALL, as well
as the <br>
asmtpd.conf(5) and avenger(1) manual pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you
haven&rsquo;t already, create a user called avenger on your
system. This is the user ID under which system-wide avenger
scripts will run. (If you wish to use a name other <br>
than &quot;avenger&quot;, you can put the directive
&quot;AvengerUser user&quot; in the asmtpd.conf
configuration file when you create that.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Create the
directory /etc/avenger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Create a file
/etc/avenger/asmtpd.conf. Copy the sample file in
/usr/local/share/avenger/asmtpd.conf and edit to taste.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Create a file
/etc/avenger/domains. List each domain for which you would
like to receive mail, followed by a colon, one per line. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my.first.domain: <br>
my.second.domain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fire it up! Run
the command &quot;asmtpd&quot; as root. You may also want to
set things up to run this command automatically on system
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Play with
scripts. Read the man page for avenger(1), create a
.avenger/rcpt file in your home directory, and maybe create
a site-wide default file /etc/avenger/default. You <br>
will also very likely want to create a script
/etc/avenger/unknown to reject mail to unknown users. See
the man page for aliascheck(1) and the sample <br>
/usr/local/share/avenger/unknown for an example of how to do
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Finally, you may
want to try the avenger.local delivery agent. See the
avenger.local(8) man page for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Normally, when started, asmtpd runs as a daemon, sends its
output to the system log, and looks for its configuration
file in /etc/avenger/asmtpd.conf. The following options <br>
change this behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Tells asmtpd to stay in the
foreground and send its diagnostic messages to standard
error, rather than to the system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Ordinarily, asmtpd will attempt to avoid sending overly many
duplicate copies of a message to the system log file. The
--verbose option changes this behavior, so that <br>
certain error conditions (such as missing directories) get
reported each time they affect a piece of mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config-file <br>
Specifies an alternate location for the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, several other
options are available to run asmtpd in various test modes,
for making use of or debugging features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spf [-f config-file] <br>
Runs in a mode where asmtpd simply performs SPF tests on
&lt;IP-address, sender&gt; pairs it reads from standard
input. Can be used to validate asmtpd&rsquo;s SPF
implementation against <br>
a different implementation, or to debug SPF records
(particularly in conjunction with the SPF_TRACE environment
variable discussed below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rbl [-f config-file] <br>
Tests asmtpd&rsquo;s RBL (realtime black hole) list
implementation. The configuration file should contain one or
more RBL directives (see the manual page for
asmtpd.conf(5)). In <br>
this mode, asmtpd will simply read IP addresses from its
input and output the result of RBL checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--avenge [-f config-file]
recipient [sender [IP-address]] <br>
Tests the avenger script for recipient, which must be a
fully-qualified email address with a domain. This simulates
an SMTP transaction in which client IP-address tries to <br>
send mail from sender to recipient. If recipient is not
specified, it defaults to postmaster@HostName (where
Hostname is the local hostname, as specified in
asmtpd.conf). <br>
If &lt;IP-address&gt; is not specified, the local address is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this option, asmtpd will
log a transcript of avenger&rsquo;s requests to standard
error, regardless of the actual DebugAvenger setting. At the
end, outputs the SMTP response <br>
asmtpd would give to the &quot;RCPT&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--synfp [tcp-port [IP-address
[interface ...]]] <br>
Tests asmtpd&rsquo;s SYN fingerprinting implementation.
Listens to the network and for each incoming TCP connection,
prints the IP address and port of the client, along with a
<br>
fingerprint describing the characteristics of the initial
SYN packet from the TCP connection. (For a description of
the SYN fingerprint format, see the description of <br>
CLIENT_SYNFP in the man page for avenger(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, asmtpd will print
the fingerprints of any incoming TCP connection. If tcp-port
is non-zero, however, asmtpd will only consider SYN packets
sent to that TCP port <br>
number. If IP-address is supplied and is not 0.0.0.0, asmtpd
will only took at TCP packets for that particular IP address
(useful if your local machine has multiple IP <br>
addresses). Finally, by default asmtpd will listen to
whatever network interfaces correspond to IP-address (or all
active non-loopback interfaces for 0.0.0.0 or <br>
unspecified). You can alternatively specify explicitly which
network interfaces asmtpd should listen on (e.g., &quot;eth0
eth1&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this option, you must be
root (or at least have permission to open the /dev/bpf*
packet filter devices on your machine).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--netpath IP-address
[network-hops] <br>
asmtpd records the network path to mail clients using a
technique similar to the traceroute utility found on many
operating systems. The --netpath option tests asmtpd&rsquo;s
<br>
implementation of this functionality. If network-hops is
positive, asmtpd will record only the first network-hops
hops on the way to IP-address. If network-hops is <br>
negative, asmtpd will output only the last network-hops hops
on the way to IP-address. If network-hops is zero, or is not
supplied, asmtpd will output the entire route (or <br>
as much as it can discover, firewall permitting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this option, you must run
asmtpd as root for it to use raw sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SPF_TRACE <br>
When set to a positive integer, causes asmtpd to send to
standard error a trace of the checks it is performing while
processing SPF records. If set to 1, simply records <br>
which SPF traces are happening. Setting it to 2 provides
more information, while setting it to 3 provides a complete
trace. (Setting the value to 4 or higher additionally <br>
causes asmtpd to send the results of all SPF-related DNS
queries to its standard output, a feature mostly useful to
the implementor.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR <br>
asmtpd creates temporary files to hold incoming mail
messages before injecting them into the mail system. It
usually creates a temporary subdirectory of /var/tmp to hold
<br>
these files (and cleans up the directory on exit). If TMPDIR
is set, its value will be used in place of /var/tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/avenger/asmtpd.conf, /etc/avenger/domains,
/etc/avenger/aliases, /etc/avenger/unknown,
/etc/avenger/default, $HOME/.avenger/rcpt*
/usr/local/share/avenger/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Mail Avenger home page:
&lt;http://www.mailavenger.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If the packet capture library (libpcap) header files were
not available at compile time, asmtpd will not support TCP
SYN fingerprints and the --synfp option will not be <br>
available. You may be able to fix this by installing a
package for your OS called pcap, libpcap, or libpcap-devel
(depending on the distribution), then re-running ./configure
<br>
and re-compiling Mail Avenger.</p>
