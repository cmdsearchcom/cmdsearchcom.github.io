<p>unbound-control(8) unbound 1.4.20 unbound-control(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
unbound-control, unbound-control-setup - Unbound remote
server control utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
unbound-control [-hq] [-c cfgfile] [-s server] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Unbound-control performs remote administration on the
unbound(8) DNS server. It reads the configuration file,
contacts the unbound server over SSL sends the command and
displays <br>
the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show the version and
commandline option help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cfgfile <br>
The config file to read with settings. If not given the
default config file /etc/unbound/unbound.conf is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s server[@port] <br>
IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server to contact. If not given,
the address is read from the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q quiet, if the option is given
it does not print anything if it works ok.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
There are several commands that the server understands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start Start the server. Simply
execs unbound(8). The unbound executable is searched for in
the PATH set in the environment. It is started with the
config file specified using <br>
-c or the default config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop Stop the server. The server
daemon exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload Reload the server. This
flushes the cache and reads the config file fresh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbosity number <br>
Change verbosity value for logging. Same values as verbosity
keyword in unbound.conf(5). This new setting lasts until the
server is issued a reload (taken from config <br>
file again), or the next verbosity control command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_reopen <br>
Reopen the logfile, close and open it. Useful for
logrotation to make the daemon release the file it is
logging to. If you are using syslog it will attempt to close
and <br>
open the syslog (which may not work if chrooted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stats Print statistics. Resets
the internal counters to zero, this can be controlled using
the statistics-cumulative config statement. Statistics are
printed with one [name]: <br>
[value] per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stats_noreset <br>
Peek at statistics. Prints them like the stats command does,
but does not reset the internal counters to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Display server status.
Exit code 3 if not running (the connection to the port is
refused), 1 on error, 0 if running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_zone name type <br>
Add new local zone with name and type. Like local-zone
config statement. If the zone already exists, the type is
changed to the given argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_zone_remove name <br>
Remove the local zone with the given name. Removes all local
data inside it. If the zone does not exist, the command
succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_data RR data... <br>
Add new local data, the given resource record. Like
local-data config statement, except for when no covering
zone exists. In that case this remote control command
creates <br>
a transparent zone with the same name as this record. This
command is not good at returning detailed syntax errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_data_remove name <br>
Remove all RR data from local name. If the name already has
no items, nothing happens. Often results in NXDOMAIN for the
name (in a static zone), but if the name has <br>
become an empty nonterminal (there is still data in domain
names below the removed name), NOERROR nodata answers are
the result for that name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump_cache <br>
The contents of the cache is printed in a text format to
stdout. You can redirect it to a file to store the cache in
a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load_cache <br>
The contents of the cache is loaded from stdin. Uses the
same format as dump_cache uses. Loading the cache with old,
or wrong data can result in old or wrong data <br>
returned to clients. Loading data into the cache in this way
is supported in order to aid with debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookup name <br>
Print to stdout the name servers that would be used to look
up the name specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush name <br>
Remove the name from the cache. Removes the types A, AAAA,
NS, SOA, CNAME, DNAME, MX, PTR, SRV and NAPTR. Because that
is fast to do. Other record types can be removed <br>
using flush_type or flush_zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush_type name type <br>
Remove the name, type information from the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush_zone name <br>
Remove all information at or below the name from the cache.
The rrsets and key entries are removed so that new lookups
will be performed. This needs to walk and inspect <br>
the entire cache, and is a slow operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush_bogus <br>
Remove all bogus data from the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush_stats <br>
Reset statistics to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush_requestlist <br>
Drop the queries that are worked on. Stops working on the
queries that the server is working on now. The cache is
unaffected. No reply is sent for those queries, proba&acirc;
<br>
bly making those users request again later. Useful to make
the server restart working on queries with new settings,
such as a higher verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump_requestlist <br>
Show what is worked on. Prints all queries that the server
is currently working on. Prints the time that users have
been waiting. For internal requests, no time is <br>
printed. And then prints out the module status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush_infra all|IP <br>
If all then entire infra cache is emptied. If a specific IP
address, the entry for that address is removed from the
cache. It contains EDNS, ping and lameness data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump_infra <br>
Show the contents of the infra cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_option opt: val <br>
Set the option to the given value without a reload. The
cache is therefore not flushed. The option must end with a
&rsquo;:&rsquo; and whitespace must be between the option
and the <br>
value. Some values may not have an effect if set this way,
the new values are not written to the config file, not all
options are supported. This is different from the <br>
set_option call in libunbound, where all values work because
unbound has not been inited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values that work are:
statistics-interval, statistics-cumulative,
do-not-query-localhost, harden-short-bufsize,
harden-large-queries, harden-glue, <br>
harden-dnssec-stripped, harden-below-nxdomain,
harden-referral-path, prefetch, prefetch-key, log-queries,
hide-identity, hide-version, identity, version,
val-log-level, <br>
val-log-squelch, ignore-cd-flag, add-holddown, del-holddown,
keep-missing, tcp-upstream, ssl-upstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get_option opt <br>
Get the value of the option. Give the option name without a
trailing &rsquo;:&rsquo;. The value is printed. If the value
is &quot;&quot;, nothing is printed and the connection
closes. On <br>
error &rsquo;error ...&rsquo; is printed (it gives a syntax
error on unknown option). For some options a list of values,
one on each line, is printed. The options are shown from the
<br>
config file as modified with set_option. For some options an
override may have been taken that does not show up with this
command, not results from e.g. the verbosity and <br>
forward control commands. Not all options work, see
list_stubs, list_forwards, list_local_zones and
list_local_data for those.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_stubs <br>
List the stub zones in use. These are printed one by one to
the output. This includes the root hints in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_forwards <br>
List the forward zones in use. These are printed zone by
zone to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_local_zones <br>
List the local zones in use. These are printed one per line
with zone type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_local_data <br>
List the local data RRs in use. The resource records are
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forward_add [+i] zone addr ...
<br>
Add a new forward zone to running unbound. With +i option
also adds a domain-insecure for the zone (so it can resolve
insecurely if you have a DNSSEC root trust anchor <br>
configured for other names). The addr can be IP4, IP6 or
nameserver names, like forward-zone config in
unbound.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forward_remove [+i] zone <br>
Remove a forward zone from running unbound. The +i also
removes a domain-insecure for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stub_add [+ip] zone addr ...
<br>
Add a new stub zone to running unbound. With +i option also
adds a domain-insecure for the zone. With +p the stub zone
is set to prime, without it it is set to notprime. <br>
The addr can be IP4, IP6 or nameserver names, like the
stub-zone config in unbound.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stub_remove [+i] zone <br>
Remove a stub zone from running unbound. The +i also removes
a domain-insecure for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forward [off | addr ... ] <br>
Setup forwarding mode. Configures if the server should ask
other upstream nameservers, should go to the internet root
nameservers itself, or show the current config. You <br>
could pass the nameservers after a DHCP update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without arguments the current
list of addresses used to forward all queries to is printed.
On startup this is from the forward-zone &quot;.&quot;
configuration. Afterwards it <br>
shows the status. It prints off when no forwarding is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If off is passed, forwarding is
disabled and the root nameservers are used. This can be used
to avoid to avoid buggy or non-DNSSEC supporting nameservers
returned from <br>
DHCP. But may not work in hotels or hotspots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more IPv4 or IPv6
addresses are given, those are then used to forward queries
to. The addresses must be separated with spaces. With
&rsquo;@port&rsquo; the port number can <br>
be set explicitly (default port is 53 (DNS)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the forwarder
information from the config file for the root &quot;.&quot;
is used. The config file is not changed, so after a reload
these changes are gone. Other for&acirc; <br>
ward zones from the config file are not affected by this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
The unbound-control program exits with status code 1 on
error, 0 on success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SET UP <br>
The setup requires a self-signed certificate and private
keys for both the server and client. The script
unbound-control-setup generates these in the default run
directory, or <br>
with -d in another directory. If you change the access
control permissions on the key files you can decide who can
use unbound-control, by default owner and group but not all
<br>
users. Run the script under the same username as you have
configured in unbound.conf or as root, so that the daemon is
permitted to read the files, for example with: <br>
sudo -u unbound unbound-control-setup <br>
If you have not configured a username in unbound.conf, the
keys need read permission for the user credentials under
which the daemon is started. The script preserves private
<br>
keys present in the directory. After running the script as
root, turn on control-enable in unbound.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATISTIC COUNTERS <br>
The stats command shows a number of statistic counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.num.queries <br>
number of queries received by thread</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.num.cachehits <br>
number of queries that were successfully answered using a
cache lookup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.num.cachemiss <br>
number of queries that needed recursive processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.num.prefetch <br>
number of cache prefetches performed. This number is
included in cachehits, as the original query had the
unprefetched answer from cache, and resulted in recursive
pro&acirc; <br>
cessing, taking a slot in the requestlist. Not part of the
recursivereplies (or the histogram thereof) or cachemiss, as
a cache response was sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.num.recursivereplies
<br>
The number of replies sent to queries that needed recursive
processing. Could be smaller than threadX.num.cachemiss if
due to timeouts no replies were sent for some <br>
queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.requestlist.avg <br>
The average number of requests in the internal recursive
processing request list on insert of a new incoming
recursive processing query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.requestlist.max <br>
Maximum size attained by the internal recursive processing
request list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.requestlist.overwritten
<br>
Number of requests in the request list that were overwritten
by newer entries. This happens if there is a flood of
queries that recursive processing and the server has a <br>
hard time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.requestlist.exceeded
<br>
Queries that were dropped because the request list was full.
This happens if a flood of queries need recursive
processing, and the server can not keep up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.requestlist.current.all
<br>
Current size of the request list, includes internally
generated queries (such as priming queries and glue
lookups).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.requestlist.current.user
<br>
Current size of the request list, only the requests from
client queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.recursion.time.avg <br>
Average time it took to answer queries that needed recursive
processing. Note that queries that were answered from the
cache are not in this average.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadX.recursion.time.median
<br>
The median of the time it took to answer queries that needed
recursive processing. The median means that 50% of the user
queries were answered in less than this time. <br>
Because of big outliers (usually queries to non responsive
servers), the average can be bigger than the median. This
median has been calculated by interpolation from a <br>
histogram.</p>

mem.total.sbrk <br>
If sbrk(2) is available, an estimate of the heap size of the
program in number of bytes. Close to the total memory used
by the program, as reported by top and ps. Could <br>
be wrong if the OS allocates memory non-contiguously.</p>

Memory in bytes in use by the iterator module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mem.mod.validator <br>
Memory in bytes in use by the validator module. Includes the
key cache and negative cache.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">histogram.&lt;sec&gt;.&lt;usec&gt;.to.&lt;sec&gt;.&lt;usec&gt;
<br>
Shows a histogram, summed over all threads. Every element
counts the recursive queries whose reply time fit between
the lower and upper bound. Times larger or equal to <br>
the lowerbound, and smaller than the upper bound. There are
40 buckets, with bucket sizes doubling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.query.type.A <br>
The total number of queries over all threads with query type
A. Printed for the other query types as well, but only for
the types for which queries were received, thus =0 <br>
entries are omitted for brevity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.query.type.other <br>
Number of queries with query types 256-65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.query.class.IN <br>
The total number of queries over all threads with query
class IN (internet). Also printed for other classes (such as
CH (CHAOS) sometimes used for debugging), or NONE, <br>
ANY, used by dynamic update. num.query.class.other is
printed for classes 256-65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.query.opcode.QUERY <br>

Number of queries that were made using IPv6 towards the
unbound server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.query.flags.RD <br>
The number of queries that had the RD flag set in the
header. Also printed for flags QR, AA, TC, RA, Z, AD, CD.
Note that queries with flags QR, AA or TC may have been <br>
rejected because of that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.query.edns.present <br>
number of queries that had an EDNS OPT record present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.query.edns.DO <br>
number of queries that had an EDNS OPT record with the DO
(DNSSEC OK) bit set. These queries are also included in the
num.query.edns.present number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.answer.rcode.NXDOMAIN <br>
The number of answers to queries, from cache or from
recursion, that had the return code NXDOMAIN. Also printed
for the other return codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.answer.rcode.nodata <br>
The number of answers to queries that had the pseudo return
code nodata. This means the actual return code was NOERROR,
but additionally, no data was carried in the <br>
answer (making what is called a NOERROR/NODATA answer).
These queries are also included in the
num.answer.rcode.NOERROR number. Common for AAAA lookups
when an A record <br>
exists, and no AAAA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.answer.secure <br>
Number of answers that were secure. The answer validated
correctly. The AD bit might have been set in some of these
answers, where the client signalled (with DO or AD <br>
bit in the query) that they were ready to accept the AD bit
in the answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.answer.bogus <br>
Number of answers that were bogus. These answers resulted in
SERVFAIL to the client because the answer failed
validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num.rrset.bogus <br>
The number of rrsets marked bogus by the validator.
Increased for every RRset inspection that fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unwanted.queries <br>
Number of queries that were refused or dropped because they
failed the access control settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unwanted.replies <br>
Replies that were unwanted or unsolicited. Could have been
random traffic, delayed duplicates, very late answers, or
could be spoofing attempts. Some low level of late <br>
answers and delayed duplicates are to be expected with the
UDP protocol. Very high values could indicate a threat
(spoofing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/unbound/unbound.conf <br>
unbound configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/unbound <br>
directory with private keys (unbound_server.key and
unbound_control.key) and self-signed certificates
(unbound_server.pem and unbound_control.pem).</p>
