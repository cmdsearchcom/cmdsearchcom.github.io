This manual page describes GNU Stow 2.2.2, a program for managing the
  installation of software packages. This is not the definitive documentation
  for stow; for that, see the info manual.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stow is a tool for managing the installation of multiple software packages in
  the same run-time directory tree. One historical difficulty of this task has
  been the need to administer, upgrade, install, and remove files in independent
  packages without confusing them with other files sharing the same filesystem
  space. For instance, it is common to install Perl and Emacs in
  <i>/usr/local</i>. When one does so, one winds up (as of Perl 4.036 and Emacs
  19.22) with the following files in <i>/usr/local/man/man1</i>: <i>a2p.1</i>;
  <i>ctags.1</i>; <i>emacs.1</i>; <i>etags.1</i>; <i>h2ph.1</i>; <i>perl.1</i>;
  and <i>s2p.1</i>. Now suppose it's time to uninstall Perl. Which man pages get
  removed? Obviously <i>perl.1</i> is one of them, but it should not be the
  administrator's responsibility to memorize the ownership of individual files
  by separate packages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The approach used by Stow is to install each package into its own tree, then use
  symbolic links to make it appear as though the files are installed in the
  common tree. Administration can be performed in the package's private tree in
  isolation from clutter from other packages. Stow can then be used to update
  the symbolic links. The structure of each private tree should reflect the
  desired structure in the common tree; i.e. (in the typical case) there should
  be a <i>bin</i> directory containing executables, a <i>man/man1</i> directory
  containing section 1 man pages, and so on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stow was inspired by Carnegie Mellon's Depot program, but is substantially
  simpler and safer. Whereas Depot required database files to keep things in
  sync, Stow stores no extra state between runs, so there's no danger (as there
  was in Depot) of mangling directories when file hierarchies don't match the
  database. Also unlike Depot, Stow will never delete any files, directories, or
  links that appear in a Stow directory (e.g., <i>/usr/local/stow/emacs</i>), so
  it's always possible to rebuild the target tree (e.g., <i>/usr/local</i>).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TERMINOLOGY"><a class="selflink" href="#TERMINOLOGY">TERMINOLOGY</a></h1>
A &quot;package&quot; is a related collection of files and directories that you
  wish to administer as a unit -- e.g., Perl or Emacs -- and that needs to be
  installed in a particular directory structure -- e.g., with <i>bin</i>,
  <i>lib</i>, and <i>man</i> subdirectories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;target directory&quot; is the root of a tree in which one or more
  packages wish to <b>appear</b> to be installed. A common, but by no means the
  only such location is <i>/usr/local</i>. The examples in this manual page will
  use <i>/usr/local</i> as the target directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;stow directory&quot; is the root of a tree containing separate packages
  in private subtrees. When Stow runs, it uses the current directory as the
  default stow directory. The examples in this manual page will use
  <i>/usr/local/stow</i> as the stow directory, so that individual packages will
  be, for example, <i>/usr/local/stow/perl</i> and <i>/usr/local/stow/emacs</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An &quot;installation image&quot; is the layout of files and directories
  required by a package, relative to the target directory. Thus, the
  installation image for Perl includes: a <i>bin</i> directory containing
  <i>perl</i> and <i>a2p</i> (among others); an <i>info</i> directory containing
  Texinfo documentation; a <i>lib/perl</i> directory containing Perl libraries;
  and a <i>man/man1</i> directory containing man pages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;package directory&quot; is the root of a tree containing the
  installation image for a particular package. Each package directory must
  reside in a stow directory -- e.g., the package directory
  <i>/usr/local/stow/perl</i> must reside in the stow directory
  <i>/usr/local/stow</i>. The &quot;name&quot; of a package is the name of its
  directory within the stow directory -- e.g., <i>perl</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, the Perl executable might reside in <i>/usr/local/stow/perl/bin/perl</i>,
  where <i>/usr/local</i> is the target directory, <i>/usr/local/stow</i> is the
  stow directory, <i>/usr/local/stow/perl</i> is the package directory, and
  <i>bin/perl</i> within is part of the installation image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;symlink&quot; is a symbolic link. A symlink can be &quot;relative&quot;
  or &quot;absolute&quot;. An absolute symlink names a full path; that is, one
  starting from <i>/</i>. A relative symlink names a relative path; that is, one
  not starting from <i>/</i>. The target of a relative symlink is computed
  starting from the symlink's own directory. Stow only creates relative
  symlinks.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The stow directory is assumed to be the value of the &quot;STOW_DIR&quot;
  environment variable or if unset the current directory, and the target
  directory is assumed to be the parent of the current directory (so it is
  typical to execute <i>stow</i> from the directory <i>/usr/local/stow</i>).
  Each <i>package</i> given on the command line is the name of a package in the
  stow directory (e.g., <i>perl</i>). By default, they are installed into the
  target directory (but they can be deleted instead using &quot;-D&quot;).

    When stowing, if a target is encountered which already exists but is a plain
      file (and hence not owned by any existing stow package), then normally
      Stow will register this as a conflict and refuse to proceed. This option
      changes that behaviour so that the file is moved to the same relative
      place within the package's installation image within the stow directory,
      and then stowing proceeds as before. So effectively, the file becomes
      adopted by the stow package, without its contents changing.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INSTALLING_PACKAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#INSTALLING_PACKAGES">INSTALLING
  PACKAGES</a></h1>
The default action of Stow is to install a package. This means creating symlinks
  in the target tree that point into the package tree. Stow attempts to do this
  with as few symlinks as possible; in other words, if Stow can create a single
  symlink that points to an entire subtree within the package tree, it will
  choose to do that rather than create a directory in the target tree and
  populate it with symlinks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, suppose that no packages have yet been installed in
  <i>/usr/local</i>; it's completely empty (except for the <i>stow</i>
  subdirectory, of course). Now suppose the Perl package is installed. Recall
  that it includes the following directories in its installation image:
  <i>bin</i>; <i>info</i>; <i>lib/perl</i>; <i>man/man1</i>. Rather than
  creating the directory <i>/usr/local/bin</i> and populating it with symlinks
  to <i>../stow/perl/bin/perl</i> and <i>../stow/perl/bin/a2p</i> (and so on),
  Stow will create a single symlink, <i>/usr/local/bin</i>, which points to
  <i>stow/perl/bin</i>. In this way, it still works to refer to
  <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> and <i>/usr/local/bin/a2p</i>, and fewer symlinks
  have been created. This is called &quot;tree folding&quot;, since an entire
  subtree is &quot;folded&quot; into a single symlink.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To complete this example, Stow will also create the symlink
  <i>/usr/local/info</i> pointing to <i>stow/perl/info</i>; the symlink
  <i>/usr/local/lib</i> pointing to <i>stow/perl/lib</i>; and the symlink
  <i>/usr/local/man</i> pointing to <i>stow/perl/man</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now suppose that instead of installing the Perl package into an empty target
  tree, the target tree is not empty to begin with. Instead, it contains several
  files and directories installed under a different system-administration
  philosophy. In particular, <i>/usr/local/bin</i> already exists and is a
  directory, as are <i>/usr/local/lib</i> and <i>/usr/local/man/man1</i>. In
  this case, Stow will descend into <i>/usr/local/bin</i> and create symlinks to
  <i>../stow/perl/bin/perl</i> and <i>../stow/perl/bin/a2p</i> (etc.), and it
  will descend into <i>/usr/local/lib</i> and create the tree-folding symlink
  <i>perl</i> pointing to <i>../stow/perl/lib/perl</i>, and so on. As a rule,
  Stow only descends as far as necessary into the target tree when it can create
  a tree-folding symlink.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The time often comes when a tree-folding symlink has to be undone because
  another package uses one or more of the folded subdirectories in its
  installation image. This operation is called &quot;splitting open&quot; a
  folded tree. It involves removing the original symlink from the target tree,
  creating a true directory in its place, and then populating the new directory
  with symlinks to the newly-installed package <b>and</b> to the old package
  that used the old symlink. For example, suppose that after installing Perl
  into an empty <i>/usr/local</i>, we wish to install Emacs. Emacs's
  installation image includes a <i>bin</i> directory containing the <i>emacs</i>
  and <i>etags</i> executables, among others. Stow must make these files appear
  to be installed in <i>/usr/local/bin</i>, but presently <i>/usr/local/bin</i>
  is a symlink to <i>stow/perl/bin</i>. Stow therefore takes the following
  steps: the symlink <i>/usr/local/bin</i> is deleted; the directory
  <i>/usr/local/bin</i> is created; links are made from <i>/usr/local/bin</i> to
  <i>../stow/emacs/bin/emacs</i> and <i>../stow/emacs/bin/etags</i>; and links
  are made from <i>/usr/local/bin</i> to <i>../stow/perl/bin/perl</i> and
  <i>../stow/perl/bin/a2p</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When splitting open a folded tree, Stow makes sure that the symlink it is about
  to remove points inside a valid package in the current stow directory.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Stow_will_never_delete_anything_that_it_doesn't_own."><a class="selflink" href="#Stow_will_never_delete_anything_that_it_doesn't_own.">Stow
  will never delete anything that it doesn't own.</a></h2>
Stow &quot;owns&quot; everything living in the target tree that points into a
  package in the stow directory. Anything Stow owns, it can recompute if lost.
  Note that by this definition, Stow doesn't &quot;own&quot; anything <b>in</b>
  the stow directory or in any of the packages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If Stow needs to create a directory or a symlink in the target tree and it
  cannot because that name is already in use and is not owned by Stow, then a
  conflict has arisen. See the &quot;Conflicts&quot; section in the info manual.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DELETING_PACKAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#DELETING_PACKAGES">DELETING
  PACKAGES</a></h1>
When the &quot;-D&quot; option is given, the action of Stow is to delete a
  package from the target tree. Note that Stow will not delete anything it
  doesn't &quot;own&quot;. Deleting a package does <b>not</b> mean removing it
  from the stow directory or discarding the package tree.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To delete a package, Stow recursively scans the target tree, skipping over the
  stow directory (since that is usually a subdirectory of the target tree) and
  any other stow directories it encounters (see &quot;Multiple stow
  directories&quot; in the info manual). Any symlink it finds that points into
  the package being deleted is removed. Any directory that contained only
  symlinks to the package being deleted is removed. Any directory that, after
  removing symlinks and empty subdirectories, contains only symlinks to a single
  other package, is considered to be a previously &quot;folded&quot; tree that
  was &quot;split open.&quot; Stow will re-fold the tree by removing the
  symlinks to the surviving package, removing the directory, then linking the
  directory back to the surviving package.

  <dd class="It-tag">The empty-directory problem.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If package <i>foo</i> includes an empty directory -- say, <i>foo/bar</i> --
      then if no other package has a <i>bar</i> subdirectory, everything's fine.
      If another stowed package <i>quux</i>, has a <i>bar</i> subdirectory, then
      when stowing, <i>targetdir/bar</i> will be &quot;split open&quot; and the
      contents of <i>quux/bar</i> will be individually stowed. So far, so good.
      But when unstowing <i>quux</i>, <i>targetdir/bar</i> will be removed, even
      though <i>foo/bar</i> needs it to remain. A workaround for this problem is
      to create a file in <i>foo/bar</i> as a placeholder. If you name that file
      <i>.placeholder</i>, it will be easy to find and remove such files when
      this bug is fixed.</dd>
