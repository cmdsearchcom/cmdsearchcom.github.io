<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
stow - software package installation manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
stow [ options ] package ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page describes GNU Stow 2.2.2, a program for
managing the installation of software packages. This is not
the definitive documentation for stow; for that, see the
info <br>
manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stow is a tool for managing the
installation of multiple software packages in the same
run-time directory tree. One historical difficulty of this
task has been the need to <br>
administer, upgrade, install, and remove files in
independent packages without confusing them with other files
sharing the same filesystem space. For instance, it is
common to <br>
install Perl and Emacs in /usr/local. When one does so, one
winds up (as of Perl 4.036 and Emacs 19.22) with the
following files in /usr/local/man/man1: a2p.1; ctags.1;
emacs.1; <br>
etags.1; h2ph.1; perl.1; and s2p.1. Now suppose it&rsquo;s
time to uninstall Perl. Which man pages get removed?
Obviously perl.1 is one of them, but it should not be the
<br>
administrator&rsquo;s responsibility to memorize the
ownership of individual files by separate packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The approach used by Stow is to
install each package into its own tree, then use symbolic
links to make it appear as though the files are installed in
the common tree. <br>
Administration can be performed in the package&rsquo;s
private tree in isolation from clutter from other packages.
Stow can then be used to update the symbolic links. The
structure of <br>
each private tree should reflect the desired structure in
the common tree; i.e. (in the typical case) there should be
a bin directory containing executables, a man/man1 directory
<br>
containing section 1 man pages, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stow was inspired by Carnegie
Mellon&rsquo;s Depot program, but is substantially simpler
and safer. Whereas Depot required database files to keep
things in sync, Stow stores no extra <br>
state between runs, so there&rsquo;s no danger (as there was
in Depot) of mangling directories when file hierarchies
don&rsquo;t match the database. Also unlike Depot, Stow will
never delete <br>
any files, directories, or links that appear in a Stow
directory (e.g., /usr/local/stow/emacs), so it&rsquo;s
always possible to rebuild the target tree (e.g.,
/usr/local).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINOLOGY <br>
A &quot;package&quot; is a related collection of files and
directories that you wish to administer as a unit -- e.g.,
Perl or Emacs -- and that needs to be installed in a
particular <br>
directory structure -- e.g., with bin, lib, and man
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;target directory&quot;
is the root of a tree in which one or more packages wish to
appear to be installed. A common, but by no means the only
such location is /usr/local. The <br>
examples in this manual page will use /usr/local as the
target directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;stow directory&quot; is
the root of a tree containing separate packages in private
subtrees. When Stow runs, it uses the current directory as
the default stow directory. The <br>
examples in this manual page will use /usr/local/stow as the
stow directory, so that individual packages will be, for
example, /usr/local/stow/perl and /usr/local/stow/emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;installation
image&quot; is the layout of files and directories required
by a package, relative to the target directory. Thus, the
installation image for Perl includes: a bin <br>
directory containing perl and a2p (among others); an info
directory containing Texinfo documentation; a lib/perl
directory containing Perl libraries; and a man/man1
directory <br>
containing man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;package directory&quot;
is the root of a tree containing the installation image for
a particular package. Each package directory must reside in
a stow directory -- e.g., the <br>
package directory /usr/local/stow/perl must reside in the
stow directory /usr/local/stow. The &quot;name&quot; of a
package is the name of its directory within the stow
directory -- e.g., <br>
perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, the Perl executable might
reside in /usr/local/stow/perl/bin/perl, where /usr/local is
the target directory, /usr/local/stow is the stow directory,
/usr/local/stow/perl is <br>
the package directory, and bin/perl within is part of the
installation image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;symlink&quot; is a
symbolic link. A symlink can be &quot;relative&quot; or
&quot;absolute&quot;. An absolute symlink names a full path;
that is, one starting from /. A relative symlink names a
<br>
relative path; that is, one not starting from /. The target
of a relative symlink is computed starting from the
symlink&rsquo;s own directory. Stow only creates relative
symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The stow directory is assumed to be the value of the
&quot;STOW_DIR&quot; environment variable or if unset the
current directory, and the target directory is assumed to be
the parent of <br>
the current directory (so it is typical to execute stow from
the directory /usr/local/stow). Each package given on the
command line is the name of a package in the stow <br>
directory (e.g., perl). By default, they are installed into
the target directory (but they can be deleted instead using
&quot;-D&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
--no <br>
Do not perform any operations that modify the filesystem;
merely show what would happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DIR <br>
--dir=DIR <br>
Set the stow directory to &quot;DIR&quot; instead of the
current directory. This also has the effect of making the
default target directory be the parent of
&quot;DIR&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t DIR <br>
--target=DIR <br>
Set the target directory to &quot;DIR&quot; instead of the
parent of the stow directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose[=N] <br>
Send verbose output to standard error describing what Stow
is doing. Verbosity levels are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4; 0 is the
default. Using &quot;-v&quot; or &quot;--verbose&quot;
increases the <br>
verbosity by one; using &lsquo;--verbose=N&rsquo; sets it to
N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
--stow <br>
Stow the packages that follow this option into the target
directory. This is the default action and so can be omitted
if you are only stowing packages rather than performing <br>
a mixture of stow/delete/restow actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
--delete <br>
Unstow the packages that follow this option from the target
directory rather than installing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R <br>
--restow <br>
Restow packages (first unstow, then stow again). This is
useful for pruning obsolete symlinks from the target tree
after updating the software in a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--adopt <br>
Warning! This behaviour is specifically intended to alter
the contents of your stow directory. If you do not want
that, this option is not for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When stowing, if a target is
encountered which already exists but is a plain file (and
hence not owned by any existing stow package), then normally
Stow will register this as <br>
a conflict and refuse to proceed. This option changes that
behaviour so that the file is moved to the same relative
place within the package&rsquo;s installation image within
the <br>
stow directory, and then stowing proceeds as before. So
effectively, the file becomes adopted by the stow package,
without its contents changing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-folding <br>
Disable folding of newly stowed directories when stowing,
and refolding of newly foldable directories when
unstowing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore=REGEX <br>
Ignore files ending in this Perl regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--defer=REGEX <br>
Don&rsquo;t stow files beginning with this Perl regex if the
file is already stowed to another package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--override=REGEX <br>
Force stowing files beginning with this Perl regex if the
file is already stowed to another package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Show Stow version number, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help <br>
Show Stow command syntax, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLING PACKAGES <br>
The default action of Stow is to install a package. This
means creating symlinks in the target tree that point into
the package tree. Stow attempts to do this with as few <br>
symlinks as possible; in other words, if Stow can create a
single symlink that points to an entire subtree within the
package tree, it will choose to do that rather than create a
<br>
directory in the target tree and populate it with
symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, suppose that no
packages have yet been installed in /usr/local; it&rsquo;s
completely empty (except for the stow subdirectory, of
course). Now suppose the Perl package is <br>
installed. Recall that it includes the following directories
in its installation image: bin; info; lib/perl; man/man1.
Rather than creating the directory /usr/local/bin and <br>
populating it with symlinks to ../stow/perl/bin/perl and
../stow/perl/bin/a2p (and so on), Stow will create a single
symlink, /usr/local/bin, which points to stow/perl/bin. In
<br>
this way, it still works to refer to /usr/local/bin/perl and
/usr/local/bin/a2p, and fewer symlinks have been created.
This is called &quot;tree folding&quot;, since an entire
subtree is <br>
&quot;folded&quot; into a single symlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To complete this example, Stow
will also create the symlink /usr/local/info pointing to
stow/perl/info; the symlink /usr/local/lib pointing to
stow/perl/lib; and the symlink <br>
/usr/local/man pointing to stow/perl/man.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now suppose that instead of
installing the Perl package into an empty target tree, the
target tree is not empty to begin with. Instead, it contains
several files and directories <br>
installed under a different system-administration
philosophy. In particular, /usr/local/bin already exists and
is a directory, as are /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/man/man1. In <br>
this case, Stow will descend into /usr/local/bin and create
symlinks to ../stow/perl/bin/perl and ../stow/perl/bin/a2p
(etc.), and it will descend into /usr/local/lib and create
<br>
the tree-folding symlink perl pointing to
../stow/perl/lib/perl, and so on. As a rule, Stow only
descends as far as necessary into the target tree when it
can create a tree- <br>
folding symlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time often comes when a
tree-folding symlink has to be undone because another
package uses one or more of the folded subdirectories in its
installation image. This operation <br>
is called &quot;splitting open&quot; a folded tree. It
involves removing the original symlink from the target tree,
creating a true directory in its place, and then populating
the new <br>
directory with symlinks to the newly-installed package and
to the old package that used the old symlink. For example,
suppose that after installing Perl into an empty /usr/local,
<br>
we wish to install Emacs. Emacs&rsquo;s installation image
includes a bin directory containing the emacs and etags
executables, among others. Stow must make these files appear
to be <br>
installed in /usr/local/bin, but presently /usr/local/bin is
a symlink to stow/perl/bin. Stow therefore takes the
following steps: the symlink /usr/local/bin is deleted; the
<br>
directory /usr/local/bin is created; links are made from
/usr/local/bin to ../stow/emacs/bin/emacs and
../stow/emacs/bin/etags; and links are made from
/usr/local/bin to <br>
../stow/perl/bin/perl and ../stow/perl/bin/a2p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When splitting open a folded
tree, Stow makes sure that the symlink it is about to remove
points inside a valid package in the current stow
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stow will never delete anything
that it doesn&rsquo;t own. <br>
Stow &quot;owns&quot; everything living in the target tree
that points into a package in the stow directory. Anything
Stow owns, it can recompute if lost. Note that by this
definition, <br>
Stow doesn&rsquo;t &quot;own&quot; anything in the stow
directory or in any of the packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Stow needs to create a
directory or a symlink in the target tree and it cannot
because that name is already in use and is not owned by
Stow, then a conflict has arisen. See <br>
the &quot;Conflicts&quot; section in the info manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETING PACKAGES <br>
When the &quot;-D&quot; option is given, the action of Stow
is to delete a package from the target tree. Note that Stow
will not delete anything it doesn&rsquo;t &quot;own&quot;.
Deleting a package does <br>
not mean removing it from the stow directory or discarding
the package tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To delete a package, Stow
recursively scans the target tree, skipping over the stow
directory (since that is usually a subdirectory of the
target tree) and any other stow <br>
directories it encounters (see &quot;Multiple stow
directories&quot; in the info manual). Any symlink it finds
that points into the package being deleted is removed. Any
directory that <br>
contained only symlinks to the package being deleted is
removed. Any directory that, after removing symlinks and
empty subdirectories, contains only symlinks to a single
other <br>
package, is considered to be a previously &quot;folded&quot;
tree that was &quot;split open.&quot; Stow will re-fold the
tree by removing the symlinks to the surviving package,
removing the <br>
directory, then linking the directory back to the surviving
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report bugs in Stow using the Debian bug tracking
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently known bugs
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
empty-directory problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If package foo includes an empty
directory -- say, foo/bar -- then if no other package has a
bar subdirectory, everything&rsquo;s fine. If another stowed
package quux, has a bar <br>
subdirectory, then when stowing, targetdir/bar will be
&quot;split open&quot; and the contents of quux/bar will be
individually stowed. So far, so good. But when unstowing
quux, <br>
targetdir/bar will be removed, even though foo/bar needs it
to remain. A workaround for this problem is to create a file
in foo/bar as a placeholder. If you name that file <br>
.placeholder, it will be easy to find and remove such files
when this bug is fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When using
multiple stow directories (see &quot;Multiple stow
directories&quot; in the info manual), Stow fails to
&quot;split open&quot; tree-folding symlinks (see
&quot;Installing packages&quot; in the <br>
info manual) that point into a stow directory which is not
the one in use by the current Stow command. Before failing,
it should search the target of the link to see whether <br>
any element of the path contains a .stow file. If it finds
one, it can &quot;learn&quot; about the cooperating stow
directory to short-circuit the .stow search the next time it
<br>
encounters a tree-folding symlink.</p>
