<p>TUNELP(8) System Administration TUNELP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tunelp - set various parameters for the lp device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tunelp [options] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tunelp sets several parameters for the /dev/lp? devices, for
better performance (or for any performance at all, if your
printer won&rsquo;t work without it...) Without parameters,
it <br>
tells whether the device is using interrupts, and if so,
which one. With parameters, it sets the device
characteristics accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i, --irq argument <br>
specifies the IRQ to use for the parallel port in question.
If this is set to something non-zero, -t and -c have no
effect. If your port does not use interrupts, this <br>
option will make printing stop. The command tunelp -i 0
restores non-interrupt driven (polling) action, and your
printer should work again. If your parallel port does <br>
support interrupts, interrupt-driven printing should be
somewhat faster and efficient, and will probably be
desirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option will have no
effect with kernel 2.1.131 or later since the irq is handled
by the parport driver. You can change the parport irq for
example via <br>
/proc/parport/*/irq. Read
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/parport.txt for more details on
parport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --time milliseconds <br>
is the amount of time in jiffies that the driver waits if
the printer doesn&rsquo;t take a character for the number of
tries dictated by the -c parameter. 10 is the default <br>
value. If you want fastest possible printing, and
don&rsquo;t care about system load, you may set this to 0.
If you don&rsquo;t care how fast your printer goes, or are
printing text <br>
on a slow printer with a buffer, then 500 (5 seconds) should
be fine, and will give you very low system load. This value
generally should be lower for printing graphics <br>
than text, by a factor of approximately 10, for best
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --chars characters <br>
is the number of times to try to output a character to the
printer before sleeping for -t TIME. It is the number of
times around a loop that tries to send a character to <br>
the printer. 120 appears to be a good value for most
printers in polling mode. 1000 is the default, because there
are some printers that become jerky otherwise, but you <br>
must set this to &lsquo;1&rsquo; to handle the maximal CPU
efficiency if you are using interrupts. If you have a very
fast printer, a value of 10 might make more sense even if in
<br>
polling mode. If you have a really old printer, you can
increase this further.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting -t TIME to 0 is
equivalent to setting -c CHARS to infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wait milliseconds <br>
is the number of usec we wait while playing with the strobe
signal. While most printers appear to be able to deal with
an extremely short strobe, some printers demand a <br>
longer one. Increasing this from the default 1 may make it
possible to print with those printers. This may also make it
possible to use longer cables. It&rsquo;s also possi&acirc;
<br>
ble to decrease this value to 0 if your printer is fast
enough or your machine is slow enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --abort &lt;on|off&gt; <br>
This is whether to abort on printer error - the default is
not to. If you are sitting at your computer, you probably
want to be able to see an error and fix it, and have <br>
the printer go on printing. On the other hand, if you
aren&rsquo;t, you might rather that your printer spooler
find out that the printer isn&rsquo;t ready, quit trying,
and send you <br>
mail about it. The choice is yours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --check-status
&lt;on|off&gt; <br>
This option is much like -a. It makes any open() of this
device check to see that the device is on-line and not
reporting any out of paper or other errors. This is the <br>
correct setting for most versions of lpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --careful &lt;on|off&gt;
<br>
This option adds extra (&quot;careful&quot;) error checking.
When this option is on, the printer driver will ensure that
the printer is on-line and not reporting any out of paper
<br>
or other errors before sending data. This is particularly
useful for printers that normally appear to accept data when
turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option is obsolete
because it&rsquo;s the default in 2.1.131 kernel or
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --status <br>
This option returns the current printer status, both as a
decimal number from 0..255, and as a list of active flags.
When this option is specified, -q off, turning off <br>
the display of the current IRQ, is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --trust-irq &lt;on|off&gt;
<br>
This option is obsolete. It was added in Linux 2.1.131, and
removed again in Linux 2.3.10. The below is for these old
kernels only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option tells the lp driver
to trust or not the IRQ. This option makes sense only if you
are using interrupts. If you tell the lp driver to trust the
irq, then, when <br>
the lp driver will get an irq, it will send the next pending
character to the printer unconditionally, even if the
printer still claims to be BUSY. This is the only way <br>
to sleep on interrupt (and so the handle the irq printing
efficiently) at least on Epson Stylus Color Printers. The lp
driver automagically detects if you could get <br>
improved performance by setting this flag, and in such case
it will warn you with a kernel message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Trusting the irq is
reported to corrupt the printing on some hardware, you must
try to know if your printer will work or not...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reset <br>
This option resets the port. It requires a Linux kernel
version of 1.1.80 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --print-irq &lt;on|off&gt;
<br>
This option sets printing the display of the current IRQ
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
-o, -C, and -s all require a Linux kernel version of 1.1.76
or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C requires a Linux version
prior to 2.1.131.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T requires a Linux version of
2.1.131 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
By some unfortunate coincidence the ioctl LPSTRICT of 2.0.36
has the same number as the ioctl LPTRUSTIRQ introduced in
2.1.131. So, use of the -T option on a 2.0.36 kernel with
<br>
an tunelp compiled under 2.1.131 or later may have
unexpected effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/lp? <br>
/proc/parport/*/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
The tunelp command is part of the util-linux package and is
available from Linux Kernel Archive
&acirc;&uml;ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/&acirc;&copy;.</p>
