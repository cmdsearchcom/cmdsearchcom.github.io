<b>tunelp</b> sets several parameters for the /dev/lp<i>?</i> devices, for
  better performance (or for any performance at all, if your printer won't work
  without it...) Without parameters, it tells whether the device is using
  interrupts, and if so, which one. With parameters, it sets the device
  characteristics accordingly.

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b>, <b>--irq</b> <i>argument</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">specifies the IRQ to use for the parallel port in question.
      If this is set to something non-zero, -t and -c have no effect. If your
      port does not use interrupts, this option will make printing stop. The
      command <b>tunelp -i 0</b> restores non-interrupt driven (polling) action,
      and your printer should work again. If your parallel port does support
      interrupts, interrupt-driven printing should be somewhat faster and
      efficient, and will probably be desirable.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">NOTE: This option will have no effect with kernel 2.1.131
      or later since the irq is handled by the parport driver. You can change
      the parport irq for example via <i>/proc/parport/*/irq</i>. Read
      <i>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/parport.txt</i> for more details on

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b>, <b>--time</b> <i>milliseconds</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is the amount of time in jiffies that the driver waits if
      the printer doesn't take a character for the number of tries dictated by
      the -c parameter. 10 is the default value. If you want fastest possible
      printing, and don't care about system load, you may set this to 0. If you
      don't care how fast your printer goes, or are printing text on a slow
      printer with a buffer, then 500 (5 seconds) should be fine, and will give
      you very low system load. This value generally should be lower for
      printing graphics than text, by a factor of approximately 10, for best
      performance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b>, <b>--chars</b> <i>characters</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is the number of times to try to output a character to the
      printer before sleeping for -t <i>TIME</i>. It is the number of times
      around a loop that tries to send a character to the printer. 120 appears
      to be a good value for most printers in polling mode. 1000 is the default,
      because there are some printers that become jerky otherwise, but you
      <i>must</i> set this to `1' to handle the maximal CPU efficiency if you
      are using interrupts. If you have a very fast printer, a value of 10 might
      make more sense even if in polling mode. If you have a <i>really</i> old
      printer, you can increase this further.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">is the number of usec we wait while playing with the strobe
      signal. While most printers appear to be able to deal with an extremely
      short strobe, some printers demand a longer one. Increasing this from the
      default 1 may make it possible to print with those printers. This may also
      make it possible to use longer cables. It's also possible to decrease this
      value to 0 if your printer is fast enough or your machine is slow
    enough.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b>, <b>--abort</b> <i>&lt;on|off&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is whether to abort on printer error - the default is
      not to. If you are sitting at your computer, you probably want to be able
      to see an error and fix it, and have the printer go on printing. On the
      other hand, if you aren't, you might rather that your printer spooler find
      out that the printer isn't ready, quit trying, and send you mail about it.

      out of paper or other errors. This is the correct setting for most

  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells the lp driver to trust or not the IRQ.
      This option makes sense only if you are using interrupts. If you tell the
      lp driver to trust the irq, then, when the lp driver will get an irq, it
      will send the next pending character to the printer unconditionally, even
      if the printer still claims to be BUSY. This is the only way to sleep on
      interrupt (and so the handle the irq printing efficiently) at least on
      Epson Stylus Color Printers. The lp driver automagically detects if you
      could get improved performance by setting this flag, and in such case it
      will warn you with a kernel message.</dd>

By some unfortunate coincidence the ioctl LPSTRICT of 2.0.36 has the same number
  as the ioctl LPTRUSTIRQ introduced in 2.1.131. So, use of the -T option on a
  2.0.36 kernel with an tunelp compiled under 2.1.131 or later may have
  unexpected effects.
