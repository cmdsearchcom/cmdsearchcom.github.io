<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ipvsadm(8) is used to set up, maintain or inspect the
virtual server table in the Linux kernel. The Linux Virtual
Server can be used to build scalable network services based
on a <br>
cluster of two or more nodes. The active node of the cluster
redirects service requests to a collection of server hosts
that will actually perform the services. Supported
fea&acirc; <br>
tures include two protocols (TCP and UDP), three
packet-forwarding methods (NAT, tunneling, and direct
routing), and eight load balancing algorithms (round robin,
weighted round <br>
robin, least-connection, weighted least-connection,
locality-based least-connection, locality-based
least-connection with replication, destination-hashing, and
source-hashing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command has two basic
formats for execution:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipvsadm COMMAND [protocol]
service-address <br>
[scheduling-method] [persistence options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipvsadm command [protocol]
service-address <br>
server-address [packet-forwarding-method] <br>
[weight options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first format manipulates a
virtual service and the algorithm for assigning service
requests to real servers. Optionally, a persistent timeout
and network mask for the granu&acirc; <br>
larity of a persistent service may be specified. The second
format manipulates a real server that is associated with an
existing virtual service. When specifying a real server,
<br>
the packet-forwarding method and the weight of the real
server, relative to other real servers for the virtual
service, may be specified, otherwise defaults will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
ipvsadm(8) recognises the commands described below.
Upper-case commands maintain virtual services. Lower-case
commands maintain real servers that are associated with a
virtual <br>
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --add-service <br>
Add a virtual service. A service address is uniquely defined
by a triplet: IP address, port number, and protocol.
Alternatively, a virtual service may be defined by a <br>
firewall-mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --edit-service <br>
Edit a virtual service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delete-service <br>
Delete a virtual service, along with any associated real
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --clear <br>
Clear the virtual server table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --restore <br>
Restore Linux Virtual Server rules from stdin. Each line
read from stdin will be treated as the command line options
to a separate invocation of ipvsadm. Lines read from <br>
stdin can optionally begin with &quot;ipvsadm&quot;. This
option is useful to avoid executing a large number or
ipvsadm commands when constructing an extensive routing
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --save <br>
Dump the Linux Virtual Server rules to stdout in a format
that can be read by -R|--restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --add-server <br>
Add a real server to a virtual service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit-server <br>
Edit a real server in a virtual service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --delete-server <br>
Remove a real server from a virtual service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, -l, --list <br>
List the virtual server table if no argument is specified.
If a service-address is selected, list this service only. If
the -c option is selected, then display the connec&acirc;
<br>
tion table. The exact output is affected by the other
arguments given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --zero <br>
Zero the packet, byte and rate counters in a service or all
services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set tcp tcpfin udp <br>
Change the timeout values used for IPVS connections. This
command always takes 3 parameters, representing the timeout
values (in seconds) for TCP sessions, TCP ses&acirc; <br>
sions after receiving a FIN packet, and UDP packets,
respectively. A timeout value 0 means that the current
timeout value of the corresponding entry is preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start-daemon state <br>
Start the connection synchronization daemon. The state is to
indicate that the daemon is started as master or backup. The
connection synchronization daemon is implemented <br>
inside the Linux kernel. The master daemon running at the
primary load balancer multicasts changes of connections
periodically, and the backup daemon running at the backup
<br>
load balancers receives multicast message and creates
corresponding connections. Then, in case the primary load
balancer fails, a backup load balancer will takeover, and
<br>
it has state of almost all connections, so that almost all
established connections can continue to access the
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sync daemon currently only
supports IPv4 connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stop-daemon <br>
Stop the connection synchronization daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a description of the command syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
The commands above accept or require zero or more of the
following parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tcp-service
service-address <br>
Use TCP service. The service-address is of the form
host[:port]. Host may be one of a plain IP address or a
hostname. Port may be either a plain port number or the
ser&acirc; <br>
vice name of port. The Port may be omitted, in which case
zero will be used. A Port of zero is only valid if the
service is persistent as the -p|--persistent option, in <br>
which case it is a wild-card port, that is connections will
be accepted to any port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --udp-service
service-address <br>
Use UDP service. See the -t|--tcp-service for the
description of the service-address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fwmark-service integer
<br>
Use a firewall-mark, an integer value greater than zero, to
denote a virtual service instead of an address, port and
protocol (UDP or TCP). The marking of packets with a <br>
firewall-mark is configured using the -m|--mark option to
iptables(8). It can be used to build a virtual service
associated with the same real servers, covering multiple
<br>
IP address, port and protocol triplets. If IPv6 addresses
are used, the -6 option must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using firewall-mark virtual
services provides a convenient method of grouping together
different IP addresses, ports and protocols into a single
virtual service. This is <br>
useful for both simplifying configuration if a large number
of virtual services are required and grouping persistence
across what would otherwise be multiple virtual ser&acirc;
<br>
vices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --scheduler
scheduling-method <br>
scheduling-method Algorithm for allocating TCP connections
and UDP datagrams to real servers. Scheduling algorithms are
implemented as kernel modules. Ten are shipped <br>
with the Linux Virtual Server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rr - Round Robin: distributes
jobs equally amongst the available real servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrr - Weighted Round Robin:
assigns jobs to real servers proportionally to there real
servers&rsquo; weight. Servers with higher weights receive
new jobs first and get more jobs <br>
than servers with lower weights. Servers with equal weights
get an equal distribution of new jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lc - Least-Connection: assigns
more jobs to real servers with fewer active jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wlc - Weighted Least-Connection:
assigns more jobs to servers with fewer jobs and relative to
the real servers&rsquo; weight (Ci/Wi). This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lblc - Locality-Based
Least-Connection: assigns jobs destined for the same IP
address to the same server if the server is not overloaded
and available; otherwise assign <br>
jobs to servers with fewer jobs, and keep it for future
assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lblcr - Locality-Based
Least-Connection with Replication: assigns jobs destined for
the same IP address to the least-connection node in the
server set for the IP address. <br>
If all the node in the server set are over loaded, it picks
up a node with fewer jobs in the cluster and adds it in the
sever set for the target. If the server set has not <br>
been modified for the specified time, the most loaded node
is removed from the server set, in order to avoid high
degree of replication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dh - Destination Hashing:
assigns jobs to servers through looking up a statically
assigned hash table by their destination IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh - Source Hashing: assigns
jobs to servers through looking up a statically assigned
hash table by their source IP addresses. This scheduler has
two flags: sh-fallback, <br>
which enables fallback to a different server if the selected
server was unavailable, and sh-port, which adds the source
port number to the hash computation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sed - Shortest Expected Delay:
assigns an incoming job to the server with the shortest
expected delay. The expected delay that the job will
experience is (Ci + 1) / Ui if <br>
sent to the ith server, in which Ci is the number of jobs on
the the ith server and Ui is the fixed service rate (weight)
of the ith server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nq - Never Queue: assigns an
incoming job to an idle server if there is, instead of
waiting for a fast one; if all the servers are busy, it
adopts the Shortest Expected <br>
Delay policy to assign the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --persistent [timeout] <br>
Specify that a virtual service is persistent. If this option
is specified, multiple requests from a client are redirected
to the same real server selected for the first <br>
request. Optionally, the timeout of persistent sessions may
be specified given in seconds, otherwise the default of 300
seconds will be used. This option may be used in <br>
conjunction with protocols such as SSL or FTP where it is
important that clients consistently connect with the same
real server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If a virtual service is to
handle FTP connections then persistence must be set for the
virtual service if Direct Routing or Tunnelling is used as
the forwarding <br>
mechanism. If Masquerading is used in conjunction with an
FTP service than persistence is not necessary, but the
ip_vs_ftp kernel module must be used. This module may be
<br>
manually inserted into the kernel using insmod(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --netmask netmask <br>
Specify the granularity with which clients are grouped for
persistent virtual services. The source address of the
request is masked with this netmask to direct all <br>
clients from a network to the same real server. The default
is 255.255.255.255, that is, the persistence granularity is
per client host. Less specific netmasks may be used <br>
to resolve problems with non-persistent cache clusters on
the client side. IPv6 netmasks should be specified as a
prefix length between 1 and 128. The default prefix <br>
length is 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --sched-flags sched-flags
<br>
Set scheduler flags for this virtual server. sched-flags is
a comma-separated list of flags. See the scheduler
descriptions for valid scheduler flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --real-server server-address
<br>
Real server that an associated request for service may be
assigned to. The server-address is the host address of a
real server, and may plus port. Host can be either a <br>
plain IP address or a hostname. Port can be either a plain
port number or the service name of port. In the case of the
masquerading method, the host address is usually <br>
an RFC 1918 private IP address, and the port can be
different from that of the associated service. With the
tunneling and direct routing methods, port must be equal to
<br>
that of the service address. For normal services, the port
specified in the service address will be used if port is not
specified. For fwmark services, port may be omit&acirc; <br>
ted, in which case the destination port on the real server
will be the destination port of the request sent to the
virtual service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[packet-forwarding-method]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --gatewaying Use gatewaying
(direct routing). This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ipip Use ipip
encapsulation (tunneling).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --masquerading Use
masquerading (network access translation, or NAT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Regardless of the
packet-forwarding mechanism specified, real servers for
addresses for which there are interfaces on the local node
will be use the local forward&acirc; <br>
ing method, then packets for the servers will be passed to
upper layer on the local node. This cannot be specified by
ipvsadm, rather it set by the kernel as real servers <br>
are added or modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --weight weight <br>
Weight is an integer specifying the capacity of a server
relative to the others in the pool. The valid values of
weight are 0 through to 65535. The default is 1.
Quies&acirc; <br>
cent servers are specified with a weight of zero. A
quiescent server will receive no new jobs but still serve
the existing jobs, for all scheduling algorithms distributed
<br>
with the Linux Virtual Server. Setting a quiescent server
may be useful if the server is overloaded or needs to be
taken out of service for maintenance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --u-threshold uthreshold
<br>
uthreshold is an integer specifying the upper connection
threshold of a server. The valid values of uthreshold are 0
through to 65535. The default is 0, which means the <br>
upper connection threshold is not set. If uthreshold is set
with other values, no new connections will be sent to the
server when the number of its connections exceeds its <br>
upper connection threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --l-threshold lthreshold
<br>
lthreshold is an integer specifying the lower connection
threshold of a server. The valid values of lthreshold are 0
through to 65535. The default is 0, which means the <br>
lower connection threshold is not set. If lthreshold is set
with other values, the server will receive new connections
when the number of its connections drops below its <br>
lower connection threshold. If lthreshold is not set but
uthreshold is set, the server will receive new connections
when the number of its connections drops below three <br>
forth of its upper connection threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mcast-interface interface <br>
Specify the multicast interface that the sync master daemon
sends outgoing multicasts through, or the sync backup daemon
listens to for multicasts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syncid syncid <br>
Specify the syncid that the sync master daemon fills in the
SyncID header while sending multicast messages, or the sync
backup daemon uses to filter out multicast messages <br>
not matched with the SyncID value. The valid values of
syncid are 0 through to 255. The default is 0, which means
no filtering at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --connection <br>
Connection output. The list command with this option will
list current IPVS connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout <br>
Timeout output. The list command with this option will
display the timeout values (in seconds) for TCP sessions,
TCP sessions after receiving a FIN packet, and UDP
pack&acirc; <br>
ets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon <br>
Daemon information output. The list command with this option
will display the daemon status and its multicast
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stats <br>
Output of statistics information. The list command with this
option will display the statistics information of services
and their servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rate Output of rate
information. The list command with this option will display
the rate information (such as connections/second,
bytes/second and packets/second) of services <br>
and their servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--thresholds <br>
Output of thresholds information. The list command with this
option will display the upper/lower connection threshold
information of each server in service listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--persistent-conn <br>
Output of persistent connection information. The list
command with this option will display the persistent
connection counter information of each server in service
list&acirc; <br>
ing. The persistent connection is used to forward the actual
connections from the same client/network to the same
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list command with the -c,
--connection option and this option will include persistence
engine data, if any is present, when listing
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort Sort the list of virtual
services and real servers. The virtual service entries are
sorted in ascending order by &lt;protocol, address,
port&gt;. The real server entries are <br>
sorted in ascending order by &lt;address, port&gt;.
(default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nosort <br>
Do not sort the list of virtual services and real
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numeric <br>
Numeric output. IP addresses and port numbers will be
printed in numeric format rather than as as host names and
services respectively, which is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exact <br>
Expand numbers. Display the exact value of the packet and
byte counters, instead of only the rounded number in
K&rsquo;s (multiples of 1000) M&rsquo;s (multiples of 1000K)
or G&rsquo;s <br>
(multiples of 1000M). This option is only relevant for the
-L command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ipv6 <br>
Use with -f to signify fwmark rule uses IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --ops <br>
One-packet scheduling. Used in conjunction with a UDP
virtual service or a fwmark virtual service that handles
only UDP packets. All connections are created such that <br>
they only schedule one packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 1 - Simple Virtual
Service <br>
The following commands configure a Linux Director to
distribute incoming requests addressed to port 80 on
207.175.44.110 equally to port 80 on five real servers. The
forwarding <br>
method used in this example is NAT, with each of the real
servers being masqueraded by the Linux Director.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipvsadm -A -t 207.175.44.110:80
-s rr <br>
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.1:80 -m <br>
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.2:80 -m <br>
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.3:80 -m <br>
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.4:80 -m <br>
ipvsadm -a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.5:80 -m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, this could be
achieved in a single ipvsadm command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot; <br>
-A -t 207.175.44.110:80 -s rr <br>
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.1:80 -m <br>
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.2:80 -m <br>
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.3:80 -m <br>
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.4:80 -m <br>
-a -t 207.175.44.110:80 -r 192.168.10.5:80 -m <br>
&quot; | ipvsadm -R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As masquerading is used as the
forwarding mechanism in this example, the default route of
the real servers must be set to the linux director, which
will need to be configured to <br>
forward and masquerade packets. This can be achieved using
the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;1&quot; &gt;
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 2 - Firewall-Mark
Virtual Service <br>
The following commands configure a Linux Director to
distribute incoming requests addressed to any port on
207.175.44.110 or 207.175.44.111 equally to the
corresponding port on <br>
five real servers. As per the previous example, the
forwarding method used in this example is NAT, with each of
the real servers being masqueraded by the Linux
Director.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipvsadm -A -f 1 -s rr <br>
ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 192.168.10.1:0 -m <br>

ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 192.168.10.4:0 -m <br>
ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 192.168.10.5:0 -m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As masquerading is used as the
forwarding mechanism in this example, the default route of
the real servers must be set to the linux director, which
will need to be configured to <br>
forward and masquerade packets. The real server should also
be configured to mark incoming packets addressed to any port
on 207.175.44.110 and 207.175.44.111 with firewall-mark <br>
1. If FTP traffic is to be handled by this virtual service,
then the ip_vs_ftp kernel module needs to be inserted into
the kernel. These operations can be achieved using the <br>
following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;1&quot; &gt;
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward <br>
modprobe ip_tables <br>
iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -d 207.175.44.110/31 -j
MARK --set-mark 1 <br>
modprobe ip_vs_ftp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 <br>
IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by square brackets ([

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The Linux Virtual Server implements three defense strategies
against some types of denial of service (DoS) attacks. The
Linux Director creates an entry for each connection in <br>
order to keep its state, and each entry occupies 128 bytes
effective memory. LVS&rsquo;s vulnerability to a DoS attack
lies in the potential to increase the number entries as much
as <br>
possible until the linux director runs out of memory. The
three defense strategies against the attack are: Randomly
drop some entries in the table. Drop 1/rate packets before
<br>
forwarding them. And use secure tcp state transition table
and short timeouts. The strategies are controlled by sysctl
variables and corresponding entries in the /proc
filesys&acirc; <br>
tem:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_entry
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_packet
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/secure_tcp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid values for each variable
are 0 through to 3. The default value is 0, which disables
the respective defense strategy. 1 and 2 are automatic modes
- when there is no enough <br>
available memory, the respective strategy will be enabled
and the variable is automatically set to 2, otherwise the
strategy is disabled and the variable is set to 1. A value
of <br>
3 denotes that the respective strategy is always enabled.
The available memory threshold and secure TCP timeouts can
be tuned using the sysctl variables and corresponding <br>
entries in the /proc filesystem:</p>
