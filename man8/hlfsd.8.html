<p>HLFSD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual HLFSD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hlfsd - home-link file system daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hlfsd [ -fhnpvC ] [ -a alt_dir ] [ -c cache-interval ] [ -g
group ] [ -i reload-interval ] [ -l logfile ] [ -o
mount-options ] [ -x log-options ] [ -D debug-options ] [ -P
pass&acirc; <br>
word-file ] [ linkname [ subdir ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Hlfsd is a daemon which implements a filesystem containing a
symbolic link to subdirectory within a user&rsquo;s home
directory, depending on the user which accessed that link.
It was <br>
primarily designed to redirect incoming mail to users&rsquo;
home directories, so that it can read from anywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hlfsd operates by mounting
itself as an NFS server for the directory containing
linkname, which defaults to /hlfs/home. Lookups within that
directory are handled by hlfsd, which <br>
uses the password map to determine how to resolve the
lookup. The directory will be created if it doesn&rsquo;t
already exist. The symbolic link will be to the accessing
user&rsquo;s home <br>
directory, with subdir appended to it. If not specified,
subdir defaults to .hlfsdir. This directory will also be
created if it does not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A SIGTERM sent to hlfsd will
cause it to shutdown. A SIGHUP will flush the internal
caches, and reload the password map. It will also close and
reopen the log file, to enable <br>
the original log file to be removed or rotated. A SIGUSR1
will cause it to dump its internal table of user IDs and
home directories to the file /usr/tmp/hlfsd.dump.XXXXXX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a alt_dir <br>
Alternate directory. The name of the directory to which the
symbolic link returned by hlfsd will point, if it cannot
access the home directory of the user. This defaults <br>
to /var/hlfs. This directory will be created if it
doesn&rsquo;t exist. It is expected that either users will
read these files, or the system administrators will run a
script <br>
to resend this &quot;lost mail&quot; to its owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cache-interval <br>
Caching interval. Hlfsd will cache the validity of home
directories for this interval, in seconds. Entries which
have been verified within the last cache-interval sec&acirc;
<br>
onds will not be verified again, since the operation could
be expensive, and the entries are most likely still valid.
After the interval has expired, hlfsd will re-verify <br>
the validity of the user&rsquo;s home directory, and reset
the cache time-counter. The default value for cache-interval
is 300 seconds (5 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force fast startup. This
option tells hlfsd to skip startup-time consistency checks
such as existence of mount directory, alternate spool
directory, symlink to be hidden <br>
under the mount directory, their permissions and
validity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g group <br>
Set the special group HLFS_GID to group. Programs such as
from or comsat, which access the mailboxes of other users)
must be setgid HLFS_GID to work properly. The <br>
default group is &quot;hlfs&quot;. If no group is provided,
and there is no group &quot;hlfs&quot;, this feature is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help. Print a brief help
message, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i reload-interval <br>
Map-reloading interval. Each reload-interval seconds, hlfsd
will reload the password map. Hlfsd needs the password map
for the UIDs and home directory pathnames. Hlfsd <br>
schedules a SIGALRM to reload the password maps. A SIGHUP
sent to hlfsd will force it to reload the maps immediately.
The default value for reload-interval is 900 sec&acirc; <br>
onds (15 minutes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
Specify a log file to which hlfsd will record events. If
logfile is the string syslog then the log messages will be
sent to the system log daemon by syslog(3), using the <br>
LOG_DAEMON facility. This is also the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No verify. Hlfsd will not
verify the validity of the symbolic link it will be
returning, or that the user&rsquo;s home directory contains
sufficient disk-space for spooling. <br>
This can speed up hlfsd at the cost of possibly returning
symbolic links to home directories which are not currently
accessible or are full. By default, hlfsd validates <br>
the symbolic-link in the background. The -n option overrides
the meaning of the -c option, since no caching is
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o mount-options <br>
Mount options. Mount options which hlfsd will use to mount
itself on top of dirname. By default, mount-options is set
to &quot;ro&quot;. If the system supports symbolic-link <br>
caching, default options are set to
&quot;ro,nocache&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Print PID. Outputs the
process-id of hlfsd to standard output where it can be saved
into a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Version. Displays version
information to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x log-options <br>
Specify run-time logging options. The options are a comma
separated list chosen from: fatal, error, user, warn, info,
map, stats, all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Force hlfsd to run on systems
that cannot turn off the NFS attribute-cache. Use of this
option on those systems is discouraged, as it may result in
loss or mis-delivery <br>
of mail. The option is ignored on systems that can turn off
the attribute-cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D log-options <br>
Select from a variety of debugging options. Prefixing an
option with the string no reverses the effect of that
option. Options are cumulative. The most useful option is
<br>
all. Since this option is only used for debugging other
options are not documented here. A fuller description is
available in the program source. A SIGUSR1 sent to <br>
hlfsd will cause it to dump its internal password map to the
file /usr/tmp/hlfsd.dump.XXXXXX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P password-file <br>
Read the user-name, user-id, and home directory information
from the file password-file. Normally, hlfsd will use
getpwent(3) to read the password database. This option <br>
allows you to override the default database, and is useful
if you want to map users&rsquo; mail files to a directory
other than their home directory. Only the username, uid,
<br>
and home-directory fields of the file password-file are read
and checked. All other fields are ignored. The file
password-file must otherwise be compliant with Unix
Sys&acirc; <br>
tem 7 colon-delimited format passwd(4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/hlfs <br>
directory under which hlfsd mounts itself and manages the
symbolic link home.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.hlfsdir <br>
default sub-directory in the user&rsquo;s home directory, to
which the home symbolic link returned by hlfsd points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/hlfs <br>
directory to which home symbolic link returned by hlfsd
points if it is unable to verify the that user&rsquo;s home
directory is accessible.</p>
