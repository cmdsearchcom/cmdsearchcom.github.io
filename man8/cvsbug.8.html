<p>CVSBUG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual CVSBUG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvsbug - send problem report (PR) about CVS to a central
support site</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvsbug [ site ] [ -f problem-report ] [ -t mail-address ]
<br>
[ -P ] [ -L ] [ --request-id ] [ -v ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cvsbug is a tool used to submit problem reports (PRs) to a
central support site. In most cases the correct site will be
the default. This argument indicates the support site <br>
which is responsible for the category of problem involved.
Some sites may use a local address as a default. site values
are defined by using the aliases(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvsbug invokes an editor on a
problem report template (after trying to fill in some fields
with reasonable default values). When you exit the editor,
cvsbug sends the completed <br>
form to the Problem Report Management System (GNATS) at a
central support site. At the support site, the PR is
assigned a unique number and is stored in the GNATS database
<br>
according to its category and submitter-id. GNATS
automatically replies with an acknowledgement, citing the
category and the PR number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To ensure that a PR is handled
promptly, it should contain your (unique) submitter-id and
one of the available categories to identify the problem
area. (Use &lsquo;cvsbug -L&rsquo; to see a <br>
list of categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cvsbug template at your site
should already be customized with your submitter-id (running
&lsquo;install-sid submitter-id&rsquo; to accomplish this is
part of the installation procedures <br>
for cvsbug). If this hasn&rsquo;t been done, see your system
administrator for your submitter-id, or request one from
your support site by invoking &lsquo;cvsbug
--request-id&rsquo;. If your <br>
site does not distinguish between different user sites, or
if you are not affiliated with the support site, use
&lsquo;net&rsquo; for this field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The more precise your problem
description and the more complete your information, the
faster your support team can solve your problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f problem-report <br>
specify a file (problem-report) which already contains a
complete problem report. cvsbug sends the contents of the
file without invoking the editor. If the value for <br>
problem-report is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, then cvsbug reads from
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t mail-address <br>
Change mail address at the support site for problem reports.
The default mail-address is the address used for the default
site. Use the site argument rather than this <br>
option in nearly all cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P print the form specified by
the environment variable PR_FORM on standard output. If
PR_FORM is not set, print the standard blank PR template. No
mail is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L print the list of available
categories. No mail is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--request-id <br>
sends mail to the default support site, or site if
specified, with a request for your submitter-id. If you are
not affiliated with site, use a submitter-id of
net&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display the cvsbug version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: use cvsbug to submit
problem reports rather than mailing them directly. Using
both the template and cvsbug itself will help ensure all
necessary information will reach the <br>
support site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable EDITOR specifies the editor to
invoke on the template. <br>
default: vi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
PR_FORM is set, then its value is used as the file name of
the template for your problem-report editing session. You
can use this to start with a <br>
partially completed form (for example, a form with the
identification fields already completed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT
<br>
Problem reports have to be in a particular form so that a
program can easily manage them. Please remember the
following guidelines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; describe only
one problem with each problem report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For follow-up
mail, use the same subject line as the one in the automatic
acknowledgement. It consists of category, PR number and the
original synopsis line. This allows the <br>
support site to relate several mail messages to a particular
PR and to record them automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Please try to be
as accurate as possible in the subject and/or synopsis
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The subject and
the synopsis line are not confidential. This is because
open-bugs lists are compiled from them. Avoid confidential
information there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the GNU Info file
cvsbug.info or the document Reporting Problems With cvsbug
for detailed information on reporting problems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE,
ETC. <br>
Submit small code samples with the PR. Contact the support
site for instructions on submitting larger test cases and
problematic source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/tmp/p$$ copy of PR used in editing session <br>
/tmp/pf$$ copy of empty PR form, for testing purposes <br>
/tmp/pbad$$ file for rejected PRs</p>
