<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntfssecaudit - NTFS Security Data Auditing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntfssecaudit [options] args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where options is a combination
of : <br>
-a full auditing of security data (Linux only) <br>
-b backup ACLs <br>
-e setting extra backed-up parameters (in conjunction with
-s) <br>
-h displaying hexadecimal security descriptors saved in a
file <br>
-r recursing in a directory <br>
-s setting backed-up ACLs <br>
-u getting a user mapping proposal <br>
-v verbose (very verbose if set twice)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and args define the parameters
and the set of files acted upon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing secaudit with no args
will display a summary of available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntfssecaudit displays the ownership and permissions of a set
of files on an NTFS file system, and checks their
consistency. It can be started in terminal mode only (no
graphical <br>
user interface is available.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a volume is required, it
has to be unmounted, and the command has to be issued as
root. The volume can be either a block device (i.e. a disk
partition) or an image file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When acting on a directory or
volume, the command may produce a lot of information. It is
therefore advisable to redirect the output to a file or pipe
it to a text editor for <br>
examination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Below are the valid combinations of options and arguments
that ntfssecaudit accepts. All the indicated arguments are
mandatory and must be unique (if wildcards are used, they
<br>
must resolve to a single name.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h file <br>
Displays in an human readable form the hexadecimal security
descriptors saved in file. This can be used to turn a
verbose output into a very verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a[rv] volume <br>
Audits the volume : all the global security data on volume
are scanned and errors are displayed. If option -r is
present, all files and directories are also scanned and <br>
their relations to global security data are checked. This
can produce a lot of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not effective on
volumes formatted for old NTFS versions (pre NTFS 3.0). Such
volumes have no global security data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When errors are signalled, it is
advisable to repair the volume with an appropriate tool
(such as chkdsk on Windows.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-v] volume file <br>
Displays the security parameters of file : its interpreted
Linux mode (rwx flags in octal) and Posix ACL[1], its
security key if any, and its security descriptor if
ver&acirc; <br>
bose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r[v] volume directory <br>
displays the security parameters of all files and
subdirectories in directory : their interpreted Linux mode
(rwx flags in octal) and Posix ACL[1], their security key if
<br>
any, and their security descriptor if verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b[v] volume [directory] <br>
Recursively extracts to standard output the NTFS ACLs of
files in volume and directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s[ev] volume [backup-file] <br>
Sets the NTFS ACLS as indicated in backup-file or standard
input. The input data must have been created on Linux. With
option -e, also sets extra parameters (currently <br>
Windows attrib).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volume perms file <br>
Sets the security parameters of file to perms. Perms is the
Linux requested mode (rwx flags, expressed in octal form as
in chmod) or a Posix ACL[1] (expressed like in set&acirc;
<br>
facl -m). This sets a new ACL which is effective for Linux
and Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r[v] volume perms directory
<br>
Sets the security parameters of all files and subdirectories
in directory to perms. Perms is the Linux requested mode
(rwx flags, expressed in octal form as in chmod), or <br>
a Posix ACL[1] (expressed like in setfacl -m.) This sets new
ACLs which are effective for Linux and Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-v] mounted-file <br>
Displays the security parameters of mounted-file : its
interpreted Linux mode (rwx flags in octal) and Posix
ACL[1], its security key if any, and its security descriptor
<br>
if verbose output. This is a special case which acts on a
mounted file (or directory) and does not require being root.
The Posix ACL interpretation can only be displayed <br>
if the full path to mounted-file from the root of the global
file tree is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u[v] mounted-file <br>
Displays a proposed contents for a user mapping file, based
on the ownership parameters set by Windows on mounted-file,
assuming this file was created on Windows by the <br>
user who should be mapped to the current Linux user. The
displayed information has to be copied to the file
.NTFS-3G/UserMapping where .NTFS-3G is a hidden subdirectory
of <br>
the root of the partition for which the mapping is to be
defined. This will cause the ownership of files created on
that partition to be the same as the original mounted- <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
[1] provided the POSIX ACL option was selected at compile
time. A Posix ACL specification looks like
&quot;[d:]{ugmo}:[id]:[perms],...&quot; where id is a
numeric user or group id, and <br>
perms an octal digit or a set from the letters r, w and x.
<br>
Example :
&quot;u::7,g::5,o:0,u:510:rwx,g:500:5,d:u:510:7&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Audit the global security data on /dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfssecaudit -ar /dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display the ownership and
permissions parameters for files in directory /audio/music
on device /dev/sda5, excluding sub-directories :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfssecaudit /dev/sda5
/audio/music</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set all files in directory
/audio/music on device /dev/sda5 as writeable by owner and
read-only for everybody :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfssecaudit -r /dev/sda5 644
/audio/music</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
ntfssecaudit exits with a value of 0 when no error was
detected, and with a value of 1 when an error was
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
