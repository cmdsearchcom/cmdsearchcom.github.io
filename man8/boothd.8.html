<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
boothd - The Booth Cluster Ticket Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
boothd daemon [-SD] [-c config] [-l lockfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">booth list [-s site] [-c
config]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">booth grant [-s site] [-c

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Booth manages tickets which authorizes one of the cluster
sites located in geographically dispersed distances to run
certain resources. It is designed to be extend Pacemaker to
<br>
support geographically distributed clustering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is based on the RAFT
protocol, see eg.
https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHORT EXAMPLES <br>
# boothd daemon -D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># booth list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># booth grant ticket-nfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># booth revoke ticket-nfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c configfile <br>
Configuration to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can be a full path to a
configuration file, or a short name; in the latter case, the
directory /etc/booth and suffix .conf are added. Per default
booth is used, which results <br>
in the path /etc/booth/booth.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration name also
determines the name of the PID file - for the defaults,
/var/run/booth/booth.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Site address or name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special value
&rsquo;other&rsquo; can be used to specify the other <br>
site. Obviously, in that case, the booth configuration must
<br>
have exactly two sites defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F <br>
immediate grant: Don&acirc;t wait for unreachable sites to
relinquish the ticket. See the Booth ticket management
section below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be DANGEROUS. It
makes booth grant the ticket <br>
even though it cannot ascertain that unreachable sites
don&rsquo;t <br>
hold the same ticket. It is up to the user to make sure that
<br>
unreachable sites don&rsquo;t have this ticket as
granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w <br>
wait for the request outcome: The client waits for the final
outcome of grant or revoke request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
wait for ticket commit to CIB: The client waits for the
ticket commit to CIB (only for grant requests). If one or
more sites are unreachable, this takes the ticket expire
<br>
time (plus, if defined, the acquire-after time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Give a short usage output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Report version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
systemd mode: don&acirc;t fork. This is like -D but without
the debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Debug output/don&acirc;t daemonize. Increases the debug
output level; booth daemon remains in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l lockfile <br>
Use another lock file. By default, the lock file name is
inferred from the configuration file name. Normally not
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Whether the binary is called as boothd or booth
doesn&acirc;t matter; the first argument determines the mode
of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daemon <br>
Tells boothd to serve a site. The locally configured
interfaces are searched for an IP address that is defined in
the configuration. booth then runs in either /arbitrator/ or
<br>
/site/ mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client <br>
Booth clients can list the ticket information (see also
crm_ticket -L), and revoke or grant tickets to a site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The grant and, under certain
circumstances, revoke operations may take a while to return
a definite operation&acirc;s outcome. The client will wait
up to the network timeout value <br>
(by default 5 seconds) for the result. Unless the -w option
was set, in which case the client waits indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode the configuration
file is searched for an IP address that is locally
reachable, ie. matches a configured subnet. This allows to
run the client commands on <br>
another node in the same cluster, as long as the config file
and the service IP is locally reachable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if the booth
service IP is 192.168.55.200, and the local node has
192.168.55.15 configured on one of its network interfaces,
it knows which site it belongs to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -s to direct client to
connect to a different site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
boothd looks for the (locked) PID file and the UDP socket,
prints some output to stdout (for use in shell scripts) and
returns an OCF-compatible return code. With -D, a <br>
human-readable message is printed to STDERR as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">peers <br>
List the other boothd servers we know about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the type, name
(IP address), and the last time the server was heard from,
network statistics are also printed. The statistics are
split into two rows, the <br>
first one consists of counters for the sent packets and the
second one for the received packets. The first counter is
the total number of packets and descriptions of the <br>
other counters follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resends <br>
Packets which had to be resent because the recipient
didn&acirc;t acknowledge a message. This usually means that
either the message or the acknowledgement got lost. The
number of <br>
resends usually reflect the network reliability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error <br>
Packets which either couldn&acirc;t be sent, got truncated,
or were badly formed. Should be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid <br>
These packets contain either invalid or non-existing ticket
name or refer to a non-existing ticket leader. Should be
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authfail <br>
Packets which couldn&acirc;t be authenticated. Should be
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file must be identical on all sites and
arbitrators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A minimal file may look like
this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">site=&quot;192.168.201.100&quot;
<br>
site=&quot;192.168.202.100&quot; <br>
arbitrator=&quot;192.168.203.100&quot; <br>
ticket=&quot;ticket-db8&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments start with a hash-sign
(&rsquo;#&rsquo;). Whitespace at the start and end of the
line, and around the &rsquo;=&rsquo;, are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following key/value pairs
are defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port <br>
The UDP/TCP port to use. Default is 9929.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transport <br>
The transport protocol to use for Raft exchanges. Currently
only UDP is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients use TCP to communicate
with a daemon; Booth will always bind and listen to both UDP
and TCP ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authfile <br>
File containing the authentication key. The key can be
either binary or text. If the latter, then both leading and
trailing white space, including new lines, is ignored. This
<br>
key is a shared secret and used to authenticate both clients
and servers. The key must be between 8 and 64 characters
long and be readable only by the file owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxtimeskew <br>
As protection against replay attacks, packets contain
generation timestamps. Such a timestamp is not allowed to be
too old. Just how old can be specified with this parameter.
<br>
The value is in seconds and the default is 600 (10 minutes).
If clocks vary more than this default between sites and
nodes (which is definitely something you should fix) then
<br>
set this parameter to a higher value. The time skew test is
performed only in concert with authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site <br>
Defines a site Raft member with the given IP. Sites can
acquire tickets. The sites&rsquo; IP should be managed by
the cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arbitrator <br>
Defines an arbitrator Raft member with the given IP.
Arbitrators help reach consensus in elections and cannot
hold tickets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Booth needs at least three
members for normal operation. Odd number of members provides
more redundancy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site-user, site-group,
arbitrator-user, arbitrator-group <br>
These define the credentials boothd will be running
with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a (Pacemaker) site the booth
process will have to call crm_ticket, so the default is to
use hacluster:&rsquo;haclient&rsquo;; for an arbitrator this
user and group might not exists, <br>
so there we default to nobody:&rsquo;nobody&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ticket <br>
Registers a ticket. Multiple tickets can be handled by
single Booth instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the special ticket name
defaults to modify the defaults. The defaults stanza must
precede all the other ticket specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All times are in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expire <br>
The lease time for a ticket. After that time the ticket can
be acquired by another site if the ticket holder is not
reachable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acquire-after <br>
Once a ticket is lost, wait this time in addition before
acquiring the ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is to allow for the site
that lost the ticket to relinquish the resources, by either
stopping them or fencing a node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical delay might be 60
seconds, but ultimately it depends on the protected
resources and the fencing configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renewal-freq <br>
Set the ticket renewal frequency period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the network reliability is
often reduced over prolonged periods, it is advisable to try
to renew more often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before every renewal, if
defined, the command or commands specified in
before-acquire-handler is run. In that case the renewal-freq
parameter is effectively also the local <br>
cluster monitoring interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout <br>
After that time booth will re-send packets if there was an
insufficient number of replies. This should be long enough
to allow packets to reach other members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retries <br>
Defines how many times to retry sending packets before
giving up waiting for acks from other members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 10. Values lower than
3 are illegal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ticket renewals should allow for
this number of retries. Hence, the total retry time must be
shorter than the renewal time (either half the expire time
or renewal-freq):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout*(retries+1) &lt;
renewal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weights <br>
A comma-separated list of integers that define the weight of
individual Raft members, in the same order as the site and
arbitrator lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 0 for all; this means
that the order in the configuration file defines priority
for conflicting requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before-acquire-handler <br>
If set, this parameter specifies either a file containing a
program to be run or a directory where a number of programs
can reside. They are invoked before boothd tries to <br>
acquire or renew a ticket. If any of them exits with a code
other than 0, boothd relinquishes the ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus it is possible to ensure
whether the services and its dependencies protected by the
ticket are in good shape at this site. For instance, if a
service in the <br>
dependency-chain has a failcount of INFINITY on all
available nodes, the service will be unable to run. In that
case, it is of no use to claim the ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One or more arguments may follow
the program or directory location. Typically, there is at
least the name of one of the resources which depend on this
ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See below for details about
booth specific environment variables. The distributed
service-runnable script is an example which may be used to
test whether a pacemaker resource <br>
can be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attr-prereq <br>
Sites can have GEO attributes managed with the geostore(8)
program. Attributes are within ticket&acirc;s scope and may
be tested by boothd for additional control of ticket
failover <br>
(automatic) or ticket acquire (manual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes are typically used to
convey extra information about resources, for instance
database replication status. The attributes are commonly
updated by resource agents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attribute values are referenced
in expressions and may be tested for equality with the eq
binary operator or inequality with the ne operator. The
usage is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attr-prereq = &lt;grant_type&gt;
&lt;name&gt; &lt;op&gt; &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;grant_type&gt;:
&quot;auto&quot; | &quot;manual&quot; <br>
&lt;name&gt;: attribute name <br>
&lt;op&gt;: &quot;eq&quot; | &quot;ne&quot; <br>
&lt;value&gt;: attribute value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two grant types are auto for
ticket failover and manual for grants using the booth
client. Only in case the expression evaluates to true can
the ticket be granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not clear whether the
manual grant type has any practical use because, obviously,
this operation is anyway controlled by a human.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there can be no
guarantee on whether an attribute value is up to date, i.e.
if it actually reflects the current state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One example of a booth
configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transport = udp <br>
port = 9930</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># D-85774 <br>
site=&quot;192.168.201.100&quot; <br>
# D-90409 <br>
site=&quot;::ffff:192.168.202.100&quot; <br>
# A-1120 <br>
arbitrator=&quot;192.168.203.100&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ticket=&quot;ticket-db8&quot;
<br>
expire = 600 <br>
acquire-after = 60 <br>
timeout = 10 <br>
retries = 5 <br>
renewal-freq = 60 <br>
before-acquire-handler = /usr/share/booth/service-runnable
db8 <br>
attr-prereq = auto repl_state eq ACTIVE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTH TICKET MANAGEMENT <br>
The booth cluster guarantees that every ticket is owned by
only one site at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tickets must be initially
granted with the booth client grant command. Once it gets
granted, the ticket is managed by the booth cluster. Hence,
only granted tickets are managed <br>
by booth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the ticket gets lost, i.e.
that the other members of the booth cluster do not hear from
the ticket owner in a sufficiently long time, one of the
remaining sites will acquire <br>
the ticket. This is what is called ticket failover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the remaining members cannot
form a majority, then the ticket cannot fail over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A ticket may be revoked at any
time with the booth client revoke command. For revoke to
succeed, the site holding the ticket must be reachable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the ticket is
administratively revoked, it is not managed by the booth
cluster anymore. For the booth cluster to start managing the
ticket again, it must be again granted to <br>
a site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The grant operation, in case not
all sites are reachable, may get delayed for the ticket
expire time (and, if defined, the acquire-after time). The
reason is that the other booth <br>
members may not know if the ticket is currently granted at
the unreachable site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This delay may be disabled with
the -F option. In that case, it is up to the administrator
to make sure that the unreachable site is not holding the
ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the ticket is managed by
booth, it is dangerous to modify it manually using either
crm_ticket command or crm site ticket. Neither of these
tools is aware of booth and, <br>
consequently, booth itself may not be aware of any ticket
status changes. A notable exception is setting the ticket to
standby which is typically done before a planned
failover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Tickets are not meant to be moved around quickly, the
default expire time is 600 seconds (10 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">booth works with both IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">booth renews a ticket before it
expires, to account for possible transmission delays. The
renewal time, unless explicitly set, is set to half the
expire time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HANDLERS <br>
Currently, there&acirc;s only one external handler defined
(see the before-acquire-handler configuration item
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following environment
variables are exported to the handler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*BOOTH_TICKET <br>
The ticket name, as given in the configuration file. (See
ticket item above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*BOOTH_LOCAL <br>
The local site name, as defined in site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*BOOTH_CONF_PATH <br>
The path to the active configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*BOOTH_CONF_NAME <br>
The configuration name, as used by the -c commandline
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*BOOTH_TICKET_EXPIRES <br>
When the ticket expires (in seconds since 1.1.1970), or
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The handler is invoked with
positional arguments specified after it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/booth/booth.conf <br>
The default configuration file name. See also the -c
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/booth/authkey <br>
There is no default, but this is a typical location for the
shared secret (authentication key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/booth/ <br>
Directory that holds PID/lock files. See also the status
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RAFT IMPLEMENTATION <br>
In essence, every ticket corresponds to a separate Raft
cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A ticket is granted to the Raft
Leader which then owns (or keeps) the ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARBITRATOR MANAGEMENT <br>
The booth daemon for an arbitrator which typically
doesn&acirc;t run the cluster stack, may be started through
systemd or with /etc/init.d/booth-arbitrator, depending on
which init <br>
system the platform supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SysV init script starts a
booth arbitrator for every configuration file found in
/etc/booth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platforms running systemd can
enable and start every configuration separately using
systemctl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl enable
booth@&lt;configurationname&gt; <br>
# systemctl start booth@&lt;configurationname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemctl requires the
configuration name, even for the default name booth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 <br>
Success. For the status command: Daemon running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 (PCMK_OCF_UNKNOWN_ERROR) <br>
General error code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 (PCMK_OCF_NOT_RUNNING) <br>
No daemon process for that configuration active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Booth is tested regularly. See the README-testing file for
more information.</p>
