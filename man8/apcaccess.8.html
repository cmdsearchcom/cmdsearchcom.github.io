<p>APCACCESS(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
APCACCESS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apcaccess &acirc; retrieve status information from
apcupsd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apcaccess [-f &lt;config-file&gt;] [-h
&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]] [-p &lt;parameter-name&gt;]
[-u] [&lt;command&gt;] [&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apcaccess is a program which prints out the complete status
of most American Power Conversion Corp. (APC) UPSes provided
you have the apcupsd(8) daemon installed, properly
config&acirc; <br>
ured and running. It can access status information from any
APC UPS attached to the localhost or attached to any
computer on the network which is running apcuspd in NIS
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f configuration file of apcupsd
(default is usually /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hostname and port of apcupsd
to communicate with. The default hostname and port are
obtained from the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Report only the value of the
named parameter instead of all parameters and values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Remove units field for easier
parsing by scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;command&gt; An optional
command, unless a hostname is also being specified. The only
implemented command is status Shorthand for status
localhost:3551. This produces a full print&acirc; <br>
out of the available status information for the associated
UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;host&gt; An optional
hostname which may be a bare machine name, fully qualified
domain name or IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:&lt;port&gt; An optional port
number where a hostname argument has been specified. The
default is 3551, the official port number assigned by IANA
for the apcupsd NIS server. The <br>
default hostname and port are obtained from the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apcaccess uses apcupsd&rsquo;s
inbuilt Network Information Server (NIS) -- no relation to
Sun&rsquo;s NIS/YP service -- to obtain the current status
information from the UPS on the local or <br>
remote computer. It is therefore necessary to have the
following configuration directives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETSERVER on <br>
NISPORT 3551</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in the /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
configuration file so that the Network Information Server
will be accessible. Firewall rules for appropriate network
access may also be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS REPORT FORMAT <br>
The status report output format is simple ASCII. Generally
there is a single piece of information on each line of
output. The content varies based on the model of UPS being
used <br>
and, in some cases, the firmware version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Set out below is a sample of the status output which may be
generated for the specified UPS models.</p>
