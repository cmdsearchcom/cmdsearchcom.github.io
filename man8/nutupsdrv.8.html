<p>NUTUPSDRV(8) NUT Manual NUTUPSDRV(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nutupsdrv - generic manual for unified NUT drivers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nutupsdrv -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nutupsdrv [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nutupsdrv is not actually a driver. This is a combined man
page for the shared code that is the core of many drivers
within the Network UPS Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information on the specific
drivers, see their individual man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPS drivers provide a
communication channel between the physical UPS hardware and
the upsd(8) server. The driver is responsible for
translating the native protocol of the UPS to <br>
the common format used by the rest of this package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The core has two modes of
operation which are determined by the command line switches.
In the normal mode, the driver will periodically poll the
UPS for its state and parameters. <br>
The results of this command is presented to upsd. The driver
will also handle setting variables and instant commands if
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The driver can also instruct the
UPS to shut down the load, possibly after some delay. This
mode of operation is intended for cases when it is known
that the UPS is running out <br>
of battery power and the systems attached must be turned off
to ensure a proper reboot when power returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
You probably don&acirc;t want to use any of these options
directly. You should use upsdrvctl(8) to control your
drivers, and ups.conf(5) to configure them. The rest of this
manual <br>
describes options and parameters that generally are not
needed by normal users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h <br>
Display a help message without doing anything else. This
will also list possible values for -x in that driver, and
other help text that the driver&acirc;s author may have
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a id <br>
Autoconfigure this driver using the id section of
ups.conf(5). This argument is mandatory when calling the
driver directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Raise the debugging level. Use this multiple times to see
more details. Running a driver in debug mode will prevent it
from backgrounding after startup. It will keep on <br>
logging information to the console until it receives a
SIGINT (usually Ctrl-C) or SIGTERM signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The level of debugging needed
depends both on the driver and the problem you&acirc;re
trying to diagnose. Therefore, first explain the problem you
have with a driver to a <br>
developer/maintainer, before sending them debugging output.
More often than not, if you just pick a level, the output
may be either too limited or too verbose to be of any <br>
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Raise log level threshold. Use this multiple times to log
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debugging comment above also
applies here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Set the poll interval for the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Print only version information, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L <br>
Print a parseable list of driver variables. Mostly useful
for configuration wizard programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
(&quot;Kill&quot; power) Forced shutdown mode. The UPS will
power off the attached load, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should use upsdrvctl
shutdown whenever possible instead of calling this
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r directory <br>
The driver will chroot(2) to directory during
initialization. This can be useful when securing
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the state path,
many systems will require /dev/null to exist within
directory for this to work. The serial ports are opened
before the chroot call, so you do <br>
not need to create them inside the jail. In fact, it is
somewhat safer if you do not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username <br>
If started as root, the driver will setuid(2) to the user id
associated with username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not specify this value
and start it as root, the driver will switch to the default
value that was compiled into the code. This is typically
nobody, and is far from <br>
ideal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x var=val <br>
Define a variable called var with the value of var in the
driver. This varies from driver to driver - see the specific
man pages for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is like setting var=val in
ups.conf(5), but -x overrides any settings from that
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Information about the startup process is printed to stdout.
Additional messages after that point are available in the
syslog. After upsd(8) starts, the UPS clients such as <br>
upsc(8) can be used to query the status of an UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM CONTROL <br>
You should always use upsdrvctl(8) to control the drivers.
While drivers can be started by hand for testing purposes,
it is not recommended for production use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
ups.conf <br>
Required configuration file. This contains all details on
which drivers to start and where the hardware is
attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Some of the drivers may have bugs. See their manuals for
more information.</p>
