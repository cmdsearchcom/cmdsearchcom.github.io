<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ca-legacy - Manage the system configuration for legacy CA
certificates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ca-legacy [COMMAND]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ca-legacy(8) is used to include or exclude a set of legacy
Certificate Authority (CA) certificates in the
system&acirc;s list of trusted CA certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of CA certificates and
trust flags included in the ca-certificates package are
based on the decisions made by Mozilla.org according to the
Mozilla CA policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Occasionally, removal or
distrust decisions made by Mozilla.org might be incompatible
with the requirements or limitations of some applications
that also use the CA certificates <br>
list in the Linux environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ca-certificates package
might keep some CA certificates included and trusted by
default, as long as it is seen necessary by the maintainers,
despite the fact that they have <br>
been removed by Mozilla. These certificates are called
legacy CA certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The general requirements to keep
legacy CA certificates included and trusted might change
over time, for example if functional limitations of software
packages have been <br>
resolved. Future versions of the ca-certificates package
might reduce the set of legacy CA certificates that are
included and trusted by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ca-legacy(8) command can be
used to override the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mechanisms to individually
trust or distrust CA certificates as described in
update-ca-trust(8) still apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
check <br>
The current configuration will be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
Configure the system to use the default configuration, as
recommended by the package maintainers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable <br>
Configure the system to explicitly disable legacy CA
certificates. Using this configuration, the system will use
the set of included and trusted CA certificates as released
<br>
by Mozilla.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install <br>
The configuration file will be read and the system
configuration will be set accordingly. This command is
executed automatically during upgrades of the
ca-certificates <br>
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/pki/ca-trust/ca-legacy.conf <br>
A configuration file that will be used and modified by the
ca-legacy command. The contents of the configuration file
will be read on package upgrades.</p>
