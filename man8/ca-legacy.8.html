ca-legacy - Manage the system configuration for legacy CA certificates

<b>ca-legacy</b> [<i>COMMAND</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
ca-legacy(8) is used to include or exclude a set of legacy Certificate Authority
  (CA) certificates in the system&#x2019;s list of trusted CA certificates.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The list of CA certificates and trust flags included in the ca-certificates
  package are based on the decisions made by Mozilla.org according to the
  Mozilla CA policy.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Occasionally, removal or distrust decisions made by Mozilla.org might be
  incompatible with the requirements or limitations of some applications that
  also use the CA certificates list in the Linux environment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The ca-certificates package might keep some CA certificates included and trusted
  by default, as long as it is seen necessary by the maintainers, despite the
  fact that they have been removed by Mozilla. These certificates are called
  legacy CA certificates.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The general requirements to keep legacy CA certificates included and trusted
  might change over time, for example if functional limitations of software
  packages have been resolved. Future versions of the ca-certificates package
  might reduce the set of legacy CA certificates that are included and trusted
  by default.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The ca-legacy(8) command can be used to override the default behaviour.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The mechanisms to individually trust or distrust CA certificates as described in
  update-ca-trust(8) still apply.
