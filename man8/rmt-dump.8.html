<p>RMT(8) System management commands RMT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rmt - remote magtape protocol module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rmt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rmt is a program used by the remote dump(8), restore(8) or
tar(1) programs in manipulating a magnetic tape drive
through an interprocess communication connection. Rmt is
nor&acirc; <br>
mally started up with an rexec(3) or rcmd(3) call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmt program accepts requests
specific to the manipulation of magnetic tapes, performs the
commands, then responds with a status indication. All
responses are in ASCII and in <br>
one of the following two forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Successful commands have
responses of: <br>
Anumber</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where number is an ASCII
representation of a decimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsuccessful commands are
responded to with: <br>
Eerror-number0rror-message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where error-number is one of the
possible error numbers described in intro(2) and
error-message is the corresponding error string as printed
from a call to perror(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol is comprised of the
following commands, which are sent as indicated - no spaces
are supplied between the command and its arguments, or
between its arguments, and <br>
indicates that a newline should be supplied:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Odevice0ode <br>
Open the specified device using the indicated mode. Device
is a full pathname and mode is an ASCII representation of a
decimal number suitable for passing to open(2). If <br>
a device had already been opened, it is closed before a new
open is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cdevice <br>
Close the currently open device. The device specified is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lwhence0ffset <br>
Perform an lseek(2) operation using the specified
parameters. The response value is that returned from the
lseek call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcount <br>
Write data onto the open device. Rmt reads count bytes from
the connection, aborting if a premature end-of-file is
encountered. The response value is that returned from <br>
the write(2) call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rcount <br>
Read count bytes of data from the open device. If count
exceeds the size of the data buffer (10 kilobytes), it is
truncated to the data buffer size. Rmt then performs the
<br>
requested read(2) and responds with Acount-readif the read
was successful; otherwise an error in the standard format is
returned. If the read was successful, the data <br>
read is then sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ioperation0ount <br>
Perform a MTIOCOP ioctl(2) command using the specified
parameters. The parameters are interpreted as the ASCII
representations of the decimal values to place in the mt_op
<br>
and mt_count fields of the structure used in the ioctl call.
The return value is the count parameter when the operation
is successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By issuing the I-10command, a
client will specify that he is using the VERSION 1
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a VERSION 0 client, the
operation parameter is the platform mt_op value (could be
different if the client and the rmt server are on two
different platforms). For a <br>
VERSION 1 client, the operation parameter is standardized as
below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Issue a MTWEOF command (write
count end-of-file records).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Issue a MTFSF command (forward
space over count file marks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Issue a MTBSF command
(backward space over count file marks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Issue a MTFSR command (forward
space count inter-record gaps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Issue a MTBSR command
(backward space count inter-record gaps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Issue a MTREW command
(rewind).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Issue a MTOFFL command (rewind
and put the drive offline).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 Issue a MTNOP command (no
operation, set status only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ioperation0ount <br>
Perform an extended MTIOCOP ioctl(2) command using the
specified parameters. The parameters are interpreted as the
ASCII representations of the decimal values to place in <br>
the mt_op and mt_count fields of the structure used in the
ioctl call. The return value is the count parameter when the
operation is successful. The possible operations <br>
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Issue a MTCACHE command
(switch cache on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Issue a MTNOCACHE command
(switch cache off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Issue a MTRETEN command
(retension the tape).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Issue a MTERASE command (erase
the entire tape).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Issue a MTEOM command
(position to end of media).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Issue a MTNBSF command
(backward space count files to BOF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Return the status of the open
device, as obtained with a MTIOCGET ioctl call. If the
operation was successful, an &acirc;ack&acirc; is sent with
the size of the status buffer, then <br>
the status buffer is sent (in binary, which is non-portable
between different platforms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssub-command <br>
This is a replacement for the previous S command, portable
across different platforms. If the open device is a magnetic
tape, return members of the magnetic tape status <br>
structure, as obtained with a MTIOCGET ioctl call. If the
open device is not a magnetic tape, an error is returned. If
the MTIOCGET operation was successful, the numerical <br>
value of the structure member is returned in decimal. The
following sub commands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T return the content of the
structure member mt_type which contains the type of the
magnetic tape device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D return the content of the
structure member mt_dsreg which contains the &quot;drive
status register&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E return the content of the
structure member mt_erreg which contains the &quot;error
register&quot;. This structure member must be retrieved
first because it is cleared after <br>
each MTIOCGET ioctl call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R return the content of the
structure member mt_resid which contains the residual count
of the last I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F return the content of the
structure member mt_fileno which contains the file number of
the current tape position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B return the content of the
structure member mt_blkno which contains the block number of
the current tape position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f return the content of the
structure member mt_flags which contains MTF_ flags from the
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b return the content of the
structure member mt_bf which contains the optimum blocking
factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other command causes rmt to
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All responses are of the form described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
People should be discouraged from using this for a remote
file access protocol.</p>

maintainer is Stelian Pop &lt;stelian@popies.net&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
The dump/restore backup suit is available from
&lt;http://dump.sourceforge.net&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The rmt command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
