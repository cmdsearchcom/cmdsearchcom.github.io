<p>SGE_CA(8) Grid Engine Administrative Commands
SGE_CA(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
util/sgeCA/sge_ca - Grid Engine CSP Support control
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
sge_ca command [command options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sge_ca controls a simple Grid Engine Certificate Authority
that is used for the special Certificate Security Protocol
(CSP) mode. CSP mode improves the security behavior of Grid
<br>
Engine by enabling OpenSSL secured communication channels
and X509v3 certificates for authentication. In addition it
is possible to export the key material or to create JKS
key&acirc; <br>
stores for the JMX connector. There follows a list of
possible commands and command options to give an overview of
what functionality is available. For further details about
<br>
every command refer to the COMMAND DETAILS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND OVERVIEW <br>
-help Show usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-init [command options] <br>
Create the infrastructure for a new Grid Engine Certificate
Authority with its corresponding files and directories, and
a set of keys and certificates for the Grid Engine <br>
daemon, root and admin user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-req | -verify cert | -sign |

[command options] <br>
Echo the $CATOP or $CALOCALTOP directory. This command is
usually run as root on the qmaster host after a CA
infrastructure has been created. If &quot;-cadir&quot;,
&quot;-catop&quot; or <br>
&quot;-calocaltop&quot; are set, the corresponding
directories are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-usercert user file | -user
u:g:e | -sdm_daemon u:g:e [command options] <br>
Create certificates and keys for a bunch of users contained
in user file, a single user, or SDM daemon in the form
u:g:e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pkcs12 user | -sdm_pkcs12 g |
-sys_pkcs12 [command options] <br>
Export the certificate and key for user user or SDM daemon g
in PKCS12 format and to export the Grid Engine daemon
certificate and key in PKCS12 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-userks | -ks user | -sysks
[command options] <br>
Create keystore for all users with a certificate and key,
the keystore for a single user user, or the keystore
containing the Grid Engine daemon certificate and key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-renew user | -renew_ca |
-renew_sys | -renew_sdm g [command options] <br>
Renew the certificate for user user, for the CA, for the
Grid Engine daemon, or the SDM daemon with common name g.
The old certificate remains valid until it expires. <br>
NB. The option of this name was re-named to -rrenew in Grid
Engine 8.1.9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rrenew user | -rrenew_ca |
-rrenew_sys | -rrenew_sdm g [command options] <br>
Renew the certificate for user user, for the CA, for the
Grid Engine daemon, or the SDM daemon with common name g,
and revoke the old ones (updating the revocation list). <br>
NB. This requires unique_subject=no in sge_ssl_template.cnf,
which is the default for new installations, but might not be
set for old ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-revoke cert <br>
Revoke the certificate cert, which should be an actual PEM
file, updating the revocation list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above, &quot;command

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND DETAILS <br>
sge_ca -init [-cadir dir] [-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir]
[-adminuser admin] [-days num days] <br>
The -init command creates a new Grid Engine certificate
authority and its corresponding files. Usually &quot;sge_ca
-init&quot; is run by user root on the master host. If the
<br>
options -adminuser, -cadir, -calocaltop, and -catop are not
used, and the Grid Engine environment variables SGE_ROOT,
SGE_CELL and SGE_QMASTER_PORT are set, the CA direc&acirc;
<br>
tories are created in the following locations:
$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sgeCA (can be overruled by -catop
dir or -cadir dir) <br>
/var/lib/sgeCA/port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT/$SGE_CELL or
/var/lib/sgeCA/sge_qmaster/$SGE_CELL (can be overruled by
-calocaltop dir or -cadir dir). <br>
The following information must be delivered for the site:
two letter country code, state, location, e.g. city or your
building code, organization (e.g. your company name), <br>
organizational unit, e.g. your department, and email address
of the CA administrator (you!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certificates and keys are
generated for the CA itself, the Grid Engine daemon,
installation user (usually root), and finally for the admin
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How and where the certificates
and keys are created can be influenced additionally by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-days days <br>
Change the time of validity of the certificates to number of
days instead of 365 days</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sha1 Change the message digest
algorithm from MD5 to SHA-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-encryptkey <br>
Encrypt the generated keys with a passphrase</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adminuser user <br>
Use user as admin user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cahost host <br>
Use host as the CA master host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-cadir dir] [-catop dir]
[-calocaltop dir] <br>
Set $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP to dir to use something other
than the Grid Engine default directories. Either -cadir dir
has to be specified to replace $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP <br>
by the same directory or -catop dir for $CATOP and
-calocaltop dir for $CALOCALTOP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -user u:g:e [-cadir dir]
[-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] [-days
days] <br>
Generate user certificate and keys for u:g:e, where u is the
user id, g is the &quot;common name&quot; (real name of the
user), and e is the user&rsquo;s email address. By default
the <br>
certificate is valid for 365 days or for days, as specified
with -days days. This command is usually run as user root on
the qmaster host. $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP may be <br>
overruled by -cadir, -catop, and -calocaltop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -sdm_daemon u:g:e <br>
Generate daemon certificate and keys for u:g:e with
parameters and lifetime as for -user. This command is
usually run as user root on the qmaster host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -usercert user file
[-cadir dir] [-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser
admin] [-days days] [-encryptkey] [-sha1] <br>
Usually sge_ca -usercert user file is run as user root on
the master host. The argument user file contains a list of
users in the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eddy:Eddy Smith:eddy@griders.org
<br>
sarah:Sarah Miller:sarah@griders.org <br>
leo:Leo Lion:leo@griders.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the fields separated by
colon are: <br>
Unix user:Gecos field:email address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -renew user [-cadir dir]
[-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] [-days
days] <br>
Renew the certificate for user. By default the certificate
is extended for 365 days or for days specified with -days
days. If the value is negative the certificate becomes <br>
invalid. This command is usually run as user root on the
qmaster host. $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP may be overruled by
-cadir, -catop, and -calocaltop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -renew_ca [-cadir dir]
[-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] [-days
days] <br>
Renew the CA certificate, similarly to -renew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -renew_sys [-cadir dir]
[-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] [-days
days] <br>
Renew the Grid Engine daemon certificate, similarly to
-renew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -renew_sdm g [-cadir dir]
[-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] [-days
days] <br>
Renew the SDM daemon certificate of g, where g is the common
name of the daemon, similarly to -renew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -pkcs12 user [-pkcs12pwf
file] [-pkcs12dir dir] [-cadir dir] [-catop dir]
[-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] <br>
Export certificate and key of user user (Unix user name) in
PKCS12 format. This command is usually run as user root on
the qmaster host. If -pkcs12pwf file is used, the <br>
file and the corresponding key will be encrypted with the
password in file. If -pkcs12dir dir is used, the output file
is written into dir/user.p12 instead of ./user.p12. <br>
$CATOP and $CALOCALTOP may be overruled by -cadir, -catop,
and -calocaltop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -sys_pkcs12 [-pkcs12pwf
file] [-pkcs12dir dir] [-cadir dir] [-catop dir]
[-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] <br>
Export certificate and key of Grid Engine daemon in PKCS12
format, similarly to -pkcs12.</p>

file] [-pkcs12dir dir] [-cadir dir] [-catop dir]
[-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] <br>
Export certificate and key of SDM daemon with common name g
in PKCS12 format,, similarly to -renew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -ks user [-ksout file]
[-kspwf file] [-cadir dir] [-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir]
[-adminuser admin] <br>
Create a keystore containing certificate and key of user
user in JKS format where user is the Unix user name. This
command is usually run as user root on the qmaster host.
<br>
If -kspwf file is used the keystore and the corresponding
key will be encrypted with the password in file. The -ksout
file option specifies the keystore file that is cre&acirc;
<br>
ated. If the -ksout file option is missing the default
location for the keystore is
$CALOCALTOP/userkeys/user/keystore. This command is usually
invoked by sge_ca -userks. <br>
A prerequisite is a valid JAVA_HOME environment variable
setting. $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP may be overruled by -cadir,
-catop and -calocaltop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -userks [-kspwf file]
[-cadir dir] [-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser
admin] <br>
Generate a keystore in JKS format for all users having a key
and certificate. This command is usually run as user root on
the qmaster host. If -kspwf file is used, the <br>
keystore and the corresponding key will be encrypted with
the password in file. The keystore files are created in
$CALOCALTOP/userkeys/user/keystore. This command is run <br>
after user certificates and keys have been created with
0ercert userfile or if any of the certificates have been
renewed. $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP may be overruled by <br>
-cadir, -catop and -calocaltop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -sysks [-kspwf file]
[-cadir dir] [-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser
admin] <br>
Generate a keystore containing the Grid Engine daemon
certificate and key in JKS format. This command is usually
run as user root on the qmaster host. If -kspwf file is <br>
used the keystore and the corresponding key will be
encrypted with the password in file. The keystore file is
created in $CALOCALTOP/private/keystore. $CATOP and
$CALO&acirc; <br>
CALTOP may be overruled by -cadir, -catop and
-calocaltop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -print cert <br>
Print a PEM-format certificate cert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -printkey key <br>
Print a PEM-format key key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -printcrl crl <br>
Print a PEM-format certificate revocation list crl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -req [-cadir dir] [-catop
dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] [-days days]
[-encryptkey] [-sha1] [-outdir dir] <br>
Create a private key and a certificate request for the
calling user. These are created as newkey.pem and newreq.pem
in the current working directory. If the option -out&acirc;
<br>
dir dir is specified in addition the files are created in
dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sge_ca -sign [-cadir dir]
[-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] [-adminuser admin] [-days
days] [-encryptkey] [-sha1] [-outdir dir] <br>
Sign a certificate request. The CA certificate under $CATOP
(default $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sgeCA), and CA key from
$CALOCALTOP (default /var/sgaCA/{port$SGE_QMAS&acirc; <br>
TER_PORT|sge_qmaster}/$SGE_CELL) are used for the signature.
If $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP are set to a different directory
the information there is used. The certificate is <br>
created as newcert.pem in the current working directory or
in dir if the option -outdir dir has been specified. In
addition the option &quot;-days number of days&quot; can be
speci&acirc; <br>
fied to change the default validity from 365 to number of
days.</p>

[-catop dir] [-calocaltop dir] <br>
Run by a user to copy their certificate and key on the
master host to
$HOME/.sge/port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT/$SGE_CELL/certs/cert.pem
and the corresponding private key to <br>
$HOME/.sge/port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT/$SGE_CELL/private/key.pem,
which are used instead of the files in $CATOP and
$CALOCALTOP. The command is only recommended for testing
pur&acirc; <br>
poses, or where $HOME is on a secure shared file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
# sge_ca -init -cadir /tmp -sha1 -encryptkey -days 31 <br>
Create a CA infrastructure in /tmp with a certificate
validity of 31 days using SHA-1 instead of MD5 as message
digest. The keys are encrypted and a passphrase has to be
<br>
entered during the creation of the different keys or during
signing a certificate with the created CA key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sge_ca -usercert
/tmp/myusers.txt -cadir /tmp <br>
/tmp/myusers.txt contains <br>
user1:My User:user1@myorg.org <br>
and user1 is a valid Unix user account. Create a key and
certificate for user1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sge_ca -userks -cadir /tmp
<br>

default Grid Engine cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
The command must usually be called with Grid Engine root
permissions on the master host. For more details on the
permission requirements consult the detailed description for
the <br>
different commands above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
sge_ca creates a file tree starting in $CATOP and
$CALOCALTOP. The default for $CATOP is usually
$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sgeCA and for $CALOCALTOP <br>

/var/lib/sgeCA/{port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT|sge_qmaster}/$SGE_CELL
where the subpaths beginning with $ expand to the content of
the corresponding environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition there may optionally
exist the user certificate in
$HOME/.sge/port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT/$SGE_CELL/certs/cert.pem
and the corresponding private key in <br>
$HOME/.sge/port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT/$SGE_CELL/private/key.pem
