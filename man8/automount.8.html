<p>AUTOMOUNT(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
AUTOMOUNT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
automount - manage autofs mount points</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
automount [options] [master_map]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The automount program is used to manage mount points for
autofs, the inlined Linux automounter. automount works by
reading the auto.master(5) map and sets up mount points for
<br>
each entry in the master map allowing them to be
automatically mounted when accessed. The file systems are
then automatically umounted after a period of
inactivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Print brief help on program usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pid-file <br>
Write the pid of the daemon to the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;seconds&gt;, --timeout
&lt;seconds&gt; <br>
Set the global minimum timeout, in seconds, until
directories are unmounted. The default is 10 minutes.
Setting the timeout to zero disables umounts completely. The
in&acirc; <br>
ternal program default is 10 minutes, but the default
installed configuration overrides this and sets the timeout
to 5 minutes to be consistent with earlier autofs
releas&acirc; <br>
es.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;seconds&gt;,
--negative-timeout &lt;seconds&gt; <br>
Set the default timeout for caching failed key lookups. The
default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Enables logging of general status and progress messages for
all autofs managed mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Enables logging of general status and progress messages as
well as debugging messages for all autofs managed
mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dvariable=value, --define
variable=value <br>
Define a global macro substitution variable. Global
definitions are over-ridden macro definitions of the same
name specified in mount entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
Run the daemon in the foreground and log to stderr instead
of syslog.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r,
--random-multimount-selection <br>
Enables the use of ramdom selection when choosing a host
from a list of replicated servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --dumpmaps [&lt;map type&gt;
&lt;map name&gt;] <br>
With no parameters, list information about the configured
automounter maps, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the dumpmaps option is given
and is followed by two parameters, &quot;&lt;map type&gt;
&lt;map name&gt;&quot; then simple &quot;&lt;key,
value&gt;&quot; pairs that would be read in by a map read
are printed <br>
to stdout if the given map type and map name are found in
the map configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the map is an LDAP map and
there is more than one map of same name in different base
dns only the first map encountered by autofs will be listed.
Similarly, if the map <br>
is a file map and there is more than one map of the same
name in different directories, only the first map
encountered will be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the map type is an old style
multi-map and any one of the map names in the multi-map
entry matches the given map name the entries that would be
used by autofs for the <br>
whole multi-map will be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --global-options <br>
Allows the specification of global mount options used for
all master map entries. These options will either replace or
be appened to options given in a master map entry <br>
depending on the APPEND_OPTIONS configuration setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display the version number, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --set-log-priority priority
path [path,...] <br>
Set the daemon log priority to the specified value. Valid
values include the numbers 0-7, or the strings emerg, alert,
crit, err, warning, notice, info, or debug. Log <br>
level debug will log everything, log levels info, warn (or
warning), or notice with enable the daemon verbose logging.
Any other level will set basic logging. Note that <br>
enabling debug or verbose logging in the autofs global
configuration will override dynamic log level changes. For
example, if verbose logging is set in the configuration <br>
then attempting to set logging to basic logging, by using
alert, crit, err or emerg won&rsquo;t stop the verbose
logging. However, setting logging to debug will lead to
every&acirc; <br>
thing (debug logging) being logged witch can then also be
disabled, returning the daemon to verbose logging. This
option can be specified to change the logging priority of
<br>
an already running automount process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path argument corresponds to
the automounted path name as specified in the master
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --dont-check-daemon <br>
Don&rsquo;t check if the daemon is currently running (see
NOTES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --force <br>
Force an unlink umount of existing mounts under autofs
managed mount points during startup. This can cause problems
for processes with working directories within these <br>
mounts (see NOTES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
automount takes one optional argument, the name of the
master map to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">master_map <br>
Location for autofs master map that defines autofs managed
mount points and the mount maps they will use. The default
is auto.master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If the automount daemon catches a USR1 signal, it will
umount all currently unused autofs managed mounted file
systems and continue running (forced expire). If it catches
the <br>
TERM signal it will umount all unused autofs managed mounted
file systems and exit if there are no remaining busy file
systems. If autofs has been compiled with the option to
ig&acirc; <br>
nore busy mounts on exit it will exit leaving any busy
mounts in place otherwise busy file systems will not be
umounted and autofs will not exit. Alternatively, if autofs
has <br>
been compiled with the option to enable forced shutdown then
a USR2 signal to the daemon will cause all mounts to be
umounted and any busy mounts to be forcibly umounted,
includ&acirc; <br>
ing autofs mount point directories (summary execution). Note
that the forced umount is an unlink operation and the actual
umount will not happen in the kernel until active file <br>
handles are released. The daemon also responds to a HUP
signal which triggers an update of the maps for each mount
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any autofs mount point
directories are busy when the daemon is sent an exit signal
the daemon will not exit. The exception to this is if autofs
has been built with configure <br>
options to either ignore busy mounts at exit or force umount
at exit. If the ignore busy mounts at exit option is used
the filesystems will be left in a catatonic
(non-function&acirc; <br>
al) state and can be manually umounted when they become
unused. If the force umount at exit option is used the
filesystems will be umounted but the mount will not be
released by <br>
the kernel until they are no longer in use by the processes
that held them busy. If automount managed filesystems are
found mounted when autofs is started they will be recovered
<br>
unless they are no longer present in the map in which case
they need to umounted manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option to disable the
check to see if the daemon is already running is used be
aware that autofs currently may not function correctly for
certain types of automount maps. <br>
The mounts of the seperate daemons might interfere with one
another. The implications of running multiple daemon
instances needs to be checked and tested before we can say
this <br>
is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option to force an unlink
of mounts at startup is used then processes whose working
directory is within unlinked automounted directories will
not get the correct pwd from <br>
the system. This is because, after the mount is unlinked
from the mount tree, anything that needs to walk back up the
mount tree to construct a path, such as getcwd(2) and the
<br>
proc filesystem /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/cwd, cannot work because
the point from which the path is constructed has been
detached from the mount tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve fixed everything I know
about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation could be
better.</p>
