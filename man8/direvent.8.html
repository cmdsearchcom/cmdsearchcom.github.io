<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GNU Direvent monitors a set of directories on the file
system and reacts when a file system event occurs in any of
them. Directories and events to monitor are specified in the
<br>
configuration file. When an event occurs the utility reacts
by invoking an external command configured for that
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following generic events can
be monitored by the program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create A file was created;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete A file was deleted;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write A file was written to;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrib File attributes have
changed. This includes changes in the file ownership, mode,
link count, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the interface
provided by the underlying operating system direvent can
trace various system-dependent events, which may offer a
better resolution. These events are <br>
described in the section SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A watcher is a configuration
entity within direvent which associates a set of directories
with a set of events and instructs the program to run a
specified external command when <br>
any of these events occur in any of these directories. This
external command (called a handler) can obtain information
about the event that triggered its execution from the <br>
environment variables, or from its command line (see the
HANDLER ENVIRONMENT section below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Watchers are declared in the
program configuration file direvent.conf, located in the
system configuration directory (normally /etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative configuration
file can be used, by supplying its pathname as the command
line argument (CONFIG parameter in the SYNOPSIS section
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --debug <br>
Increase debug verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --facility=FACILITY <br>
Log under this syslog facility. Allowed values for FACILITY
are a decimal number or any of the following symbolic names:
auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, ftp, local0 through <br>
local7, lpr, mail, news, user, and uucp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -F 0 directs logging
to the standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
Run in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --include=DIR <br>
Add DIR to the include search path. When looking for a file
to be included in the #include (#include_once) statement,
direvent scans first the directories given with -I <br>
options (in the same order as given on the command line),
and then the directories in the standard include search
path. The latter is defined at compile time and can be <br>
inspected in the output of the --help option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l PRIO <br>
While connected to a terminal direvent outputs its
diagnostics messages to stderr and, if configured, to
syslog. This option limits the amount of information output
to <br>
the standard error. PRIO is one of the following priorities
(in order of increasing severity): debug, info, notice,
warning, err, crit, alert, emerg. When this option is <br>
given, only messages with the priority level equal to or
greater than PRIO will be duplicated on the standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pidfile=FILE <br>
Write PID to FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --self-test=COMMAND <br>
Run in self-test mode. In this mode, direvent starts
external command supplied as the argument to this option and
continues running until the command exits. If the com&acirc;
<br>
mand terminates normally, direvent exits with the code
returned by it. If the command terminates on SIGHUP,
direvent exits with code 0. If it terminates on another
sig&acirc; <br>
nal, direvent exits with code 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND can include any command
line options or arguments, provided that it is properly
quoted. It is invoked as /bin/sh -c COMMAND in the
environment of the parent <br>
direvent process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macro variable
$self_test_pid holds the PID of the COMMAND (see section
MACRO EXPANSION in direvent.conf(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --lint <br>
Check configuration file for errors and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user=USER <br>
Run as this USER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Informative options cause the
program to display the requested piece of information and
exit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Output a terse help summary and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --config-help <br>
Describe configuration file syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Show available command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print program version and copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The default configuration file is /etc/direvent.conf. If a
file name is supplied as an argument to the program, that
file will be read instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file syntax is
discussed in detail in direvent.conf(5). This section
provides only a short description of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three types of comments are
allowed: inline comments, that begin with a # or // and
extend to the end of line, and multi-line comments, which
comprise everything enclosed between <br>
/* and */. Comments and empty lines are ignored. Whitespace
characters are ignored as well, except as they serve to
separate tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A token is a string of
consecutive characters from the following classes:
alphanumeric characters, underscores, dots, asteriscs,
slashes, semicolons, commercial at&rsquo;s, and dashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other sequence of characters
must be enclosed in double quotation marks in order to
represent a single token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adjacent quoted strings are
concatenated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration statements consist
of a keyword and value separated by any amount of whitespace
and is terminated with a semicolon. A block statement is a
collection of statements <br>
enclosed in curly braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most important configuration
statement is watcher. It is defined as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watcher { <br>
path PATHNAME [recursive [LEVEL]]; <br>
event EVENT-LIST; <br>
command COMMAND-LINE; <br>
user NAME; <br>
timeout NUMBER; <br>
environ ENV-SPEC; <br>
option STRING-LIST; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each watcher statement instructs
direvent to monitor the events listed in EVENT-LIST
occurring in the directories specified by PATHNAMEs in path
statements (any number of path <br>
statements can be given). When any such event is detected,
the COMMAND-LINE will be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each directory defined with the
recursive keyword will be watched recursively. This means
that for each subdirectory created in it, direvent will
install a watcher similar to <br>
that of its parent directory. The optional LEVEL can be used
to set up a cut-off nesting level, beyond which the
recursive operation is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of statements are
optional. The user statement can be used to execute the
COMMAND-LINE as the user NAME (provided, of course, that
direvent is started with root privi&acirc; <br>
leges). The timeout specifies the maximum amount of time (in
seconds) the command is allowed to run. It defaults to 5.
The environ statement modifies the command environment <br>
(see the following section). Finally, the option statement
supplies additional options. It can be used, for example, to
divert the command&rsquo;s output to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program&rsquo;s logging is
controlled by the debug and syslog statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug NUMBER; <br>
Sets the debugging level to NUMBER -- an integer value
between 0 and 3. Zero is the default and means the debugging
is disabled. The bigger the NUMBER the more detailed <br>
debugging information will be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syslog statement controls
the syslog logging:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syslog { <br>
facility STRING; <br>
tag STRING; <br>
print-priority BOOL; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pidfile statement instructs
the program to write its PID to <br>
the named file after disconnecting from the controlling
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HANDLER ENVIRONMENT <br>
The handler to be executed on an event is defined by the
command statement in the watcher configuration block (see
direvent.conf(5)). Before executing, the following
operations <br>
are performed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The current working directory
is set to the directory where the event occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the environ statement is
present in the watcher, the environment is modified
according to its rules. See the description of the environ
statement in direvent.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The standard input is
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the stdout option is
supplied, the standard output is captured and redirected to
the syslog. Otherwise it is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the stderr option is
supplied, the standard error is captured and redirected to
the syslog. Otherwise it is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All file descriptors above 2 are
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Macro variables are expanded.
See the section MACRO EXPANSION in direvent.conf(5). For
example, if the handler is about to be executed for the
write event on the file <br>
somefile, and the command definition was:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command &quot;/libexec/handler
-e &rsquo;$genev_name&rsquo; -f
&rsquo;$file&rsquo;&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the resulting command line
will be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/libexec/handler -e
&rsquo;open&rsquo; -f &rsquo;somefile&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Word splitting is performed
on the resulting command line. The first word is treated as
the pathname of the program to be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The program is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES <br>
Direvent relies on the event monitoring API provided by the
kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux <br>
On Linux the program uses inotify(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum number of watches a
user process can have is controlled by the
fs.inotify.max_user_watches system variable. Normally it is
set to 8192, which is quite enough for <br>
most purposes. However, if you monitor a big number or
directories and/or are using recursive watchers, you may
need more watches. In that case, use sysctl(8) to raise the
<br>
limit, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysctl -w
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=16384</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most GNU/Linux distributions
provide the file /etc/sysctl.conf which can be used to set
this variable on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following system-dependent
events are defined on systems that use inotify(7):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS A file was accessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTRIB A file&rsquo;s metadata
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLOSE_WRITE <br>
A writable file was closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLOSE_NOWRITE <br>
An unwritable file closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATE A file was created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE A file was deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODIFY A file was modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOVED_FROM <br>
A file was moved into a monitored directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOVED_TO <br>
A file was moved out from a monitored directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPEN A file was opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSD <br>
When compiled on BSD systems (including Darwin), direvent
uses kqueue(2). This interface needs an open file handle for
each file in a monitored directory, which means that the
<br>
number of watchers is limited by the maximum number of open
files. Use ulimit -n NUM to raise it to a higher number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since it operates on files,
kqueue does not provide direct support for the create
generic event. Direvent works over this disadvantage by
keeping track of the contents of each <br>
monitored directory and rescanning it each time a WRITE
system event is reported for it. It then generates the open
event for each file that appeared after the last scan. Such
<br>
a rescan can consume considerable time if a directory has a
very large number of files in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following system-dependent
events are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE The unlink() system call
was called on the monitored file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITE A write occurred on the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTEND The file was
extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTRIB The file attributes have
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINK The link count on the file
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RENAME The file was renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVOKE Access to the file was
revoked via revoke(2) or the underlying file system was
unmounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darwin <br>
Essentially the same as BSD. The main difference compared to
Linux and BSD is that on Darwin the watchers are set after
disconnecting from the controlling terminal, because
Dar&acirc; <br>
win lacks the rfork(2) call and the event queue cannot be
inherited by the child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
0 Successful termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Command line usage error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Another error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
direvent.conf(5), inotify(7), kqueue(2).</p>
