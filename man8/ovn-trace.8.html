<p>ovn-trace(8) Open vSwitch Manual ovn-trace(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ovn-trace - Open Virtual Network logical network tracing
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ovn-trace [options] datapath microflow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-trace [options] --detach</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility simulates packet forwarding within an OVN
logical network. It can be used to run through
&lsquo;&lsquo;what-if&acirc;&acirc; scenarios: if a packet
originates at a logical port, what will <br>
happen to it and where will it ultimately end up? Users
already familiar with the Open vSwitch ofproto/trace command
described in ovs-vswitch(8) will find ovn-trace to be a
simi&acirc; <br>
lar tool for logical networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-trace works by reading the
Logical_Flow and other tables from the OVN southbound
database (see ovn-sb(5)). It simulates a packet&acirc;s path
through logical networks by repeatedly <br>
looking it up in the logical flow table, following the
entire tree of possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-trace simulates only the OVN
logical network. It does not simulate the physical elements
on which the logical network is layered. This means that,
for example, it is unimpor&acirc; <br>
tant how VMs are distributed among hypervisors, or whether
their hypervisors are functioning and reachable, so
ovn-trace will yield the same results regardless. There is
one <br>
important exception: ovn-northd, the daemon that generates
the logical flows that ovn-trace simulates, treats logical
ports differently based on whether they are up or down. <br>
Thus, if you see surprising results, ensure that the ports
involved in a simulation are up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest way to use
ovn-trace is to provide datapath and microflow arguments on
the command line. In this case, it simulates the behavior of
a single packet and exits. For an <br>
alternate usage model, see Daemon Mode below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The datapath argument specifies
the name of a logical datapath. Acceptable names are the
name from the northbound Logical_Switch or Logical_Router
table, the UUID of a record <br>
from one of those tables, or the UUID of a record from the
southbound Datapath_Binding table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The microflow argument describes
the packet whose forwarding is to be simulated, in the
syntax of an OVN logical expression, as described in
ovn-sb(5), to express constraints. <br>
The parser understands prerequisites; for example, if the
expression refers to ip4.src, there is no need to explicitly
state ip4 or eth.type == 0x800.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reasonable L2 behavior, the
microflow should include at least inport and eth.dst, plus
eth.src if port security is enabled. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inport == &quot;lp11&quot;
&amp;&amp; eth.src == 00:01:02:03:04:05 &amp;&amp; eth.dst
== ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reasonable L3 behavior,
microflow should also include ip4.src and ip4.dst (or
ip6.src and ip6.dst) and ip.ttl. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inport == &quot;lp111&quot;
&amp;&amp; eth.src == f0:00:00:00:01:11 &amp;&amp; eth.dst
== 00:00:00:00:ff:11 <br>
&amp;&amp; ip4.src == 192.168.11.1 &amp;&amp; ip4.dst ==
192.168.22.2 &amp;&amp; ip.ttl == 64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&acirc;s an ARP microflow
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inport == &quot;lp123&quot; <br>
&amp;&amp; eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff &amp;&amp; eth.src
== f0:00:00:00:01:11 <br>
&amp;&amp; arp.op == 1 &amp;&amp; arp.sha ==
f0:00:00:00:01:11 &amp;&amp; arp.spa == 192.168.1.11 <br>
&amp;&amp; arp.tha == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff &amp;&amp; arp.tpa
== 192.168.2.22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovn-trace will reject erroneous
microflow expressions, which beyond syntax errors fall into
two categories. First, they can be ambiguous. For example,
tcp.src == 80 is ambiguous <br>
because it does not state IPv4 or IPv6 as the Ethernet type.
ip4 &amp;&amp; tcp.src &gt; 1024 is also ambiguous because
it does not constrain bits of tcp.src to particular values.
Second, <br>
they can be contradictory, e.g. ip4 &amp;&amp; ip6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
ovn-trace supports the three different forms of output, each
described in a separate section below. Regardless of the
selected output format, ovn-trace starts the output with a
<br>
line that shows the microflow being traced in OpenFlow
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detailed Output <br>
The detailed form of output is also the default form. This
form groups output into sections headed up by the ingress or
egress pipeline being traversed. Each pipeline lists each
<br>
table that was visited (by number and name), the ovn-northd
source file and line number of the code that added the flow,
the match expression and priority of the logical flow <br>
that was matched, and the actions that were executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The execution of OVN logical
actions naturally forms a &lsquo;&lsquo;control
stack&acirc;&acirc; that resembles that of a program in
conventional programming languages such as C or Java.
Because the <br>
next action that calls into another logical flow table for a
lookup is a recursive construct, OVN
&lsquo;&lsquo;programs&acirc;&acirc; in practice tend to
form deep control stacks that, displayed in the <br>
obvious way using additional indentation for each level,
quickly use up the horizontal space on all but the widest
displays. To make detailed output more readable, without
loss <br>
of generality, ovn-trace omits indentation for
&lsquo;&lsquo;tail recursion,&acirc;&acirc; that is, when
next is the last action in a logical flow, it does not
indent details of the next table lookup <br>
more deeply. Output still uses indentation when it is needed
for clarity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVN
&lsquo;&lsquo;programs&acirc;&acirc; traces also tend to
encounter long strings of logical flows with match
expression 1 (which matches every packet) and the single
action next;. These are uninter&acirc; <br>
esting and merely clutter output, so ovn-trace omits them
entirely even from detailed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following excerpt from
detailed ovn-trace output shows a section for a packet
traversing the ingress pipeline of logical datapath ls1 with
ingress logical port lp111. The <br>
packet matches a logical flow in table 0 (aka
ls_in_port_sec_l2) with priority 50 and executes next(1); to
pass to table 1. Tables 1 through 11 are trivial and
omitted. In table <br>
12 (aka ls_in_l2_lkup), the packet matches a flow with
priority 50 based on its Ethernet destination address and
the flow&acirc;s actions output the packet to the
lrp11-attachement <br>
logical port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ingress(dp=&quot;ls1&quot;,
inport=&quot;lp111&quot;) <br>
--------------------------------- <br>
0. ls_in_port_sec_l2: inport == &quot;lp111&quot;, priority
50 <br>
next(1); <br>
12. ls_in_l2_lkup: eth.dst == 00:00:00:00:ff:11, priority 50
<br>
outport = &quot;lrp11-attachment&quot;; <br>
output;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Summary Output <br>
Summary output includes the logical pipelines visited by a
packet and the logical actions executed on it. Compared to
the detailed output, however, it removes details of tables
<br>
and logical flows traversed by a packet. It uses a format
closer to that of a programming language and does not
attempt to avoid indentation. The summary output equivalent
to the <br>
above detailed output fragment is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ingress(dp=&quot;ls1&quot;,
inport=&quot;lp111&quot;) { <br>
outport = &quot;lrp11-attachment&quot;; <br>
output; <br>
... <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimal Output <br>
Minimal output includes only actions that modify packet data
(not including OVN registers or metadata such as outport)
and output actions that actually deliver a packet to a
log&acirc; <br>
ical port (excluding patch ports). The operands of actions
that modify packet data are displayed reduced to constants,
e.g. ip4.dst = reg0; might be show as ip4.dst = <br>
192.168.0.1; if that was the value actually loaded. This
yields output even simpler than the summary format. (Users
familiar with Open vSwitch may recognize this as similar in
<br>
spirit to the datapath actions listed at the bottom of
ofproto/trace output.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The minimal output format
reflects the externally seen behavior of the logical
networks more than it does the implementation. This makes
this output format the most suitable for <br>
use in regression tests, because it is least likely to
change when logical flow tables are rearranged without
semantic change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DAEMON MODE <br>
If ovn-trace is invoked with the --detach option (see Daemon
Options, below), it runs in the background as a daemon and
accepts commands from ovs-appctl (or another JSON-RPC <br>
client) indefinitely. The currently supported commands are
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace [options] datapath
microflow <br>
Traces microflow through datapath and replies with the
results of the trace. Accepts the options described under
Trace Options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit Causes ovn-trace to
gracefully terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Trace Options <br>
--detailed <br>
--summary <br>
--minimal <br>
These options control the form and level of detail in
ovn-trace output. If more than one of these options is
specified, all of the selected forms are output, in the
order <br>
listed above, each headed by a banner line. If none of these
options is given, --detailed is the default. See Output,
above, for a description of each kind of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all <br>
Selects all three forms of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ovs[=remote] <br>
Makes ovn-trace attempt to obtain and display the OpenFlow
flows that correspond to each OVN logical flow. To do so,
ovn-trace connects to remote (by default, <br>
unix:/var/run/openvswitch/br-int.mgmt) over OpenFlow and
retrieves the flows. If remote is specified, it must be an
active OpenFlow connection method described in <br>
ovs-ofctl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make the best use of the
output, it is important to understand the relationship
between logical flows and OpenFlow flows.
ovn-architecture(7), under Architectural Physi&acirc; <br>
cal Life Cycle of a Packet, describes this relationship.
Keep in mind the following points:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ovn-trace
currently shows all the OpenFlow flows to which a logical
flow corresponds, even though an actual packet ordinarily
matches only one of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some logical
flows can map to the Open vSwitch &lsquo;&lsquo;conjunctive
match&acirc;&acirc; extension (see ovs-fields(7)). Currently
ovn-trace cannot display the flows with conjunction <br>
actions that effectively produce the conj_id match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some logical
flows may not be represented in the OpenFlow tables on a
given hypervisor, if they could not be used on that
hypervisor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some OpenFlow
flows do not correspond to logical flows, such as OpenFlow
flows that map between physical and logical ports. These
flows will never show up in a trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When ovn-trace
omits uninteresting logical flows from output, it does not
look up the corresponding OpenFlow flows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daemon Options <br>
--pidfile[=pidfile] <br>
Causes a file (by default, program.pid) to be created
indicating the PID of the running process. If the pidfile
argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with /,
<br>
then it is created in /var/run/openvswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --pidfile is not specified,
no pidfile is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overwrite-pidfile <br>
By default, when --pidfile is specified and the specified
pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process,
the daemon refuses to start. Specify --overwrite-pid&acirc;
<br>
file to cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --pidfile is not specified,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach <br>
Runs this program as a background process. The process
forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes the
standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of <br>
disabling logging to the console), and changes its current
directory to the root (unless --no-chdir is specified).
After the child completes its initialization, the parent
<br>
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--monitor <br>
Creates an additional process to monitor this program. If it
dies due to a signal that indicates a programming error
(SIGABRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGPIPE, <br>
SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ) then the monitor process
starts a new copy of it. If the daemon dies or exits for
another reason, the monitor process exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is normally used
with --detach, but it also functions without it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-chdir <br>
By default, when --detach is specified, the daemon changes
its current working directory to the root directory after it
detaches. Otherwise, invoking the daemon from a <br>
carelessly chosen directory would prevent the administrator
from unmounting the file system that holds that
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying --no-chdir suppresses
this behavior, preventing the daemon from changing its
current working directory. This may be useful for collecting
core files, since it <br>
is common behavior to write core dumps into the current
working directory and the root directory is not a good
directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect when
--detach is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-self-confinement <br>
By default this daemon will try to self-confine itself to
work with files under well-known directories whitelisted at
build time. It is better to stick with this default <br>
behavior and not to use this flag unless some other Access
Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
other access control implementations that are typi&acirc;
<br>
cally enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC),
self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
itself and hence should not be considered as a full
confinement <br>
strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional
layer of security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user=user:group <br>
Causes this program to run as a different user specified in
user:group, thus dropping most of the root privileges. Short
forms user and :group are also allowed, with cur&acirc; <br>
rent user or group assumed, respectively. Only daemons
started by the root user accepts this argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, daemons will be
granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before
dropping root privileges. Daemons that interact with a
datapath, such as ovs-vswitchd, will <br>
be granted two additional capabilities, namely CAP_NET_ADMIN
and CAP_NET_RAW. The capability change will apply even if
the new user is root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, this option is not
currently supported. For security reasons, specifying this
option will cause the daemon process not to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging Options <br>
-v[spec] <br>
--verbose=[spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively. (If
--detach is specified, the daemon <br>
closes its standard file descriptors, so logging to the
console will have no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be filtered <br>
out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8) for a
definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
--log-file is also specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
--verbose=dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vPATTERN:destination:pattern
<br>
--verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vFACILITY:facility <br>
--verbose=FACILITY:facility <br>
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can
be one of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, local0, <br>
local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or local7. If
this option is not specified, daemon is used as the default
for the local system syslog and local0 is used while <br>
sending a message to the target provided via the
--syslog-target option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file[=file] <br>
Enables logging to a file. If file is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
file name used if file is omitted is /var/log/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/program.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-target=host:port <br>
Send syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the
system syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-method=method <br>
Specify method as how syslog messages should be sent to
syslog daemon. The following forms are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libc, to use the
libc syslog() function. This is the default behavior.
Downside of using this options is that libc adds fixed
prefix to every message before it is <br>
actually sent to the syslog daemon over /dev/log UNIX domain
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file, to
use a UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify
arbitrary message format with this option. However, rsyslogd
8.9 and older versions use <br>
hard coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain
socket use. If you want to use arbitrary message format with
older rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to <br>
localhost IP address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; udp:ip:port, to
use a UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use
arbitrary message format also with older rsyslogd. When
sending syslog messages over UDP <br>
socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for
example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
the specified UDP port, accidental iptables <br>
rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and
there are some security considerations that apply to UDP
sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PKI Options <br>
PKI configuration is required to use SSL for the connection
to the database (and the switch, if --ovs is specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p privkey.pem <br>
--private-key=privkey.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
identity for outgoing SSL connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cert.pem <br>
--certificate=cert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies
the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the <br>
certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections
will use to verify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cacert.pem <br>
--ca-cert=cacert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for
verifying certificates presented to this program by SSL
peers. (This may be the same certificate that SSL peers <br>
use to verify the certificate specified on -c or
--certificate, or it may be a different one, depending on
the PKI design in use.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C none <br>
--ca-cert=none <br>
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
peers. This introduces a security risk, because it means
that certificates cannot be verified to be those of <br>
known trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Options <br>
--db database <br>
The OVSDB database remote to contact. If the OVN_SB_DB
environment variable is set, its value is used as the
default. Otherwise, the default is unix:/var/run/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/db.sock, but this default is unlikely to be useful
outside of single-machine OVN test environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help <br>
Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints version information to the console.</p>
