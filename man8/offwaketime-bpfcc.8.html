<p>offwaketime(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
offwaketime(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
offwaketime - Summarize blocked time by kernel off-CPU stack
+ waker stack. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
offwaketime [-h] [-u] [-p PID] [-v] [-f] [duration]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program shows kernel stack traces and task names that
were blocked and &quot;off-CPU&quot;, along with the stack
traces and task names for the threads that woke them, and
the total <br>
elapsed time from when they blocked to when they were woken
up. This combines the summaries from both the offcputime and
wakeuptime tools. The time measurement will be very <br>
similar to off-CPU time, however, off-CPU time may include a
little extra time spent waiting on a run queue to be
scheduled. The combined stacks, task names, and total time
is <br>
summarized in kernel context for efficiency, using an eBPF
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output summary will further
help you identify reasons why threads were blocking, and
quantify the time from when they were blocked to woken up.
This spans all types of <br>
blocking activity: disk I/O, network I/O, locks, page
faults, swapping, sleeping, involuntary context switches,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is complementary to CPU
profiling (e.g., CPU flame graphs) which shows the time
spent on-CPU. This shows the time spent blocked off-CPU, and
the output, especially the -f <br>
format, can be used to generate an &quot;off-wake time flame
graph&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stack depth is currently
limited to 20 for the off-CPU stack, and 10 for the waker
stack, and the stack traces are kernel mode only. Check for
newer versions where this <br>
should be improved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This currently only works on
x86_64. Check for future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Output stacks in folded
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Only trace user threads (not
kernel threads).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Show raw addresses for
non-folded mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PID Trace this process ID
only (filtered in-kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duration <br>
Duration to trace, in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Trace all thread blocking events, and summarize (in-kernel)
by kernel off-CPU stack trace, waker stack traces, task
names, and total blocked time: <br>
# offwaketime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace for 5 seconds only: <br>
# offwaketime 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace for 5 seconds, and emit
output in folded stack format (suitable for flame graphs),
user-mode threads only: <br>
# offwaketime -fu 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace PID 185 only: <br>
# offwaketime -p 185</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERHEAD <br>
This summarizes unique stack trace pairs in-kernel for
efficiency, allowing it to trace a higher rate of events
than methods that post-process in user space. The stack
trace and <br>
time data is only copied to user space once, when the output
is printed. While these techniques greatly lower overhead,
scheduler events are still a high frequency event, as they
<br>
can exceed 1 million events per second, and so caution
should still be used. Test before production use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the overhead is still a
problem, take a look at the MINBLOCK_US tunable in the code.
If your aim is to chase down longer blocking events, then
this could be increased to fil&acirc; <br>
ter shorter blocking events, further lowering overhead.</p>
