<p>APGD(8) User Manual APGD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apgd - server that generates several random passwords</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apgd [-a algorithm] [-M mode] [-E char_string] [-n
num_of_pass] [-m min_pass_len] [-x max_pass_len] [-r
dictfile] [-b filter_file] [-p min_substr_len] [-k] [-t]
[-l]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apgd program is a server that supports Password Generation
Protocol described in RFC972. It uses several password
generation algorithms (currently two) and a built-in pseudo
<br>
random number generator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apgd is normally invoked by the
Internet superserver (see inetd (8)) for requests to connect
to the pwdgen port (pwdgen port is 129 according to RFC1700
) as indicated by the <br>
/etc/services file (see services (5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default algorithm is
pronounceable password generation algorithm designed by
Morrie Gasser and described in &quot;A Random Word Generator
For Pronounceable Passwords&quot; National Techni&acirc;
<br>
cal Information Service (NTIS) AD-A-017676. The original
paper is very old and had never been put online, so I have
to use NIST implementation described in FIPS-181.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another algorithm is simple
random character generation algorithm, but it uses four
user-defined symbol sets to produce random password. It
means that user can choose type of <br>
symbols that should appear in password. Symbol sets are:
numeric symbol set (0,...,9) , capital letters symbol set
(A,...,Z) , small letters symbol set (a,...,z) and special
sym&acirc; <br>
bols symbol set (#,@,!,...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in pseudo random number
generator is an implementation of algorithm described in
Appendix C of ANSI X9.17 or RFC1750 with exception that it
uses CAST or SHA-1 instead of <br>
Triple DES. It uses local time with precision of
microseconds (see gettimeofday(2)) and /dev/random (if
available) to produce initial random seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apgd also have the ability to
check generated password quality using dictionary. You can
use this ability if you specify command-line option -r
dictfile or -b filtername where <br>
dictfile is dictionary file name and filtername is the name
of Bloom filter file. In that dictionary you may place words
(one per line) that should not appear as generated
pass&acirc; <br>
words. For example: user names common words, etc. You even
can use one of the dictionaries that come with dictionary
password crackers. Bloom filter file should be created with
<br>
apgbfm(1) utility included in apg distribution. In future
releases I plan to implement some other techniques to check
passwords just to make life easier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apgd has the ability log user
password generation activity and internal debug information.
It does this using <br>
facility = daemon <br>
priority = info for user password generation activity
logging <br>
priority = debug for internal debug information <br>
See the syslogd(8) and syslog.conf(5) man pages for
information on how to configure your syslog daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Password generation modes options <br>
-a algorithm <br>
use algorithm for password generation. <br>
0 - (default) pronounceable password generation <br>
1 - random character password generation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num_of_pass <br>
generate num_of_pass number of passwords. Default is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m min_pass_len <br>
generate password with minimum length min_pass_len. If
min_pass_len &gt; max_pass_len then max_pass_len =
min_pass_len. Default minimum password length is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x max_pass_len <br>
generate password with maximum length max_pass_len If
min_pass_len &gt; max_pass_len then max_pass_len =
min_pass_len. Default maximum password length is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M mode <br>
Use symbolsets specified with mode for password generation.
mode is a text string consisting of characters S, s, N, n,
C, c, L, l. Where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S generator must use special
symbol set for every generated password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s generator should use special
symbol set for password generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N generator must use numeral
symbol set for every generated password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n generator should use numeral
symbol set for password generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C generator must use capital
symbol set for every generated password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c generator should use capital
symbol set for password generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L generator must use small
letters symbol set for every generated password (always
present if pronounceable password generation algorithm is
used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l generator should use small
letters symbol set for password generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R,r not supported any more. Use
-E char_string option instead. <br>
mode can not be more than 4 characters in length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: <br>
Usage of L, M, N, C will slow down password generation
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
-M sncl or -M SNCL or -M Cn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E char_string <br>
exclude characters in char_string from password generation
process (in pronounceable password generation mode you can
not exclude small letters). To include special sym&acirc;
<br>
bols that can be recognized by shell (apostrophe, quotes,
dollar sign, etc.) in char_string use the backslashed
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command apgd -a 1 -M n -n 3 -m 8
-e 23456789 will generate a set of passwords that will look
like this <br>
10100110 <br>
01111000 <br>
11011101</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command apgd -a 1 -M nc -n 3 -m
26 -e GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ will generate a set of passwords
that will look like this <br>
16A1653CD4DE5E7BD9584A3476 <br>
C8F78E06944AFD57FB9CB882BC <br>
8C8DF37CD792D36D056BBD5002</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password quality control options
<br>
-k check every generated password using cracklib. To use
this ability you must enable cracklib support during
programm building.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r dictfile <br>
check generated passwords for their appearance in
dictfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b filter_file <br>
check generated passwords for their appearance in
filter_file. filter_file should be created with apgbfm(1)
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p min_substr_len <br>
this option tells apg(1) to check every substring of the
generated password for appearance in filter_file. If any of
such substrings would be found in the filter_file then <br>
generated password would be rejected and apg(1) will
generate another one. min_substr_len is specifies minimum
substring length to check. This option is active only if
<br>
-b option is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password output options <br>
-l spell genetated passwords. Useful when you want to read
generated password by telephone. <br>
WARNING: Think twice before read your password by phone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t print pronunciation for
generated pronounceable password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULT OPTIONS <br>
apgd -a 0 -M sncl -n 6 -x 10 -m 8 (new style)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
On successful completion of its task, apgd will complete
with exit code 0. An exit code of -1 indicates an error
occurred. Textual errors are written to the syslogd (8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All textual info is written to the syslogd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
None.</p>

None. If you&rsquo;ve found one, please send bug description
to the author.</p>
