<p>IFTOP(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual IFTOP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
iftop - display bandwidth usage on an interface by host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
iftop -h | [-nNpblBP] [-i interface] [-f filter code] [-F
net/mask] [-G net6/mask6]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
iftop listens to network traffic on a named interface, or on
the first interface it can find which looks like an external
interface if none is specified, and displays a table of <br>
current bandwidth usage by pairs of hosts. iftop must be run
with sufficient permissions to monitor all network traffic
on the interface; see pcap(3) for more information, but <br>
on most systems this means that it must be run as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, iftop will look up
the hostnames associated with addresses it finds in packets.
This can cause substantial traffic of itself, and may result
in a confusing display. <br>
You may wish to suppress display of DNS traffic by using
filter code such as not port domain, or switch it off
entirely, by using the -n option or by pressing r when the
program <br>
is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, iftop counts all IP
packets that pass through the filter, and the direction of
the packet is determined according to the direction the
packet is moving across the <br>
interface. Using the -F option it is possible to get iftop
to show packets entering and leaving a given network. For
example, iftop -F 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 will analyse packets
<br>
flowing in and out of the 10.* network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some other filter ideas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">not ether host ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
<br>
Ignore ethernet broadcast packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port http and not host
webcache.example.com <br>
Count web traffic only, unless it is being directed through
a local web cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmp How much bandwidth are
users wasting trying to figure out why the network is
slow?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print a summary of usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Don&rsquo;t do hostname
lookups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not resolve port number to
service names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Run in promiscuous mode, so
that traffic which does not pass directly through the
specified interface is also counted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Turn on port display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Display and count datagrams
addressed to or from link-local IPv6 addresses. The default
is not to display that address category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Don&rsquo;t display bar
graphs of traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m limit <br>
Set the upper limit for the bandwidth scale. Specified as a
number with a &rsquo;K&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo; or
&rsquo;G&rsquo; suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Display bandwidth rates in
bytes/sec rather than bits/sec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface <br>
Listen to packets on interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filter code <br>
Use filter code to select the packets to count. Only IP
packets are ever counted, so the specified code is evaluated
as (filter code) and ip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F net/mask <br>
Specifies an IPv4 network for traffic analysis. If
specified, iftop will only include packets flowing in to or
out of the given network, and packet direction is
deter&acirc; <br>
mined relative to the network boundary, rather than to the
interface. You may specify mask as a dotted quad, such as
/255.255.255.0, or as a single number specifying the <br>
number of bits set in the netmask, such as /24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G net6/mask6 <br>
Specifies an IPv6 network for traffic analysis. The value of
mask6 can be given as a prefix length or as a numerical
address string for more compound bitmasking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config file <br>
Specifies an alternate config file. If not specified, iftop
will use ~/.iftoprc if it exists. See below for a
description of config files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t text output mode <br>
Use text interface without ncurses and print the output to
STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
When running, iftop uses the whole screen to display network
usage. At the top of the display is a logarithmic scale for
the bar graph which gives a visual indication of
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main part of the display
lists, for each pair of hosts, the rate at which data has
been sent and received over the preceding 2, 10 and 40
second intervals. The direction of <br>
data flow is indicated by arrows, &lt;= and =&gt;. For
instance,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo.example.com =&gt;
bar.example.com 1Kb 500b 100b <br>
&lt;= 2Mb 2Mb 2Mb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shows, on the first line,
traffic from foo.example.com to bar.example.com; in the
preceding 2 seconds, this averaged 1Kbit/s, around half that
amount over the preceding 10s, and <br>
a fifth of that over the whole of the last 40s. During each
of those intervals, the data sent in the other direction was
about 2Mbit/s. On the actual display, part of each line <br>
is inverted to give a visual indication of the 10s average
of traffic. You might expect to see something like this
where host foo is making repeated HTTP requests to bar,
which <br>
is sending data back which saturates a 2Mbit/s link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the pairs of hosts
responsible for the most traffic (10 second average) are
displayed at the top of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the bottom of the display,
various totals are shown, including peak traffic over the
last 40s, total traffic transferred (after filtering), and
total transfer rates averaged <br>
over 2s, 10s and 40s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE / DEST AGGREGATION <br>
By pressing s or d while iftop is running, all traffic for
each source or destination will be aggregated together. This
is most useful when iftop is run in promiscuous mode, or
<br>
is run on a gateway machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORT DISPLAY <br>
S or D toggle the display of source and destination ports
respectively. p will toggle port display on/off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY TYPE <br>
t cycles through the four line display modes; the default
2-line display, with sent and received traffic on separate
lines, and 3 1-line displays, with sent, received, or total
<br>
traffic shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY ORDER <br>
By default, the display is ordered according to the 10s
average (2nd column). By pressing 1, 2 or 3 it is possible
to sort by the 1st, 2nd or 3rd column. By pressing &lt; or
&gt; <br>
the display will be sorted by source or destination hostname
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY FILTERING <br>
l allows you to enter a POSIX extended regular expression
that will be used to filter hostnames shown in the display.
This is a good way to quickly limit what is shown on the
<br>
display. Note that this happens at a much later stage than
filter code, and does not affect what is actually captured.
Display filters DO NOT affect the totals at the bottom of
<br>
the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAUSE DISPLAY / FREEZE ORDER
<br>
P will pause the current display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o will freeze the current screen
order. This has the side effect that traffic between hosts
not shown on the screen at the time will not be shown at
all, although it will be <br>
included in the totals at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCROLL DISPLAY <br>
j and k will scroll the display of hosts. This feature is
most useful when the display order is frozen (see
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTER CODE <br>
f allows you to edit the filter code whilst iftop running.
This can lead to some unexpected behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
iftop can read its configuration from a config file. If the
-c option is not specified, iftop will attempt to read its
configuration from ~/.iftoprc, if it exists. Any command
<br>
line options specified will override settings in the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The config file consists of one
configuration directive per line. Each directive is a name
value pair, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface: eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sets the network interface. The
following config directives are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface: if <br>
Sets the network interface to if.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dns-resolution: (yes|no) <br>
Controls reverse lookup of IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port-resolution: (yes|no) <br>
Controls conversion of port numbers to service names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter-code: bpf <br>
Sets the filter code to bpf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-bars: (yes|no) <br>
Controls display of bar graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">promiscuous: (yes|no) <br>
Puts the interface into promiscuous mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port-display:
(off|source-only|destination-only|on) <br>
Controls display of port numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link-local: (yes|no) <br>
Determines displaying of link-local IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hide-source: (yes|no) <br>
Hides source host names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hide-destination: (yes|no) <br>
Hides destination host names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use-bytes: (yes|no) <br>
Use bytes for bandwidth display, rather than bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort:
(2s|10s|40s|source|destination) <br>
Sets which column is used to sort the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line-display:
(two-line|one-line-both|one-line-sent|one-line-received)
<br>
Controls the appearance of each item in the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-totals: (yes|no) <br>
Shows cumulative total for each item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log-scale: (yes|no) <br>
Use a logarithmic scale for bar graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-bandwidth: bw <br>
Fixes the maximum for the bar graph scale to bw, e.g.
&quot;10M&quot;. Note that the value has to always be in
bits, regardless if the option to display in bytes has been
chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">net-filter: net/mask <br>
Defines an IP network boundary for determining packet
direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">net-filter6: net6/mask6 <br>
Defines an IPv6 network boundary for determining packet
direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screen-filter: regexp <br>
Sets a regular expression to filter screen output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUIRKS (aka they&rsquo;re
features, not bugs) <br>
There are some circumstances in which iftop may not do what
you expect. In most cases what it is doing is logical, and
we believe it is correct behaviour, although I&rsquo;m happy
to <br>
hear reasoned arguments for alternative behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Totals don&rsquo;t add up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several reasons why
the totals may not appear to add up. The most obvious is
having a screen filter in effect, or screen ordering frozen.
In this case some captured <br>
information is not being shown to you, but is included in
the totals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more subtle explanation comes
about when running in promiscuous mode without specifying a
-F option. In this case there is no easy way to assign the
direction of traffic <br>
between two third parties. For the purposes of the main
display this is done in an arbitrary fashion (by ordering of
IP addresses), but for the sake of totals all traffic <br>
between other hosts is accounted as incoming, because
that&rsquo;s what it is from the point of view of your
interface. The -F option allows you to specify an arbitrary
network bound&acirc; <br>
ary, and to show traffic flowing across it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Peak totals don&rsquo;t add
up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again, this is a feature. The
peak sent and peak received didn&rsquo;t necessarily happen
at the same time. The peak total is the maximum of sent plus
received in each captured time <br>
division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing the filter code
doesn&rsquo;t seem to work</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Give it time. Changing the
filter code affects what is captured from the time that you
entered it, but most of what is on the display is based on
some fraction of the last 40s <br>
window of capturing. After changing the filter there may be
entries on the display that are disallowed by the current
filter for up to 40s. DISPLAY FILTERING has immediate <br>
effect and does not affect what is captured.</p>
