<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm - Migrates a system profile from
Red Hat Network Classic Hosted to Customer Portal
Subscription Management (hosted) or Subscription Asset
Manager (on- <br>
premise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm [--force] | [--no-auto] [--keep]
| [--servicelevel=SERVICE_LEVEL] | [--remove-rhn-packages] |
[--destination-url=URL] | [--legacy-user=LEGACY_USER] | <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm migrates a system profile which
is registered with Red Hat Network Classic to Customer
Portal Subscription Management. This is intended for
migrating <br>
from the host service, not for migrating from a Satellite
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script migrates
configuration, from a channel-based subscription framework
to a certificate-based subscription framework. While the
rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm script per&acirc; <br>
forms the migration operation, the data used to map the
channels to the corresponding product certificates is
defined in the subscription-manager-migration-data package.
The sub&acirc; <br>
scription-manager-migration-data package must be installed
before the rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm script can be run
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND <br>
Access to support and updates for products is determined
through subscriptions. Subscriptions are attached to a
system, which means that the system has the right to install
and <br>
update a product with full support. Subscriptions for an
entire account are tracked through a subscription management
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the channel-based
framework, a subscription management service was either an
on-premise Satellite or hosted Red Hat Network Classic. With
the new certificate-based subscrip&acirc; <br>
tions, the subscription management service is either
Customer Portal Subscription Management or Subscription
Asset Manager. The differences between the two types of
subscription <br>
management services are described in this Knowledgebase
article:
&lt;https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/63269&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system registers with the
subscription management service and receives an inventory ID
number. When subscriptions are attached to a system, that
association is noted in the <br>
subscription management service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Registering with a subscription
management service is exclusive. If a system is registered
with Red Hat Network Classic, it cannot simultaneously be
registered with Customer Por&acirc; <br>
tal Subscription Management. The rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm
tool is provided specifically so that there is a way to
transition from the deprecated Red Hat Network Classic to
<br>
Customer Portal Subscription Management or an on-premise
Subscription Asset Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Prints the specific help information for the given
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Ignore channels not available through Customer Portal
Subscription Management (or Subscription Asset Manager). The
channels in Red Hat Network Classic are mapped to the <br>
product certificates used by the Customer Portal
Subscription Management. However, not every channel has a
certificate mapping, which can cause errors during
migration. <br>
Using this option skips any channels which are not mapped to
Customer Portal Subscription Management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-auto <br>
Deletes the system from Red Hat Network Classic and
registers it to Customer Portal Subscription Management, but
does not attach any subscriptions to the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SERVICE_LEVEL,
--servicelevel=SERVICE_LEVEL <br>
Sets a preferred service level for the system, such as
premium or standard. This service-level preference is then
used as one of the criteria for auto-attaching
subscrip&acirc; <br>
tions to the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-rhn-packages <br>
After unregistering from Red Hat Network Classic, remove
legacy packages: osad, rhn-check, rhn-client-tools, rhncfg,
rhncfg-actions, rhncfg-client, rhncfg-management, rhn- <br>
setup, rhnpush, rhnsd, spacewalk-abrt, spacewalk-oscap,
yum-rhn-plugin. Once unregistered from Red Hat Network
Classic, they are no longer needed. Once packages are <br>
removed, subsequent attempts to migrate will be blocked with
a message indicating &quot;Perhaps this script was already
executed with --remove-rhn-packages?&quot;. --remove-rhn-
<br>
packages cannot be used with --keep, since it does not make
sense to keep a system registered without the tooling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--org=ORG <br>
Sets the organization within the account structure to which
to register the system. Every account is divided into
subgroups called organizations, which represent some kind
<br>
of organizational or logical division in the infrastructure.
Organizations are further divided into environments, which
organize content streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--environment=ENVIRONMENT <br>
Sets which environment within the organization the system
belongs to. Every account is divided into subgroups called
organizations, which are further divided into environ&acirc;
<br>
ments Environments define different content streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--activation-key=ACTIVATION_KEY
<br>
Sets an activation key to use during registration to the
subscription management service. Use of an activation key
requires the user to supply the organization that the <br>
system will be registered to. This option may be supplied
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep Leaves the system profile
on the legacy system. Normally the system profile on the
legacy system is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-proxy <br>
Disables or ignores any previous RHN proxy settings when
migrating to the new subscription management service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--legacy-user=LEGACY_USER <br>
Specifies the user name on the legacy server.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--legacy-password=LEGACY_PASSWORD
<br>
Specifies the password for the user on the legacy
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--destination-url=URL <br>
Specifies the URL of the subscription management service to
which to register the system. This is used for environments
which have an on-premise subscription management <br>
service such as Subscription Asset Manager. If no URL is
given, the migration tool uses the Customer Portal
Subscription Management Service.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--destination-user=DESTINATION_USER
<br>
Specifies the user name on the destination server.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--destination-password=DESTINATION_PASSWORD
<br>
Specifies the password for the user on the destination
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The migration process moves the system from the inventory in
one subscription management service (Red Hat Network
Classic) to the new subscription management service
(Customer <br>
Portal Subscription Management), and then re-applies the
subscriptions to the system. The script runs through these
steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Authenticate to both Red Hat
Network Classic and Customer Portal Subscription Management
to verify the account settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Get a channel list for the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Match each channel to a
corresponding certificate map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Copy over the product
certificates for the old channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Unregister from Red Hat
Network Classic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Stop and disable legacy
services: osad, rhnsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Register with Customer Portal
Subscription Management and auto-attach the best-matched
subscriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After migration, the system
facts maintained by Subscription Manager display what script
was used for migration and what the previous system ID was.
<br>
[root@server ~]# subscription-manager facts --list | grep
migr <br>
migration.classic_system_id: 09876 <br>
migration.migrated_from: rhn_hosted_classic <br>
migration.migration_date: 2012-09-14T14:55:29.280519</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIGRATION AND AUTOSUBSCRIBE <br>
The rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm tool, by default,
auto-attaches the best-matching subscriptions to the system.
This allows migrations to be automated. <br>

SLA associated with a subscription is then evaluated when
determining what subscrip&acirc; <br>
tions to auto-attach to the system, along with other factors
like installed products, existing channel assignments, and
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIGRATION TO ON-PREMISE SERVICES
<br>
The rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm tool migrates the system to
Customer Portal Subscription Management (hosted) services by
default. This uses the default configuration for Sub&acirc;
<br>
scription Manager, which points to the subscription
management services for the Customer Portal. For
infrastructures which have an on-premise subscription
management service such <br>
as Subscription Asset Manager, this configuration can be
changed so that the migration process registers the systems
to the on-premise subscription management service and <br>
attaches the appropriate subscriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done by using the
--destination-url option, which specifies the URL of the
on-premise service. In this case, the authorization
credentials must also be given for the on- <br>
premise subscription management service account (which is
independent of the RHN classic account).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[root@server ~]#

programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/rhsm/rhsm.log <br>

registering the system to Customer Portal Subscription
Management or with attaching subscriptions to the sys&acirc;
