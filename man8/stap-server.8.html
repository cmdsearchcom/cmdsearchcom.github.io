<p>STAP-SERVER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
STAP-SERVER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
stap-server - systemtap compile server management</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
[ service ] stap-server { start | stop | restart |
condrestart | try-restart | force-reload | status } [
options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A systemtap compile server listens for connections from stap
clients on a secure SSL network port and accepts requests to
run the stap front end. Each server advertises its
pres&acirc; <br>
ence and configuration on the local network using mDNS
(avahi) allowing for automatic detection by clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stap-server script aims to
provide:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; management of
systemtap compile servers as a service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; convenient
control over configured servers and individual (ad-hoc)
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
One of the actions below must be specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start Start servers. The
specified servers are started. If no server is specified,
the configured servers are started. If no servers are
configured, a server for the kernel <br>
release and architecture of the host is started. If a
specified server is already started, this action will be
ignored for that server. If a server fails to start, this
<br>
action fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop Stop server(s). The
specified servers are stopped. If no server is specified,
all currently running servers are stopped. If a specified
server is not running, this <br>
action will be successful for that server. If a server fails
to stop, this action fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart <br>
Stop and restart servers. The specified servers are stopped
and restarted. If no server is specified, all currently
running servers are stopped and restarted. If no <br>
servers are running, this action behaves like start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">condrestart <br>
Stop and restart servers. The specified servers are stopped
and restarted. If a specified server is not running, it is
not started. If no server is specified, all cur&acirc; <br>
rently running servers are stopped and restarted. If no
servers are running, none will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">try-restart <br>
This action is identical to condrestart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force-reload <br>
Stop all running servers, reload config files and restart
the service as if start was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Print information about
running servers. Information about the specified server(s)
will be printed. If no server is specified, information
about all running servers will <br>
be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are used to provide additional
configuration and to specify servers to be managed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c configfile <br>
This option specifies a global configuration file in
addition to the default global configuration file described
below. This file will be processed after the default <br>
global configuration file. If the -c option is specified
more than once, the last configuration file specified will
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a architecture <br>
This option specifies the target architecture of the server
and is analogous to the -a option of stap. See the stap(1)
manual page for more details. The default architec&acirc;
<br>
ture is the architecture of the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r kernel-release <br>
This option specifies the target kernel release of the
server and is analogous to the -r option of stap. See the
stap(1) manual page for more details. The default release
<br>
is that of the currently running kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I path <br>
This option specifies an additional path to be searched by
the server(s) for tapsets and is analogous to the -I option
of stap. See the stap(1) manual page for more <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R path <br>
This option specifies the location of the systemtap runtime
to be used by the server(s) and is analogous to the -R
option of stap. See the stap(1) manual page for more <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B options <br>
This option specifies options to be passed to make when
building systemtap modules and is analogous to the -B option
of stap. See the stap(1) manual page for more <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This option is a shortcut
which specifies one server for each kernel release installed
in /lib/modules/. Previous -I, -R, -B and -u options will be
applied to each server, <br>
however previous -a options will be ignored and the default
architecture will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nickname <br>
This option allows the specification of a server
configuration by nickname. When -n is specified, a currently
running server with the given nickname will be searched for.
<br>
If no currently running server with the given nickname is
found, a server configuration with the given nickname will
be searched for in the configuration files for default <br>
servers, or the path configured in the global configuration
file or the configuration file specified by the -c option.
If a server configuration for the given nickname is <br>
found, the -a, -r, -I, -R, -B and -u options for that server
will be used as if they were specified on the command line.
If no configuration with the given nickname is <br>
found, and the action is start (or an action behaving like
start (see ARGUMENTS), the server will be started with the
given nickname. If no configuration with the given <br>
nickname is found, and the action is not start (or an action
behaving like start), it is an error. If a nickname is not
specified for a server which is being started, its <br>
nickname will be its process id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid This option allows the
specification of a server configuration by process id. When
-p is specified, a currently running server with the given
process id will be searched <br>
for. If no such server is found, it is an error. If a server
with the given process id is found, the -a, -r, -I, -R, -B
and -u options for that server will be used as if <br>
they were specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user-name <br>
Each systemtap compile server is normally run by the user
name stap-server (for the initscript) or as the user
invoking stap-server, unless otherwise configured (see <br>
FILES). This option specifies the user name used to run the
server(s). The user name specified must be a member of the
group stap-server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log logfile <br>
This option allows the specification of a separate log file
for each server. Each --log option is added to a list which
will be applied, in turn, to each server speci&acirc; <br>
fied. If more servers are specified than --log options, the
default log file (see FILES) will be used for subsequent
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--port port-number <br>
This option allows the specification of a specific network
port for each server. Each --port option is added to a list
which will be applied, in turn, to each server spec&acirc;
<br>
ified. If more servers are specified than --port options, a
randomly selected port is used for subsequent servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl certificate-db-path <br>
This option allows the specification of a separate NSS
certificate database for each server. Each --ssl option is
added to a list which will be applied, in turn, to each <br>
server specified. If more servers are specified than --ssl
options, the default certificate database (see FILES) for
subsequent servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-threads threads <br>
This option allows the specification of the maximum number
of worker threads to handle concurrent requests. If threads
== 0, each request will be handled on the main <br>
thread, serially. The default is the number of available
processor cores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-request-size size <br>
This options allows the specification of the maximum size of
an uncompressed client request. The arguement size is
specified in bytes. The default is the 50000 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-compressed-request size
<br>
This options allows the specification of the maximum size of
a compressed client request. The arguement size is specified
in bytes. The default is the 5000 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Configuration files allow us to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; specify global
configuration of logging, server configuration files, status
files and other global parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; specify which
servers are to be started by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global Configuration <br>
The Global Configuration file contains variable assignments
used to configure the overall operation of the service. Each
line beginning with a &rsquo;#&rsquo; character is ignored.
All <br>
other lines must be of the form VARIABLE=VALUE. This is not
a shell script. The entire contents of the line after the =
will be assigned as-is to the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables may be
assigned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG_PATH <br>
Specifies the absolute path of the directory containing the
default server configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STAT_PATH <br>
Specifies the absolute path of the running server status
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG_FILE <br>
Specifies the absolute path of the log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STAP_USER <br>
Specifies the userid which will be used to run the server(s)
(default: for the initscript stap-server, otherwise the user
running stap-server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of a Global
Configuration file:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG_PATH=~&lt;user&gt;/my-stap-server-configs
<br>
LOG_FILE=/tmp/stap-server/log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual Server Configuration
<br>
Each server configuration file configures a server to be
started when no server is specified for the start action, or
an action behaving like the start action (see ARGUMENTS).
<br>
Each configuration file contains variable assignments used
to configure an individual server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line beginning with a
&rsquo;#&rsquo; character is ignored. All other lines must
be of the form VARIABLE=VALUE. This is not a shell script.
The entire contents of the line after the = <br>
will be assigned as-is to the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each configuration file must
have a filename suffix of .conf. See stappaths(7) for the
default location of these files. This default location can
be overridden in the global <br>
configuration file using the -c option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables may be
assigned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARCH Specifies the target
architecture for this server and corresponds to the -a
option (see OPTIONS). If ARCH is not set, the architecture
of the host will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELEASE <br>
Specifies the kernel release for this server and corresponds
to the -r option (see OPTIONS). If RELEASE is not set, the
release of the kernel running on the host will be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILD Specifies options to be
passed to the make process used by systemtap to build kernel
modules. This an array variable with each element
corresponding to a -B option (see <br>
OPTIONS). Using the form BUILD=STRING clears the array and
sets the first element to STRING. Using the form
BUILD+=STRING adds STRING as an additional element to the
ar&acirc; <br>
ray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE <br>
Specifies a list of directories to be searched by the server
for tapsets. This is an array variable with each element
corresponding to a -I option (see OPTIONS). Using <br>
the form INCLUDE=PATH clears the array and sets the first
element to PATH. Using the form INCLUDE+=PATH adds PATH as
an additional element to the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME <br>
Specifies the directory which contains the systemtap runtime
code to be used by this server and corresponds to the -R
option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER Specifies the user name to
be used to run this server and corresponds to the -u option
(see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NICKNAME <br>
Specifies the nickname to be used to refer to this server
and corresponds to the -n option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG Specifies the location of
the log file to be used by this server and corresponds to
the --log option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORT Specifies the network port
to be used by this server and corresponds to the --port
option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL Specifies the location of
the NSS certificate database to be used by this server and
corresponds to the --ssl option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXTHREADS <br>
Specifies the maximum number of worker threads to handle
concurrent requests to be used by this server and
corresponds to the --max-threads option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXREQSIZE <br>
Specifies the maximum size of an uncompressed client
request, to be used by this server and correspnds to the
--max-request-size option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXCOMPRESSEDREQ <br>
Specifies the maximum size of an compressed client request,
to be used by this server and correspnds to the
--max-compressed-request option (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of a server
configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARCH= <br>
USER= <br>
RELEASE= <br>
NICKNAME=native</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By keeping the ARCH, USER, and
RELEASE fields blank, they will default to the current arch
and release and use the default user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more specific example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARCH=i386 <br>
RELEASE=2.6.18-128.el5 <br>
PORT=5001 <br>
LOG=/path/to/log/file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And here is a more complicated
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER=serveruser <br>
RELEASE=/kernels/2.6.18-92.1.18.el5/build <br>
INCLUDE=/mytapsets <br>
INCLUDE+=/yourtapsets <br>
BUILD=&rsquo;VARIABLE1=VALUE1 VARIABLE2=VALUE2&rsquo; <br>
DEFINE=STP_MAXMEMORY=1024 <br>
DEFINE+=DEBUG_TRANS <br>
RUNTIME=/myruntime <br>
NICKNAME=my-server <br>
SSL=/path/to/NSS/certificate/database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER AUTHENTICATION <br>
The security of the SSL network connection between the
client and server depends on the proper management of server
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trustworthiness of a given
systemtap compile server can not be determined automatically
without a trusted certificate authority issuing systemtap
compile server certificates. <br>
This is not practical in everyday use and so, clients must
authenticate servers against their own database of trusted
server certificates. In this context, establishing a given
<br>
server as trusted by a given client means adding that
server&rsquo;s certificate to the client&rsquo;s database of
trusted servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the stap-server initscript,
on the local host, this is handled automatically. When the
systemtap-server package is installed, the server&rsquo;s
certificate for the default user <br>
(stap-server) is automatically generated and installed. This
means that servers started by the stap-server initscript,
with the default user, are automatically trusted by clients
<br>
on the local host, both as an SSL peer and as a systemtap
module signer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, when stap is
invoked by an unprivileged user (not root, not a member of
the group stapdev, but a member of the group stapusr and
possibly the group stapsys), the op&acirc; <br>
tions --use-server and --privilege are automatically added
to the specified options. This means that unprivileged users
on the local host can use a server on the local host in <br>
unprivileged mode with no further setup or options required.
Normal users (those in none of the SystemTap groups) can
also use compile-servers through the --use-server and <br>
--privilege options. But they will of course be unable to
load the module (the -p4 option can be used to stop short of
loading).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to use a server running
on another host, that server&rsquo;s certificate must be
installed on the client&rsquo;s host. See the
--trust-servers option in the stap(1) manual page for <br>
more details and README.unprivileged in the systemtap
sources for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
See the stapex(3stap) manual page for a collection of sample
systemtap scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start the configured servers,
or the default server, if none are configured:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server
start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start a server for each
kernel installed in /lib/modules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server start
-i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To obtain information about the
running server(s):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server
status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start a server like another
one, except targeting a different architecture, by
referencing the first server&rsquo;s nickname:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server start
-n NICKNAME -a ARCH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start a server for a kernel
release not installed (cross-compiling)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server start
-a ARCH -r /BUILDDIR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To stop one of the servers by
referencing its process id (obtained by running stap-server
status):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server stop
-p PID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run a script using a compile
server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ stap SCRIPT --use-server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run a script as an
unprivileged user using a compile server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ stap SCRIPT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To stop all running servers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server
stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restart servers after a
global configuration change and/or when default servers have
been added, changed, or removed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ [ service ] stap-server
force-reload</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAFETY AND SECURITY <br>
Systemtap is an administrative tool. It exposes kernel
internal data structures and potentially private user
information. See the stap(1) manual page for additional
information <br>
on safety and security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a network server, stap-server
should be activated with care in order to limit the
potential effects of bugs or mischevious users. Consider the
following prophylactic mea&acirc; <br>
sures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Run stap-server as an
unprivileged user, never as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked as a service (i.e.
service stap-server ...), each server is run, by default, as
the user stap-server. When invoked directly (i.e.
stap-server ...), each <br>
server is run, by default, as the invoking user. In each
case, another user may be selected by using the -u option on
invocation, by specifying STAP_USER=username in the <br>
global configuration file or by specifying USER=username in
an individual server configuration file. The invoking user
must have authority to run processes as another us&acirc;
<br>
er. See CONFIGURATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selected user must have
write access to the server log file. The location of the
server log file may be changed by setting LOG_FILE=path in
the global configuration <br>
file. See CONFIGURATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selected user must have
read/write access to the directory containing the server
status files. The location of the server status files may be
changed by setting <br>
STAT_PATH=path in the global configuration file. See
CONFIGURATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selected user must have
read/write access to the uprobes.ko build directory and its
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither form of stap-server will
run if the selected user is root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Run stap-server requests with
resource limits that impose maximum cpu time, file size,
memory consumption, in order to bound the effects of
processing excessively large or <br>
bogus inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the user running the server
is stap-server, each server request is run with limits
specified in ~stap-server/.systemtap/rc otherwise, no limits
are imposed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Run stap-server with a TMPDIR
environment variable that points to a separate and/or
quota-enforced directory, in order to prevent filling up of
important filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default TMPDIR is /tmp/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Activate network firewalls to
limit stap client connections to relatively trustworthy
networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For automatic selection of
servers by clients, avahi must be installed on both the
server and client hosts and mDNS messages must be allowed
through the firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The systemtap compile server and
its related utilities use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) as
implemented by Network Security Services (NSS) for network
security. NSS is also used <br>
for the generation and management of certificates. The
related certificate databases must be protected in order to
maintain the security of the system. Use of the utilities
pro&acirc; <br>
vided will help to ensure that the proper protection is
maintained. The systemtap client will check for proper
access permissions before making use of any certificate
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Important files and their corresponding paths can be located
in the <br>
stappaths (7) manual page.</p>
