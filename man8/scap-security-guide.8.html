SCAP Security Guide - Delivers security guidance, baselines, and associated
  validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content Automation Protocol
  (SCAP).

The project provides practical security hardening advice for Red Hat products,
  and also links it to compliance requirements in order to ease deployment
  activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include
  requirements in the U.S. government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence
  Community) as well as of the financial services and health care industries.
  For example, high-level and widely-accepted policies such as NIST 800-53
  provides prose stating that System Administrators must audit &quot;privileged
  user actions,&quot; but do not define what &quot;privileged actions&quot; are.
  The SSG bridges the gap between generalized policy requirements and specific
  implementation guidance, in SCAP formats to support automation whenever
  possible.

The SCAP Security Guide, an open source project jointly maintained by Red Hat
  and the NSA, provides XCCDF and OVAL content for Red Hat technologies. As an
  open source project, community participation extends into U.S. Department of
  Defense agencies, civilian agencies, academia, and other industrial partners.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SCAP Security Guide is provided to consumers through Red Hat's Extended Packages
  for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository. As such, SCAP Security Guide content
  is considered &quot;vendor provided.&quot;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that while Red Hat hosts the infrastructure for this project and Red Hat
  engineers are involved as maintainers and leaders, there is no commercial
  support contracts or service level agreements provided by Red Hat.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Support, for both users and developers, is provided through the SCAP Security

DoD Directive (DoDD) 8500.1 requires that &quot;all IA and IA-enabled IT
  products incorporated into DoD information systems shall be configured in
  accordance with DoD-approved security configuration guidelines&quot; and tasks
  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to &quot;develop and provide
  security configuration guidance for IA and IA-enabled IT products in
  coordination with Director, NSA.&quot; The output of this authority is the
  DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides, or STIGs. DISA FSO is in the
  process of moving the STIGs towards the use of the NIST Security Content
  Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to &quot;automate&quot; compliance
  reporting of the STIGs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Through a common, shared vision, the SCAP Security Guide community enjoys close
  collaboration directly with NSA, NIST, and DISA FSO. As stated in Section 1.1
  of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG Overview, Version 1, Release 2, issued
  on 03-JUNE-2013:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;The consensus content was developed using an open-source project called
  SCAP Security Guide. The project's website is
  https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide. Except for
  differences in formatting to accomodate the DISA STIG publishing process, the
  content of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG should mirrot the SCAP Security
  Guide content with only minor divergence as updates from multiple sources work
  through the concensus process.&quot;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The DoD STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was released June 2013. Currently,
  the DoD Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG contains only XCCDF content and is
  available online: http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/unix-linux/Pages/red-hat.aspx
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Content published against the iase.disa.mil website is authoritative STIG
  content. The SCAP Security Guide project, as noted in the STIG overview, is
  considered upstream content. Unlike DISA FSO, the SCAP Security Guide project
  does publish OVAL automation content. Individual programs and C&amp;A
  evaluators make program-level determinations on the direct usage of the SCAP
  Security Guide. Currently there is no blanket approval.
