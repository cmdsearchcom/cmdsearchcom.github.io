<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
SCAP Security Guide - Delivers security guidance, baselines,
and associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The project provides practical security hardening advice for
Red Hat products, and also links it to compliance
requirements in order to ease deployment activities, such as
certi&acirc; <br>
fication and accreditation. These include requirements in
the U.S. government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence
Community) as well as of the financial services and health
care <br>
industries. For example, high-level and widely-accepted
policies such as NIST 800-53 provides prose stating that
System Administrators must audit &quot;privileged user
actions,&quot; but <br>
do not define what &quot;privileged actions&quot; are. The
SSG bridges the gap between generalized policy requirements
and specific implementation guidance, in SCAP formats to
support au&acirc; <br>
tomation whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
PROFILES <br>
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 SSG content is broken into
&rsquo;profiles,&rsquo; groupings of security settings that
correlate to a known policy. Available profiles are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C2S <br>
The C2S profile demonstrates compliance against the U.S.
Government Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) baseline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This baseline was inspired by
the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7 Benchmark, v1.1.0 - 04-02-2015. For the SCAP
Security Guide project to <br>
remain in compliance with CIS&rsquo; terms and conditions,
specifically Restrictions(8), note there is no
representation or claim that the C2S profile will ensure a
system is in <br>
compliance or consistency with the CIS baseline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CS2 <br>
The CS2 is an example of a customized server profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSCF-RHEL6-MLS <br>
The CSCF RHEL6 MLS Core Baseline profile reflects the
Centralized Super Computing Facility (CSCF) baseline for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This baseline has received
gov&acirc; <br>
ernment ATO through the ICD 503 process, utilizing the CNSSI
1253 cross domain overlay. This profile should be considered
in active development. Additional tailoring will <br>
be needed, such as the creation of RBAC roles for production
deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">common <br>
The Common Profile for General-Purpose Systems profile
contains items common to general-purpose desktop and server
installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">desktop <br>

Security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of

obtained from <br>
FIPS Publication 200, which provides the high-level and
fundamental security requirements for federal information

<br>
community participation extends into U.S. Department of
Defense agencies, civilian agencies, academia, and other

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. MILITARY
SYSTEMS <br>
DoD Directive (DoDD) 8500.1 requires that &quot;all IA and
IA-enabled IT products incorporated into DoD information
systems shall be configured in accordance with DoD-approved
secu&acirc; <br>
rity configuration guidelines&quot; and tasks Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA) to &quot;develop and
provide security configuration guidance for IA and
IA-enabled IT products in <br>
coordination with Director, NSA.&quot; The output of this
authority is the DISA Security Technical Implementation
Guides, or STIGs. DISA FSO is in the process of moving the
STIGs <br>
towards the use of the NIST Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP) in order to &quot;automate&quot; compliance
reporting of the STIGs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Through a common, shared vision,
the SCAP Security Guide community enjoys close collaboration
directly with NSA, NIST, and DISA FSO. As stated in Section
1.1 of the Red Hat <br>
Enterprise Linux 6 STIG Overview, Version 1, Release 2,
issued on 03-JUNE-2013:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;The consensus content was
developed using an open-source project called SCAP Security
Guide. The project&rsquo;s website is
https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-
<br>
guide. Except for differences in formatting to accomodate
the DISA STIG publishing process, the content of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6 STIG should mirrot the SCAP Security <br>
Guide content with only minor divergence as updates from
multiple sources work through the concensus
process.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DoD STIG for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6 was released June 2013. Currently, the
DoD Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG contains only XCCDF
content and is available online: <br>

http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/unix-linux/Pages/red-hat.aspx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Content published against the
iase.disa.mil website is authoritative STIG content. The
SCAP Security Guide project, as noted in the STIG overview,
is considered upstream content. <br>
Unlike DISA FSO, the SCAP Security Guide project does
publish OVAL automation content. Individual programs and
C&amp;A evaluators make program-level determinations on the
direct <br>
usage of the SCAP Security Guide. Currently there is no
blanket approval.</p>
