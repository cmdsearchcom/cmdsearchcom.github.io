The <b>downtimed</b> daemon waits in the background, frequently updating a time
  stamp file on the disk. If the daemon is killed with a signal associated with
  a normal system shutdown procedure, it records the shutdown time on the disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the daemon is restarted during the next boot process, it reports how long
  the system was down and whether it was properly shut down or crashed. The
  downtime report is output to the system log or to a specified log file. Also a
  record is appended to the downtime database.

  <dd class="It-tag">Logging destination. If the argument contains a slash (/)
      it is interpreted to be a path name to a log file, which will be created
      if it does not exist already. Otherwise it is interpreted as a syslog

  <dd class="It-tag">Defines how long to sleep between each update of the
      on-disk time stamp file. More frequent updates result in more accurate
      downtime reporting in the case of a system crash. Less frequent updates
      decrease the amount of disk writes performed. The default is to sleep 15
      seconds between each update. If you are using a flash memory based SSD or
      other disk which has limited amount of write cycles per block, it might be
      a good idea to set the sleep time to a higher value to prolong the
      lifetime of the storage device.</dd>

The reporting accuracy in case of a system crash depends on how often the time
  stamp is updated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finding out the system startup time is very operating system specific. If the
  program does not have specific code to support your operating system, it
  assumes that the system started when the daemon started.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reporting is inaccurate if the system clock changes during system downtime or
  startup process. Daylight saving time changes have no effect as all
  calculations are done using UTC.
