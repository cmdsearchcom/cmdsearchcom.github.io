<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smp_* - invoke a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP)
function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
smp_* [--expected=EX] [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS]
[--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version]
SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a transport (also known as a
interconnect) used by storage systems. A SAS system is made
up of Host Bus Adapters (HBAs typically containing SCSI <br>
initiators), disks (referred to in SCSI as both targets and
logical units) and optionally some switching hardware called
&quot;expanders&quot;. Expanders are not SCSI devices so a
new pro&acirc; <br>
tocol was required to control and monitor them. Its full
name is the SAS Serial Management Protocol which is
abbreviated to SMP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smp_utils is a package of
utilities. Each utility sends an SMP function request to a
SMP_DEVICE (an SMP target). Some utilities may invoke the
same function more than once. If an <br>
error occurs then an error message is sent to stderr. If no
error occurs, the response is decoded (the default), output
in ASCII hex (when --hex is given) or output in binary to
<br>
stdout (when the --raw option is given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SMP_DEVICE[,N] is not given
then the value in the environment variable SMP_UTILS_DEVICE
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This package was originally
written for Linux and has been ported to FreeBSD and
Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINUX INTERFACE <br>
Currently there are multiple interfaces that allow SMP
functions to be passed through to an SMP target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One method is to have a
SMP_DEVICE which is actually the SMP initiator (e.g.
&rsquo;/dev/mptctl,0&rsquo;). In this case the SMP
target&rsquo;s SAS address must be supplied with the
--sa=SAS_ADDR <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another method is to have a
SMP_DEVICE which represents the SMP target. In this case no
SAS_ADDRESS needs to be given (since it is implicit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each utility in smp_utils
attempts to work out which interface it has been given by
examining the SMP_DEVICE file. There are three interfaces
supported currently:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aac This specifies the aacraid
SAS pass-through associated with Adaptec/PMC RAID products.
The SMP_DEVICE[,N] argument takes the form
/dev/aac[N[,E_ID]] where &quot;N&quot; is the raid <br>
controller number (typically 0) and &quot;E_ID&quot; is the
expander identifier (typically 0); both default to 0 so
/dev/aac is equivalent to /dev/aac0 and /dev/aac0,0 . The
&quot;N&quot; is <br>
the unique_id found in
/sys/class/scsi_host&lt;HN&gt;/unique_id . The
&quot;HN&quot; is the host number which is the first number
to appear on each line in the lsscsi utility which by <br>
default uses one line to list each accessible SCSI device
(typically SCSI or ATA disks). The &quot;E_ID&quot; is the
expander identifier which can be found with the Adaptec/PMC
arc&acirc; <br>
conf utility using the form &quot;arcconf expanderlist
&lt;ControllerNum&gt;&quot;. The &lt;ControllerNum&gt;s
start at 1 . If an aac RAID controller is present then the
/dev/acc device node <br>
will be created by the first smp utility to use this
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpt This specifies the MPT
fusion SAS pass-through. The mptsas driver uses the
&rsquo;/dev/mptctl&rsquo; device node (character device
major 10, minor 220) while the mpt2sas driver uses <br>
&rsquo;/dev/mpt2ctl&rsquo; device node (major 10, minor
221). For the mpt3sas driver the corresponding device node
is &rsquo;/dev/mpt3ctl&rsquo;. The &rsquo;modprobe
mptctl&rsquo; or &rsquo;modprobe mpt2ctl&rsquo; <br>
command may be needed. If there are multiple mpt fusion
controllers (HBAs) in the computer, then the user will need
to specify which one to use with the syntax: <br>
&rsquo;/dev/mptctl,&lt;n&gt;&rsquo; where &lt;n&gt; is the
&quot;ioc_num&quot;. This number can be found with dmesg
after the mptsas driver is registered and appears as a
suffix to the driver name (e.g. <br>
mpt2sas0). It can also be found in
&rsquo;/sys/class/scsi_host/host&lt;n&gt;/unique_id&rsquo;.
When this interface is used the --sa=SAS_ADDR option must be
given to specify the SAS address <br>
of the SMP target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sgv4 (sg) <br>
This interface is more generic and supported by several SAS
HBA drivers including mptsas (and mpt2sas). It was
introduced in the Linux 2.6.24 kernel. The SMP functions are
<br>
passed to the kernel via the bsg driver using a format known
as &quot;SCSI Generic Version 4&quot; which gives this
interface its name: &quot;sgv4&quot; or just &quot;sg&quot;.
The SAS transport layer <br>
within the SCSI sub-system unpacks the SMP requests and
forwards them to SAS low level drivers that support this
interface. The SMP_DEVICE is either a member of the <br>
&rsquo;/sys/class/bsg&rsquo; directory (e.g.
/sys/class/bsg/expander-6:0 ) or a device node made for the
bsg driver (e.g. /dev/bsg/expander-6:0 ). Such device nodes
are dynamic (i.e. <br>
they don&rsquo;t have fixed major and minor numbers) and
should correspond to the major and minor numbers found in
the
&rsquo;sys/class/bsg/&lt;smp_target_device&gt;/dev&rsquo;
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FREEBSD INTERFACE <br>
The CAM subsystem has been enhanced in FreeBSD 9 to
pass-through SMP requests and return the corresponding
responses. However CAM does not directly access expander
devices <br>
because they are not SCSI devices. It makes the assumption
that each SAS expander has an integrated SES (enclosure)
device and that is addressed. This assumption seems to be
true <br>
for SAS-2 expanders but not some SAS-1 expanders. Thus
invocations look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># smp_discover /dev/ses0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where /dev/ses0 is a SES device
associated with a SAS expander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOLARIS INTERFACE <br>
The USMP pass-through mechanism is used. Invocations look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># smp_rep_manufacturer
/dev/smp/expd0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
If the device name is not given then the SMP_UTILS_DEVICE
environment variable is checked and if present its contents
are used as the device name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the SAS address (of the SMP
target) is not given and it is required (i.e. it is not
implicit in the device name) then the SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR
environment variable is checked <br>
and if present its contents are used as the SAS address. SAS
addresses are usually given in hex indicated by a leading
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; or trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either or both environment
variables and the corresponding command line options are
given, then the command line options take precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
options as well. If an option takes a numeric argument then
that argument is assumed to be decimal unless otherwise <br>
indicated (e.g. with a leading &quot;0x&quot; or a trailing
&quot;h&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --expected=EX <br>
revision 4a of the SAS-2 draft introduced an &rsquo;expected
expander change count&rsquo; field in some SMP requests. The
idea is to detect other SMP initiators trying to change the
<br>
state of an expander. The value EX is from 0 to 65535
inclusive with 0 being the default value. When EX is greater
than zero then if the value doesn&rsquo;t match the expander
<br>
change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the
request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets
a function result of &quot;invalid expander change <br>
count&quot; in the response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message for the utility then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
output the response in hexadecimal. This does not include
the trailing CRC field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --interface=PARAMS <br>
interface specific parameters. This option is usually not
needed since the interface type is guessed by a utility
based on the characteristics of the given SMP_DEVICE <br>
argument or what is in the corresponding environment
variables. PARAMS is of the form: INTF[,force]. If the guess
doesn&rsquo;t work then the interface can be specified by
giv&acirc; <br>
ing a INTF of either &rsquo;mpt&rsquo; or
&rsquo;sgv4&rsquo;. Sanity checks are still performed and a
utility may refuse if it doesn&rsquo;t agree with the given
INTF. If the user is really sure then <br>
adding a &rsquo;,force&rsquo; will force the utility to use
the given interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
send the response to stdout in binary. This does not include
the trailing CRC field. All error messages are sent to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR <br>
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device.
Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed
if the SMP_DEVICE has the target&rsquo;s SAS address
associated <br>
with it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS addresses
are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal
either prefix it with &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or put a trailing
&rsquo;h&rsquo; on <br>
it. If this option is not given then the value in the
environment variable SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
To aid scripts that call these utilities, the exit status is
set to indicate success (0) or failure (1 or more):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 success</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - 63 reserved for SMP function
result codes. See the SAS-2 (or later) draft, in the section
on the application layer, drilling down further: management
application layer then <br>
SMP functions. Here are some common function result codes: 1
[unknown SMP function], 2 [SMP function failed], 16 [phy
does not exist], 17 [index does not exist], 18 [phy <br>
does not support SATA], 19 [unknown phy operation], 22 [phy
vacant] and 35 [zone lock violation].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">91 syntax error. Either illegal
options, options with bad arguments or a combination of
options that is not permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">92 the utility is unable to
open, close or use the given SMP_DEVICE. The given file name
could be incorrect or there may be file permission problems.
Adding the --verbose <br>
option may give more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">97 the response to an SMP
function failed sanity checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">99 any error that can&rsquo;t be
categorized into values 1 to 97 may yield this value. This
includes transport and operating system errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Finding the SAS address of an expander can be a challenge in
some environments. An enclosure containing one or more
expanders may have the expander SAS address(es) printed on
the <br>
back of the device, a bit like Ethernet MAC addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Linux 2.6 kernel series
the expander SAS address may well be in the sysfs tree but
it is not always easy to find. Doing this search may
help:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># find /sys -name
&quot;*expander*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That should show the suffix on
any expanders that have been detected. Then a command like
&rsquo;cat
/sys/class/sas_device/expander-6:0/sas_address&rsquo; should
show its SAS address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another approach is to work
backwards from SCSI devices (i.e. logical units). The
protocol specific port log page (log page 18h) contains
fields for the &quot;attached SAS address&quot;. <br>
The sg_logs utility from the sg3_utils package could be used
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_logs --page=18h
/dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any given &quot;attached SAS
address&quot; is either a HBA, an expander or 0 indicating
that port is not connected. An expander is indicated by
&quot;attached device type: expander device&quot;. A <br>
SAS disk&rsquo;s target port identifiers (also known as SAS
addresses), device name and logical unit name (all NAA 5
format) can be found with the sg_vpd utility (e.g.
&rsquo;sg_vpd -i <br>
&lt;disk_dev&gt;&rsquo;). The sdparm utility can provide the
same information (e.g. &rsquo;sdparm -i
&lt;disk_dev&gt;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A SAS expander is often
associated with a SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) device
sometimes on the same silicon attached via a virtual phy to
the expander. That SES device may be <br>
able to access and control an attached enclosure or
backplane via SGPIO or I2C on sideband signals (e.g. in a
SFF-8087 cable). To interact with a SES device, see the
sg_ses util&acirc; <br>
ity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Often expander phys are grouped
in fours on the same connector (e.g. SFF-8088). Care needs
to be taken when multiple expanders are interconnected. An
enclosure universal port <br>
is one in which the &quot;table to table supported&quot;
attribute is set (in the REPORT GENERAL response) and the
associated phys have the table routing attribute (in the
DISCOVER <br>
response). Enclosure universal ports were introduced in
SAS-2 and have few restrictions when used to interconnect
expanders or connect SAS or SATA devices. An enclosure out
port <br>
is one in which the &quot;table to table supported&quot;
attribute is clear and the associated phys have the table
routing attribute. An enclosure in port is one in which the
associated <br>
phys have the subtractive routing attribute. When universal
ports are not available, an expander interconnect should be
between an in port and an out port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFORMING TO <br>
SAS has multiple generations. The early standards are: the
original SAS (ANSI INCITS 376-2003), SAS 1.1 (INCITS
417-2006) and SAS-2 (ANSI INCITS 457-2010) . SAS-2.1 work
was <br>
split into an electrical and physical layers document
(standardized as SAS-2.1 ANSI INCITS 478-2011) with the
upper level layers placed in a document called the SAS
Protocol <br>
Layer and it was standardized as SPL ANSI INCITS 476-2011.
Next came SPL-2 which was standardized as SPL-2 ANSI INCITS
505-2013. SPL-3 is near standardization and its most recent
<br>
draft is spl3r07.pdf. To avoid confusion, the multiple
generations of SAS will be referred to in these man pages as
SAS 1, 1.1, 2, 2.1 (SPL) and 3 (SPL-2 and SPL-3). Roughly
<br>
speaking SAS-1 runs at 3 Gbps, SAS-2 at 6 Gbps and SAS-3 at
12 Gbps. Drafts, including those just prior to
standardization can be found at the http://www.t10.org site
(e.g. <br>
spl-r07.pdf and spl2r04c.pdf). INCITS policy now requires a
registration to view these drafts, a break from t10.org
tradition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two utilities for reading
and writing to GPIO registers, smp_read_gpio and
smp_write_gpio, are defined in the Small Form Factor
document SFF-8485 found at http://www.sffcom&acirc; <br>
mittee.com . &quot;Enhanced&quot; versions of the
corresponding SMP functions have been mentioned in some
drafts but no definitions have been published and the
references have been removed <br>
in more recent drafts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this section of each
utility&rsquo;s man page is the first standard in which the
associated SMP function appeared and whether there have been
significant additions in later stan&acirc; <br>
dards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The COVERAGE file in the
smp_utils source tarball shows a table of all SMP function
names defined in the drafts, the versions of those standards
in which those SMP functions <br>
first appeared and the corresponding smp_utils utility
names. A lot of extra SMP functions have been added in SAS-2
associated with zoning.</p>
