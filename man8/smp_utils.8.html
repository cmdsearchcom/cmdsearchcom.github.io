Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a transport (also known as a interconnect) used by
  storage systems. A SAS system is made up of Host Bus Adapters (HBAs typically
  containing SCSI initiators), disks (referred to in SCSI as both targets and
  logical units) and optionally some switching hardware called
  &quot;expanders&quot;. Expanders are not SCSI devices so a new protocol was
  required to control and monitor them. Its full name is the SAS Serial
  Management Protocol which is abbreviated to SMP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
smp_utils is a package of utilities. Each utility sends an SMP function request
  to a <i>SMP_DEVICE</i> (an SMP target). Some utilities may invoke the same
  function more than once. If an error occurs then an error message is sent to
  stderr. If no error occurs, the response is decoded (the default), output in
  ASCII hex (when <i>--hex</i> is given) or output in binary to stdout (when the
  <i>--raw</i> option is given).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</i> is not given then the value in the environment variable
  SMP_UTILS_DEVICE is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This package was originally written for Linux and has been ported to FreeBSD and
  Solaris.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LINUX_INTERFACE"><a class="selflink" href="#LINUX_INTERFACE">LINUX
  INTERFACE</a></h1>
Currently there are multiple interfaces that allow SMP functions to be passed
  through to an SMP target.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One method is to have a <i>SMP_DEVICE</i> which is actually the SMP initiator
  (e.g. '/dev/mptctl,0'). In this case the SMP target's SAS address must be
  supplied with the <i>--sa=SAS_ADDR</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another method is to have a <i>SMP_DEVICE</i> which represents the SMP target.
  In this case no <i>SAS_ADDRESS</i> needs to be given (since it is implicit).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each utility in smp_utils attempts to work out which interface it has been given
  by examining the <i>SMP_DEVICE</i> file. There are three interfaces supported
  currently:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>aac</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This specifies the aacraid SAS pass-through associated with
      Adaptec/PMC RAID products. The <i>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</i> argument takes the
      form <i>/dev/aac[N[,E_ID]]</i> where &quot;N&quot; is the raid controller
      number (typically 0) and &quot;E_ID&quot; is the expander identifier
      (typically 0); both default to 0 so <i>/dev/aac</i> is equivalent to
      <i>/dev/aac0</i> and <i>/dev/aac0,0</i> . The &quot;N&quot; is the
      unique_id found in /sys/class/scsi_host&lt;HN&gt;/unique_id . The
      &quot;HN&quot; is the host number which is the first number to appear on
      each line in the lsscsi utility which by default uses one line to list
      each accessible SCSI device (typically SCSI or ATA disks). The
      &quot;E_ID&quot; is the expander identifier which can be found with the
      Adaptec/PMC arcconf utility using the form &quot;arcconf expanderlist
      &lt;ControllerNum&gt;&quot;. The &lt;ControllerNum&gt;s start at 1 . If an
      aac RAID controller is present then the /dev/acc device node will be
      created by the first smp utility to use this interface.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>mpt</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This specifies the MPT fusion SAS pass-through. The mptsas
      driver uses the '/dev/mptctl' device node (character device major 10,
      minor 220) while the mpt2sas driver uses '/dev/mpt2ctl' device node (major
      10, minor 221). For the mpt3sas driver the corresponding device node is
      '/dev/mpt3ctl'. The 'modprobe mptctl' or 'modprobe mpt2ctl' command may be
      needed. If there are multiple mpt fusion controllers (HBAs) in the
      computer, then the user will need to specify which one to use with the
      syntax: '/dev/mptctl,&lt;n&gt;' where &lt;n&gt; is the
      &quot;ioc_num&quot;. This number can be found with dmesg after the mptsas
      driver is registered and appears as a suffix to the driver name (e.g.
      mpt2sas0). It can also be found in
      '/sys/class/scsi_host/host&lt;n&gt;/unique_id'. When this interface is
      used the <i>--sa=SAS_ADDR</i> option must be given to specify the SAS
      address of the SMP target.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>sgv4</b> (<b>sg</b>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This interface is more generic and supported by several SAS
      HBA drivers including mptsas (and mpt2sas). It was introduced in the Linux
      2.6.24 kernel. The SMP functions are passed to the kernel via the bsg
      driver using a format known as &quot;SCSI Generic Version 4&quot; which
      gives this interface its name: &quot;sgv4&quot; or just &quot;sg&quot;.
      The SAS transport layer within the SCSI sub-system unpacks the SMP
      requests and forwards them to SAS low level drivers that support this
      interface. The <i>SMP_DEVICE</i> is either a member of the
      '/sys/class/bsg' directory (e.g. /sys/class/bsg/expander-6:0 ) or a device
      node made for the bsg driver (e.g. /dev/bsg/expander-6:0 ). Such device
      nodes are dynamic (i.e. they don't have fixed major and minor numbers) and
      should correspond to the major and minor numbers found in the
      'sys/class/bsg/&lt;smp_target_device&gt;/dev' file.</dd>

The CAM subsystem has been enhanced in FreeBSD 9 to pass-through SMP requests
  and return the corresponding responses. However CAM does not directly access
  expander devices because they are not SCSI devices. It makes the assumption
  that each SAS expander has an integrated SES (enclosure) device and that is
  addressed. This assumption seems to be true for SAS-2 expanders but not some
  SAS-1 expanders. Thus invocations look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # smp_discover /dev/ses0
<div class="Pp"></div>
where /dev/ses0 is a SES device associated with a SAS expander.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOLARIS_INTERFACE"><a class="selflink" href="#SOLARIS_INTERFACE">SOLARIS
  INTERFACE</a></h1>
The USMP pass-through mechanism is used. Invocations look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # smp_rep_manufacturer /dev/smp/expd0
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
If the device name is not given then the SMP_UTILS_DEVICE environment variable
  is checked and if present its contents are used as the device name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the SAS address (of the SMP target) is not given and it is required (i.e. it
  is not implicit in the device name) then the SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR environment
  variable is checked and if present its contents are used as the SAS address.
  SAS addresses are usually given in hex indicated by a leading '0x' or trailing
  'h'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If either or both environment variables and the corresponding command line
  options are given, then the command line options take precedence.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMON_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMON_OPTIONS">COMMON
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well. If
  an option takes a numeric argument then that argument is assumed to be decimal
  unless otherwise indicated (e.g. with a leading &quot;0x&quot; or a trailing
  &quot;h&quot;).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-E</b>, <b>--expected</b>=<i>EX</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">revision 4a of the SAS-2 draft introduced an 'expected
      expander change count' field in some SMP requests. The idea is to detect
      other SMP initiators trying to change the state of an expander. The value
      <i>EX</i> is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default value.
      When <i>EX</i> is greater than zero then if the value doesn't match the
      expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the
      request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function
      result of &quot;invalid expander change count&quot; in the response.</dd>

      are still performed and a utility may refuse if it doesn't agree with the

Finding the SAS address of an expander can be a challenge in some environments.
  An enclosure containing one or more expanders may have the expander SAS
  address(es) printed on the back of the device, a bit like Ethernet MAC
  addresses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the Linux 2.6 kernel series the expander SAS address may well be in the sysfs
  tree but it is not always easy to find. Doing this search may help:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # find /sys -name &quot;*expander*&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
That should show the suffix on any expanders that have been detected. Then a
  command like 'cat /sys/class/sas_device/expander-6:0/sas_address' should show
  its SAS address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another approach is to work backwards from SCSI devices (i.e. logical units).
  The protocol specific port log page (log page 18h) contains fields for the
  &quot;attached SAS address&quot;. The sg_logs utility from the sg3_utils
  package could be used like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 # sg_logs --page=18h /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any given &quot;attached SAS address&quot; is either a HBA, an expander or 0
  indicating that port is not connected. An expander is indicated by
  &quot;attached device type: expander device&quot;. A SAS disk's target port
  identifiers (also known as SAS addresses), device name and logical unit name
  (all NAA 5 format) can be found with the sg_vpd utility (e.g. 'sg_vpd -i
  &lt;disk_dev&gt;'). The sdparm utility can provide the same information (e.g.
  'sdparm -i &lt;disk_dev&gt;').
<div class="Pp"></div>
A SAS expander is often associated with a SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) device
  sometimes on the same silicon attached via a virtual phy to the expander. That
  SES device may be able to access and control an attached enclosure or
  backplane via SGPIO or I2C on sideband signals (e.g. in a SFF-8087 cable). To
  interact with a SES device, see the sg_ses utility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Often expander phys are grouped in fours on the same connector (e.g. SFF-8088).
  Care needs to be taken when multiple expanders are interconnected. An
  enclosure <b>universal</b> port is one in which the &quot;table to table
  supported&quot; attribute is set (in the REPORT GENERAL response) and the
  associated phys have the table routing attribute (in the DISCOVER response).
  Enclosure <b>universal</b> ports were introduced in SAS-2 and have few
  restrictions when used to interconnect expanders or connect SAS or SATA
  devices. An enclosure <b>out</b> port is one in which the &quot;table to table
  supported&quot; attribute is clear and the associated phys have the table
  routing attribute. An enclosure <b>in</b> port is one in which the associated
  phys have the subtractive routing attribute. When <b>universal</b> ports are
  not available, an expander interconnect should be between an <b>in</b> port
  and an <b>out</b> port.

SAS has multiple generations. The early standards are: the original SAS (ANSI
  INCITS 376-2003), SAS 1.1 (INCITS 417-2006) and SAS-2 (ANSI INCITS 457-2010) .
  SAS-2.1 work was split into an electrical and physical layers document
  (standardized as SAS-2.1 ANSI INCITS 478-2011) with the upper level layers
  placed in a document called the SAS Protocol Layer and it was standardized as
  SPL ANSI INCITS 476-2011. Next came SPL-2 which was standardized as SPL-2 ANSI
  INCITS 505-2013. SPL-3 is near standardization and its most recent draft is
  spl3r07.pdf. To avoid confusion, the multiple generations of SAS will be
  referred to in these man pages as SAS 1, 1.1, 2, 2.1 (SPL) and 3 (SPL-2 and
  SPL-3). Roughly speaking SAS-1 runs at 3 Gbps, SAS-2 at 6 Gbps and SAS-3 at 12
  Gbps. Drafts, including those just prior to standardization can be found at
  the http://www.t10.org site (e.g. spl-r07.pdf and spl2r04c.pdf). INCITS policy
  now requires a registration to view these drafts, a break from t10.org
  tradition.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two utilities for reading and writing to GPIO registers, smp_read_gpio and
  smp_write_gpio, are defined in the Small Form Factor document SFF-8485 found
  at http://www.sffcommittee.com . &quot;Enhanced&quot; versions of the
  corresponding SMP functions have been mentioned in some drafts but no
  definitions have been published and the references have been removed in more
  recent drafts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this section of each utility's man page is the first standard in which the
  associated SMP function appeared and whether there have been significant
  additions in later standards.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The COVERAGE file in the smp_utils source tarball shows a table of all SMP
  function names defined in the drafts, the versions of those standards in which
  those SMP functions first appeared and the corresponding smp_utils utility
  names. A lot of extra SMP functions have been added in SAS-2 associated with
  zoning.
