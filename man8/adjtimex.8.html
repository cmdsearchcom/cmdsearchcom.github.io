<p>ADJTIMEX(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ADJTIMEX(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
adjtimex - display or set the kernel time variables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
adjtimex [option]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program gives you raw access to the kernel time
variables. Anyone may print out the time variables, but only
the superuser may change them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your computer has two clocks -
the &quot;hardware clock&quot; that runs all the time, and
the system clock that runs only while the computer is on.
Normally, &quot;hwclock --hctosys&quot; should be <br>
run at startup to initialize the system clock. The system
clock has much better precision (approximately 1 usec), but
the hardware clock probably has better long-term stability.
<br>
There are three basic strategies for managing these
clocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a machine connected to the
Internet, or equipped with a precision oscillator or radio
clock, the best way is to regulate the system clock with
ntpd(8). The kernel will auto&acirc; <br>
matically update the hardware clock every eleven
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, hwclock(8) can be
used to approximately correct for a constant drift in the
hardware clock. In this case, &quot;hwclock --adjust&quot;
is run occasionally. hwclock notes how <br>
long it has been since the last adjustment, and nudges the
hardware clock forward or back by the appropriate amount.
The user needs to set the time with &quot;hwclock
--set&quot; several <br>
times over the course of a few days so hwclock can estimate
the drift rate. During that time, ntpd should not be
running, or else hwclock will conclude the hardware clock
does <br>
not drift at all. After you have run &quot;hwclock
--set&quot; for the last time, it&rsquo;s okay to start
ntpd. Then, &quot;hwclock --systohc&quot; should be run when
the machine is shut down. (To see <br>
why, suppose the machine runs for a week with ntpd, is shut
down for a day, is restarted, and &quot;hwclock
--adjust&quot; is run by a startup script. It should only
correct for one day&rsquo;s <br>
worth of drift. However, it has no way of knowing that ntpd
has been adjusting the hardware clock, so it bases its
adjustment on the last time hwclock was run.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a standalone or
intermittently connected machine, where it&rsquo;s not
possible to run ntpd, you may use adjtimex instead to
correct the system clock for systematic drift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways to
estimate the drift rate. If your computer can be connected
to the net, you might run ntpd for at least several hours
and run &quot;adjtimex --print&quot; to <br>
learn what values of tick and freq it settled on.
Alternately, you could estimate values using as a reference
the CMOS clock (see the --compare and --adjust switches),
another <br>
host (see --host and --review), or some other source of time
(see --watch and --review). You could then add a line to
rc.local invoking adjtimex, or configure
/etc/init.d/adj&acirc; <br>
timex or /etc/default/adjtimex, to set those parameters each
time you reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options may be introduced by either - or --, and unique
abbreviations may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a summary of the
options, grouped by type. Explanations follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --print <br>
Print the current values of the kernel time variables. NOTE:
The time is &quot;raw&quot;, and may be off by up to one
timer tick (10 msec). &quot;status&quot; gives the value of
the <br>
time_status variable in the kernel. For Linux 1.0 and 1.2
kernels, the value is as follows: <br>
0 clock is synchronized (so the kernel should <br>
periodically set the CMOS clock to match the <br>
system clock) <br>
1 inserting a leap second at midnight <br>
2 deleting a leap second at midnight <br>
3 leap second in progress <br>
4 leap second has occurred <br>
5 clock not externally synchronized (so the <br>
kernel should leave the CMOS clock alone) <br>
For Linux kernels 2.0 through 2.6, the value is a sum of
these: <br>
1 PLL updates enabled <br>
2 PPS freq discipline enabled <br>
4 PPS time discipline enabled <br>
8 frequency-lock mode enabled <br>
16 inserting leap second <br>
32 deleting leap second <br>
64 clock unsynchronized <br>
128 holding frequency <br>
256 PPS signal present <br>
512 PPS signal jitter exceeded <br>
1024 PPS signal wander exceeded <br>
2048 PPS signal calibration error <br>
4096 clock hardware fault <br>
* The following status value are appended since 2.6.26 (July
2008): <br>
8192 resolution (0 = us, 8192 = ns) <br>
16384 mode (0 = PLL, 16384 = FLL) <br>
32768 clock source (0 = A, 32768 = B)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t val, --tick val <br>
Set the number of microseconds that should be added to the
system time for each kernel tick interrupt. For a kernel
with USER_HZ=100, there are supposed to be 100 ticks <br>
per second, so val should be close to 10000. Increasing val
by 1 speeds up the system clock by about 100 ppm, or 8.64
sec/day. tick must be in the range <br>
900000/USER_HZ...1100000/USER_HZ. If val is rejected by the
kernel, adjtimex will determine the acceptable range through
trial and error and print it. (After completing <br>
the search, it will restore the original value.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f newfreq, --frequency newfreq
<br>
Set the system clock frequency offset to newfreq. newfreq
can be negative or positive, and gives a much finer
adjustment than the --tick switch. When USER_HZ=100, the
<br>
value is scaled such that newfreq = 65536 speeds up the
system clock by about 1 ppm, or .0864 sec/day. Thus, all of
these are about the same: <br>
--tick 9995 --frequency 32768000 <br>
--tick 10000 --frequency 0 <br>
--tick 10001 --frequency -6553600 <br>
--tick 10002 --frequency -13107200 <br>
--tick 10005 --frequency -32768000 <br>
To see the acceptable range for newfreq, use --print and
look at &quot;tolerance&quot;, or try an illegal value (e.g.
--tick 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s adj, --singleshot adj <br>
Slew the system clock by adj usec. (Its rate is changed
temporarily by about 1 part in 2000.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o adj, --offset adj <br>
Add a time offset of adj usec. The kernel code adjusts the
time gradually by adj, notes how long it has been since the
last time offset, and then adjusts the frequency <br>
offset to correct for the apparent drift. adj must be in the
range -512000...512000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S status, --status status <br>
Set kernel system clock status register to value status.
Look here above at the --print switch section for the
meaning of status, depending on your kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --reset <br>
Reset clock status after setting a clock parameter. For
early Linux kernels, using the adjtimex(2) system call to
set any time parameter the kernel think the clock is <br>
synchronized with an external time source, so it sets the
kernel variable time_status to TIME_OK. Thereafter, at 11
minute intervals, it will adjust the CMOS clock to <br>
match. We prevent this &quot;eleven minute mode&quot; by
setting the clock, because that has the side effect of
resetting time_status to TIME_BAD. We try not to actually
change <br>
the clock setting. Kernel versions 2.0.40 and later
apparently don&rsquo;t need this. If your kernel does
require it, use this option with: -t -T -t -e -m -f -s -o -c
-r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m val, --maxerror val <br>
Set maximum error (usec).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e val, --esterror val <br>
Set estimated error (usec). The maximum and estimated error
are not used by the kernel. They are merely made available
to user processes via the adjtimex(2) system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T val, --timeconstant val <br>
Set phase locked loop (PLL) time constant. val determines
the bandwidth or &quot;stiffness&quot; of the PLL. The
effective PLL time constant will be a multiple of (2^val).
For <br>
room-temperature quartz oscillators, David Mills recommends
the value 2, which corresponds to a PLL time constant of
about 900 sec and a maximum update interval of about <br>
64 sec. The maximum update interval scales directly with the
time constant, so that at the maximum time constant of 6,
the update interval can be as large as 1024 sec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values of val between zero and 2
give quick convergence; values between 2 and 6 can be used
to reduce network load, but at a modest cost in
accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c[count], --compare[=count]
<br>
Periodically compare the system clock with the CMOS clock.
After the first two calls, print values for tick and
frequency offset that would bring the system clock into <br>
approximate agreement with the CMOS clock. CMOS clock
readings are adjusted for systematic drift using using the
correction in /etc/adjtime &acirc; see hwclock(8). The <br>
interval between comparisons is 10 seconds, unless changed
by the --interval switch. The optional argument is the
number of comparisons. (If the argument is supplied, <br>
the &quot;=&quot; is required.) If the CMOS clock and the
system clock differ by more than six minutes, adjtimex will
try shifting the time from the CMOS clock by some multiple
of <br>
one hour, up to plus or minus 13 hours in all. This should
allow correct operation, including logging, if the --utc
switch was used when the CMOS clock is set to local <br>
time (or vice-versa), or if summer time has started or
stopped since the CMOS clock was last set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a[count], --adjust[=count] <br>
By itself, same as --compare, except the recommended values
are actually installed after every third comparison. With
--review, the tick and frequency are set to the <br>
least-squares estimates. (In the latter case, any count
value is ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-adjust <br>
Override the sanity check that prevents changing the clock
rate by more than 500 ppm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i tim, --interval tim <br>
Set the interval in seconds between clock comparisons for
the --compare and --adjust options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --utc <br>
The CMOS clock is set to UTC (universal time) rather than
local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --directisa <br>
To read the CMOS clock accurately, adjtimex usually accesses
the clock via the /dev/rtc device driver of the kernel, and
makes use of its CMOS update-ended interrupt to <br>
detect the beginning of seconds. It will also try /dev/rtc0
(for udev), /dev/misc/rtc (for the obsolete devfs) and
possibly others. When the /dev/rtc driver is absent, or <br>
when the interrupt is not available, adjtimex can sometimes
automatically fallback to a direct access method. This
method detects the start of seconds by polling the <br>
update-in-progress (UIP) flag of the CMOS clock. You can
force this direct access to the CMOS chip with the
--directisa switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the /dev/rtc interrupt
method is more accurate, less sensible to perturbations due
to system load, cleaner, cheaper, and is generally better
than the direct <br>
access method. It is advisable to not use the --directisa
switch, unless the CMOS chip or the motherboard don&rsquo;t
properly provide the necessary interrupt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nointerrupt <br>
Force immediate use of busywait access method, without first
waiting for the interrupt timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l[file], --log[=file] <br>
Save the current values of the system and CMOS clocks, and
optionally a reference time, to file (default
/var/log/clocks.log). The reference time is taken from a
network <br>
timeserver (see the --host switch) or supplied by the user
(see the --watch switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h timeserver, --host timeserver
<br>
Use ntpdate to query the given timeserver for the current
time. This will fail if timeserver is not running a Network
Time Protocol (NTP) server, or if that server is not <br>
synchronized. Implies --log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --watch <br>
Ask for a keypress when the user knows the time, then ask
what that time was, and its approximate accuracy. Implies
--log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r[file], --review[=file] <br>
Review the clock log file (default /var/log/clocks.log) and
estimate, if possible, the rates of the CMOS and system
clocks. Calculate least-squares rates using all <br>
suitable log entries. Suggest corrections to adjust for
systematic drift. With --adjust, the frequency and tick are
set to the suggested values. (The CMOS clock <br>
correction is not changed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Increase verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print the program
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If your system clock gained 8 seconds in 24 hours, you could
set the tick to 9999, and then it would lose 0.64 seconds a
day (that is, 1 tick unit = 8.64 seconds per day). To <br>
correct the rest of the error, you could set the frequency
offset to (2^16)*0.64/.0864 = 485452. Thus, putting the
following in rc.local would approximately correct the system
<br>
clock:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adjtimex --tick 9999 --freq
485452</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
adjtimex adjusts only the system clock &acirc; the one that
runs while the computer is powered up. To set or regulate
the CMOS clock, see hwclock(8).</p>
