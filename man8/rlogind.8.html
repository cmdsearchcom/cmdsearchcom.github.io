<p>RLOGIND(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
RLOGIND(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rlogind &acirc; remote login server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rlogind [-ahlLn]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rlogind is the server for the rlogin(1) program. The server
provides a remote login facility with authentication based
on privileged port numbers from trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options supported by
rlogind:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Ask hostname for
verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Permit use of superuser
&acirc;.rhosts&acirc; files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Prevent any authentication
based on the user&rsquo;s &acirc;.rhosts&acirc; file. If the
user is logging in as the superuser and the -h option is
used, &acirc;.rhosts&acirc; processing is still enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Prevent any authentication
based on &acirc;.rhosts&acirc; or &acirc;hosts.equiv&acirc;
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Disable keep-alive
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h, -l, and -L flags are not
used if PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) support is in
use. In this case the same effects can be achieved by
editing /etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h and -l options should
also not be trusted without verifying that they work as
expected with the particular version of libc installed on
your system (and should be tested <br>
again after any libc update) because some versions of libc
may not honor the internal flags used by rlogind. As the -L
option bypasses the libc functions entirely, it is not
sub&acirc; <br>
ject to this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that the design of the
.rhosts system is COMPLETELY INSECURE except on a carefully
firewalled private network. Always use the -L option under
all other circumstances. <br>
Also, since rlogind does not encrypt communications, it
should not, in general, be used at all. Consider ssh(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rlogind listens for service
requests at the port indicated in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;login&rsquo;&rsquo; service specification; see
services(5). When a service request is received the
following protocol is <br>
initiated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The server checks the
client&rsquo;s source port. If the port is not in the range
512-1023, the server aborts the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The server checks the
client&rsquo;s source address and requests the corresponding
host name (see gethostbyaddr(3), hosts(5) and named(8)). If
the hostname cannot be determined, <br>
the dot-notation representation of the host address is used.
If the hostname is in the same domain as the server
(according to the last two components of the domain name),
or <br>
if the -a option is given, the addresses for the hostname
are requested, verifying that the name and address
correspond. Normal authentication is bypassed if the address
ver&acirc; <br>
ification fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the source port and address
have been checked, rlogind proceeds with the authentication
process described in rshd(8). It then allocates a pseudo
terminal (see pty(4)), and <br>
manipulates file descriptors so that the slave half of the
pseudo terminal becomes the stdin, stdout, and stderr for a
login process. The login process is an instance of the <br>
login(1) program, invoked with the -f option if
authentication has succeeded. If automatic authentication
fails, the user is prompted to log in as if on a standard
terminal line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parent of the login process
manipulates the master side of the pseudo terminal,
operating as an intermediary between the login process and
the client instance of the rlogin <br>
program. In normal operation, the packet protocol described
in pty(4) is invoked to provide &acirc;^S/^Q&acirc; type
facilities and propagate interrupt signals to the remote
programs. The <br>
login process propagates the client terminal&rsquo;s baud
rate and terminal type, as found in the environment
variable, &acirc;TERM&acirc;; see environ(7). The screen or
window size of the terminal <br>
is requested from the client, and window size changes from
the client are propagated to the pseudo terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transport-level keepalive
messages are enabled unless the -n option is present. The
use of keepalive messages allows sessions to be timed out if
the client crashes or becomes <br>
unreachable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All initial diagnostic messages are indicated by a leading
byte with a value of 1, after which any network connections
are closed. If there are no errors before login is invoked,
<br>
a null byte is returned as in indication of success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try again. <br>
A fork by the server failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
login(1), ruserok(3), rshd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity
of each client machine and the connecting medium. This is
insecure, but is useful in an
&lsquo;&lsquo;open&rsquo;&rsquo; environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A facility to allow all data
exchanges to be encrypted should be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more extensible protocol
should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The rlogind command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
