<p>POST(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual POST(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
post - deliver a message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/libexec/nmh/post [-alias aliasfile] [-filter
filterfile] [-nofilter] [-format | -noformat] [-mime |
-nomime] [-msgid | -nomsgid] [-messageid localname | random]
[-verbose | <br>

[-saslmech mechanism] [-user username] [-tls] [-initialtls]
[-notls] file [-version] [-help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Post is the default program called by send to deliver the
message in file to local and remote users. In fact, most of
the features attributed to send in its manual page are
per&acirc; <br>
formed by post, with send acting as a relatively simple
preprocessor. Thus, it is post which parses the various
header fields, appends a &acirc;Date:&acirc; line, and
interacts with the <br>
mail transport system. Post will not normally be called
directly by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Post searches the
&acirc;To:&acirc;, &acirc;cc:&acirc;, &acirc;Bcc:&acirc;,
&acirc;Fcc:&acirc;, and &acirc;Resent-xxx:&acirc; header
lines of the specified message for destination addresses,
checks these addresses for validity, and for&acirc; <br>
mats them so as to conform to ARPAnet Internet Message
Format protocol, unless the -noformat flag is set. This will
normally cause &acirc;@local-site&acirc; to be appended to
each local <br>
destination address, as well as any local return addresses.
The -width columns switch can be used to indicate the
preferred length of the header components that contain <br>
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &acirc;Bcc:&acirc; field is
encountered, its addresses will be used for delivery, and
the &acirc;Bcc:&acirc; field will be removed from the
message sent to sighted recipients. The blind recipients
<br>
will receive an entirely new message with a minimal set of
headers. Included in the body of the message will be a copy
of the message sent to the sighted recipients. If -filter
<br>
filterfile is specified, then this copy is filtered
(re-formatted) by mhl prior to being sent to the blind
recipients. Alternately, if the -mime switch is given, then
post will <br>
use the MIME rules for encapsulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -alias aliasfile switch can
be used to specify a file that post should take aliases
from. More than one file can be specified, each being
preceded with -alias. In any <br>
event, the primary alias file is read first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -msgid switch indicates that
a &acirc;Message-ID:&acirc; or
&acirc;Resent-Message-ID:&acirc; field should be added to
the header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -messageid switch selects
the style used for the part appearing after the @ in
&acirc;Message-ID:&acirc;, &acirc;Resent-Message-ID:&acirc;,
and &acirc;Content-ID:&acirc; header fields. The two
acceptable <br>
options are localname (which is the default), and random.
With localname, the local hostname is used. With random, a
random sequence of characters is used instead. Note that
<br>
the -msgid switch must be enabled for this switch to have
any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -verbose switch indicates
that the user should be informed of each step of the
posting/filing process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -watch switch indicates that
the user would like to watch the transport system&rsquo;s
handling of the message (e.g., local and &acirc;fast&acirc;
delivery).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under normal circumstances, post
uses the &acirc;From:&acirc; line in the message draft as
the identity of the originating mailbox. A
&acirc;From:&acirc; line is required in all message draft.
By <br>
default the message composition utilities such as comp, repl
and mhmail will automatically place a &acirc;From:&acirc;
line in the message draft. There are two ways to override
this behav&acirc; <br>
ior, however. Note that they apply equally to
&acirc;Resent-From:&acirc; lines in messages sent with
dist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first way is to supply a
&acirc;Sender:&acirc; line. The value of this field will be
used as the originating mailbox identity when submitting the
message to the mail transport system. <br>
If multiple addresses are given in the &acirc;From:&acirc;
line, a &acirc;Sender:&acirc; line is required. If an
&acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; line is supplied when multiple
addresses are given in the &acirc;From:&acirc; line, <br>
a &acirc;Sender:&acirc; header will be generated using the
value of the &acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; line, if the
&acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; line is not blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second way is to supply a
&acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; line. The value of this field
will be used as the originating mailbox identity when
submitting the message to the mail transport <br>
system. This will override both the value of the
&acirc;From:&acirc; line and a &acirc;Sender:&acirc; line
(if one is supplied). The &acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; line
is allowed to have a blank value; if the <br>
value is blank, then the mail transport system will be
instructed to not send any bounces in response to the
message. Not all mail transport systems support this
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mail transport system
default is provided in /etc/nmh/mts.conf but can be
overriiden here with the -mts switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nmh is using the SMTP MTA,
the -server and the -port switches can be used to override
the default mail server (defined by the servers entry in
/etc/nmh/mts.conf ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nmh has been compiled with
SASL support, the -sasl and -nosasl switches will enable and
disable the use of SASL authentication with the SMTP MTA.
Depending on the SASL mecha&acirc; <br>
nism used, this may require an additional password prompt
from the user (but the netrc file can be used to store this
password, as described in the mh-profile(5) man page). The
<br>
-saslmech switch can be used to select a particular SASL
mechanism, and the -user switch can be used to select a
authorization userid to provide to SASL other than the
default. <br>
The credentials profile entry in the mh-profile(5) man page
describes the ways to supply a username and password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SASL authentication is
successful, nmh will attempt to negotiate a security layer
for session encryption. Encrypted data is labelled with
&lsquo;(sasl-encrypted)&rsquo; and &lsquo;(sasl- <br>
decrypted)&rsquo; when viewing the SMTP transaction with the
-snoop switch. The -saslmaxssf switch can be used to select
the maximum value of the Security Strength Factor. This is
an <br>
integer value and the exact meaning of this value depends on
the underlying SASL mechanism. A value of 0 disables
encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nmh has been compiled with
TLS support, the -tls and -initialtls switches will require
the negotiation of TLS when connecting to the SMTP MTA. The
-tls switch will negotiate <br>
TLS as part of the normal SMTP protocol using the STARTTLS
command. The -initialtls will negotiate TLS immediately
after the connection has taken place, before any SMTP
commands <br>
are sent or received. Encrypted data is labelled with
&lsquo;(tls-encrypted)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;(tls-decrypted)&rsquo; when viewing the SMTP
transction with the -snoop switch. The -notls switch will
<br>
disable all attempts to negotiate TLS.</p>
