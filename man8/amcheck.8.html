<p>AMCHECK(8) System Administration Commands AMCHECK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
amcheck - run Amanda self-checks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
amcheck [-am] [-w] [-sclt] [-M address] [--client-verbose]
[--exact-match] [-o configoption...] config [host
[disk...]...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Amcheck runs a number of self-checks on both the Amanda tape
server host and the Amanda client hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the tape server host, amcheck
can go through the same tape checking used at the start of
the nightly amdump run to verify the correct tape for the
next run is mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amcheck can also do a self-check
on all client hosts to make sure each host is running and
that permissions on filesystems to be backed up are
correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify many host/disk
expressions, only disks that match an expression will be
checked. All disks are checked if no expressions are
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the amanda(8) man page for
more details about Amanda.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-s <br>
Run the tape server local and tape checks (same as -lt).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Run the client host checks. Multiple specific clients can be
checked by specifying the client name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Run the local tests (e.g. permissions) on the server
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
Run the tape tests on the server host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w <br>
Enables a DESTRUCTIVE check for write-protection on the tape
(which would otherwise cause the subsequent amdump to fail).
If the tape is writable, this check causes all data <br>
after the tape label to be erased. If the autolabel option
is enabled, this check may ERASE any non-Amanda tape in the
drive or changer. The check enable the tape tests on <br>
the server host and is only made if the tape is otherwise
correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
Nothing is printed, but mail is sent if any errors are
detected. The mail goes to the mailto address specified in
the amanda.conf file or the address value if -M is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a <br>
Like -m but the mail is always sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M address <br>
Mail the report to address instead of the mailto value from
amanda.conf. Implies -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--client-verbose <br>
Print all client messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exact-match <br>
The host and disk are parsed as exact values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host [disk]* <br>
Specify the host and disk on which the command will
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o configoption <br>
See the &quot;CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE&quot; section in
amanda(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -cs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
In this example, both the tape server and client tests are
run. The results are displayed on standard output. <br>

because amdump or amflush seem to be running, WARNING: if

were running because a log file or amdump file exists. If
they are not running, you probably need to run <br>
amcleanup to clear up a previous failure. Otherwise, you
need to wait until they complete before running amcheck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: skipping tape checks <br>
