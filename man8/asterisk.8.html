<p>asterisk (8) asterisk (8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
asterisk - All-purpose telephony server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
asterisk [-BcdfFghiImnpqRtTvVW] [-C file] [-e memory] [-G
group] [-L loadaverage] [-M value] [-U user] [-s
socket-file] <br>
asterisk -r [-v] [-d] [-x command] <br>
asterisk -R [-v] [-d] [-x command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
asterisk is a full-featured telephony server which provides
Private Branch eXchange (PBX), Interactive Voice Response
(IVR), Automated Call Distribution (ACD), Voice over IP <br>
(VoIP) gatewaying, Conferencing, and a plethora of other
telephony applications to a broad range of telephony devices
including packet voice (SIP, IAX2, MGCP, Skinny, H.323, <br>
Unistim) devices (both endpoints and proxies), as well as
traditional TDM hardware including T1, E1, ISDN PRI, GR-303,
RBS, Loopstart, Groundstart, ISDN BRI and many more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At start, Asterisk reads the
/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf main configuration file and
locates the rest of the configuration files from the
configuration in that file. The -C op&acirc; <br>
tion specifies an alternate main configuration file.
Virtually all aspects of the operation of asterisk&rsquo;s
configuration files can be found in the sample configuration
files. The <br>
format for those files is generally beyond the scope of this
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running with -c, -r or -R
options, Asterisk supplies a powerful command line,
including command completion, which may be used to monitors
its status, perform a variety of <br>
administrative actions and even explore the applications
that are currently loaded into the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Asterisk is a trademark of
Digium, Inc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Running Asterisk starts the asterisk daemon (optionally
running it in the foreground). However running it with -r or
-R connects to an existing Asterisk instance through a
remote <br>
console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force the background of the
terminal to be black, in order for terminal colors to show
up properly. Equivalent to forceblackbackground = yes in
asterisk.conf. See also -n <br>
and -W.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C file <br>
Use file as master configuration file instead of the
default, /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Provide a control console on
the calling terminal. The console is similar to the remote
console provided by -r. Specifying this option implies -f
and will cause asterisk <br>
to no longer fork or detach from the controlling terminal.
Equivalent to console = yes in asterisk.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable extra debugging
statements. This parameter may be used several times, and
each increases the debug level. Equivalent to debug = num in
asterisk.conf to explicitly <br>
set the initian debug level to num. When given at startup,
this option also implies -f (no forking). However when
connecting to an existing Asterisk instance (-r or -R), <br>
it may only increase the debug level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e memory <br>
Limit the generation of new channels when the amount of free
memory has decreased to under memory megabytes. Equivalent
to minmemfree = memory in asterisk.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not fork or detach from
controlling terminal. Overrides any preceding specification
of -F on the command line. Equivalent to nofork = yes in
asterisk.conf. See also <br>
-c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Always fork and detach from
controlling terminal. Overrides any preceding specification
of -f on the command line. May also be used to prevent -d
and -v to imply no fork&acirc; <br>
ing. Equivalent to alwaysfork = yes in asterisk.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Remove resource limit on core
size, thus forcing Asterisk to dump core in the unlikely
event of a segmentation fault or abort signal. NOTE: in some
cases this may be in&acirc; <br>
compatible with the -U or -G flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G group <br>
Run as group group instead of the calling group. NOTE: this
requires substantial work to be sure that Asterisk&rsquo;s
environment has permission to write the files required for
<br>
its operation, including logs, its comm socket, the asterisk
database, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Provide brief summary of
command line arguments and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Prompt user to intialize any
encrypted private keys for IAX2 secure authentication during
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Enable internal timing if
DAHDI timing is available. The default behaviour is that
outbound packets are phase locked to inbound packets.
Enabling this switch causes them <br>
to be locked to the internal DAHDI timer instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L loadaverage <br>
Limits the maximum load average before rejecting new calls.
This can be useful to prevent a system from being brought
down by terminating too many simultaneous calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Temporarily mutes output to
the console and logs. To return to normal, use logger
mute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M value <br>
Limits the maximum number of calls to the specified value.
This can be useful to prevent a system from being brought
down by terminating too many simultaneous calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Disable ANSI colors even on
terminals capable of displaying them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p If supported by the operating
system (and executing as root), attempt to run with realtime
priority for increased performance and responsiveness within
the Asterisk <br>
process, at the expense of other programs running on the
same machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: astcanary will run
concurrently with asterisk. If astcanary stops running or is
killed, asterisk will slow down to normal process priority,
to avoid locking up the <br>
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Reduce default console output
when running in conjunction with console mode (-c).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Instead of running a new
Asterisk process, attempt to connect to a running Asterisk
process and provide a console interface for controlling
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Much like -r. Instead of
running a new Asterisk process, attempt to connect to a
running Asterisk process and provide a console interface for
controlling it. Additionally, <br>
if connection to the Asterisk process is lost, attempt to
reconnect for as long as 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s socket file name <br>
In combination with -r, connect directly to a specified
Asterisk server socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t When recording files, write
them first into a temporary holding directory, then move
them into the final location when done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Add timestamp to all
non-command related output going to the console when running
with verbose and/or logging to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U user <br>
Run as user user instead of the calling user. NOTE: this
requires substantial work to be sure that Asterisk&rsquo;s
environment has permission to write the files required for
<br>
its operation, including logs, its comm socket, the asterisk
database, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase the level of
verboseness on the console. The more times -v is specified,
the more verbose the output is. Specifying this option
implies -f and will cause aster&acirc; <br>
isk to no longer fork or detach from the controlling
terminal. This option may also be used in conjunction with
-r and -R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This always sets the
verbose level in the asterisk process, even if it is running
in the background. This will affect the size of your log
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version information
and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Display colored terminal text
as if the background were white or otherwise light in color.
Normally, terminal text is displayed as if the background
were black or other&acirc; <br>
wise dark in color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x command <br>
Connect to a running Asterisk process and execute a command
on a command line, passing any output through to standard
out and then terminating when the command execution <br>
completes. Implies -r when -R is not explicitly
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Enables executing of includes
via #exec directive. This can be useful if You want to do
#exec inside asterisk.conf</p>
