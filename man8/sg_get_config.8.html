<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_get_config - send SCSI GET CONFIGURATION command (MMC-4
+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_get_config [--brief] [--current] [--help] [--hex]
[--inner-hex] [--list] [--raw] [--readonly] [--rt=RT]
[--starting=FC] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sends a SCSI GET CONFIGURATION command to DEVICE and decodes
the response. The response includes the features and
profiles of the device. Typically these devices are CD, DVD,
<br>
HD-DVD and BD players that may (but not necessarily) have
media in them. These devices may well be connected via
ATAPI, USB or IEEE 1394 transports. In such cases they are
&quot;SCSI&quot; <br>
devices only in the sense that they use the
&quot;Multi-Media command&quot; set (MMC). MMC is a
specialized SCSI command set whose definition can be found
at http://www.t10.org .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is based on the
MMC-4 and later draft standards. See section 5 on
&quot;Features and Profile for Multi_Media devices&quot; for
more information on specific feature parameters <br>
and profiles. The manufacturer&rsquo;s product manual may
also be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since modern DVD and BD writers
support many features and profiles, the decoded output from
this utility can be large. There are various ways to cut
down the output. If the <br>
--brief option is used only the feature names are shown and
the feature parameters are not decoded. Alternatively if
only one feature is of interest then this combination of
<br>
options is appropriate: &quot;--rt=2 --starting=FC&quot;.
Another possibility is to show only the features that are
relevant to the media in the drive (i.e.
&quot;current&quot;) with the &quot;--rt=1&quot; <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --brief <br>
show the feature names but don&rsquo;t decode the parameters
of those features. When used with --list outputs known
feature names but not known profile names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --current <br>
output features marked as current. This option is equivalent
to &rsquo;--rt=1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
output the response in hex (don&rsquo;t decode
response).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --inner-hex <br>
decode to the feature name level then output each
feature&rsquo;s data in hex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
list all known feature and profile names. Ignore the device
name (if given). Simply lists the feature names and profiles
(followed by their hex values) that this utility <br>
knows about. If --brief is also given then only feature
names are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --readonly <br>
opens the DEVICE read-only rather than read-write which is
the default. The Linux sg driver needs read-write access for
the SCSI GET CONFIGURATION command but other access <br>
methods may require read-only access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rt=RT <br>
where RT is the field of that name in the GET CONFIGURATION
cdb. Allowable values are 0, 1, 2, or 3 . The
command&rsquo;s action also depends on the value given to
the --start&acirc; <br>
ing=FC option. The default value is 0. When RT is 0 then all
features, regardless of currency, are returned (whose
feature code is greater than or equal to FC given to <br>
--starting=). When RT is 1 then all current features are
returned (whose feature code is greater than or equal to
FC). When RT is 2 then the feature whose feature code is
<br>
equal to FC, if any, is returned. When RT is 3 the response
is reserved (probably yields an &quot;illegal field in
cdb&quot; error). To simplify the meanings of the RT values
are: <br>
0 : all features, current on not <br>
1 : only current features <br>
2 : only feature whose code is FC <br>
3 : reserved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --raw <br>
output response in binary (to stdout). Note that the short
form is -R unlike most other utilities in this package that
use -r for this action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --starting=FC <br>
where FC is the feature code value. This option works
closely with the --rt=RT option. The FC value is in the
range 0 to 65535 (0xffff) inclusive. Its default value is 0.
<br>
A value prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; (or a trailing
&rsquo;h&rsquo;) is interpreted as hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
There are multiple versions of the MMC (draft) standards:
MMC [1997], MMC-2 [2000], MMC-3 [2002], MMC-4 and MMC-5. The
first three are now ANSI INCITS standards with the year <br>
they became standards shown in brackets. The draft
immediately prior to standardization can be found at
http://www.t10.org . In the initial MMC standard there was
no GET CONFIGU&acirc; <br>
RATION command and the relevant information was obtained
from the &quot;CD capabilities and mechanical status mode
page&quot; (mode page 0x2a). It was later renamed the
&quot;MM capabilities <br>
and mechanical status mode page&quot; and has been made
obsolete in MMC-4 and MMC-5. The GET CONFIGURATION command
was introduced in MMC-2 and has become a replacement for
that mode <br>
page. New features such as support for &quot;BD&quot; (blue
ray) media type can only be found by using the GET
CONFIGURATION command. Hence older CD players may not
support the GET CONFIG&acirc; <br>
URATION command in which case the &quot;MM capabilities
...&quot; mode page can be checked with sdparm(8), sginfo(8)
or sg_modes(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 2.4 series of Linux
kernels the DEVICE must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In
the 2.6 series block devices can also be specified. For
example &quot;sg_get_config /dev/hdc&quot; will <br>
work in the 2.6 series kernels as long as /dev/hdc is an
ATAPI device. In the 2.6 series external DVD writers
attached via USB could be queried with &quot;sg_get_config
/dev/scd1&quot; for <br>
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_get_config is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
