<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nuttcp is a network performance measurement tool intended
for use by network and system managers. Its most basic usage
is to determine the raw TCP (or UDP) network layer <br>
throughput by transferring memory buffers from a source
system across an interconnecting network to a destination
system, either transferring data for a specified time
interval, <br>
or alternatively transferring a specified number of bytes.
In addition to reporting the achieved network throughput in
Mbps, nuttcp also provides additional useful information
<br>
related to the data transfer such as user, system, and
wall-clock time, transmitter and receiver CPU utilization,
and loss percentage (for UDP transfers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nuttcp is based on nttcp, which
in turn was an enhancement by someone at Silicon Graphics
(SGI) on the original ttcp, which was written by Mike Muuss
at BRL sometime before <br>
December 1984, to compare the performance of TCP stacks by
U.C. Berkeley and BBN to help DARPA decide which version to
place in the first BSD Unix release. nuttcp has several <br>
useful features beyond those of the basic ttcp/nttcp, such
as a server mode, rate limiting, multiple parallel streams,
and timer based usage. More recent changes include IPv6 <br>
support, IPv4 multicast, and the ability to set the maximum
segment size or TOS/DSCP bits. nuttcp is continuing to
evolve to meet new requirements that arise and to add
desired <br>
new features. nuttcp has been successfully built and run on
a variety of Solaris, SGI, and PPC/X86 Linux systems, and
should probably work fine on most flavors of Unix. It has
<br>
also been used successfully on various versions of the
Windows operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two basic modes of
operation for nuttcp. The original or classic mode is the
transmitter/receiver mode, which is also the way the
original ttcp and nttcp worked. In <br>
this mode, a receiver is first initiated on the destination
host using &quot;nuttcp -r&quot;, and then a transmitter
must be started on the source host using &quot;nuttcp
-t&quot;. This mode is <br>
somewhat deprecated and is no longer recommended for general
use. The preferred and recommended mode of operation for
nuttcp is the new client/server mode. With this mode, a <br>
server is first started on one system using &quot;nuttcp
-S&quot; (or &quot;nuttcp -1&quot;), and then a client may
either transmit data to (using &quot;nuttcp -t&quot;) or
receive data from (using &quot;nuttcp <br>
-r&quot;) the server system. All the information provided by
nuttcp is reported by the client, including the information
from the server, thus providing a full snapshot of both the
<br>
transmitter and receiver ends of the data transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server may be started by a
normal, non-privileged user by issuing either a &quot;nuttcp
-S&quot; or a &quot;nuttcp -1&quot; command. However, the
optimal and recommended method of running a <br>
server is to run &quot;nuttcp -S&quot; via the inetd/xinetd
daemon. This method has several significant advantages,
including being more robust, allowing multiple simultaneous
connec&acirc; <br>
tions, and providing for access control over who is allowed
to use the nuttcp server via the hosts.allow (and
hosts.deny) file. By default, the nuttcp server listens for
com&acirc; <br>
mands on port 5000, and the actual nuttcp data transfers
take place on port 5001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host parameter must be
specified for the transmitter, and provides the host name or
IP address of the receiver. In classic transmitter/receiver
mode, the host parameter may <br>
not be specified for the receiver. In client/server mode,
when the client is the receiver, the host parameter
specifies the host name or IP address of the transmitter
(server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, a nuttcp data transfer
is memory-to-memory. However, by using the &quot;-s&quot;
option, it is possible to also perform memory-to-disk,
disk-to-memory, and disk-to-disk data <br>
transfers. Using the &quot;-s&quot; option with the
transmitter will cause nuttcp to read its data from the
standard input instead of using a prefabricated memory
buffer, while using the <br>
&quot;-s&quot; option on the receiver causes nuttcp to write
its data to standard output. All these types of data
transfers are possible with the classic transmitter/receiver
mode. For <br>
security reasons, the &quot;-s&quot; option is disabled on
the server, so it is not possible to access the disk on the
server side of a data transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The allowed options to nuttcp
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print out a usage statement. Running nuttcp with no
arguments will also produce a usage statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the nuttcp version
number. The nuttcp version is also printed as part of the
normal nuttcp output when the &quot;-v&quot; verbose output
is used (but not when using the <br>
default brief output). In client/server mode, the version
number of both the client and server is identified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Indicates that this nuttcp is
the transmitter. In client/server mode, this means the
server specified by the host parameter is the receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Indicates that this nuttcp is
the receiver. In client/server mode, this means the server
specified by the host parameter is the transmitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Indicates that this nuttcp is
the server. The only option that may be specified to the
server is the &quot;-P&quot; option, which allows one to
change the control port used by the <br>
server, but only when the server is started by a normal,
non-privileged user. When the server is initiated by
inetd/xinetd, the server control port should be specified in
<br>
the services file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Basically the same as the
&quot;-S&quot; option, but indicates a one-shot server, i.e.
the server exits after the first data transfer initiated by
a client. The &quot;-1&quot; option should <br>
only be used when the server is started by a normal,
non-privileged user. This option will probably rarely need
to be used, but can be useful for a quick test and
elimi&acirc; <br>
nates the possibilty of leaving a non-access controlled
nuttcp server running on the system (which can happen when
using the &quot;-S&quot; option and forgetting to kill the
nuttcp <br>
server after finishing a series of tests).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Produce brief one-line
output, which includes the amount of data transferred in MB
(1024**2 bytes), the time interval in seconds, the TCP (or
UDP) network throughput in <br>
Mbps (millions of bits per second), the transmitter and/or
receiver CPU utilization, and for UDP data transfers also
outputs the loss percentage. In client/server mode, <br>
most of the printed statistics are from the viewpoint of the
receiver. This is the default output format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B This option is only valid for
the receiver, and forces the receiver to read a full buffer
(as specified by the &quot;-l&quot; buffer length option)
from the network. It is mainly <br>
intended to be used with the &quot;-s&quot; option to only
output full buffers to standard output (e.g. for use with
tar). It is also implicitly set whenever the number of
streams <br>
as specified by the &quot;-N&quot; option is greater than 1.
This option is not passed to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d For TCP data transfers, sets
the SO_DEBUG option on the data socket. This option is not
passed to the server. It is a rarely used option which may
possibly be removed or <br>
renamed in a future version of nuttcp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D This option is only valid for
the transmitter, and only for TCP data transfers, in which
case it sets the TCP_NODELAY option on the data socket,
which turns off the Nagle <br>
algorithm causing data packets to be sent as soon as
possible without introducing any unnecessary delays. This
option is not passed to the server. It is a rarely used <br>
option which may possibly be removed or renamed in a future
version of nuttcp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Setting the &quot;-s&quot;
option causes nuttcp to either read its data from standard
input rather than using prefabricated memory buffers (for
&quot;nuttcp -t&quot;), or to write its data <br>
out to standard output (for &quot;nuttcp -r&quot;). The
&quot;-s&quot; option is disabled for security reasons on
the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Use UDP for the data transfer
instead of the default of TCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output that provides
some additional information related to the data transfer. In
client/server mode, the server is always verbose (implicit
&quot;-v&quot; option), but the <br>
client controls the extent and type of output via the
&quot;-v&quot; and &quot;-b&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cdscp_value <br>
Sets the socket option to support COS. Either takes a dscp
value or with the t|T modifier it takes the full TOS
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lbuffer_len <br>
Length of the network write/read buffer in bytes for the
transmitter/receiver. It defaults to 64 KB (65536) for TCP
data transfers and to 8 KB (8192) for UDP. For <br>
client/server mode, it sets both the client and server
buffer lengths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nnum_bufs <br>
Specifies the number of source buffers written to the
network (default is unlimited), and is ignored by the
receiver. For client/server mode, if the client issues a
<br>
&quot;nuttcp -r&quot; command making it the receiver, this
parameter is passed to the server since the server is the
transmitter in this case. This parameter is also ignored if
the <br>
&quot;-s&quot; parameter is specified to the
transmitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wwindow_size <br>
Indicates the window size in KB of the transmitter (for
&quot;nuttcp -t&quot;) or receiver (for &quot;nuttcp
-r&quot;). Actually, to be technically correct, it sets the
sender or receiver <br>
TCP socket buffer size, which then effectively sets the
window size. For client/server mode, both the transmitter
and receiver window sizes are set. The default window <br>
size is architecture and system dependent. Note recent Linux
systems, out of a misguided desire to be helpful, double
whatever window size is actually specified by the <br>
user (this is not a bug with nuttcp but a bug/feature of the
Linux kernel). Also, with these Linux systems, the actual
window size that&rsquo;s used on the intervening network,
<br>
as observed with tcpdump, is greater than the requested
window size, but less than the doubled value set by
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wsserver_window <br>
For client/server mode, the &quot;-ws&quot; option provides
a mechanism for setting a different window size on the
server than the client window size as specified with the
&quot;-w&quot; <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wb Normally, to conserve
memory, the transmitter only sets the TCP send socket buffer
size and the receiver only sets the TCP receive socket
buffer size. However, if the <br>
&quot;-wb&quot; option is used, the transmitter will also
set the TCP receive socket buffer size and the receiver will
also set the TCP send socket buffer size. Under normal
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances, this should never be necessary. This option was
implemented because certain early braindead Solaris 2.8
systems would not properly set the TCP window size <br>
unless both the TCP send and receive socket buffer sizes
were set (later Solaris 2.8 systems have corrected this
deficiency). Thus the &rsquo;b&rsquo; in this option can
stand either <br>
for &quot;braindead&quot; or &quot;both&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pdata_port <br>
Port number used for the data connection, which defaults to
port 5001. If multiple streams are specified with the
&quot;-N&quot; option, the &quot;-p&quot; option specifies
the starting port <br>
number for the data connection. For example, if four streams
are specified using the default data connection port number,
nuttcp will use ports 5001, 5002, 5003, and 5004 <br>
for the four TCP (or UDP) connections used to perform the
data transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Pcontrol_port <br>
For client/server mode, specifies the port number used for
the control connection between the client and server, and
defaults to port 5000. On the server side, the
&quot;-P&quot; <br>
option should only be used when the server is started
manually by the user. If the server is started by
inetd/xinetd (the preferred method), the control connection
must <br>
be specified by adding a nuttcp entry to the services
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nnum_streams <br>
Species the number of parallel TCP (or UDP) data streams to
be used for the data transfer, with the default being a
single data stream. The maximum number of parallel <br>
data streams that can be used is 128. If the number of
streams is greater than one, the &quot;-B&quot; option is
implicitly set. The current implementation does not fork off
sepa&acirc; <br>
rate processes for each data stream, so specifying multiple
streams on an SMP machine will not take advantage of its
multiple processors. Of course it is always possible <br>
to run multiple nuttcp commands in parallel on an SMP system
to determine if there is any advantage to running on
multiple processors. This is especially simple to do <br>
when running in client/server mode when the server is
started from the inetd/xinetd daemon. When running multiple
nuttcp commands in parallel, the &quot;-T&quot; transmitter
time&acirc; <br>
out option may be used to insure that all the nuttcp
commands finish at approximately the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rxmit_rate_limit[m|g] <br>
The transmitter rate limit throttles the speed at which the
transmitter sends data to the network, and by default is in
Kbps, although the &rsquo;m&rsquo; or &rsquo;g&rsquo; suffix
may be used to <br>
specify Mbps or Gbps. This option may be used with either
TCP or UDP data streams. Because of the way this option is
currently implemented, it will consume all the <br>
available CPU on the transmitter side of the connection so
the &quot;%TX&quot; stats are not meaningful when using the
rate limit option. By default the rate limit is applied to
<br>
the average rate of the data transfer in real time, and not
in CPU time, so if nuttcp is switched out of the processor
for any reason, when it is switched back in, it is <br>
possible that the instantaneous rate may momentarily exceed
the specified value. There is an &rsquo;i&rsquo; qualifier
to the rate limit option (specified as &quot;-Ri&quot;) that
will <br>
restrict the instantaneous rate at any given point in time
to the specified value, although in this case the final rate
reported by nuttcp may be less than the specified <br>
value since nuttcp won&rsquo;t attempt to catch up if other
processes gain control of the CPU. The default is no rate
limit. Note another way to throttle the throughput of TCP
<br>
data streams is to reduce the window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Txmit_time_limit[m] <br>
Limits the amount of time that the transmitter will send
data to the specified number of seconds, or number of
minutes if the &rsquo;m&rsquo; suffix is used. Normally a
data transfer <br>
will either specify a fixed amount of data to send using the
&quot;-n&quot; option, or a fixed period of time to send
using the &quot;-T&quot; option. However, if both the
&quot;-n&quot; and &quot;-T&quot; <br>
options are used, the data transfer will be stopped by
whichever option takes affect first. The default is a 10
second time limit for the data transfer.</p>
