<p>mkfs.xfs(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
mkfs.xfs(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mkfs.xfs - construct an XFS filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mkfs.xfs [ -b block_size ] [ -m global_metadata_options ] [
-d data_section_options ] [ -f ] [ -i inode_options ] [ -l
log_section_options ] [ -n naming_options ] [ -p protofile
<br>

[ -L label ] [ -N ] [ -K ] device <br>
mkfs.xfs -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mkfs.xfs constructs an XFS filesystem by writing on a
special file using the values found in the arguments of the
command line. It is invoked automatically by mkfs(8) when it
is <br>
given the -t xfs option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In its simplest (and most
commonly used form), the size of the filesystem is
determined from the disk driver. As an example, to make a
filesystem with an internal log on the <br>
first partition on the first SCSI disk, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metadata log can be placed
on another device to reduce the number of disk seeks. To
create a filesystem on the first partition on the first SCSI
disk with a 10000 block log <br>
located on the first partition on the second SCSI disk,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkfs.xfs -l
logdev=/dev/sdb1,size=10000b /dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the option elements in
the argument list above can be given as multiple
comma-separated suboptions if multiple suboptions apply to
the same option. Equivalently, each <br>
main option can be given multiple times with different
suboptions. For example, -l internal,size=10000b and -l
internal -l size=10000b are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the descriptions below, sizes
are given in sectors, bytes, blocks, kilobytes, megabytes,
gigabytes, etc. Sizes are treated as hexadecimal if prefixed
by 0x or 0X, octal if <br>
prefixed by 0, or decimal otherwise. The following lists
possible multiplication suffixes: <br>
s - multiply by sector size (default = 512, see -s option
below). <br>
b - multiply by filesystem block size (default = 4K, see -b
option below). <br>
k - multiply by one kilobyte (1,024 bytes). <br>
m - multiply by one megabyte (1,048,576 bytes). <br>
g - multiply by one gigabyte (1,073,741,824 bytes). <br>
t - multiply by one terabyte (1,099,511,627,776 bytes). <br>
p - multiply by one petabyte (1,024 terabytes). <br>
e - multiply by one exabyte (1,048,576 terabytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b block_size_options <br>
This option specifies the fundamental block size of the
filesystem. The valid block_size_options are: log=value or
size=value and only one can be supplied. The block <br>
size is specified either as a base two logarithm value with
log=, or in bytes with size=. The default value is 4096
bytes (4 KiB), the minimum is 512, and the maximum is <br>
65536 (64 KiB). Although mkfs.xfs will accept any of these
values and create a valid filesystem, XFS on Linux can only
mount filesystems with pagesize or smaller blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m global_metadata_options <br>
These options specify metadata format options that either
apply to the entire filesystem or aren&rsquo;t easily
characterised by a specific functionality group. The valid
<br>
global_metadata_options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crc=value <br>
This is used to create a filesystem which maintains and
checks CRC information in all metadata objects on disk. The
value is either 0 to disable the feature, <br>
or 1 to enable the use of CRCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRCs enable enhanced error
detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format changes
also improves crash recovery algorithms and the ability of
various tools <br>
to validate and repair metadata corruptions when they are
found. The CRC algorithm used is CRC32c, so the overhead is
dependent on CPU architecture as some <br>
CPUs have hardware acceleration of this algorithm. Typically
the overhead of calculating and checking the CRCs is not
noticeable in normal operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, mkfs.xfs will enable
metadata CRCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finobt=value <br>
This option enables the use of a separate free inode btree
index in each allocation group. The value is either 0 to
disable the feature, or 1 to create a free <br>
inode btree in each allocation group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The free inode btree mirrors the
existing allocated inode btree index which indexes both used
and free inodes. The free inode btree does not index used
inodes, <br>
allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation
performance as filesystems age.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, mkfs.xfs will not
create free inode btrees for filesystems. This is for
backwards compatibility with older RHEL7 kernels. If the
free inode btree <br>
is enabled, older RHEL7 kernels will not be able to mount
the created filesystem. When the option -m crc=0 is used,
the free inode btree feature is not sup&acirc; <br>
ported and is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uuid=value <br>
Use the given value as the filesystem UUID for the newly
created filesystem. The default is to generate a random
UUID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d data_section_options <br>
These options specify the location, size, and other
parameters of the data section of the filesystem. The valid
data_section_options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agcount=value <br>
This is used to specify the number of allocation groups. The
data section of the filesystem is divided into allocation
groups to improve the performance of <br>
XFS. More allocation groups imply that more parallelism can
be achieved when allocating blocks and inodes. The minimum
allocation group size is 16 MiB; the <br>
maximum size is just under 1 TiB. The data section of the
filesystem is divided into value allocation groups (default
value is scaled automatically based on <br>
the underlying device size).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agsize=value <br>
This is an alternative to using the agcount suboption. The
value is the desired size of the allocation group expressed
in bytes (usually using the m or g suf&acirc; <br>
fixes). This value must be a multiple of the filesystem
block size, and must be at least 16MiB, and no more than
1TiB, and may be automatically adjusted to <br>
properly align with the stripe geometry. The agcount and
agsize suboptions are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name=value <br>
This can be used to specify the name of the special file
containing the filesystem. In this case, the log section
must be specified as internal (with a size, <br>
see the -l option below) and there can be no real-time
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file[=value] <br>
This is used to specify that the file given by the name
suboption is a regular file. The value is either 0 or 1,
with 1 signifying that the file is regular. <br>
This suboption is used only to make a filesystem image. If
the value is omitted then 1 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=value <br>
This is used to specify the size of the data section. This
suboption is required if -d file[=1] is given. Otherwise, it
is only needed if the filesystem should <br>
occupy less space than the size of the special file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sunit=value <br>
This is used to specify the stripe unit for a RAID device or
a logical volume. The value has to be specified in 512-byte
block units. Use the su suboption to <br>
specify the stripe unit size in bytes. This suboption
ensures that data allocations will be stripe unit aligned
when the current end of file is being extended <br>
and the file size is larger than 512KiB. Also inode
allocations and the internal log will be stripe unit
aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su=value <br>
This is an alternative to using sunit. The su suboption is
used to specify the stripe unit for a RAID device or a
striped logical volume. The value has to be <br>
specified in bytes, (usually using the m or g suffixes).
This value must be a multiple of the filesystem block
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swidth=value <br>
This is used to specify the stripe width for a RAID device
or a striped logical volume. The value has to be specified
in 512-byte block units. Use the sw sub&acirc; <br>
option to specify the stripe width size in bytes. This
suboption is required if -d sunit has been specified and it
has to be a multiple of the -d sunit subop&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sw=value <br>
suboption is an alternative to using swidth. The sw
suboption is used to specify the stripe width for a RAID
device or striped logical volume. The value is <br>
expressed as a multiplier of the stripe unit, usually the
same as the number of stripe members in the logical volume
configuration, or data disks in a RAID <br>
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a filesystem is created on
a logical volume device, mkfs.xfs will automatically query
the logical volume for appropriate sunit and swidth
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noalign <br>
This option disables automatic geometry detection and
creates the filesystem without stripe geometry alignment
even if the underlying storage device provides <br>
this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force overwrite when an
existing filesystem is detected on the device. By default,
mkfs.xfs will not write to the device if it suspects that
there is a filesystem or par&acirc; <br>
tition table on the device already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i inode_options <br>
This option specifies the inode size of the filesystem, and
other inode allocation parameters. The XFS inode contains a
fixed-size part and a variable-size part. The <br>
variable-size part, whose size is affected by this option,
can contain: directory data, for small directories;
attribute data, for small attribute sets; symbolic link <br>
data, for small symbolic links; the extent list for the
file, for files with a small number of extents; and the root
of a tree describing the location of extents for the <br>
file, for files with a large number of extents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid inode_options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=value | log=value |
perblock=value <br>
The inode size is specified either as a value in bytes with
size=, a base two logarithm value with log=, or as the
number fitting in a filesystem block with <br>
perblock=. The minimum (and default) value is 256 bytes. The
maximum value is 2048 (2 KiB) subject to the restriction
that the inode size cannot exceed one <br>
half of the filesystem block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XFS uses 64-bit inode numbers
internally; however, the number of significant bits in an
inode number is affected by filesystem geometry. In
practice, filesys&acirc; <br>
tem size and inode size are the predominant factors. The
Linux kernel (on 32 bit hardware platforms) and most
applications cannot currently handle inode num&acirc; <br>
bers greater than 32 significant bits, so if no inode size
is given on the command line, mkfs.xfs will attempt to
choose a size such that inode numbers will be <br>
&lt; 32 bits. If an inode size is specified, or if a
filesystem is sufficiently large, mkfs.xfs will warn if this
will create inode numbers &gt; 32 significant <br>
bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxpct=value <br>
This specifies the maximum percentage of space in the
filesystem that can be allocated to inodes. The default
value is 25% for filesystems under 1TB, 5% for <br>
filesystems under 50TB and 1% for filesystems over 50TB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default inode allocation
mode, inode blocks are chosen such that inode numbers will
not exceed 32 bits, which restricts the inode blocks to the
lower <br>
portion of the filesystem. The data block allocator will
avoid these low blocks to accommodate the specified maxpct,
so a high value may result in a filesystem <br>
with nothing but inodes in a significant portion of the
lower blocks of the filesystem. (This restriction is not
present when the filesystem is mounted with <br>
the inode64 option on 64-bit platforms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting the value to 0 means
that essentially all of the filesystem can become inode
blocks, subject to inode32 restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This value can be modified with
xfs_growfs(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">align[=value] <br>
This is used to specify that inode allocation is or is not
aligned. The value is either 0 or 1, with 1 signifying that
inodes are allocated aligned. If the <br>
value is omitted, 1 is assumed. The default is that inodes
are aligned. Aligned inode access is normally more efficient
than unaligned access; alignment must <br>
be established at the time the filesystem is created, since
inodes are allocated at that time. This option can be used
to turn off inode alignment when the <br>
filesystem needs to be mountable by a version of IRIX that
does not have the inode alignment feature (any release of
IRIX before 6.2, and IRIX 6.2 without XFS <br>
patches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attr=value <br>
This is used to specify the version of extended attribute
inline allocation policy to be used. By default, this is 2,
which uses an efficient algorithm for <br>
managing the available inline inode space between attribute
and extent data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The previous version 1, which
has fixed regions for attribute and extent data, is kept for
backwards compatibility with kernels older than version
2.6.16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">projid32bit[=value] <br>
This is used to enable 32bit quota project identifiers. The
value is either 0 or 1, with 1 signifying that 32bit projid
are to be enabled. If the value is <br>
omitted, 1 is assumed. (This default changed in release
version 3.2.0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sparse[=value] <br>
Enable sparse inode chunk allocation. This experimental
option is not available in RHEL7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l log_section_options <br>
These options specify the location, size, and other
parameters of the log section of the filesystem. The valid
log_section_options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal[=value] <br>
This is used to specify that the log section is a piece of
the data section instead of being another device or logical
volume. The value is either 0 or 1, with <br>
1 signifying that the log is internal. If the value is
omitted, 1 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logdev=device <br>
This is used to specify that the log section should reside
on the device separate from the data section. The internal=1
and logdev options are mutually exclu&acirc; <br>
sive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=value <br>
This is used to specify the size of the log section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the log is contained within
the data section and size isn&rsquo;t specified, mkfs.xfs
will try to select a suitable log size depending on the size
of the filesys&acirc; <br>
tem. The actual logsize depends on the filesystem block size
and the directory block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the size suboption is
only needed if the log section of the filesystem should
occupy less space than the size of the special file. The
value is <br>
specified in bytes or blocks, with a b suffix meaning
multiplication by the filesystem block size, as described
above. The overriding minimum value for size is <br>
512 blocks. With some combinations of filesystem block size,
inode size, and directory block size, the minimum log size
is larger than 512 blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version=value <br>
This specifies the version of the log. The current default
is 2, which allows for larger log buffer sizes, as well as
supporting stripe-aligned log writes (see <br>
the sunit and su options, below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The previous version 1, which is
limited to 32k log buffers and does not support
stripe-aligned writes, is kept for backwards compatibility
with very old 2.4 <br>
kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sunit=value <br>
This specifies the alignment to be used for log writes. The
value has to be specified in 512-byte block units. Use the
su suboption to specify the log stripe <br>
unit size in bytes. Log writes will be aligned on this
boundary, and rounded up to this boundary. This gives major
improvements in performance on some con&acirc; <br>
figurations such as software RAID5 when the sunit is
specified as the filesystem block size. The equivalent byte
value must be a multiple of the filesystem <br>
block size. Version 2 logs are automatically selected if the
log sunit suboption is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The su suboption is an
alternative to using sunit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su=value <br>
This is used to specify the log stripe. The value has to be
specified in bytes, (usually using the s or b suffixes).
This value must be a multiple of the <br>
filesystem block size. Version 2 logs are automatically
selected if the log su suboption is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lazy-count=value <br>
This changes the method of logging various persistent
counters in the superblock. Under metadata intensive
workloads, these counters are updated and logged <br>
frequently enough that the superblock updates become a
serialization point in the filesystem. The value can be
either 0 or 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With lazy-count=1, the
superblock is not modified or logged on every change of the
persistent counters. Instead, enough information is kept in
other parts of <br>
the filesystem to be able to maintain the persistent counter
values without needed to keep them in the superblock. This
gives significant improvements in per&acirc; <br>
formance on some configurations. The default value is 1 (on)
so you must specify lazy-count=0 if you want to disable this
feature for older kernels which <br>
don&rsquo;t support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n naming_options <br>
These options specify the version and size parameters for
the naming (directory) area of the filesystem. The valid
naming_options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=value | log=value <br>
The block size is specified either as a value in bytes with
size=, or as a base two logarithm value with log=. The block
size must be a power of 2 and cannot <br>
be less than the filesystem block size. The default size
value for version 2 directories is 4096 bytes (4 KiB),
unless the filesystem block size is larger <br>
than 4096, in which case the default value is the filesystem
block size. For version 1 directories the block size is the
same as the filesystem block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version=value <br>
The naming (directory) version value can be either 2 or
&rsquo;ci&rsquo;, defaulting to 2 if unspecified. With
version 2 directories, the directory block size can be any
<br>
power of 2 size from the filesystem block size up to
65536.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version=ci option enables
ASCII only case-insensitive filename lookup and version 2
directories. Filenames are case-preserving, that is, the
names are <br>
stored in directories using the case they were created
with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Version 1 directories are
not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftype=value <br>
This feature allows the inode type to be stored in the
directory structure so that the readdir(3) and getdents(2)
do not need to look up the inode to determine <br>
the inode type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value is either 0 or 1, with
1 signifiying that filetype information will be stored in
the directory structure. The default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When CRCs are enabled via -m
crc=1, the ftype functionality is always enabled. This
feature can not be turned off for such filesystem
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p protofile <br>
If the optional -p protofile argument is given, mkfs.xfs
uses protofile as a prototype file and takes its directions
from that file. The blocks and inodes specifiers in <br>
the protofile are provided for backwards compatibility, but
are otherwise unused. The syntax of the protofile is defined
by a number of tokens separated by spaces or new&acirc; <br>
lines. Note that the line numbers are not part of the syntax
but are meant to help you in the following discussion of the
file contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 /stand/diskboot <br>
2 4872 110 <br>
3 d--777 3 1 <br>
4 usr d--777 3 1 <br>
5 sh ---755 3 1 /bin/sh <br>
6 ken d--755 6 1 <br>
7 $ <br>
8 b0 b--644 3 1 0 0 <br>
9 c0 c--644 3 1 0 0 <br>
10 fifo p--644 3 1 <br>
11 slink l--644 3 1 /a/symbolic/link <br>
12 : This is a comment line <br>
13 $ <br>
14 $</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line 1 is a dummy string. (It
was formerly the bootfilename.) It is present for backward
compatibility; boot blocks are not used on SGI systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some string of
characters must be present as the first line of the proto
file to cause it to be parsed correctly; the value of this
string is immaterial since it <br>
is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line 2 contains two numeric
values (formerly the numbers of blocks and inodes). These
are also merely for backward compatibility: two numeric
values must appear at this <br>
point for the proto file to be correctly parsed, but their
values are immaterial since they are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lines 3 through 11 specify
the files and directories you want to include in this
filesystem. Line 3 defines the root directory. Other
directories and files that you <br>
want in the filesystem are indicated by lines 4 through 6
and lines 8 through 10. Line 11 contains symbolic link
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice the dollar sign ($)
syntax on line 7. This syntax directs the mkfs.xfs command
to terminate the branch of the filesystem it is currently on
and then continue from <br>
the directory specified by the next line, in this case line
8. It must be the last character on a line. The colon on
line 12 introduces a comment; all characters up <br>
until the following newline are ignored. Note that this
means you cannot have a file in a prototype file whose name
contains a colon. The $ on lines 13 and 14 end the <br>
process, since no additional specifications follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File specifications provide the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* file mode <br>
* user ID <br>
* group ID <br>
* the file&rsquo;s beginning contents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A 6-character string defines the
mode for a file. The first character of this string defines
the file type. The character range for this first character
is -bcdpl. A file <br>
may be a regular file, a block special file, a character
special file, directory files, named pipes (first-in, first
out files), and symbolic links. The second character <br>
of the mode string is used to specify setuserID mode, in
which case it is u. If setuserID mode is not specified, the
second character is -. The third character of the <br>
mode string is used to specify the setgroupID mode, in which
case it is g. If setgroupID mode is not specified, the third
character is -. The remaining characters of the <br>
mode string are a three digit octal number. This octal
number defines the owner, group, and other read, write, and
execute permissions for the file, respectively. For <br>
more information on file permissions, see the chmod(1)
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following the mode character
string are two decimal number tokens that specify the user
and group IDs of the file&rsquo;s owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a regular file, the next
token specifies the pathname from which the contents and
size of the file are copied. In a block or character special
file, the next token are <br>
two decimal numbers that specify the major and minor device
numbers. When a file is a symbolic link, the next token
specifies the contents of the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the file is a directory,
the mkfs.xfs command creates the entries dot (.) and dot-dot
(..) and then reads the list of names and file
specifications in a recursive <br>
manner for all of the entries in the directory. A scan of
the protofile is always terminated with the dollar ( $ )
token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet option. Normally
mkfs.xfs prints the parameters of the filesystem to be
constructed; the -q flag suppresses this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r realtime_section_options <br>
These options specify the location, size, and other
parameters of the real-time section of the filesystem. The
valid realtime_section_options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rtdev=device <br>
This is used to specify the device which should contain the
real-time section of the filesystem. The suboption value is
the name of a block device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extsize=value <br>
This is used to specify the size of the blocks in the
real-time section of the filesystem. This value must be a
multiple of the filesystem block size. The min&acirc; <br>
imum allowed size is the filesystem block size or 4 KiB
(whichever is larger); the default size is the stripe width
for striped volumes or 64 KiB for non- <br>
striped volumes; the maximum allowed size is 1 GiB. The
real-time extent size should be carefully chosen to match
the parameters of the physical media used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size=value <br>
This is used to specify the size of the real-time section.
This suboption is only needed if the real-time section of
the filesystem should occupy less space <br>
than the size of the partition or logical volume containing
the section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noalign <br>
This option disables stripe size detection, enforcing a
realtime device with no stripe geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sector_size <br>
This option specifies the fundamental sector size of the
filesystem. The sector_size is specified either as a value
in bytes with size=value or as a base two logarithm <br>
value with log=value. The default sector_size is 512 bytes.
The minimum value for sector size is 512; the maximum is
32768 (32 KiB). The sector_size must be a power of 2 <br>
size and cannot be made larger than the filesystem block
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L label <br>
Set the filesystem label. XFS filesystem labels can be at
most 12 characters long; if label is longer than 12
characters, mkfs.xfs will not proceed with creating the <br>
filesystem. Refer to the mount(8) and xfs_admin(8) manual
entries for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Causes the file system
parameters to be printed out without really creating the
file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Do not attempt to discard
blocks at mkfs time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the version number and
exits.</p>

With a prototype file, it is not possible to specify hard
links.</p>
