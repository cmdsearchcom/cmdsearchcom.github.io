      executing the command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--always-prefix</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or
      communicating in-band. This option is primarily useful for scripting
      purposes. Option will be ignored if specified with the <b>-C</b>
    option.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOSTRANGED_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#HOSTRANGED_SUPPORT">HOSTRANGED
  SUPPORT</a></h1>
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated lists of hosts
  or a range of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt;
  m and l &lt; k, etc. The later form should not be confused with regular
  expression character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does
  not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN
  naming convention and specification of ranges should not be considered
  necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
  foo[1,9].
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some examples of range usage follow:
<pre>
    foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
    foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
    foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ]) for
  pattern matching. Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to enclose
  ranged lists within quotes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When multiple hosts are specified by the user, a thread will be executed for
  each host in parallel up to the configured fanout (which can be adjusted via
  the <b>-F</b> option). This will allow communication to large numbers of nodes
  far more quickly than if done in serial.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, standard output from each node specified will be output with the
  hostname prepended to each line. Although this output is readable in many
  situations, it may be difficult to read in other situations. For example,
  output from multiple nodes may be mixed together. The <b>-B</b> and <b>-C</b>
  options can be used to change this default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In-band IPMI Communication will be used when the host &quot;localhost&quot; is
  specified. This allows the user to add the localhost into the hostranged
  output.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GENERAL_TROUBLESHOOTING"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERAL_TROUBLESHOOTING">GENERAL
  TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h1>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.
  Double check to make sure the following are configured properly in the remote
  machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
  enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN enablement, and
  allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make
  sure the cipher suite privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
  <b>bmc-config(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change these
  configuration settings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly configured drivers or
  non-standard BMCs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
  also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and
  worked around.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages. For additional
  support, please e-mail the &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;username invalid&quot; - The username entered (or a NULL username if none
  was entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also be possible
  the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;password invalid&quot; - The password entered (or a NULL password if none
  was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the password for the user
  is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;password verification timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed out.
  A &quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above) or a generic
  &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below) occurred. During this point in
  the protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was
  entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not correctly
  configured on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;privilege level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher
  user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to authenticate
  with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating to a different user
  which has a higher maximum privilege.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;privilege level cannot be obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege
  level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
  allowed for this user. Please try again with a lower privilege. It may also be
  possible the maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
  properly on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
  authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not available for this
  privilege level. Please try again with an alternate authentication type or
  alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the available
  authentication types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on
  the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;cipher suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
  authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please try again with an
  alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the available cipher suite
  ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote
  machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;connection timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of
  potential errors are possible, including an invalid hostname specified, an
  IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server,
  the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and
  connectivity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;session timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.
  If this error occurs often, you may wish to increase the retransmission
  timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;device not found&quot; - The specified device could not be found. Please
  check configuration or inputs and try again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;driver timeout&quot; - Communication with the driver or device has timed
  out. Please try again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;message timeout&quot; - Communication with the driver or device has timed
  out. Please try again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;BMC busy&quot; - The BMC is currently busy. It may be processing
  information or have too many simultaneous sessions to manage. Please wait and
  try again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;could not find inband device&quot; - An inband device could not be found.
  Please check configuration or specify specific device or driver on the command
  line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;driver timeout&quot; - The inband driver has timed out communicating to
  the local BMC or service processor. The BMC or service processor may be busy
  or (worst case) possibly non-functioning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;internal IPMI error&quot; - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does
  not know how to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to report
  the issue.

With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions, different
  vendors may implement their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following
  describes a number of workarounds currently available to handle discovered
  compliance issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they
  will be transparent to the user. However, some will require the user to
  specify a workaround be used via the -W option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was
  discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
  below. Similar machines from vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems.
  Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware
  developer, so it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if
  your motherboard is not listed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe your hardware has an additional compliance issue that needs a
  workaround to be implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
  &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or &lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>assumeio</i> - This workaround flag will assume inband interfaces communicate
  with system I/O rather than being memory-mapped. This will work around systems
  that report invalid base addresses. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;device not supported&quot; or &quot;could not find inband device&quot;
  errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>spinpoll</i> - This workaround flag will inform some inband drivers (most
  notably the KCS driver) to spin while polling rather than putting the process
  to sleep. This may significantly improve the wall clock running time of tools
  because an operating system scheduler's granularity may be much larger than
  the time it takes to perform a single IPMI message transaction. However, by
  spinning, your system may be performing less useful work by not contexting out
  the tool for a more useful task.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>authcap</i> - This workaround flag will skip early checks for username
  capabilities, authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
  authentication to succeed. It works around multiple issues in which the remote
  system does not properly report username capabilities, authentication
  capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;username
  invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege
  level&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
  P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450
  with ELOM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>nochecksumcheck</i> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check
  the checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works around systems
  that return invalid checksums due to implementation errors, but the packet is
  otherwise valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it removes
  validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is
  unlikely to be an issue in most situations. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;, or &quot;password
  verification timeout&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
  &quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too. Issue observed on
  Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>idzero</i> - This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be accepted
  by the client. It works around IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs to
  the client. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
  errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>unexpectedauth</i> - This workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null
  authcodes to be checked as though they were expected. It works around an issue
  when packets contain non-null authentication data when they should be null due
  to disabled per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell PowerEdge
  2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>forcepermsg</i> - This workaround flag will force per-message authentication
  to be used no matter what is advertised by the remote system. It works around
  an issue when per-message authentication is advertised as disabled on the
  remote system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those hitting
  this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on IBM
  eServer 325.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>endianseq</i> - This workaround flag will flip the endian of the session
  sequence numbers to allow the session to continue properly. It works around
  IPMI 1.5 session sequence numbers that are the wrong endian. Those hitting
  this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
  Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>noauthcodecheck</i> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check
  the authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works
  around systems that return invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
  implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
  removes an authentication check verifying the validity of a packet. However,
  in most organizations, this is unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting
  this issue may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session
  timeout&quot;, or &quot;password verification timeout&quot; errors. Issue
  observed on Xyratex FB-H8-SRAY.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>intel20</i> - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0
  authentication issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
  password truncation if the authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those
  hitting this issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
  invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Intel
  SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>supermicro20</i> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro
  IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI firmware. The
  issues covered include handling invalid length authentication codes. Those
  hitting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed
  on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver
  firmware.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>sun20</i> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0
  authentication issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash keys,
  improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this
  issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot; errors.
  Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM. This workaround
  automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>opensesspriv</i> - This workaround flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI's IPMI
  2.0 connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing algorithm used by the
  remote system. The privilege level sent during the Open Session stage of an
  IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level
  sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see
  &quot;password invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus
  status code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM,
  Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
  S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta
  QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is automatically triggered with the
  &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>integritycheckvalue</i> - This workaround flag will work around an invalid
  integrity check value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
  Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be 0 length, however the
  remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue
  may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG,
  Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and Intel
  S2600JF/Appro 512X.
<div class="Pp"></div>
No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to
  not support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;ipmi 2.0
  unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be
  worked around by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
  <b>--driver-type</b>= <i>LAN_2_0</i>. Issue observed on HP Proliant DL 145.

On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other
  potentially security relevant information on the command line, this
  information may be discovered by other users when using tools like the
  <b>ps(1)</b> command or looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
  secure to input password information with options like the -P or -K options.
  Configuring security relevant information in the FreeIPMI configuration file
  would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock
  up&quot; after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need to wait
  awhile in order to this temporary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may
  authenticate again.
