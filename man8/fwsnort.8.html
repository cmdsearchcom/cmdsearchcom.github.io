<p>FWSNORT(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual FWSNORT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fwsnort - Firewall Snort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fwsnort [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fwsnort translates SNORT rules into iptables rules on Linux
systems and generates a corresponding iptables policy in
iptables-save format. This ruleset allows network traffic
<br>
that matches Snort signatures (i.e. attacks and other
suspicious network behavior) to be logged and/or dropped by
iptables directly without putting an interface into
promiscuous <br>
mode or queuing packets from kernel to user space. Note that
fwsnort can also build an iptables policy that combines the
string match extension with the NFQUEUE or QUEUE targets
<br>
to allow the kernel to perform preliminary string matches
that are defined within Snort rules before queuing matching
packets to a userspace snort_inline instance. Because the
<br>
bulk of network communications are not generallly malicious,
this should provide a speedup for snort_inline since the
majority of packets do not then have to be copied from
ker&acirc; <br>
nel memory into user memory and subsequently inspected by
snort_inline. There is a tradeoff here in terms of signature
detection however because snort_inline when deployed in <br>
this way does not have the opportunity to see all packets
associated with a session, so stream reassembly and
signature comparisons against a reassembled buffer do not
take place <br>
(the stream preprocessor should be disabled in the userspace
snort_inline instance).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of fwsnort-1.5 all iptables
rules built by fwsnort are written out to the
/var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort.save file in iptables-save format.
This allows a long fwsnort policy (which <br>
may contain thousands of iptables rules translated from a
large Snort signature set) to be quickly instantiated via
the &quot;iptables-restore&quot; command. A wrapper script
<br>
/var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh is also written out to make this
easy. Hence, the typical work flow for fwsnort is to: 1) run
fwsnort, 2) note the Snort rules that fwsnort was able <br>
to successfully translate (the number of such rules is
printed to stdout), and then 3) execute the
/var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh wrapper script to instantiate
the policy in the <br>
running kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwsnort (optionally) uses the
IPTables::Parse CPAN module to parse the iptables ruleset on
the machine to determine which Snort rules are applicable to
the specific iptables pol&acirc; <br>
icy. After all, if iptables is blocking all inbound http
traffic from external addresses for example, it is probably
not of much use to try detecting inbound attacks against
<br>
against tcp/80. By default fwsnort generates iptables rules
that log Snort sid&rsquo;s within a --log-prefix to syslog
where the messages can be analyzed with a log analyzer such
as <br>
psad (see http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/). fwsnort relies
on the iptables string match module to match Snort content
fields in the application portion of ip traffic. Since <br>
Snort rules can contain hex data in content fields
(specified between pipe &quot;|&quot; characters), fwsnort
implements a patch against iptables (which has been accepted
by the Netfilter <br>
project as of iptables-1.2.7a) which adds a
&quot;--hex-string&quot; option. This allow iptables to
accept content fields from Snort rules such as
&quot;|0d0a5b52504c5d3030320d0a|&quot; without any <br>
modification. fwsnort is able to translate approximately 60%
of all rules from the Snort-2.3.3 IDS into equivalent
iptables rules. For more information about the translation
<br>
strategy as well as advantages/disadvantages of the method
used by fwsnort to obtain intrusion detection data, see the
README included with the fwsnort sources or browse to: <br>
http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwsnort/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwsnort is able to apply Snort
rules to IPv6 traffic by building an ip6tables policy (see
the &quot;--ip6tables&quot; command line argument).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --config &lt;configuration file&gt; <br>
By default fwsnort makes use of the configuration file
/etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.conf for almost all configuration
parameters. fwsnort can be made to override this path by
<br>
specifying a different file on the command line with the
--config option. When fwsnort is not executed as root, then
a path to a readable fwsnort.conf file is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update-rules <br>
Download the latest Emerging Threats rules from
http://www.emergingthreats.net This will overwrite the
emerging-all.rules file in the /etc/fwsnort/snort_rules/
directory. <br>
Note that the automatic downloading of Snort rules from
http://www.snort.org/ as of March, 2005 is only offered as a
pay service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rules-url &lt;url&gt; <br>
Specify the URL to use when updating the Emerging Threats
rule set (or any other rule set). The default URL is:
http://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/snort-2.9.0/emerg&acirc;
<br>
ing-all.rules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ip6tables <br>
Enable ip6tables mode so that the fwsnort rule set is built
into an ip6tables policy instead of the iptables policy.
This allows fwsnort controls to apply to IPv6 traf&acirc;
<br>
fic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-type &lt;rules
type&gt; <br>
Restrict to processing snort rules of &lt;rules type&gt;.
Example rule types would include &quot;ddos&quot;,
&quot;backdoor&quot;, and &quot;web-attacks&quot;. This
option also supports a comma-separated <br>
list of types, e.g. &quot;ddos,backdoor&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-type &lt;rules
type&gt; <br>
Exclude all Snort rules from of type &lt;rules type&gt; from
the translation process. For example, if you don&rsquo;t
want any rules from the file emerging-all.rules to be
trans&acirc; <br>
lated, then use &quot;emerging-all&quot; as the argument to
this option. A comma-separated list of types to exclude can
be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-regex &lt;regex&gt;
<br>
Only translate Snort rules that match the specified regular
expression. This is useful to build fwsnort policies for
Snort rules that have a common characteristic (such as <br>
a string match on the word &quot;Storm&quot; for the Storm
worm for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-regex &lt;regex&gt;
<br>
Translate all Snort rules except those that match the
specified regular expression. This is useful to omit Snort
rules from fwsnort policies that have a common
character&acirc; <br>
istic (such as a string match on &quot;HTTP_PORTS&quot; for
example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-re-caseless <br>
Make the rule matchine regular expression specified with
--include-regex match case insensitively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-re-caseless <br>
Make the rule matchine regular expression specified with
--exclude-regex match case insensitively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--snort-rdir
&lt;snort-rules-directory&gt; <br>
Manually specify the directory where the snort rules files
are located. The default is /etc/fwsnort/snort_rules.
Multiple directories are supported as a comma-separated <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--snort-rfile
&lt;snort-rules-file&gt; <br>
Manually specify a Snort rules file to translated into
iptables rules. Multiple files are also supported as a
comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--snort-sid &lt;sid&gt; <br>
Generate an iptables ruleset for a single snort rule
specified by &lt;sid&gt;. A comma-separated list of sids can
be specified, e.g. &quot;2001842,1834&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-sid &lt;sid&gt; <br>
Provide a list of Snort ID&rsquo;s to be excluded from the
translation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-perl-triggers <br>
Include &rsquo;perl -e print ... &rsquo; commands as
comments in the fwsnort.sh script. These commands allow
payloads that are designed to trigger snort rules to easily
be built, and <br>
when combined with netcat (or other software that can send
bytes over the wire) it becomes possible to test whether an
fwsnort policy appropriately triggers on matching <br>
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-script &lt;script file&gt;
<br>
Specify the path to the iptables script generated by
fwsnort. The default location is
/var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-check-capabilities <br>
Check iptables capabilities and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Last-cmd <br>
Run fwsnort with the same command line arguments as the
previous execution. This is a convenient way of rebuilding
the /var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh script without having <br>
to remember what the last command line args were.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--NFQUEUE <br>
Build an fwsnort policy that sends packets that match Snort
content or uricontent fields to userspace via the iptables
NFQUEUE target for further analysis. This is a <br>
mechanism for reducing the signature inspection load placed
on snort_inline. A parallel set of Snort rules that are
successfully translated are placed in the /etc/fws&acirc;
<br>
nort/snort_rules_queue directory. This requires
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_NFQUEUE support in the Linux
kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--QUEUE <br>
Same as the --NFQUEUE command line argument except that the
older QUEUE target is used instead of the NFQUEUE target.
This requires CONFIG_IP_NF_QUEUE support in the <br>
Linux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--queue-num &lt;num&gt; <br>
Specify a queue number in --NFQUEUE mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--queue-pre-match-max
&lt;num&gt; <br>
In --QUEUE or --NFQUEUE mode, limit the number of content
matches that are performed within the kernel before sending
a matching packet to a userspace Snort instance. <br>
This allows a level of tuning with respect to how much work
the kernel does to qualify a packet based on a signature
match before having Snort do the same thing. The <br>
default is to perform all specified content matches in the
signature before queuing the packet to userspace because the
multiple in-kernel content matches is probably less <br>
expensive than sending a packet to userspace by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--string-match-alg &lt;alg&gt;
<br>
Specify the string matching algorithm to use with the
kernel. By default, this is &rsquo;bm&rsquo; for the
&rsquo;Boyer-Moore&rsquo; string matching algorithm, but
&rsquo;kmp&rsquo; may also be specified <br>
(short for the &rsquo;Knuth&acirc;Morris&acirc;Pratt&rsquo;
algorithm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-apply <br>
Execute the iptables script generated by fwsnort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-exec <br>
Synonym for --ipt-apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-revert <br>
Revert to a version of the iptables policy without any
fwsnort rules. Note that this reverts to the iptables policy
as it was when fwsnort was originally executed. So, <br>
it is not recommended to use this option if there is a large
amount of time between when fwsnort is run to translate
Snort rules vs. running it with this option. For most <br>
purposes it is better to use the --ipt-flush option
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-flush <br>
Flush all fwsnort currently active iptables rules (flushes
the fwsnort chains).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-list <br>
List all fwsnort currently active iptables rules (lists the
fwsnort chains).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-drop <br>
For each logging rule generated by fwsnort add a
corresponding DROP rule. Note that for TCP sessions using
this option will cause retransmissions as packets that are
part <br>
of established sessions selectively dropped. Remember that
false positives are common occurrences for intrusion
detection systems, and so using this or the --ipt-reject
<br>
option may break things on your network! You have been
warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-reject <br>
For each logging rule generated by fwsnort add a
corresponding REJECT rule. Reset packets will be generated
for TCP sessions through the use of the &quot;--reject-with
tcp- <br>
reset&quot; option, and ICMP port unreachable messages will
be generated for UDP packets through the use of the
&quot;--reject-with icmp-port-unreachable&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --Conntrack-state
&lt;state&gt; <br>
Specify a conntrack state in place of the
&quot;established&quot; state that commonly accompanies the
Snort &quot;flow&quot; keyword. By default, fwsnort uses the
conntrack state of &quot;ESTAB&acirc; <br>
LISHED&quot; for this. In certain corner cases, it might be
useful to use &quot;ESTABLISHED,RELATED&quot; instead to
apply application layer inspection to things like ICMP port
unreach&acirc; <br>
able messages that are responses to real attempted
communications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-log <br>
By default fwsnort generates an iptables script that
implements a logging rule for each successfully translated
snort rule. This can be disabled with the --no-ipt-log <br>
option, but --ipt-drop must also be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-sync <br>
This is a deprecated option since the default behavior is to
translate as many Snort rules into iptables rules as
possible. With fwsnort able to produce iptables rules in
<br>
iptables-save format, it is extremely fast to instantiate a
large set of translated Snort rules into an iptables policy.
A new --ipt-sync option has been added to reverse <br>
this behavior (not recommended).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipt-sync <br>
Consult the iptables policy currently running on the machine
for applicable snort rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-test <br>
Do not test the iptables build for existence of support for
the LOG and REJECT targets, and ascii and hex string
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-jumps <br>
Do not jump packets from the built-in iptables INPUT,
OUTPUT, and FORWARD chains to the custom fwsnort chains.
This options is mostly useful to make it easy to manually
<br>
alter the placement of the jump rules in the iptables
ruleset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-rule-nums <br>
By default fwsnort includes the rule number within the
logging prefix for each of the rules it adds to the fwsnort
chains. E.g. the logging prefix for rule 34 would look <br>
something like &quot;[34] SID1242 ESTAB&quot;. Use this
option to not include the rule number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-comments <br>
If the iptables &quot;comment&quot; match exists, then
fwsnort puts the Snort &quot;msg&quot;,
&quot;classtype&quot;, &quot;reference&quot;,
&quot;priority&quot;, and &quot;rev&quot; fields within a
comment for each iptables rule. <br>
Use this option to disable this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-INPUT <br>
Do not jump packets from the iptables INPUT chain to the
fwsnort chains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-OUTPUT <br>
Do not jump packets from the iptables OUTPUT chain to the
fwsnort chains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-FORWARD <br>
Do not jump packets from the iptables FORWARD chain to the
fwsnort chains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-fast-pattern-ordering <br>
Cause fwsnort to not try to reorder pattern matches to
process the longest pattern first. The Snort fast_pattern
keyword is also ignored if this option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --Home-net
&lt;network/mask&gt; <br>
Specify the internal network instead of having fwsnort
derive it from the HOME_NET keyword in the fwsnort.conf
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --External-net
&lt;network/mask&gt; <br>
Specify the external network instead of having fwsnort
derive it from the EXTERNAL_NET keyword in the fwsnort.conf
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-addresses <br>
Disable all checks against the output of ifconfig for proper
IP addresses. This is useful if fwsnort is running on a
bridging firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Dump-conf <br>
Print the fwsnort configuration on STDOUT and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Run in debug mode. This will cause all parse errors which
are normally written to the fwsnort logfile
/var/log/fwsnort.log to be written to STDOUT instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strict <br>
Run fwsnort in &quot;strict&quot; mode. This will prevent
fwsnort from translating snort rules that contain the
keywords &quot;offset&quot;, &quot;uricontent&quot;, and
&quot;depth&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --Ulog <br>
Force the usage of the ULOG target for all log messages
instead of the default LOG target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ulog-nlgroup <br>
Specify the netlink group for ULOG rules. Such rules are
only added for Snort rules that have an action of
&quot;log&quot;, or when fwsnort is run in --Ulog mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --logfile &lt;logfile&gt;
<br>
By default fwsnort logs all parse errors to the logfile
/var/log/fwsnort.log. This path can be manually changed with
the --logfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Run fwsnort in verbose mode. This will cause fwsnort to add
the original snort rule as a comment to the fwsnort.sh
script for each successfully translated rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --Version <br>
Print the fwsnort version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print usage information on STDOUT and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/fwnort/fwsnort.conf <br>
The fwsnort configuration file. The path to this file can be
changed on the command line with --config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/fwnort/fwsnort.sh <br>
The iptables script generated by fwsnort. The path can be
manually specified on the command line with the --ipt-script
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FWSNORT CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
<br>
This section describes what each of the more important
fwsnort configuration variables do and how they can be tuned
to meet your needs. These variables are located in the
fws&acirc; <br>
nort configuration file /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME_NET <br>
fwsnort uses the same HOME_NET and EXTERNAL_NET variables as
defined in Snort rules, and the same semantics are
supported. I.e., individual IP addresses or networks in <br>
standard dotted-quad or CIDR notation can be specified, and
comma separated lists are also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTERNAL_NET <br>
Defines the external network. See the HOME_NET variable for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples illustrate the command line arguments
that could be supplied to fwsnort in a few situations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Script generation in logging
mode, parse errors written to the fwsnort logfile, and
iptables policy checking are enabled by default without
having to specify any command line <br>
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># fwsnort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generate ip6tables rules for
attacks delivered over IPv6:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># fwsnort -6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generate iptables rules for ddos
and backdoor Snort rules only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># fwsnort --include-type

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generate iptables rules for
Snort ID&rsquo;s 2008475 and 2003268 (from
emerging-all.rules):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwsnort --snort-sid

userspace via the NFQUEUE target and restrict exclude the
INPUT and OUTPUT chains:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwsnort --snort-sid 1834,2001842
--NFQUEUE --no-ipt-INPUT --no-ipt-OUTPUT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instruct fwsnort to only inspect
traffic that traverses the eth0 and eth1 interfaces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># fwsnort --restrict-intf
eth0,eth1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generate iptables rules for
Snort rules that appear to be allowed by the local iptables
policy, and write original snort rules to the iptables
script as a comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># fwsnort --ipt-sync
--verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPENDENCIES <br>
fwsnort requires that the iptables string match module be
compiled into the kernel (or as a loadable kernel module) in
order to be able to match snort signatures that make use of
<br>
the &quot;content&quot; keyword. Note that the --no-opt-test
option can be specified to have fwsnort generate an iptables
script even if the string match module is not compiled
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwsnort also requires the
IPTables::Parse CPAN module in order to parse iptables
policies. This module is bundled with the fwsnort sources in
the deps/ directory for conve&acirc; <br>
nience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The --debug option can be used to display on STDOUT any
errors that are generated as fwsnort parses each snort rule.
Normally these errors are written to the fwsnort logfile
<br>
/var/log/fwsnort.log</p>
