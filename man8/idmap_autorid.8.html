<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
idmap_autorid - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_autorid Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The idmap_autorid backend provides a way to use an
algorithmic mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs that is
more deterministic than idmap_tdb and easier to configure
than <br>
idmap_rid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The module works similar to
idmap_rid, but it automatically configures the range to be
used for each domain, so there is no need to specify a
specific range for each domain in <br>
the forest, the only configuration that is needed is the
range of uid/gids that shall be used for user/group mappings
and an optional size of the ranges to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mappings of which domain is
mapped to which range is stored in autorid.tdb, thus you
should backup this database regularly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the algorithm being used,
it is the module that is most easy to use as it only
requires a minimal configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDMAP OPTIONS <br>
range = low - high <br>
Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which
the backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a
filter. If algorithmically determined UID or GID fall <br>
outside the range, they are ignored and the corresponding
map is discarded. It is intended as a way to avoid
accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely
defined <br>
IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rangesize = numberofidsperdomain
<br>
Defines the number of uids/gids available per domain range.
The minimum needed value is 2000. SIDs with RIDs larger than
this value will be mapped into extension ranges <br>
depending upon number of available ranges. If the autorid
backend runs out of available ranges, mapping requests for
new domains (or new extension ranges for domains already
<br>
known) are ignored and the corresponding map is
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: with rangesize set to
10000, users/groups with a RID up to 10000 will be put into
the first range for the domain. When attempting to map the
an object with a RID of <br>
25000, an extension range will be allocated that will then
be used to map all RIDs from 20000-29999.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One range will be used for local
users and groups and for non-domain well-known SIDs like
Everyone (S-1-1-0) or Creator Owner (S-1-3-0). A chosen list
of well-known SIDs will <br>
be preallocated on first start to create deterministic
mappings for those.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus the number of local users
and groups that can be created is limited by this option as
well. If you plan to create a large amount of local users or
groups, you will need <br>
set this parameter accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 100000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read only = [ yes | no ] <br>
Turn the module into read-only mode. No new ranges will be
allocated nor will new mappings be created in the idmap
pool. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore builtin = [ yes | no ]
<br>
Ignore any mapping requests for the BUILTIN domain. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE MAPPING FORMULAS <br>
The Unix ID for a RID is calculated this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID = REDUCED RID + IDMAP RANGE
LOW VALUE + RANGE NUMBER * RANGE SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where REDUCED RID = RID %
RANGE_SIZE and a DOMAIN RANGE INDEX = RID / RANGE_SIZE is
used together with the domain sid to determine the RANGE
NUMBER (stored in the database).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Correspondingly, the formula for
calculating the RID for a given Unix ID is this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RID = (ID - LOW ID) % RANGE SIZE
+ DOMAIN RANGE INDEX * RANGE SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the DOMAIN RANGE INDEX is
retrieved from the database along with the domain sid by the
RANGE NUMBER = (ID - LOW ID) / RANGE SIZE .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example shows you the minimal configuration that will
work for the principal domain and 19 trusted domains / range
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[global] <br>
security = ads <br>
workgroup = CUSTOMER <br>
realm = CUSTOMER.COM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idmap config * : backend =
autorid <br>
idmap config * : range = 1000000-1999999</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example shows how to
configure idmap_autorid as default for all domains with a
potentially large amount of users plus a specific
configuration for a trusted domain that uses <br>
the SFU mapping scheme. Please note that idmap ranges and
sfu ranges are not allowed to overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[global] <br>
security = ads <br>
workgroup = CUSTOMER <br>
realm = CUSTOMER.COM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idmap config * : backend =
autorid <br>
idmap config * : range = 1000000-19999999 <br>
idmap config * : rangesize = 1000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idmap config TRUSTED : backend =
ad <br>
idmap config TRUSTED : range = 50000 - 99999 <br>
idmap config TRUSTED : schema_mode = sfu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux <br>
kernel is developed.</p>
