<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bareos-dbcheck - Bareos&rsquo;s Catalog Database Check/Clean
program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dbcheck [options] working-directory bareos-database user
password [dbhost] [dbport]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the bareos-dbcheck
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bareos-dbcheck will not repair
your database if it is broken. Please see your
vendor&rsquo;s instructions for fixing broken database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bareos-dbcheck is a simple
program that will search for logical inconsistencies in the
Bareos tables in your database, and optionally fix them. It
is a database maintenance rou&acirc; <br>
tine, in the sense that it can detect and remove unused
rows, but it is not a database repair routine. To repair a
database, see the tools furnished by the database vendor.
Nor&acirc; <br>
mally dbcheck should never need to be run, but if Bareos has
crashed or you have a lot of Clients, Pools, or Jobs that
you have removed, it could be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A summary of options is included below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? Show version and usage of
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b If specified, dbcheck will
run in batch mode, and it will proceed to examine and fix
(if -f is set) all programmed inconsistency checks. By
default, dbcheck will enter <br>
interactive mode (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B print catalog configuration
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config <br>
If the -c option is given with the Director&rsquo;s conf
file, there is no need to enter any of the command line
arguments, in particular the working directory as dbcheck
will <br>
read them from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C catalog <br>
catalog name in the director conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d nnn set debug level to
nnn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dt print timestamp in debug
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D drivername <br>
Specify the database driver name (default NULL)
&lt;postgresql|mysql|sqlite3&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f If specified, dbcheck will
repair (fix) the inconsistencies it finds. Otherwise, it
will report only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Set verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE MODE <br>
In interactive mode dbcheck will prompt with the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hello, this is the database
check/correct program. Please select the function you want
to perform. <br>
1) Toggle modify database flag <br>
2) Toggle verbose flag <br>
3) Repair bad Filename records <br>
4) Repair bad Path records <br>
5) Eliminate duplicate Filename records <br>
6) Eliminate duplicate Path records <br>
7) Eliminate orphaned Jobmedia records <br>
8) Eliminate orphaned File records <br>
9) Eliminate orphaned Path records <br>
10) Eliminate orphaned Filename records <br>
11) Eliminate orphaned FileSet records <br>
12) Eliminate orphaned Client records <br>
13) Eliminate orphaned Job records <br>
14) Eliminate all Admin records <br>
15) Eliminate all Restore records <br>
16) All (3-15) <br>
17) Quit Select function number:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By entering 1 or 2, you can
toggle the modify database flag (-f option) and the verbose
flag (-v). It can be helpful and reassuring to turn off the
modify database flag, then <br>
select one or more of the consistency checks (items 3
through 9) to see what will be done, then toggle the modify
flag on and re-run the check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inconsistencies examined are
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate filename records. This
can happen if you accidentally run two <br>
copies of Bareos at the same time, and they are both adding
filenames <br>
simultaneously. It is a rare occurrence, but will create an
<br>
inconsistent database. If this is the case, you will receive
error <br>
messages during Jobs warning of duplicate database records.
If you are <br>
not getting these error messages, there is no reason to run
this check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repair bad Filename records.
This checks and corrects filenames that have <br>
a trailing slash. They should not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repair bad Path records. This
checks and corrects path names that do not <br>
have a trailing slash. They should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate path records. This can
happen if you accidentally run two copies <br>
of Bareos at the same time, and they are both adding
filenames <br>
simultaneously. It is a rare occurrence, but will create an
<br>
inconsistent database. See the item above for why this
occurs and how <br>
you know it is happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orphaned JobMedia records. This
happens when a Job record is deleted <br>
(perhaps by a user issued SQL statement), but the
corresponding JobMedia <br>
record (one for each Volume used in the Job) was not
deleted. Normally, <br>
this should not happen, and even if it does, these records
generally do <br>
not take much space in your database. However, by running
this check, <br>
you can eliminate any such orphans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orphaned File records. This
happens when a Job record is deleted (perhaps <br>
by a user issued SQL statement), but the corresponding File
record (one <br>
for each Volume used in the Job) was not deleted. Note,
searching for <br>
these records can be very time consuming (i.e. it may take
hours) for a <br>
large database. Normally this should not happen as Bareos
takes care to <br>
prevent it. Just the same, this check can remove any
orphaned File <br>
records. It is recommended that you run this once a year
since orphaned <br>
File records can take a large amount of space in your
database. You <br>
might want to ensure that you have indexes on JobId,
FilenameId, and <br>
PathId for the File table in your catalog before running
this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orphaned Path records. This
condition happens any time a directory is <br>
deleted from your system and all associated Job records have
been <br>
purged. During standard purging (or pruning) of Job records,
Bareos <br>
does not check for orphaned Path records. As a consequence,
over a <br>
period of time, old unused Path records will tend to
accumulate and use <br>
space in your database. This check will eliminate them. It
is <br>
recommended that you run this check at least once a
year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orphaned Filename records. This
condition happens any time a file is <br>
deleted from your system and all associated Job records have
been <br>
purged. This can happen quite frequently as there are quite
a large <br>
number of files that are created and then deleted. In
addition, if you <br>
do a system update or delete an entire directory, there can
be a very <br>
large number of Filename records that remain in the catalog
but are no <br>
longer used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During standard purging (or
pruning) of Job records, Bareos does not <br>
check for orphaned Filename records. As a consequence, over
a period of <br>
time, old unused Filename records will accumulate and use
space in your <br>
database. This check will eliminate them. It is strongly
recommended <br>
that you run this check at least once a year, and for large
database <br>
(more than 200 Megabytes), it is probably better to run this
once every <br>
6 months.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orphaned Client records. These
records can remain in the database long <br>
after you have removed a client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orphaned Job records. If no
client is defined for a job or you do not run <br>
a job for a long time, you can accumulate old job records.
This option <br>
allow you to remove jobs that are not attached to any client
(and thus <br>
useless).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Admin records. This command
will remove all Admin records, <br>
regardless of their age.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Restore records. This
command will remove all Restore records, <br>
regardless of their age.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By the way, I personally run
dbcheck only where I have messed up my database due to a bug
in developing Bareos code, so normally you should never need
to run dbcheck inspite of <br>
the recommendations given above, which are given so that
users don&rsquo;t waste their time running dbcheck too
often.</p>
