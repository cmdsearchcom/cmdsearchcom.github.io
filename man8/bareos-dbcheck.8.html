This manual page documents briefly the <b>bareos-dbcheck</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
bareos-dbcheck will not repair your database if it is broken. Please see your
  vendor's instructions for fixing broken database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
bareos-dbcheck is a simple program that will search for logical inconsistencies
  in the Bareos tables in your database, and optionally fix them. It is a
  database maintenance routine, in the sense that it can detect and remove
  unused rows, but it is not a database repair routine. To repair a database,
  see the tools furnished by the database vendor. Normally dbcheck should never
  need to be run, but if Bareos has crashed or you have a lot of Clients, Pools,
  or Jobs that you have removed, it could be useful.

In interactive mode dbcheck will prompt with the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hello, this is the database check/correct program. Please select the function
  you want to perform.
<br/>
 1) Toggle modify database flag
<br/>
 2) Toggle verbose flag
<br/>
 3) Repair bad Filename records
<br/>
 4) Repair bad Path records
<br/>
 5) Eliminate duplicate Filename records
<br/>
 6) Eliminate duplicate Path records
<br/>
 7) Eliminate orphaned Jobmedia records
<br/>
 8) Eliminate orphaned File records
<br/>
 9) Eliminate orphaned Path records
<br/>
 10) Eliminate orphaned Filename records
<br/>
 11) Eliminate orphaned FileSet records
<br/>
 12) Eliminate orphaned Client records
<br/>
 13) Eliminate orphaned Job records
<br/>
 14) Eliminate all Admin records
<br/>
 15) Eliminate all Restore records
<br/>
 16) All (3-15)
<br/>
 17) Quit Select function number:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By entering 1 or 2, you can toggle the modify database flag (-f option) and the
  verbose flag (-v). It can be helpful and reassuring to turn off the modify
  database flag, then select one or more of the consistency checks (items 3
  through 9) to see what will be done, then toggle the modify flag on and re-run
  the check.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The inconsistencies examined are the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Duplicate filename records. This can happen if you accidentally run two
<br/>
 copies of Bareos at the same time, and they are both adding filenames
<br/>
 simultaneously. It is a rare occurrence, but will create an
<br/>
 inconsistent database. If this is the case, you will receive error
<br/>
 messages during Jobs warning of duplicate database records. If you are
<br/>
 not getting these error messages, there is no reason to run this check.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Repair bad Filename records. This checks and corrects filenames that have
<br/>
 a trailing slash. They should not.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Repair bad Path records. This checks and corrects path names that do not
<br/>
 have a trailing slash. They should.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Duplicate path records. This can happen if you accidentally run two copies
<br/>
 of Bareos at the same time, and they are both adding filenames
<br/>
 simultaneously. It is a rare occurrence, but will create an
<br/>
 inconsistent database. See the item above for why this occurs and how
<br/>
 you know it is happening.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Orphaned JobMedia records. This happens when a Job record is deleted
<br/>
 (perhaps by a user issued SQL statement), but the corresponding JobMedia
<br/>
 record (one for each Volume used in the Job) was not deleted. Normally,
<br/>
 this should not happen, and even if it does, these records generally do
<br/>
 not take much space in your database. However, by running this check,
<br/>
 you can eliminate any such orphans.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Orphaned File records. This happens when a Job record is deleted (perhaps
<br/>
 by a user issued SQL statement), but the corresponding File record (one
<br/>
 for each Volume used in the Job) was not deleted. Note, searching for
<br/>
 these records can be very time consuming (i.e. it may take hours) for a
<br/>
 large database. Normally this should not happen as Bareos takes care to
<br/>
 prevent it. Just the same, this check can remove any orphaned File
<br/>
 records. It is recommended that you run this once a year since orphaned
<br/>
 File records can take a large amount of space in your database. You
<br/>
 might want to ensure that you have indexes on JobId, FilenameId, and
<br/>
 PathId for the File table in your catalog before running this command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Orphaned Path records. This condition happens any time a directory is
<br/>
 deleted from your system and all associated Job records have been
<br/>
 purged. During standard purging (or pruning) of Job records, Bareos
<br/>
 does not check for orphaned Path records. As a consequence, over a
<br/>
 period of time, old unused Path records will tend to accumulate and use
<br/>
 space in your database. This check will eliminate them. It is
<br/>
 recommended that you run this check at least once a year.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Orphaned Filename records. This condition happens any time a file is
<br/>
 deleted from your system and all associated Job records have been
<br/>
 purged. This can happen quite frequently as there are quite a large
<br/>
 number of files that are created and then deleted. In addition, if you
<br/>
 do a system update or delete an entire directory, there can be a very
<br/>
 large number of Filename records that remain in the catalog but are no
<br/>
 longer used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 During standard purging (or pruning) of Job records, Bareos does not
<br/>
 check for orphaned Filename records. As a consequence, over a period of
<br/>
 time, old unused Filename records will accumulate and use space in your
<br/>
 database. This check will eliminate them. It is strongly recommended
<br/>
 that you run this check at least once a year, and for large database
<br/>
 (more than 200 Megabytes), it is probably better to run this once every
<br/>
 6 months.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Orphaned Client records. These records can remain in the database long
<br/>
 after you have removed a client.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Orphaned Job records. If no client is defined for a job or you do not run
<br/>
 a job for a long time, you can accumulate old job records. This option
<br/>
 allow you to remove jobs that are not attached to any client (and thus
<br/>
 useless).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All Admin records. This command will remove all Admin records,
<br/>
 regardless of their age.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All Restore records. This command will remove all Restore records,
<br/>
 regardless of their age.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By the way, I personally run dbcheck only where I have messed up my database due
  to a bug in developing Bareos code, so normally you should never need to run
  dbcheck inspite of the recommendations given above, which are given so that
  users don't waste their time running dbcheck too often.
