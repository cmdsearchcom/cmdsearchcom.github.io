<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nmbd - NetBIOS name server to provide NetBIOS over IP naming
services to clients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nmbd [-D|--daemon] [-F|--foreground] [-S|--log-stdout]
[-i|--interactive] [-V] [-d &lt;debug level&gt;] [-H|--hosts
&lt;lmhosts file&gt;] [-l &lt;log directory&gt;] [-p|--port
&lt;port number&gt;] <br>
[-s &lt;configuration file&gt;] [--no-process-group]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmbd is a server that
understands and can reply to NetBIOS over IP name service
requests, like those produced by SMB/CIFS clients such as
Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows <br>
2000, Windows XP and LanManager clients. It also
participates in the browsing protocols which make up the
Windows &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot; view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMB/CIFS clients, when they
start up, may wish to locate an SMB/CIFS server. That is,
they wish to know what IP number a specified host is
using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amongst other services, nmbd
will listen for such requests, and if its own NetBIOS name
is specified it will respond with the IP number of the host
it is running on. Its &quot;own <br>
NetBIOS name&quot; is by default the primary DNS name of the
host it is running on, but this can be overridden by the
netbios name in smb.conf. Thus nmbd will reply to broadcast
<br>
queries for its own name(s). Additional names for nmbd to
respond on can be set via parameters in the smb.conf(5)
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmbd can also be used as a WINS
(Windows Internet Name Server) server. What this basically
means is that it will act as a WINS database server,
creating a database from name <br>
registration requests that it receives and replying to
queries from clients for these names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, nmbd can act as a
WINS proxy, relaying broadcast queries from clients that do
not understand how to talk the WINS protocol to a WINS
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-D|--daemon <br>
If specified, this parameter causes nmbd to operate as a
daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the
background, fielding requests on the appropriate port. By
<br>
default, nmbd will operate as a daemon if launched from a
command shell. nmbd can also be operated from the inetd
meta-daemon, although this is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F|--foreground <br>
If specified, this parameter causes the main nmbd process to
not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the
terminal. Child processes are still created as normal <br>
to service each connection request, but the main process
does not exit. This operation mode is suitable for running
nmbd under process supervisors such as supervise and <br>
svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein&rsquo;s daemontools package,
or the AIX process monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S|--log-stdout <br>
If specified, this parameter causes nmbd to log to standard
output rather than a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i|--interactive <br>
If this parameter is specified it causes the server to run
&quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if the
server is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting
this <br>
parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when run from the
command line. nmbd also logs to standard output, as if the
-S parameter had been given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?|--help <br>
Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Display brief usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H|--hosts &lt;filename&gt; <br>
NetBIOS lmhosts file. The lmhosts file is a list of NetBIOS
names to IP addresses that is loaded by the nmbd server and
used via the name resolution mechanism name resolve <br>
order described in smb.conf(5) to resolve any NetBIOS name
queries needed by the server. Note that the contents of this
file are NOT used by nmbd to answer any name queries. <br>
Adding a line to this file affects name NetBIOS resolution
from this host ONLY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default path to this file is
compiled into Samba as part of the build process. Common
defaults are /usr/local/samba/lib/lmhosts,
/usr/samba/lib/lmhosts or <br>
/etc/samba/lmhosts. See the lmhosts(5) man page for details
on the contents of this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--debuglevel=level <br>
level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
parameter is not specified is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The higher this value, the more
detail will be logged to the log files about the activities
of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious
warnings will be <br>
logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running
- it generates a small amount of information about
operations carried out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Levels above 1 will generate
considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used
when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed
for use only by developers <br>
and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that specifying this
parameter here will override the log level parameter in the
smb.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V|--version <br>
Prints the program version number.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s|--configfile=&lt;configuration
file&gt; <br>
The file specified contains the configuration details
required by the server. The information in this file
includes server-specific information such as what printcap
file to <br>
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at <br>
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
<br>
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
&quot;.progname&quot; will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the
client.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<br>
Set the smb.conf(5) option &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; to value
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p|--port &lt;UDP port
number&gt; <br>
UDP port number is a positive integer value. This option
changes the default UDP port number (normally 137) that nmbd
responds to name queries on. Don&rsquo;t use this option
<br>
unless you are an expert, in which case you won&rsquo;t need
help!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-process-group <br>
Do not create a new process group for nmbd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/inetd.conf <br>
If the server is to be run by the inetd meta-daemon, this
file must contain suitable startup information for the
meta-daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/rc <br>
or whatever initialization script your system uses).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If running the server as a
daemon at startup, this file will need to contain an
appropriate startup sequence for the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/services <br>
If running the server via the meta-daemon inetd, this file
must contain a mapping of service name (e.g., netbios-ssn)
to service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g., <br>
tcp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
<br>
This is the default location of the smb.conf(5) server
configuration file. Other common places that systems install
this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and <br>
/etc/samba/smb.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run as a WINS server (see
the wins support parameter in the smb.conf(5) man page),
nmbd will store the WINS database in the file wins.dat in
the var/locks directory <br>
configured under wherever Samba was configured to install
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nmbd is acting as a <br>
browse master (see the local master parameter in the
smb.conf(5) man page, nmbd will store the browsing database
in the file browse.dat in the var/locks directory configured
<br>
under wherever Samba was configured to install itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
To shut down an nmbd process it is recommended that SIGKILL
(-9) NOT be used, except as a last resort, as this may leave
the name database in an inconsistent state. The correct <br>
way to terminate nmbd is to send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal
and wait for it to die on its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmbd will accept SIGHUP, which
will cause it to dump out its namelists into the file
namelist.debug in the /usr/local/samba/var/locks directory
(or the var/locks directory <br>
configured under wherever Samba was configured to install
itself). This will also cause nmbd to dump out its server
database in the log.nmb file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debug log level of nmbd may
be raised or lowered using smbcontrol(1) (SIGUSR[1|2]
signals are no longer used since Samba 2.2). This is to
allow transient problems to be <br>
diagnosed, whilst still running at a normally low log
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
inetd(8), smbd(8), smb.conf(5), smbclient(1), testparm(1),
and the Internet RFC&rsquo;s rfc1001.txt, rfc1002.txt. In
addition the CIFS (formerly SMB) specification is available
as a <br>
link from the Web page http://samba.org/cifs/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux <br>
kernel is developed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original Samba man pages
were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources were
converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at <br>
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to <br>
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
