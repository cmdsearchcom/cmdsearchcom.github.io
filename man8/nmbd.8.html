<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program is part of the <b>samba</b>(7) suite.
<div class="Pp"></div>
nmbd is a server that understands and can reply to NetBIOS over IP name service
  requests, like those produced by SMB/CIFS clients such as Windows 95/98/ME,
  Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and LanManager clients. It also
  participates in the browsing protocols which make up the Windows &quot;Network
  Neighborhood&quot; view.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SMB/CIFS clients, when they start up, may wish to locate an SMB/CIFS server.
  That is, they wish to know what IP number a specified host is using.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Amongst other services, nmbd will listen for such requests, and if its own
  NetBIOS name is specified it will respond with the IP number of the host it is
  running on. Its &quot;own NetBIOS name&quot; is by default the primary DNS
  name of the host it is running on, but this can be overridden by the
  <b>netbios name</b> in smb.conf. Thus nmbd will reply to broadcast queries for
  its own name(s). Additional names for nmbd to respond on can be set via
  parameters in the <b>smb.conf</b>(5) configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
nmbd can also be used as a WINS (Windows Internet Name Server) server. What this
  basically means is that it will act as a WINS database server, creating a
  database from name registration requests that it receives and replying to
  queries from clients for these names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, nmbd can act as a WINS proxy, relaying broadcast queries from
  clients that do not understand how to talk the WINS protocol to a WINS server.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-D|--daemon
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If specified, this parameter causes nmbd to
  operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the background,
  fielding requests on the appropriate port. By default, nmbd will operate as a
  daemon if launched from a command shell. nmbd can also be operated from the
  inetd meta-daemon, although this is not recommended.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-F|--foreground
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If specified, this parameter causes the main
  nmbd process to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the
  terminal. Child processes are still created as normal to service each
  connection request, but the main process does not exit. This operation mode is
  suitable for running nmbd under process supervisors such as supervise and
  svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein's daemontools package, or the AIX process
  monitor.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-S|--log-stdout
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If specified, this parameter causes nmbd to
  log to standard output rather than a file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-i|--interactive
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If this parameter is specified it causes the
  server to run &quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if the server
  is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting this parameter negates the
  implicit daemon mode when run from the command line. nmbd also logs to
  standard output, as if the <b>-S</b> parameter had been given.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-?|--help
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print a summary of command line options.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--usage
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display brief usage message.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-H|--hosts &lt;filename&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">NetBIOS lmhosts file. The lmhosts file is a
  list of NetBIOS names to IP addresses that is loaded by the nmbd server and
  used via the name resolution mechanism <b>name resolve order</b> described in
  <b>smb.conf</b>(5) to resolve any NetBIOS name queries needed by the server.
  Note that the contents of this file are <i>NOT</i> used by nmbd to answer any
  name queries. Adding a line to this file affects name NetBIOS resolution from
  this host <i>ONLY</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default path to this file is compiled into Samba as part of the build
  process. Common defaults are /usr/local/samba/lib/lmhosts,
  /usr/samba/lib/lmhosts or /etc/samba/lmhosts. See the <b>lmhosts</b>(5) man
  page for details on the contents of this file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-d|--debuglevel=level
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><i>level</i> is an integer from 0 to 10. The
  default value if this parameter is not specified is 0.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the
  activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious
  warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running
  - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only
  be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only
  by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
  extremely cryptic.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>log level</b>
  parameter in the smb.conf file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-V|--version
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prints the program version number.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-s|--configfile=&lt;configuration file&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The file specified contains the configuration
  details required by the server. The information in this file includes
  server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
  descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See smb.conf
  for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at
  compile time.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Base directory name for log/debug files. The
  extension <b>&quot;.progname&quot;</b> will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
  log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the <b>smb.conf</b>(5) option
  &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; to value &quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; from the command
  line. This overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
  configuration file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-p|--port &lt;UDP port number&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">UDP port number is a positive integer value.
  This option changes the default UDP port number (normally 137) that nmbd
  responds to name queries on. Don't use this option unless you are an expert,
  in which case you won't need help!</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--no-process-group
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not create a new process group for
  nmbd.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
/etc/inetd.conf
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the server is to be run by the inetd
  meta-daemon, this file must contain suitable startup information for the
  meta-daemon.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/etc/rc
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">or whatever initialization script your system
  uses).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If running the server as a daemon at startup, this file will need to contain an
  appropriate startup sequence for the server.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/etc/services
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If running the server via the meta-daemon
  inetd, this file must contain a mapping of service name (e.g., netbios-ssn) to
  service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g., tcp).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is the default location of the
  <b>smb.conf</b>(5) server configuration file. Other common places that systems
  install this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and /etc/samba/smb.conf.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When run as a WINS server (see the <b>wins support</b> parameter in the
  <b>smb.conf</b>(5) man page), nmbd will store the WINS database in the file
  wins.dat in the var/locks directory configured under wherever Samba was
  configured to install itself.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If nmbd is acting as a <i> browse master</i> (see the <b>local master</b>
  parameter in the <b>smb.conf</b>(5) man page, nmbd will store the browsing
  database in the file browse.dat in the var/locks directory configured under
  wherever Samba was configured to install itself.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
To shut down an nmbd process it is recommended that SIGKILL (-9) <i>NOT</i> be
  used, except as a last resort, as this may leave the name database in an
  inconsistent state. The correct way to terminate nmbd is to send it a SIGTERM
  (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
nmbd will accept SIGHUP, which will cause it to dump out its namelists into the
  file namelist.debug in the /usr/local/samba/var/locks directory (or the
  var/locks directory configured under wherever Samba was configured to install
  itself). This will also cause nmbd to dump out its server database in the
  log.nmb file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The debug log level of nmbd may be raised or lowered using <b>smbcontrol</b>(1)
  (SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no longer used since Samba 2.2). This is to allow
  transient problems to be diagnosed, whilst still running at a normally low log
  level.

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
  Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project
  similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources
  were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source
  software, available at ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the
  Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2
  was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was
  done by Alexander Bokovoy.</div>
