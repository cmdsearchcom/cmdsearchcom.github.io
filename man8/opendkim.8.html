<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>opendkim</b> implements the <b>DKIM</b> standard for signing and verifying
  e-mail messages on a per-domain basis.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>opendkim</b> uses the <i>milter</i> interface, originally distributed as part
  of version 8.11 of <b>sendmail(8),</b> to provide DKIM signing and/or
  verifying service for mail transiting a milter-aware MTA.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most, if not all, of the command line options listed below can also be set using
  a configuration file. See the <i>-x</i> option for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DATA_SETS"><a class="selflink" href="#DATA_SETS">DATA
  SETS</a></h1>
Many of the command line and configuration file parameters will refer to a
  &quot;dataset&quot; as their values. This refers to a string that either
  contains the list of desirable values, or to a file that contains them, or (if
  enabled at compile time) a database containing the data.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some data sets require that the value contain more than one entry. How this is
  done depends on which data set type is used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Which type is used depends on the format of the specification string. Note that
  not all of these are necessarily supported for all installations; most of them
  depend on the availability of a particular third-party library at compile
  time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In particular:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>a)</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the string begins with &quot;file:&quot;, then the
      remainder of the string is presumed to refer to a flat file that contains
      elements of the data set, one per line. If a line contains
      whitespace-separated values, then the line is presumed to define a key and
      its corresponding value. Blank lines are ignored, and the hash
      (&quot;#&quot;) character denotes the start of a comment. If a value
      contains multiple entries, the entries should be separated by colons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>b)</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the string begins with &quot;refile:&quot;, then the
      remainder of the string is presumed to specify a file that contains a set
      of patterns, one per line, and their associated values. The pattern is
      taken as the start of the line to the first whitespace, and the portion
      after that whitespace is taken as the value to be used when that pattern
      is matched. Patterns are simple wildcard patterns, matching all text
      except that the asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) character is considered a
      wildcard. If a value contains multiple entries, the entries should be
      separated by colons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>c)</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the string begins with &quot;db:&quot; and the program
      was compiled with Sleepycat DB support, then the remainder of the string
      is presumed to identify a Sleepycat database containing keys and
      corresponding values. These may be used only to test for membership in the
      data set, or for storing keys and corresponding values. If a value
      contains multiple entries, the entries should be separated by colons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>d)</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the string begins with &quot;dsn:&quot; and the OpenDKIM
      library was compiled to support that database type, then the remainder of
      the string is a Data Store Name describing the type, location parameters
      and access credentials for an ODBC or SQL database. The DSN is of the
      form:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    backend://[user[:pwd]@][port+]host/dbase[/key=value[?...]]
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    where <i>backend</i> is the name of a supported backend database mechanism
      (e.g. &quot;mysql&quot;), <i>user</i> and <i>password</i> are optional
      login credentials for the database, <i>port</i> and <i>host</i> describe
      the destination of a TCP connection to connect to that database,
      <i>dbase</i> is the name of the database to be accessed, and the
      <i>key=value</i> pairs must specify at least &quot;table&quot;,
      &quot;keycol&quot; and &quot;datacol&quot; values specifying the name of
      the table, the name of the column to consider as the key, and the name(s)
      of the column(s) to be considered as the values (separated by commas). For
      example (all in one line):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    mysql:://dbuser:dbpass@3306+dbhost/odkim/table=macros
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     ?keycol=host?datacol=v1,v2
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    defines a MySQL database listening at port 3306 on host &quot;dbhost&quot;;
      the userid &quot;dbuser&quot; and password &quot;dbpass&quot; should be
      used to access the database; the database name is &quot;odkim&quot;, and
      the data are in columns &quot;host&quot; (the keys) and &quot;v1&quot; and
      &quot;v2&quot; (the values) inside table &quot;macros&quot;. This example
      would thus return two values when a match is found.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The key may also include a &quot;filter&quot; value which will be included
      in all generated SQL as an AND clause after the WHERE clause that declares
      the search criteria. For example, given the above DSN specification with
      an additional &quot;filter&quot; value of &quot;ID &gt; 1000&quot;, the
      generated SQL for a query for &quot;foo&quot; would look like so:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    SELECT v1,v2 FROM macros WHERE host = 'foo' AND ID &gt; 1000
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    No value within the DSN may contain any of the six punctuation characters
      (&quot;:&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;?&quot;
      and &quot;=&quot;) used to delimit portions of the DSN. To include such
      characters within a value, encode them in quoted-printable style (e.g.,
      &quot;=20&quot; will be translated into a single space character).
      Encoding of spaces is also advised.</dd>

      servers to be queried. The first one should be a full RFC4516 LDAP URL
      indicating a base DN template and optional scope, filter and attribute
      names to use in queries. When constructing a DN template or filter, the
      special tokens &quot;$d&quot; and &quot;$D&quot; are replaced with the key

      &quot;.&quot; characters, each component preceded by &quot;dc=&quot; and
      followed by &quot;,&quot; (so &quot;example.com&quot; would become
      &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;). If a data set requires multiple values to

  and (2) (a) the client connecting to the MTA must have authenticated, or (b)
  the client connecting to the MTA must be listed in the file referenced by the
  <i>InternalHosts</i> configuration file setting (or be in the default list for
  that option), or (c) the client must be connected to a daemon port named by
  the <i>MTAs</i> configuration file setting, or (d) the MTA must have set one
  or more macros matching the criteria set by the <i>MacroList</i> configuration
  file setting.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For (a) above, the test is whether or not the MTA macro &quot;{auth_type}&quot;
  is set and contains any non-empty value. This means the MTA must pass the
  value of that macro to the filter before or during the end-of-header (EOH)
  phase in order for its value to be tested. Check your MTA's configuration
  documentation for details.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For (1) above, other header fields may be selected using the SenderHeaders
  configuration file setting. See <i>opendkim.conf(5)</i> for more information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When signing a message, a <i>DKIM-Signature:</i> header will be prepended to the
  message. The signature is computed using the private key provided. You must be
  running a version of <i>sendmail(8)</i> recent enough to be able to do header
  prepend operations (8.13.0 or later).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When verifying a message, an <i>Authentication-Results:</i> header will be
  prepended to indicate the presence of a signature and whether or not it could
  be validated against the body of the message using the public key advertised
  by the sender's nameserver. The value of this header can be used by mail user
  agents to sort or discard messages that were not signed or could not be
  verified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Upon receiving SIGUSR1, if the filter was started with a configuration file, it
  will be re-read and the new values used. Note that any command line overrides
  provided at startup time will be lost when this is done. Also, the following
  configuration file values (and their corresponding command line items, if any)
  are not reloaded through this process: AutoRestart (-A), AutoRestartCount,
  AutoRestartRate, Background, MilterDebug, PidFile (-P), POPDBFile, Quarantine
  (-q), QueryCache, Socket (-p), StrictTestMode, TestPublicKeys, UMask, UserID
  (-u). The filter does not automatically check the configuration file for
  changes and reload.

<b>opendkim</b> makes use of three MTA-provided macros, plus any demanded by
  configuration. The basic three are: &quot;i&quot; (the envelope ID, also known
  as the job ID or the queue ID), which is used for logging;
  &quot;daemon_name&quot; (the symbolic name given to the MTA instance that
  accepted the connection), which is used when performing tests against any
  &quot;MTAs&quot; setting used; and &quot;auth_type&quot;, which is used to
  determine whether or not the SMTP client authenticated to the MTA. If the MTA
  does not provide them to <b>opendkim</b> then it is not able to apply their
  corresponding tests or do useful logging. Consult your MTA documentation to
  determine how to adjust your its configuration if some or all of these are not
  available.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_PERMISSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_PERMISSIONS">FILE
  PERMISSIONS</a></h1>
When the filter is started as the superuser and the UserID (-u) setting is used,
  the filter gives up its root privileges by changing to the specified user
  after the following steps are taken: (1) the configuration file (if any) is
  loaded; (2) if the KeyFile (-k) setting is used, that key is loaded into
  memory; (3) all data sets in the configuration file are opened, and those that
  are based on flat files are also read into memory; and (4) if
  ChangeRootDirectory is set, the process root is changed to that directory.
  This means on configuration reload, the filter will not be accessing these
  files or the configuration file as the superuser (and possibly from a
  different root), and any key files referenced by the KeyTable will also be
  accessed by the new user.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Thus, keys referenced by the KeyTable must always be accessible for read by the
  unprivileged user. Also, run-time reloads are not possible if any of the other
  files will not be readable by the unprivileged user.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The following environment variable(s) can be used to adjust the behaviour of
  this filter:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>DKIM_TMPDIR</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The directory to use when creating temporary files. The
      default is <i>/tmp.</i></dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
When using DNS timeouts (see the <i>-T</i> option above), be sure not to use a
  timeout that is larger than the timeout being used for interaction between
  <i>sendmail</i> and the filter. Otherwise, the MTA could abort a message while
  waiting for a reply from the filter, which in turn is still waiting for a DNS
  reply.

The POP authentication database is expected to be a Sleepycat DB file (formerly
  known as a Berkeley DB) in hash format with keys containing the IP address in
  text form without a terminating NULL. The values of these records are not
  checked; only the existence of such records is of interest. The filter will
  attempt to establish a shared lock on the database before reading from it, so
  any programs which write to the database should keep their lock use to a
  minimum or else this filter will appear to hang while waiting for the lock
  operation to complete.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Features that involve specification of IPv4 addresses or CIDR blocks will use
  the <i>inet_addr(3)</i> function to parse that information. Users should be
  familiar with the way that function handles the non-trivial cases (for
  example, &quot;192.0.2/24&quot; and &quot;192.0.2.0/24&quot; are not the same
  thing).
