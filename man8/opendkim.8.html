<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
opendkim - DKIM signing and verifying filter for MTAs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
opendkim [-A] [-b modes] [-c canon] [-d domain[,...]] [-D]
[-e name] [-f] [-F time] [-k keyfile] [-l] [-L min] [-n] [-o
hdrlist] [-p socketspec] [-P pidfile] [-Q] [-r] [-s <br>
selector] [-S signalg] [-t testfiles] [-T secs] [-u
userid[:group]] [-v] [-V] [-W] [-x configfile] [-X]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
opendkim implements the DKIM standard for signing and
verifying e-mail messages on a per-domain basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opendkim uses the milter
interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of
sendmail(8), to provide DKIM signing and/or verifying
service for mail transiting a milter- <br>
aware MTA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most, if not all, of the command
line options listed below can also be set using a
configuration file. See the -x option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATA SETS <br>
Many of the command line and configuration file parameters
will refer to a &quot;dataset&quot; as their values. This
refers to a string that either contains the list of
desirable values, <br>
or to a file that contains them, or (if enabled at compile
time) a database containing the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some data sets require that the
value contain more than one entry. How this is done depends
on which data set type is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which type is used depends on
the format of the specification string. Note that not all of
these are necessarily supported for all installations; most
of them depend on the <br>
availability of a particular third-party library at compile
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) If the string begins with
&quot;file:&quot;, then the remainder of the string is
presumed to refer to a flat file that contains elements of
the data set, one per line. If a line <br>
contains whitespace-separated values, then the line is
presumed to define a key and its corresponding value. Blank
lines are ignored, and the hash (&quot;#&quot;) character
denotes <br>
the start of a comment. If a value contains multiple
entries, the entries should be separated by colons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b) If the string begins with
&quot;refile:&quot;, then the remainder of the string is
presumed to specify a file that contains a set of patterns,
one per line, and their associated <br>
values. The pattern is taken as the start of the line to the
first whitespace, and the portion after that whitespace is
taken as the value to be used when that pattern is <br>
matched. Patterns are simple wildcard patterns, matching all
text except that the asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) character is
considered a wildcard. If a value contains multiple <br>
entries, the entries should be separated by colons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c) If the string begins with
&quot;db:&quot; and the program was compiled with Sleepycat
DB support, then the remainder of the string is presumed to
identify a Sleepycat database con&acirc; <br>
taining keys and corresponding values. These may be used
only to test for membership in the data set, or for storing
keys and corresponding values. If a value contains <br>
multiple entries, the entries should be separated by
colons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d) If the string begins with
&quot;dsn:&quot; and the OpenDKIM library was compiled to
support that database type, then the remainder of the string
is a Data Store Name describing the <br>
type, location parameters and access credentials for an ODBC
or SQL database. The DSN is of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">backend://[user[:pwd]@][port+]host/dbase[/key=value[?...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where backend is the name of a
supported backend database mechanism (e.g.
&quot;mysql&quot;), user and password are optional login
credentials for the database, port and host <br>
describe the destination of a TCP connection to connect to
that database, dbase is the name of the database to be
accessed, and the key=value pairs must specify at least <br>
&quot;table&quot;, &quot;keycol&quot; and
&quot;datacol&quot; values specifying the name of the table,
the name of the column to consider as the key, and the
name(s) of the column(s) to be considered <br>
as the values (separated by commas). For example (all in one
line):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysql:://dbuser:dbpass@3306+dbhost/odkim/table=macros
<br>
?keycol=host?datacol=v1,v2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defines a MySQL database
listening at port 3306 on host &quot;dbhost&quot;; the
userid &quot;dbuser&quot; and password &quot;dbpass&quot;
should be used to access the database; the database name is
<br>
&quot;odkim&quot;, and the data are in columns
&quot;host&quot; (the keys) and &quot;v1&quot; and
&quot;v2&quot; (the values) inside table &quot;macros&quot;.
This example would thus return two values when a match is
<br>
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key may also include a
&quot;filter&quot; value which will be included in all
generated SQL as an AND clause after the WHERE clause that
declares the search criteria. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, given the above DSN specification with an additional
&quot;filter&quot; value of &quot;ID &gt; 1000&quot;, the
generated SQL for a query for &quot;foo&quot; would look
like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECT v1,v2 FROM macros WHERE
host = &rsquo;foo&rsquo; AND ID &gt; 1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No value within the DSN may
contain any of the six punctuation characters
(&quot;:&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;+&quot;,
&quot;?&quot; and &quot;=&quot;) used to delimit portions of
the DSN. To include such charac&acirc; <br>
ters within a value, encode them in quoted-printable style
(e.g., &quot;=20&quot; will be translated into a single
space character). Encoding of spaces is also advised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e) If the string begins with
&quot;ldap:&quot;, &quot;ldaps:&quot; or &quot;ldapi:&quot;,
it is presumed to be a space-separated set of one or more
LDAP URLs that identify a set of servers to be queried. <br>
The first one should be a full RFC4516 LDAP URL indicating a
base DN template and optional scope, filter and attribute
names to use in queries. When constructing a DN <br>
template or filter, the special tokens &quot;$d&quot; and
&quot;$D&quot; are replaced with the key being queried and
the key broken into components, separated at &quot;.&quot;
characters, each compo&acirc; <br>
nent preceded by &quot;dc=&quot; and followed by
&quot;,&quot; (so &quot;example.com&quot; would become
&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;). If a data set requires
multiple values to be returned, the appropriate <br>
attribute names should be given in the correct order to
satisfy such requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f) If the string begins with
&quot;lua:&quot;, it is presumed to refer to a file that
contains a Lua script to be executed whenever a query is
performed. The key for the query is <br>
placed in a global variable called &quot;query&quot;, which
the called script can then access. The script may return any
number of values as required for the type of query being
<br>
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g) If the string begins with
&quot;memcache:&quot;, it is presumed to refer to a memory
cache database provided by memcached. The remainder of the
string is a comma-separated list of <br>
hosts to which query attempts should be made, each
optionally followed by &quot;:&quot; and a port number; that
list must be followed by a slash (&quot;/&quot;) character
and a string that <br>
will be used to prefix queries send to the cache. For
example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">memcache:localhost,otherhost/keyname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would use either
&quot;localhost&quot; or &quot;otherhost&quot; to conduct
queries, and all strings sent to the dataset will be
prefixed with &quot;keyname:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h) If the string contains none
of these prefixes but ends with &quot;.db&quot;, it is
presumed to be a Sleepycat DB as described above (if support
for same is compiled in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i) If the string contains none
of these prefixes but starts with a slash (&quot;/&quot;)
character, it is presumed to be a flat file as described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j) If the string begins with
&quot;csl:&quot;, the string is treated as a comma-separated
list as described in m) below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k) If the string begins with
&quot;erlang:&quot;, it is presumed to refer to a function
called to be made to the specified distributed Erlang
node(s). The specification is of the form</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">erlang:node@host[,...]:cookie:module:function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where node[,...] is a list of
comma-separated erlang nodes, cookie is the cookie for the
known nodes of the distributed Erlang setup, module is the
name of the Erlang <br>
module where the function to be called resides, function is
the name of the Erlang function to be called. For example,
(all in one line):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">erlang:mynode@myhost,myothernode@myotherhost:
<br>
chocolate:dkim:lookup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will join the distributed Erlang
setup connecting to either &quot;mynode@myhost&quot; or
&quot;myothernode@myotherhost&quot; (connections to nodes
are tried in order) using &quot;chocolate&quot; as the <br>
cookie, and use the function &quot;dkim:lookup/1&quot; for
lookups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l) If the string begins with
&quot;mdb:&quot;, it refers to a directory that contains a
memory database, as provided by libmdb from OpenLDAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m) In any other case, the string
is presumed to be a comma-separated list. Elements in the
list are either simple data elements that are part of the
set or, in the case of <br>
an entry of the form &quot;x=y&quot;, are stored as
key-value pairs as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A Automatically re-start on failures. Use with caution; if
the filter fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a
tight fork(2) loop. This can be mitigated using <br>
some values in the configuration file to limit restarting.
See opendkim.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b modes <br>
Selects operating modes. modes is a concatenation of
characters that indicate which mode(s) of operation are
desired. Valid modes are s (signer) and v (verifier). The
<br>
default is sv except in test mode (see -t below) in which
case the default is v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c canon <br>
Selects the canonicalization method(s) to be used when
signing messages. When verifying, the message&rsquo;s
DKIM-Signature: header specifies the canonicalization
method. The <br>
recognized values are relaxed and simple as defined by the
DKIM specification. The default is simple. The value may
include two different canonicalizations separated by <br>
a slash (&quot;/&quot;) character, in which case the first
will be applied to the headers and the second to the
body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dataset <br>
A set of domains whose mail should be signed by this filter.
Mail from other domains will be verified rather than being
signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Sign subdomains of those
listed by the -d option as well as the actual domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e name <br>
Extracts the value of name from the configuration file (if
any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Normally opendkim forks and
exits immediately, leaving the service running in the
background. This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it
runs in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F time <br>
Specifies a fixed time to use when generating signatures.
Ignored unless also used in conjunction with -t (see below).
The time must be expressed in the usual UNIX <br>
time_t (seconds since epoch) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keyfile <br>
Gives the location of a PEM-formatted private key to be used
for signing all messages. Ignored if a configuration file is
referenced that defines a KeyTable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Log via calls to syslog(3)
any interesting activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L min[%+] <br>
Instructs the verification code to fail messages for which a
partial signature was received. There are three possible
formats: min indicating at least min bytes of the <br>
message must be signed (or if the message is smaller than
min then all of it must be signed); min% requiring that at
least min percent of the received message must be <br>
signed; and min+ meaning there may be no more than min bytes
of unsigned data appended to the message for it to be
considered valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Parse the configuration file
and command line arguments, reporting any errors found, and
then exit. The exit value will be 0 if the filter would
start up without com&acirc; <br>
plaint, or non-zero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o dataset <br>
Specifies a list of headers that should be omitted when
generating signatures. If an entry in the list names any
header which is mandated by the DKIM specification, the <br>
entry is ignored. A set of headers is listed in the DKIM
specification as &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; be signed; the
default list for this parameter contains those headers
(Return-Path, <br>
Received, Comments, Keywords, Bcc, Resent-Bcc and
DKIM-Signature). To omit no headers, simply use the string
&quot;-&quot; (or any string that will match no
headers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p socketspec <br>
Specifies the socket that should be established by the
filter to receive connections from sendmail(8) in order to
provide service. socketspec is in one of two forms: <br>
local:path which creates a UNIX domain socket at the
specified path, or inet:port[@host] or inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified port using the
<br>
requested protocol family. If the host is not given as
either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces. A literal IP address must be
<br>
enclosed in square brackets. If neither socket type is
specified, local is assumed, meaning the parameter is
interpreted as a path at which the socket should be created.
<br>
This parameter is mandatory either here or in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P pidfile <br>
Specifies a file into which the filter should write its
process ID at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Query test mode. The filter
will read two lines from standard input, one containing a
database description to be opened and one containing a
string of the form &quot;q/n&quot; <br>
where &quot;q&quot; is the query to be performed and
&quot;n&quot; is the number of fields to be retrieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Checks all messages for
compliance with RFC5322 header count requirements.
Non-compliant messages are rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s selector <br>
Defines the name of the selector to be used when signing
messages. See the DKIM specification for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S signalg <br>
Selects the signing algorithm to use when generating
signatures. Use &rsquo;opendkim -V&rsquo; to see the list of
supported algorithms. The default is rsa-sha256 if it is
available, <br>
otherwise it will be rsa-sha1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t testfiles <br>
Evaluates (verifies) one or more RFC5322-formatted message
found in testfiles and exits. The value of testfiles should
be a comma-separated list of one or more filenames, <br>
one of which may be &quot;-&quot; if the message should be
read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T secs <br>
Sets the DNS timeout in seconds. A value of 0 causes an
infinite wait. The default is 5. Ignored if not using an
asynchronous resolver package. See also the NOTES sec&acirc;
<br>
tion below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u userid[:group] <br>
Attempts to be come the specified userid before starting
operations. The process will be assigned all of the groups
and primary group ID of the named userid unless an <br>
alternate group is specified. See the FILE PERMISSIONS
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase verbose output
during test mode (see -t above). May be specified more than
once to request increasing amounts of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number and
supported canonicalization and signature algorithms, and
then exit without doing anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W If logging is enabled (see -l
above), issues very detailed logging about the logic behind
the filter&rsquo;s decision to either sign a message or
verify it. The &quot;W&quot; stands for <br>
&quot;Why?!&quot; since the logic behind the decision is
non-trivial and can be confusing to administrators not
familiar with its operation. A description of how the
decision is <br>
made can be found in the OPERATION section of this document.
This causes a large increase in the amount of log data
generated for each message, so it should be limited to <br>
debugging use and not enabled for general operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x configfile <br>
Read the named configuration file. See the opendkim.conf(5)
man page for details. Values in the configuration file are
overridden when their equivalents are provided on <br>
the command line until a configuration reload occurs. The
OPERATION section describes how reloads are triggered. The
default is to read a configuration file from <br>
/etc/opendkim.conf if one exists, or otherwise to apply
defaults to all values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Tolerates configuration file
items that have been internally marked as
&quot;deprecated&quot;. Normally when a configuration file
item is removed from the package, it is flagged in <br>
this way for at least one full release cycle. The presence
of a deprecated configuration file item typically causes the
filter to return an error and refuse to start. <br>
Setting this flag will allow the filter to start and a
warning is logged. In some future release when the item is
removed completely, a different error results, and it <br>
will not be possible to start the filter. Use of this flag
is NOT RECOMMENDED; it could effectively hide a major
configuration change with serious security implications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
A message will be verified unless it conforms to the signing
criteria, which are: (1) the domain on the From: address (if
present) must be listed by the -d command line switch or
<br>
the Domain configuration file setting, and (2) (a) the
client connecting to the MTA must have authenticated, or (b)
the client connecting to the MTA must be listed in the file
<br>
referenced by the InternalHosts configuration file setting
(or be in the default list for that option), or (c) the
client must be connected to a daemon port named by the MTAs
<br>
configuration file setting, or (d) the MTA must have set one
or more macros matching the criteria set by the MacroList
configuration file setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For (a) above, the test is
whether or not the MTA macro &quot;{auth_type}&quot; is set
and contains any non-empty value. This means the MTA must
pass the value of that macro to the filter <br>
before or during the end-of-header (EOH) phase in order for
its value to be tested. Check your MTA&rsquo;s configuration
documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For (1) above, other header
fields may be selected using the SenderHeaders configuration
file setting. See opendkim.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When signing a message, a
DKIM-Signature: header will be prepended to the message. The
signature is computed using the private key provided. You
must be running a version of <br>
sendmail(8) recent enough to be able to do header prepend
operations (8.13.0 or later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When verifying a message, an
Authentication-Results: header will be prepended to indicate
the presence of a signature and whether or not it could be
validated against the body of <br>
the message using the public key advertised by the
sender&rsquo;s nameserver. The value of this header can be
used by mail user agents to sort or discard messages that
were not signed <br>
or could not be verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon receiving SIGUSR1, if the
filter was started with a configuration file, it will be
re-read and the new values used. Note that any command line
overrides provided at startup <br>
time will be lost when this is done. Also, the following
configuration file values (and their corresponding command
line items, if any) are not reloaded through this process:
<br>
AutoRestart (-A), AutoRestartCount, AutoRestartRate,
Background, MilterDebug, PidFile (-P), POPDBFile, Quarantine
(-q), QueryCache, Socket (-p), StrictTestMode,
TestPublicKeys, <br>
UMask, UserID (-u). The filter does not automatically check
the configuration file for changes and reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MTA MACROS <br>
opendkim makes use of three MTA-provided macros, plus any
demanded by configuration. The basic three are:
&quot;i&quot; (the envelope ID, also known as the job ID or
the queue ID), which <br>
is used for logging; &quot;daemon_name&quot; (the symbolic
name given to the MTA instance that accepted the
connection), which is used when performing tests against any
&quot;MTAs&quot; setting <br>
used; and &quot;auth_type&quot;, which is used to determine
whether or not the SMTP client authenticated to the MTA. If
the MTA does not provide them to opendkim then it is not
able to <br>
apply their corresponding tests or do useful logging.
Consult your MTA documentation to determine how to adjust
your its configuration if some or all of these are not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE PERMISSIONS <br>
When the filter is started as the superuser and the UserID
(-u) setting is used, the filter gives up its root
privileges by changing to the specified user after the
following <br>
steps are taken: (1) the configuration file (if any) is
loaded; (2) if the KeyFile (-k) setting is used, that key is
loaded into memory; (3) all data sets in the configuration
<br>
file are opened, and those that are based on flat files are
also read into memory; and (4) if ChangeRootDirectory is
set, the process root is changed to that directory. This
<br>
means on configuration reload, the filter will not be
accessing these files or the configuration file as the
superuser (and possibly from a different root), and any key
files <br>
referenced by the KeyTable will also be accessed by the new
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, keys referenced by the
KeyTable must always be accessible for read by the
unprivileged user. Also, run-time reloads are not possible
if any of the other files will not be <br>
readable by the unprivileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variable(s) can be used to adjust
the behaviour of this filter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DKIM_TMPDIR <br>
The directory to use when creating temporary files. The
default is /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
When using DNS timeouts (see the -T option above), be sure
not to use a timeout that is larger than the timeout being
used for interaction between sendmail and the filter.
Oth&acirc; <br>
erwise, the MTA could abort a message while waiting for a
reply from the filter, which in turn is still waiting for a
DNS reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The POP authentication database
is expected to be a Sleepycat DB file (formerly known as a
Berkeley DB) in hash format with keys containing the IP
address in text form without a <br>
terminating NULL. The values of these records are not
checked; only the existence of such records is of interest.
The filter will attempt to establish a shared lock on the
<br>
database before reading from it, so any programs which write
to the database should keep their lock use to a minimum or
else this filter will appear to hang while waiting for the
<br>
lock operation to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Features that involve
specification of IPv4 addresses or CIDR blocks will use the
inet_addr(3) function to parse that information. Users
should be familiar with the way that <br>
function handles the non-trivial cases (for example,
&quot;192.0.2/24&quot; and &quot;192.0.2.0/24&quot; are not
the same thing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Filter exit status codes are selected according to
sysexits(3).</p>
