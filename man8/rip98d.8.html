<p>RIP98D(8) Linux System Managers Manual RIP98D(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rip98d - Send and receive RIP98 routing messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rip98d [-d] [-l] [-r] [-t interval] [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The RIP98 routing protocol was devised by John Wiseman G8BPQ
as an alternative to both traditional RIP and RSPF for use
in an RF environment. Its main advantage is that each <br>
routing element only takes six bytes and is therefore much
more efficient in terms of bandwidth than other routing
protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In operation rip98d that each
neighbour that also uses RIP98 must be listed. RIP98 is not
a broadcast protocol and each neighbour is individually
contacted. Any incoming RIP98 <br>
message is also validated against this list. The list of
neighbours is held in /etc/ax25/rip98d.conf, and each line
is either the name or the dotted decimal IP address of the
<br>
neighbour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time interval between RIP98
transmissions is set to one hour by default but other
intervals can be set with the -t option. The routes
advertised and received can be <br>
restricted by the -r option which only allows processing of
ampr.org addresses. At present rip98d is under development
and any feedback on its operation would be welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Set debugging on. Information is only output if the
logging option is also enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enable logging to the system
log, the default is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Restricts the transmitting
and receiving of routes to ampr.org (44.x.x.x) addresses
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t interval The time interval
between routing broadcasts, in minutes. The default is 60
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display the version.</p>
