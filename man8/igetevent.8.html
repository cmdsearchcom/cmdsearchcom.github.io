<p>IGETEVENT(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipmiutil_getevt - wait for IPMI events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmiutil getevt [-abosx -t secs -N node -U user -P/-R pswd
-EFJTVY]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ipmiutil getevt is a program that uses IPMI commands to wait
for IPMI events sent from the BMC firmware. These events are
also sent to the IPMI System Event Log (SEL). This <br>
utility can use either the /dev/ipmi0 driver from OpenIPMI,
the /dev/imb driver from Intel, the /dev/ipmikcs driver from
valinux, direct user-space IOs, or the IPMI LAN interface
<br>
if -N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some server management functions
want to trigger custom actions or alerts when IPMI
hardware-related events occur, but do not want to track all
events, just newly occurring <br>
events. This utility waits a specified timeout period for
any events, and returns interpreted output for each event.
It is designed as a scriptable command-line utility, but if
<br>
the timeout is infinite (-t 0), then this code could be used
for a sample service as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several methods to do
this which are implemented here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SEL method: <br>
This method polls the SEL once a second, keeps track of the
last SEL event read, and only new events are processed. This
ensures that in a series of rapid events, all events are
<br>
received in order, however, some transition-to-OK events may
not be configured to write to the SEL on certain platforms.
This method is used if getevent -s is specified. This <br>
is the only method supported over IPMI LAN, i.e. with
-N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ReadEventMessageBuffer
method: <br>
This uses an IPMI Message Buffer in the BMC firmware to read
each new event. This receives any event, but if two events
occur nearly simultaneously, only the most recent of the
<br>
two will be returned with this method. An example of
simultaneous events might be, if a fan stops/fails, both the
non-critical and critical fan threshold events would occur
at <br>
that time. This is the default method for getevent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OpenIPMI custom method: <br>
Different IPMI drivers may have varying behavior. For
instance, the OpenIPMI driver uses the IPMI GetMessage
commands internally and does not allow client programs to
use those <br>
commands. It has its own custom mechanism, see
getevent_mv(). This method is used if the OpenIPMI driver is
detected, and no other method is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Async Event method: <br>
This only gets certain Asynchronous requests from the BMC to
an SMS OS service, like a remote OS shutdown, and
get_software_id. This method is disabled by default and only
<br>
turned on if the getevent -a option is specified. This
method is only supported via the Intel IMB and OpenIPMI
driver interfaces. There is an init script provided with
ipmiutil <br>
to automate the task of starting this async event daemon.
<br>
# chkconfig --add ipmiutil_asy (skip this if no chkconfig)
<br>
# /etc/init.d/ipmiutil_asy start <br>
This listens for IPMI LAN requests for soft-shutdown, and
logs the output to /var/log/ipmiutil_asy.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Command line options are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Use the Async request method,
which receives SMS OS requests from the BMC using the IMB or
OpenIPMI driver interface. This services remote SMS bridge
agent requests, like <br>
remote OS shutdown and get software_id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Run in Background as a
daemon. If this option is specified, normal output will be
redirected to /var/log/ipmiutil_getevt.log. The default is
to run in foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Show output in a canonical
format, with a delimiter of &rsquo;|&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e N Wait for a specific event
sensor type N. The parameter can be in hex (0x23) or decimal
(35). The default is 0xFF which means wait for any
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r F Run script file F when an
event occurs. The filename can include a full path. The
script will be passed the event description as a parameter.
A sample evt.sh script is <br>
included with the ipmiutil package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Only run one pass to wait for
the first event. Default is to loop for multiple events for
the timeout period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Use the SEL method to get
events. This polls the SEL once a second for new events. The
last SEL record read is saved in
/usr/share/ipmiutil/evt.idx. Otherwise, the <br>
default is to use the ReadEventMessageBuffer method to get
new events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t N Set the timeout period to N
seconds. Default is 120 seconds. A timeout of 0 means an
infinite period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Causes extra debug messages
to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N nodename <br>
Nodename or IP address of the remote target system. If a
nodename is specified, IPMI LAN interface is used. Otherwise
the local system management interface is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P/-R rmt_pswd <br>
Remote password for the nodename given. The default is a
null password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U rmt_user <br>
Remote username for the nodename given. The default is a
null username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Use the remote password from
Environment variable IPMI_PASSWORD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F drv_t <br>
Force the driver type to one of the followng: imb, va, open,
gnu, landesk, lan, lan2, lan2i, kcs, smb. Note that lan2i
means lan2 with intelplus. The default is to <br>
detect any available driver type and use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Use the specified LanPlus
cipher suite (0 thru 17): 0=none/none/none,
1=sha1/none/none, 2=sha1/sha1/none, 3=sha1/sha1/cbc128,
4=sha1/sha1/xrc4_128, 5=sha1/sha1/xrc4_40, <br>
6=md5/none/none, ... 14=md5/md5/xrc4_40. Default is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Use a specified IPMI LAN
Authentication Type: 0=None, 1=MD2, 2=MD5, 4=Straight
Password, 5=OEM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Use a specified IPMI LAN
privilege level. 1=Callback level, 2=User level, 3=Operator
level, 4=Administrator level (default), 5=OEM level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y Yes, do prompt the user for
the IPMI LAN remote password. Alternatives for the password
are -E or -P.</p>
