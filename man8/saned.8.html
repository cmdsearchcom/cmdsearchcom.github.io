<p>saned(8) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy saned(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
saned - SANE network daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
saned [ -a [ username ] | -d [ n ] | -s [ n ] | -h ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
saned is the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) daemon that
allows remote clients to access image acquisition devices
available on the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The -a flag requests that saned run in standalone daemon
mode. In this mode, saned will detach from the console and
run in the background, listening for incoming client
connec&acirc; <br>
tions; inetd is not required for saned operations in this
mode. If the optional username is given after -a , saned
will drop root privileges and run as this user (and
group).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d and -s flags request that
saned run in debug mode (as opposed to inetd(8) daemon
mode). In this mode, saned explicitly waits for a connection
request. When compiled with <br>
debugging enabled, these flags may be followed by a number
to request debug info. The larger the number, the more
verbose the debug output. E.g., -d128 will request printing
of <br>
all debug info. Debug level 0 means no debug output at all.
The default value is 2. If flag -d is used, the debug
messages will be printed to stderr while -s requests using
sys&acirc; <br>
log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If saned is run from inetd,
xinetd or systemd, no option can be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h flag displays a short
help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
First and foremost: saned is not intended to be exposed to
the internet or other non-trusted networks. Make sure that
access is limited by tcpwrappers and/or a firewall setup.
<br>
Don&rsquo;t depend only on saned&rsquo;s own authentication.
Don&rsquo;t run saned as root if it&rsquo;s not necessary.
And do not install saned as setuid root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The saned.conf configuration
file contains both options for the daemon and the access
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data_portrange = min_port -
max_port <br>
Specify the port range to use for the data connection. Pick
a port range between 1024 and 65535; don&rsquo;t pick a too
large port range, as it may have performance issues. Use
<br>
this option if your saned server is sitting behind a
firewall. If that firewall is a Linux machine, we strongly
recommend using the Netfilter nf_conntrack_sane module <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access list is a list of
host names, IP addresses or IP subnets (CIDR notation) that
are permitted to use local SANE devices. IPv6 addresses must
be enclosed in brackets, and <br>
should always be specified in their compressed form.
Connections from localhost are always permitted. Empty lines
and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A line
con&acirc; <br>
taining the single character &lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo;
is interpreted to match any hostname. This allows any remote
machine to use your scanner and may present a security risk,
so this shouldn&rsquo;t be <br>
used unless you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A sample configuration file is
shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Daemon options <br>
data_portrange = 10000 - 10100 <br>
# Access list <br>
scan-client.somedomain.firm <br>
# this is a comment <br>
192.168.0.1 <br>
192.168.2.12/29 <br>
[::1] <br>
[2001:db8:185e::42:12]/64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The case of the host names does
not matter, so AHost.COM is considered identical to
ahost.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER DAEMON CONFIGURATION <br>
For saned to work properly in its default mode of operation,
it is also necessary to add the appropriate configuration
for (x)inetd or systemd. (see below). Note that your <br>
inetd must support IPv6 if you want to connect to saned over
IPv6 ; xinetd, openbsd-inetd and systemd are known to
support IPv6, check the documentation for your inetd
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the sections below the
configuration for inetd, xinetd and systemd are described in
more detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the configurations below it
is necessary to add a line of the following form to
/etc/services:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE
network scanner daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The official IANA short name for
port 6566 is &quot;sane-port&quot;. The older name
&quot;sane&quot; is now deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INETD CONFIGURATION <br>
It is required to add a single line to the inetd
configuration file (/etc/inetd.conf)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration line normally
looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sane-port stream tcp nowait
saned.saned /usr/sbin/saned saned</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if your system uses
tcpd(8) for additional security screening, you may want to
disable saned access control by putting
&lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo; in saned.conf and use a line
of the <br>
following form in /etc/inetd.conf instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sane-port stream tcp nowait
saned.saned /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/saned</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that both examples assume
that there is a saned group and a saned user. If you follow
this example, please make sure that the access permissions
on the special <br>
device are set such that saned can access the scanner (the
program generally needs read and write access to scanner
devices).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XINETD CONFIGURATION <br>
If xinetd is installed on your system instead of inetd the
following example for /etc/xinetd.conf may be helpful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># default: off <br>
# description: The sane server accepts requests <br>
# for network access to a local scanner via the <br>
# network. <br>
service sane-port <br>
{ <br>
port = 6566 <br>
socket_type = stream <br>
wait = no <br>
user = saned <br>
group = saned <br>
server = /usr/sbin/saned <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEMD CONFIGURATION <br>
for systemd we need to add 2 configuation files in
/etc/systemd/system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first file we need to add
here is called saned.socket. It shall have the following
contents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Unit] <br>
Description=saned incoming socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Socket] <br>
ListenStream=6566 <br>
Accept=yes <br>
MaxConnections=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Install] <br>
WantedBy=sockets.target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second file to be added is
saned@.service with the following contents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Unit] <br>
Description=Scanner Service <br>
Requires=saned.socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Service] <br>
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/saned <br>
User=saned <br>
Group=saned <br>
StandardInput=null <br>
StandardOutput=syslog <br>
StandardError=syslog <br>
# Environment=SANE_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/sane.d
SANE_DEBUG_DLL=255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is you need to set an
environment variable for saned like SANE_CONFIG_DIR you will
have to remove the # on the last line and set the variable
appropriately. Multiple variables <br>
can be set by separating the assignments by spaces as shown
in the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike (x)inetd systemd allows
debugging output from backends set using
SANE_DEBUG_&lt;backend_name&gt; to be captured. With the
service unit as described above, the debugging output <br>
is forwarded to the system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/hosts.equiv <br>
The hosts listed in this file are permitted to access all
local SANE devices. Caveat: this file imposes serious
security risks and its use is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/sane.d/saned.conf <br>
Contains a list of hosts permitted to access local SANE
devices (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/sane.d/saned.users <br>
If this file contains lines of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user:password:backend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">access to the listed backends is
restricted. A backend may be listed multiple times for
different user/password combinations. The server uses MD5
hashing if supported by <br>
the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SANE_CONFIG_DIR <br>
This environment variable specifies the list of directories
that may contain the configuration file. Under UNIX, the
directories are separated by a colon (&lsquo;:&rsquo;),
under <br>
OS/2, they are separated by a semi-colon (&lsquo;;&rsquo;).
If this variable is not set, the configuration file is
searched in two default directories: first, the current
working <br>
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched <br>
after the explicitly specified directories. For example,
setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would
result in directories &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;,
and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being <br>
searched (in this order).</p>
