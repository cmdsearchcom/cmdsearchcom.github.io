<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
greenbone-nvt-sync - updates the OpenVAS NVTs from Greenbone
Security Feed or Community Feed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
greenbone-nvt-sync</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The OpenVAS Scanner performs several security checks. These
are called Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs) and are mostly
implemented in the programming language NASL. Some NVTs <br>
are wrappers for external tools. As new vulnerabilities are
published every day, new NVTs appear in the Greenbone
Security Feed. This feed is commercial and requires a
respec&acirc; <br>
tive subscription key. In case no subscription key is
present, the update synchronisation will use the Community
Feed instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script greenbone-nvt-sync
will fetch all new and updated security checks and install
them at the proper location. Once this is done it will send
a signal to the OpenVAS Scan&acirc; <br>
ner, openvassd(8) so that the new NVTs are loaded and
considered for new security scans. If your installation does
not allow automatic restart, you need to restart the scanner
<br>
manually. Subsequent to the scanner, the script also tries
to send a signal to the OpenVAS Manager openvasmd(8) so that
the information about the NVTs are also updated into the
<br>
Manager database.</p>
