<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nutdrv_atcl_usb - Driver for &rsquo;ATCL FOR UPS&rsquo;
equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the specific features of the
nutdrv_atcl_usb driver. For information about the core
driver, see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
This driver is for UPS hardware which identifies itself as
USB idVendor 0001 and idProduct 0000, and iManufacturer ATCL
FOR UPS. Known manufacturers include Kanji and Plexus. The
<br>
UPS interface seems to be a generic USB-to-serial chip, and
for hardware manufactured by Kanji and Plexus, the
microcontroller appears to emulate a traditional
contact-closure <br>
interface. This translates into only three states in
ups.status: OL, OB and OB LB (similar to genericups(8)),
with no other dynamic status values reported. Note that
these USB <br>
identifiers (including the iManufacturer string) have also
been seen on devices that are supported by the fuji
subdriver of nutdrv_qx(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following optional setting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vendor=name <br>
In case your iManufacturer (Vendor) string does not exactly
match ATCL FOR UPS, you may provide an alternate string
here. Note that a more likely case is that your device is
<br>
handled by another driver for 0001:0000 devices, such as
nutdrv_qx(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The UPS returns the same code for &quot;load power is
off&quot; as for &quot;on line power&quot;. This condition
will not be observed if the NUT master is powered by the
UPS, but may be an issue if <br>
the UPS is monitored by a remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time between the shutdown
command and removal of power seems to be fixed at 30
seconds. Ensure that the NUT shutdown script is invoked as
late as possible in the shutdown <br>
procedure (in case some services take longer than others to
clean up).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most contact-closure UPSes will
not power down the load if the line power is present. This
can create a race when using slave upsmon(8) systems. See
the upsmon(8) man page for <br>
more information. The solution to this problem is to upgrade
to a smart protocol UPS of some kind that allows detection
and proper load cycling on command.</p>
