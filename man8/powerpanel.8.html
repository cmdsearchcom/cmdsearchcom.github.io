<p>POWERPANEL(8) NUT Manual POWERPANEL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
powerpanel - Driver for PowerPanel Plus compatible UPS
equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the powerpanel driver. For information about the core
driver, see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
This driver supports CyberPower BC1200, PR2200 and many
other similar devices, both for the text and binary
protocols. The driver will autodetect which protocol is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following optional settings in
ups.conf(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol=[text,binary] <br>
Override the default autodetection of the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manufacturer=value <br>
If you don&acirc;t like the autodetected value, you can
override this by setting it here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">model=value <br>
Like manufacturer above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serial=value <br>
Like manufacturer above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ondelay=value <br>
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (1 - 9999 minutes,
0=indefinite). Only available with the text protocol driver
(see Support Status).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offdelay=value <br>
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (6 - 600 seconds).
Values below 60 seconds will be truncated to 6 seconds
intervals, values above 60 seconds to 60 seconds <br>
intervals. Only available with the text protocol driver (see
Support Status).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES <br>
Depending on the type of your UPS unit, some of the
following variables may be changed with upsrw(8). If the
driver can&acirc;t read a variable from the UPS, it will not
be made <br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input.transfer.high <br>
writable: high transfer voltage point in V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input.transfer.low <br>
writable: low transfer voltage point in V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battery.charge.low <br>
writable: remaining battery charge percentage for low
battery warning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output.voltage.nominal <br>
writable: nominal output voltage in V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.start.battery <br>
writable: allow cold start from battery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Depending on the type of your UPS unit, some of the
following commands may be available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
test.battery.start.quick, test.battery.stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; beeper.enable,
beeper.disable, beeper.toggle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; shutdown.return,
shutdown.reboot, shutdown.stayoff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On many devices, these commands
are unreliable, so before using them you must verify that
these work as expected (see Shutdown Issues).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
shutdown.stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORT STATUS <br>
Vendor support is absent for this driver, so if you need
some features that are currently not available, provide
ample documentation on what the driver should sent to the
UPS in <br>
order to make this work. If more information would be
available on the binary protocol, it would probably be
possible to make ondelay and offdelay configurable. So far,
nobody <br>
has taken the time to investigate what we should tell the
UPS to make this work, and CyberPower isn&acirc;t willing to
share this with us.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHUTDOWN ISSUES <br>
If the shutdown.return command on your UPS doesn&acirc;t
seem to work, chances are that your UPS is an older model.
Try a couple of different settings for offdelay. If no value
in the <br>
range 6..600 works, your UPS likely doesn&acirc;t support
this. In order to get the expected behaviour, it requires
shutdown.stayoff (when on battery) and shutdown.reboot (when
on <br>
mains). The driver will automatically fallback to these
commands if shutdown.return fails, and tries to detect which
one should be used when called with the -k option (or
through <br>
upsdrvctl shutdown).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This isn&acirc;t bullet-proof,
however, and you should be prepared that the power will
either not be shutdown or that it doesn&acirc;t return when
the power comes back. All models supported <br>
by the binary protocol and many supported through the text
protocol are affected by this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
The CyberPower OP series don&acirc;t offer direct voltage,
charge, frequency and temperature readings. Instead, they
will return a binary value that needs conversion to the
actual <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact conversion needed is
unknown at the time of this writing, hence an estimation was
made based om readings from actual devices. This may
(probably will) be off, possibly <br>
a lot. Unless you can tell us the exact mapping between
values from the UPS and actual readings, don&acirc;t bother
to complain. We&acirc;ve done the best we can based on the
limited <br>
information available. Remember, a UPS isn&acirc;t a
measuring instrument.</p>
