<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
start-stop-daemon - start and stop system daemon
programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
start-stop-daemon [option...] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
start-stop-daemon is used to control the creation and
termination of system-level processes. Using one of the
matching options, start-stop-daemon can be configured to
find <br>
existing instances of a running process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: unless --pid or --pidfile
are specified, start-stop-daemon behaves similar to
killall(1). start-stop-daemon will scan the process table
looking for any processes which <br>
match the process name, parent pid, uid, and/or gid (if
specified). Any matching process will prevent --start from
starting the daemon. All matching processes will be sent the
<br>
TERM signal (or the one specified via --signal or --retry)
if --stop is specified. For daemons which have long-lived
children which need to live through a --stop, you must
spec&acirc; <br>
ify a pidfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
-S, --start [--] arguments <br>
Check for the existence of a specified process. If such a
process exists, start-stop-daemon does nothing, and exits
with error status 1 (0 if --oknodo is specified). If <br>
such a process does not exist, it starts an instance, using
either the executable specified by --exec or, if specified,
by --startas. Any arguments given after -- on the <br>
command line are passed unmodified to the program being
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --stop <br>
Checks for the existence of a specified process. If such a
process exists, start-stop-daemon sends it the signal
specified by --signal, and exits with error status 0. If
<br>
such a process does not exist, start-stop-daemon exits with
error status 1 (0 if --oknodo is specified). If --retry is
specified, then start-stop-daemon will check that <br>
the process(es) have terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --status <br>
Check for the existence of a specified process, and returns
an exit status code, according to the LSB Init Script
Actions (since version 1.16.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --help <br>
Show usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Matching options <br>
--pid pid <br>
Check for a process with the specified pid (since version
1.17.6). The pid must be a number greater than 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ppid ppid <br>
Check for a process with the specified parent pid ppid
(since version 1.17.7). The ppid must be a number greater
than 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pidfile pid-file <br>
Check whether a process has created the file pid-file. Note:
using this matching option alone might cause unintended
processes to be acted on, if the old process termi&acirc;
<br>
nated without being able to remove the pid-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exec executable <br>
Check for processes that are instances of this executable.
The executable argument should be an absolute pathname.
Note: this might not work as intended with interpreted <br>
scripts, as the executable will point to the interpreter.
Take into account processes running from inside a chroot
will also be matched, so other match restrictions might <br>
be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --name process-name <br>
Check for processes with the name process-name. The
process-name is usually the process filename, but it could
have been changed by the process itself. Note: on most
sys&acirc; <br>
tems this information is retrieved from the process comm
name from the kernel, which tends to have a relatively short
length limit (assuming more than 15 characters is <br>
non-portable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user username|uid <br>
Check for processes owned by the user specified by username
or uid. Note: using this matching option alone will cause
all processes matching the user to be acted on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generic options <br>
-g, --group group|gid <br>
Change to group or gid when starting the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --signal signal <br>
With --stop, specifies the signal to send to processes being
stopped (default TERM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --retry timeout|schedule
<br>
With --stop, specifies that start-stop-daemon is to check
whether the process(es) do finish. It will check repeatedly
whether any matching processes are running, until <br>
none are. If the processes do not exit it will then take
further action as determined by the schedule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If timeout is specified instead
of schedule, then the schedule signal/timeout/KILL/timeout
is used, where signal is the signal specified with
--signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">schedule is a list of at least
two items separated by slashes (/); each item may be
-signal-number or [-]signal-name, which means to send that
signal, or timeout, which <br>
means to wait that many seconds for processes to exit, or
forever, which means to repeat the rest of the schedule
forever if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the end of the schedule is
reached and forever is not specified, then start-stop-daemon
exits with error status 2. If a schedule is specified, then
any signal speci&acirc; <br>
fied with --signal is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --startas pathname <br>
With --start, start the process specified by pathname. If
not specified, defaults to the argument given to --exec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --test <br>
Print actions that would be taken and set appropriate return
value, but take no action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --oknodo <br>
Return exit status 0 instead of 1 if no actions are (would
be) taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Do not print informational messages; only display error
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --chuid
username|uid[:group|gid] <br>
Change to this username/uid before starting the process. You
can also specify a group by appending a :, then the group or
gid in the same way as you would for the chown(1) <br>
command (user:group). If a user is specified without a
group, the primary GID for that user is used. When using
this option you must realize that the primary and
supple&acirc; <br>
mental groups are set as well, even if the --group option is
not specified. The --group option is only for groups that
the user isn&rsquo;t normally a member of (like adding per
<br>
process group membership for generic users like nobody).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --chroot root <br>
Chdir and chroot to root before starting the process. Please
note that the pidfile is also written after the chroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --chdir path <br>
Chdir to path before starting the process. This is done
after the chroot if the -r|--chroot option is set. When not
specified, start-stop-daemon will chdir to the root <br>
directory before starting the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --background <br>
Typically used with programs that don&rsquo;t detach on
their own. This option will force start-stop-daemon to fork
before starting the process, and force it into the
back&acirc; <br>
ground. Warning: start-stop-daemon cannot check the exit
status if the process fails to execute for any reason. This
is a last resort, and is only meant for programs that <br>
either make no sense forking on their own, or where
it&rsquo;s not feasible to add the code for them to do this
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --no-close <br>
Do not close any file descriptor when forcing the daemon
into the background (since version 1.16.5). Used for
debugging purposes to see the process output, or to redirect
<br>
file descriptors to log the process output. Only relevant
when using --background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --nicelevel int <br>
This alters the priority of the process before starting
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --procsched policy:priority
<br>
This alters the process scheduler policy and priority of the
process before starting it (since version 1.15.0). The
priority can be optionally specified by appending a : <br>
followed by the value. The default priority is 0. The
currently supported policy values are other, fifo and
rr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --iosched class:priority
<br>
This alters the IO scheduler class and priority of the
process before starting it (since version 1.15.0). The
priority can be optionally specified by appending a :
fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the value. The default priority is 4, unless class
is idle, then priority will always be 7. The currently
supported values for class are idle, best-effort and <br>
real-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --umask mask <br>
This sets the umask of the process before starting it (since
version 1.13.22).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --make-pidfile <br>
Used when starting a program that does not create its own
pid file. This option will make start-stop-daemon create the
file referenced with --pidfile and place the pid <br>
into it just before executing the process. Note, the file
will only be removed when stopping the program if
--remove-pidfile is used. Note: This feature may not work in
<br>
all cases. Most notably when the program being executed
forks from its main process. Because of this, it is usually
only useful when combined with the --background option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-pidfile <br>
Used when stopping a program that does not remove its own
pid file (since version 1.17.19). This option will make
start-stop-daemon remove the file referenced with
--pid&acirc; <br>
file after terminating the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print verbose informational messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The requested action was performed. If --oknodo was
specified, it&rsquo;s also possible that nothing had to be
done. This can happen when --start was specified and a
matching <br>
process was already running, or when --stop was specified
and there were no matching processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 If --oknodo was not specified
and nothing was done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 If --stop and --retry were
specified, but the end of the schedule was reached and the
processes were still running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Any other error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the --status command,
the following status codes are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Program is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Program is not running and the
pid file exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Program is not running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Unable to determine program
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Start the food daemon, unless one is already running (a
process named food, running as user food, with pid in
food.pid):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start-stop-daemon --start
--oknodo --user food --name food --pidfile /run/food.pid
--startas /usr/sbin/food --chuid food -- --daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send SIGTERM to food and wait up
to 5 seconds for it to stop:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start-stop-daemon --stop
--oknodo --user food --name food --pidfile /run/food.pid
--retry 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Demonstration of a custom
schedule for stopping food:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start-stop-daemon --stop
--oknodo --user food --name food --pidfile /run/food.pid
--retry=TERM/30/KILL/5</p>
