<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
perfdhcp is a DHCP benchmarking tool. It provides a way of
measuring the performance of DHCP servers by generating
large amounts of traffic from simulated multiple clients. It
is <br>
able to test both IPv4 and IPv6 servers, and provides
statistics concerning response times and the number of
requests that are dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tests are run using
the full four-packet exchange sequence (DORA for DHCPv4,
SARR for DHCPv6). An option is provided to run tests using
the initial two-packet <br>
exchange (DO and SA) instead. It is also possible to
configure perfdhcp to send DHCPv6 RENEW and RELEASE messages
at a specified rate in parallel with the DHCPv6 four-way
<br>
exchanges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running a performance test,
perfdhcp will exchange packets with the server under test as
fast as possible unless the -r is given to limit the request
rate. The length of the <br>
test can be limited by setting a threshold on any or all of
the number of requests made by perfdhcp, the elapsed time,
or the number of requests dropped by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPLATES <br>
To allow the contents of packets sent to the server to be
customized, perfdhcp allows the specification of template
files that determine the contents of the packets. For
example, <br>
the customized packet may contain a DHCPv6 ORO to request a
set of options to be returned by the server, or it may
contain the Client FQDN option to request that server
performs <br>
DNS updates. This may be used to discover performance
bottlenecks for different server configurations (e.g. DDNS
enabled or disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to two template files can be
specified on the command line, each file representing the
contents of a particular type of packet, the type being
determined by the test being <br>
carried out. For example, if testing DHCPv6:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With no template
files specified on the command line, perfdhcp will generate
both SOLICIT and REQUEST packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With one
template file specified, that file will be used as the
pattern for SOLICIT packets: perfdhcp will generate the
REQUEST packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With two
template files given on the command line, the first will be
used as the pattern for SOLICIT packets, the second as the
pattern for REQUEST packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Similar determination applies
to DHCPv4&rsquo;s DISCOVER and REQUEST packets.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The template file holds the DHCP
packet represented as a stream of ASCII hexadecimal digits
and it excludes any IP/UDP stack headers. The template file
must not contain any <br>
characters other than hexadecimal digits and spaces. Spaces
are discarded when the template file is parsed (so in the
file, &rsquo;12B4&rsquo; is the same as &rsquo;12 B4&rsquo;
which is the same as &rsquo;1 <br>
2 B 4&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The template files should be
used in conjunction with the command line parameters which
specify offsets of the data fields being modified in
outbound packets. For example, the -E <br>
time-offset switch specifies the offset of the DHCPv6
Elapsed Time option in the packet template. If the offset is
specified, perfdhcp will inject the current elapsed time
value <br>
into this field before sending the packet to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many scenarios, perfdhcp
needs to simulate multiple clients (having unique client
identifier). Since packets for each client are generated
from the same template file, it is <br>
necessary to randomize the client identifier (or HW address
in DHCPv4) in the packet created from it. The -O
random-offset option allows specification of the offset in
the <br>
template where randomization should be performed. It is
important to note that this offset points to the end (not
the beginning) of the client identifier (or HW address
field). <br>
The number of bytes being randomized depends on the number
of simulated clients. If the number of simulated clients is
between 1 and 255, only one byte (to which randomization
<br>
offset points) will be randomized. If the number of
simulated clients is between 256 and 65535, two bytes will
be randomized. Note, that two last bytes of the client
identifier <br>
will be randomized in this case: the byte which
randomization offset parameter points to, and the one which
precedes it (random-offset - 1). If the number of simulated
clients <br>
exceeds 65535, three bytes will be randomized; and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Templates may be currently used
to generate packets being sent to the server in 4-way
exchanges, i.e. SOLICIT, REQUEST (DHCPv6) and DISCOVER,
REQUEST (DHCPv4). They cannot be <br>
used when RENEW or RELEASE packets are being sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-1 <br>
Take the server-ID option from the first received
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 <br>
DHCPv4 operation; this is the default. It is incompatible
with the -6 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 <br>
DHCPv6 operation. This is incompatible with the -4
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a aggressivity <br>
When the target sending rate is not yet reached, control how
many exchanges are initiated before the next pause. This is
a positive integer and defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b basetype=value <br>
The base MAC or DUID used to simulate different clients. The
basetype may be &quot;mac&quot; or &quot;duid&quot;. (The
keyword &quot;ether&quot; may alternatively used for MAC.)
The -b option can be <br>
specified multiple times. The MAC address must consist of
six octets separated by single (:) or double (::) colons,
for example: mac=00:0c:01:02:03:04. The DUID value is a <br>
hexadecimal string: it must be at least six octets long and
must not be longer than 64 bytes and the length must be less
than 128 hexadecimal digits, for example: <br>
duid=0101010101010101010110111F14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d drop-time <br>
Specify the time after which a request is treated as having
been lost. The value is given in seconds and may contain a
fractional component. The default is 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e lease-type <br>
Specifies the type of lease being requested from the server.
It may be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address-only <br>
Only regular addresses (v4 or v6) will be requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefix-only <br>
Only IPv6 prefixes will be requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address-and-prefix <br>
Both IPv6 addresses and prefixes will be requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e prefix-only and -e
address-and-prefix forms may not be used with the -4
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f renew-rate <br>
Rate at which DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 renew requests are sent to a
server. This value is only valid when used in conjunction
with the exchange rate (given by -r rate). Furthermore <br>
the sum of this value and the release-rate (given by -F
rate) must be equal to or less than the exchange rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Print help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Do only the initial part of the exchange: DISCOVER-OFFER if
-4 is selected, SOLICIT-ADVERTISE if -6 is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i is incompatible with the
following options: -1, -d, -D, -E, -S, -I and -F. In
addition, it cannot be used with multiple instances of -O,
-T and -X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l local-addr|interface <br>
For DHCPv4 operation, specify the local hostname/address to
use when communicating with the server. By default, the
interface address through which traffic would normally be
<br>
routed to the server is used. For DHCPv6 operation, specify
the name of the network interface through which exchanges
are initiated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L local-port <br>
Specify the local port to use. This must be zero or a
positive integer up to 65535. A value of 0 (the default)
allows perfdhcp to choose its own port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M mac-list-file <br>
A text file containing a list of MAC addresses, one per
line. If provided, a MAC address will be choosen randomly
from this list for every new exchange. In the DHCPv6 case,
<br>
MAC addresses are used to generate DUID-LLs. This parameter
must not be used in conjunction with the -b parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P preload <br>
Initiate preload exchanges back to back at startup. preload
must be 0 (the default) or a positive integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rate <br>
Initiate rate DORA/SARR (or if -i is given, DO/SA) exchanges
per second. A periodic report is generated showing the
number of exchanges which were not completed, as well as
<br>
the average response latency. The program continues until
interrupted, at which point a final report is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R num-clients <br>
Specify how many different clients are used. With a value of
1 (the default), all requests seem to come from the same
client. num-clients must be a positive number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s seed <br>
Specify the seed for randomization, making runs of perfdhcp
repeatable. seed is 0 or a positive integer. The value 0
means that a seed is not used; this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T template-file <br>
The name of a file containing the template to use as a
stream of hexadecimal digits. This may be specified up to
two times and controls the contents of the packets sent (see
<br>
the &quot;TEMPLATES&quot; section above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Print the version of this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w wrapped <br>
Command to call with a single parameter of &quot;start&quot;
or &quot;stop&quot; at the beginning/end of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x diagnostic-selector <br>
Include extended diagnostics in the output.
diagnostic-selector is a string of single-keywords
specifying the operations for which verbose output is
desired. The selector <br>
key letters are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a <br>
Print the decoded command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e <br>
Print the exit reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i <br>
Print rate processing details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s <br>
Print the first server-ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t <br>
When finished, print timers of all successful exchanges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T <br>
When finished, print templates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCPv4-Only Options <br>
The following options only apply for DHCPv4 (i.e. when -4 is
given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B <br>
Force broadcast handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCPv6-Only Options <br>
The following options only apply for DHCPv6 (i.e. when -6 is
given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Add a rapid commit option (exchanges will be
SOLICIT-ADVERTISE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F release-rate <br>
Rate at which IPv6 RELEASE requests are sent to a server.
This value is only valid when used in conjunction with the
exchange rate (given by -r rate). Furthermore the sum of
<br>
this value and the renew-rate (given by -f rate) must be
equal to or less than the exchange rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A encapsulation-level <br>
Specifies that relayed traffic must be generated. The
argument specifies the level of encapsulation, i.e. how many
relay agents are simulated. Currently the only supported
<br>
encapsulation-level value is 1, which means that the
generated traffic is an equivalent of the traffic passing
through a single relay agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Template-Related Options <br>
The following options may only be used in conjunction with
-T and control how perfdhcp modifies the template. The
options may be specified multiple times on the command line;
<br>
each occurrence affects the corresponding template file (see
&quot;TEMPLATES&quot; above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E time-offset <br>
Offset of the (DHCPv4) secs field or (DHCPv6) elapsed-time
option in the (second i.e. REQUEST) template and must be 0
or a positive integer: a value of 0 disables this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I ip-offset <br>
Offset of the (DHCPv4) IP address in the requested-IP option
/ (DHCPv6) IA_NA option in the (second/request)
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O random-offset <br>
Offset of the last octet to randomize in the template.
random-offset must be an integer greater than 3. The -T
switch must be given to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S srvid-offset <br>
Offset of the server-ID option in the (second/request)
template. srvid-offset must be a positive integer, and the
switch can only be used when the template option (-T) is
<br>
also given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X xid-offset <br>
Offset of the transaction ID (xid) in the template.
xid-offset must be a positive integer, and the switch can
only be used when the template option (-T) is also
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling a Test <br>
The following options may only be used in conjunction with
-r and control both the length of the test and the frequency
of reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D max-drop <br>
Abort the test if more than max-drop requests have been
dropped. Use -D 0 to abort if even a single request has been
dropped. If max-drop includes the suffix &rsquo;%&rsquo;, it
<br>
specifies a maximum percentage of requests that may be
dropped before abort. In this case, testing of the threshold
begins after 10 requests have been expected to be <br>
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num-requests <br>
Initiate num-request transactions. No report is generated
until all transactions have been initiated/waited-for, after
which a report is generated and the program terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p test-period <br>
Send requests for test-period, which is specified in the
same manner as -d. This can be used as an alternative to -n,
or both options can be given, in which case the testing <br>
is completed when either limit is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t interval <br>
Sets the delay (in seconds) between two successive
reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments <br>
server <br>
Server to test, specified as an IP address. In the DHCPv6
case, the special name &rsquo;all&rsquo; can be used to
refer to All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers (the multicast
address <br>
FF02::1:2), or the special name &rsquo;servers&rsquo; to
refer to All_DHCP_Servers (the multicast address FF05::1:3).
The server is mandatory except where the -l option is given
to <br>
specify an interface, in which case it defaults to
&rsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
perfdhcp can report the following errors in the packet
exchange:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tooshort <br>
A message was received that was too short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orphans <br>
Received a message which doesn&rsquo;t match one sent to the
server (i.e. it is a duplicate message, a message that has
arrived after an excessive delay, or one that is just not
<br>
recognized).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">locallimit <br>
Reached local system limits when sending a message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
perfdhcp can exit with one of the following status
codes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 <br>
Success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 <br>
General error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 <br>
Error in command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 <br>
No general failures in operation, but one or more exchanges
were unsuccessful.</p>
