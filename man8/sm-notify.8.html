<p>SM-NOTIFY(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
SM-NOTIFY(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sm-notify - send reboot notifications to NFS peers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/sm-notify [-dfn] [-m minutes] [-v name] [-p
notify-port] [-P path]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
File locks are not part of persistent file system state.
Lock state is thus lost when a host reboots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network file systems must also
detect when lock state is lost because a remote host has
rebooted. After an NFS client reboots, an NFS server must
release all file locks held by <br>
applications that were running on that client. After a
server reboots, a client must remind the server of file
locks held by applications running on that client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For NFS version 2 and version 3,
the Network Status Monitor protocol (or NSM for short) is
used to notify NFS peers of reboots. On Linux, two separate
user-space components con&acirc; <br>
stitute the NSM service:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sm-notify <br>
A helper program that notifies NFS peers after the local
system reboots</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpc.statd <br>
A daemon that listens for reboot notifications from other
hosts, and manages the list of hosts to be notified when the
local system reboots</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local NFS lock manager
alerts its local rpc.statd of each remote peer that should
be monitored. When the local system reboots, the sm-notify
command notifies the NSM service <br>
on monitored peers of the reboot. When a remote reboots,
that peer notifies the local rpc.statd, which in turn passes
the reboot notification back to the local NFS lock
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NSM OPERATION IN DETAIL <br>
The first file locking interaction between an NFS client and
server causes the NFS lock managers on both peers to contact
their local NSM service to store information about the <br>
opposite peer. On Linux, the local lock manager contacts
rpc.statd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpc.statd records information
about each monitored NFS peer on persistent storage. This
information describes how to contact a remote peer in case
the local system reboots, how <br>
to recognize which monitored peer is reporting a reboot, and
how to notify the local lock manager when a monitored peer
indicates it has rebooted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An NFS client sends a hostname,
known as the client&rsquo;s caller_name, in each file lock
request. An NFS server can use this hostname to send
asynchronous GRANT calls to a client, <br>
or to notify the client it has rebooted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Linux NFS server can provide
the client&rsquo;s caller_name or the client&rsquo;s network
address to rpc.statd. For the purposes of the NSM protocol,
this name or address is known as <br>
the monitored peer&rsquo;s mon_name. In addition, the local
lock manager tells rpc.statd what it thinks its own hostname
is. For the purposes of the NSM protocol, this hostname is
<br>
known as my_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no equivalent
interaction between an NFS server and a client to inform the
client of the server&rsquo;s caller_name. Therefore NFS
clients do not actually know what mon_name <br>
an NFS server might use in an SM_NOTIFY request. The Linux
NFS client records the server&rsquo;s hostname used on the
mount command to identify rebooting NFS servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reboot notification <br>
When the local system reboots, the sm-notify command reads
the list of monitored peers from persistent storage and
sends an SM_NOTIFY request to the NSM service on each listed
<br>
remote peer. It uses the mon_name string as the destination.
To identify which host has rebooted, the sm-notify command
normally sends my_name string recorded when that remote <br>
was monitored. The remote rpc.statd matches incoming
SM_NOTIFY requests using this string, or the caller&rsquo;s
network address, to one or more peers on its own monitor
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rpc.statd does not find a
peer on its monitor list that matches an incoming SM_NOTIFY
request, the notification is not forwarded to the local lock
manager. In addition, each <br>
peer has its own NSM state number, a 32-bit integer that is
bumped after each reboot by the sm-notify command. rpc.statd
uses this number to distinguish between actual reboots <br>
and replayed notifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Part of NFS lock recovery is
rediscovering which peers need to be monitored again. The
sm-notify command clears the monitor list on persistent
storage after each reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Keeps sm-notify attached to its controlling terminal and
running in the foreground so that notification progress may
be monitored directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Send notifications even if
sm-notify has already run since the last system reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m retry-time <br>
Specifies the length of time, in minutes, to continue
retrying notifications to unresponsive hosts. If this option
is not specified, sm-notify attempts to send notifica&acirc;
<br>
tions for 15 minutes. Specifying a value of 0 causes
sm-notify to continue sending notifications to unresponsive
peers until it is manually killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notifications are retried if
sending fails, the remote does not respond, the
remote&rsquo;s NSM service is not registered, or if there is
a DNS failure which prevents the <br>
remote&rsquo;s mon_name from being resolved to an
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hosts are not removed from the
notification list until a valid reply has been received.
However, the SM_NOTIFY procedure has a void result. There is
no way for sm-notify <br>
to tell if the remote recognized the sender and has started
appropriate lock recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Prevents sm-notify from
updating the local system&rsquo;s NSM state number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Specifies the source port number sm-notify should use when
sending reboot notifications. If this option is not
specified, a randomly chosen ephemeral port is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to
traverse a firewall between client and server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --state-directory-path
pathname <br>
Specifies the pathname of the parent directory where NSM
state information resides. If this option is not specified,
sm-notify uses /var/lib/nfs/statd by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After starting, sm-notify
attempts to set its effective UID and GID to the owner and
group of this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v ipaddr | hostname <br>
Specifies the network address from which to send reboot
notifications, and the mon_name argument to use when sending
SM_NOTIFY requests. If this option is not specified, <br>
sm-notify uses a wildcard address as the transport bind
address, and uses the my_name recorded when the remote was
monitored as the mon_name argument when sending <br>
SM_NOTIFY requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ipaddr form can be expressed
as either an IPv4 or an IPv6 presentation address. If the
ipaddr form is used, the sm-notify command converts this
address to a hostname <br>
for use as the mon_name argument when sending SM_NOTIFY
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be useful in
multi-homed configurations where the remote requires
notification from a specific network address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
The sm-notify command must be started as root to acquire
privileges needed to access the state information database.
It drops root privileges as soon as it starts up to reduce
<br>
the risk of a privilege escalation attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During normal operation, the
effective user ID it chooses is the owner of the state
directory. This allows it to continue to access files in
that directory after it has dropped <br>
its root privileges. To control which user ID rpc.statd
chooses, simply use chown(1) to set the owner of the state
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDITIONAL NOTES <br>
Lock recovery after a reboot is critical to maintaining data
integrity and preventing unnecessary application hangs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To help rpc.statd match
SM_NOTIFY requests to NLM requests, a number of best
practices should be observed, including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UTS nodename of your systems
should match the DNS names that NFS peers use to contact
them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UTS nodenames of your
systems should always be fully qualified domain names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The forward and reverse DNS
mapping of the UTS nodenames should be consistent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hostname the client uses to
mount the server should match the server&rsquo;s mon_name in
SM_NOTIFY requests it sends</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unmounting an NFS file system
does not necessarily stop either the NFS client or server
from monitoring each other. Both may continue monitoring
each other for a time in case <br>
subsequent NFS traffic between the two results in fresh
mounts and additional file locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, if the lockd kernel
module is unloaded during normal operation, all remote NFS
peers are unmonitored. This can happen on an NFS client, for
example, if an automounter <br>
removes all NFS mount points due to inactivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 and TI-RPC support <br>
TI-RPC is a pre-requisite for supporting NFS on IPv6. If
TI-RPC support is built into the sm-notify command ,it will
choose an appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 transport based on the
<br>
network address returned by DNS for each remote peer. It
should be fully compatible with remote systems that do not
support TI-RPC or IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the sm-notify command
supports sending notification only via datagram transport
protocols.</p>
