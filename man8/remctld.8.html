<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>remctld</b> is the server for remctl. It accepts a connection from remctl,
  receives the command to execute and the arguments, verifies authorization of
  the user and executes the command, returning the result back to the client.
  All connections are authenticated using Kerberos GSS-API Kerberos, and all
  transmissions are also encrypted using the GSS-API privacy layer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>remctld</b> is normally started using <b>tcpserver</b> or from <b>inetd</b>,
  but it may be run in stand-alone mode as a daemon using <b>-m</b>. Either
  <b>-s</b> must be given to use an alternate identity (which will require the
  same flag be used for <b>remctl</b> client invocations), or it must be run as
  root to read the host keytab file. <b>remctld</b> logs its activity using
  syslog (the daemon facility).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The location of the configuration file may be specified with the <b>-f</b>
  option. The default location is <i>/etc/remctl.conf</i>. For information on
  the format of the configuration file, see &quot;CONFIGURATION FILE&quot;
  below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the command is run, several environment variables will be set providing
  information about the remote connection. See ENVIRONMENT below for more
  information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Command-line and configuration options and ACL methods are annotated below with
  the version at which they were added. For version information for more general
  features, see COMPATIBILITY below.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE">CONFIGURATION
  FILE</a></h1>
The configuration file defines the allowed commands and specifies access control
  information. The configuration file format is lines of space- or tab-separated
  strings, where each line is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    command subcommand executable [option=value ...] acl [acl ...]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each command consists of a command, a subcommand, and zero or more arguments.
  Each configuration line defines an acceptable command and subcommand (or, if
  &quot;ALL&quot; is used as mentioned below under <i>command</i> and
  <i>subcommand</i>, a set of commands). The first configuration line matching
  the received command is used, so list more specific entries before more
  general entries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Blank lines and lines beginning with &quot;#&quot; are ignored. Lines can be
  continued on the next line by ending them with a backslash (&quot;\&quot;). Be
  aware that comments can be continued with a backslash as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a special case, a line like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    include file
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will include <i>file</i> as if its contents were pasted verbatim into the
  configuration file at that point. <i>file</i> may be a directory, in which
  case all files whose names do not contain a period found in that directory
  will be included (in no particular order). <i>file</i> should be a fully
  qualified path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The meaning of the fields on each configuration line are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>command</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The command being issued or the special keyword
      &quot;ALL&quot;. Normally, related commands (such as all commands for
      managing a particular service) are grouped together as subcommands under
      one command.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the keyword &quot;ALL&quot; is used instead of a specific subcommand,
      this line matches all commands with the given subcommand (so &quot;ALL
      ALL&quot; matches any command) and can be used to dispatch all commands to
      the same executable with the same ACLs. Since the first matching entry is
      used, list entries for specific commands first (if any) and then the
      &quot;ALL&quot; catch-all.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that while the subcommand is passed to the executable as a command-line
      option, the command is not. The command is available to the executable in
      the environment variable REMCTL_COMMAND (see ENVIRONMENT below).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The command &quot;help&quot; is handled specially if no such command is
      defined in the configuration file. See below under the &quot;help&quot;
      and &quot;summary&quot; options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>subcommand</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The subcommand within the command being requested, such as
      &quot;release&quot; for the release function of the AFS volume backend, or
      one of the special keywords &quot;ALL&quot; or &quot;EMPTY&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the keyword &quot;ALL&quot; is used instead of a specific subcommand,
      this line matches all subcommands with the given command and can be used
      to dispatch all subcommands under that command to the same executable with
      the same ACLs. Since the first matching entry is used, list entries for
      specific services first (if any) and then the &quot;ALL&quot; catch-all.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the keyword &quot;EMPTY&quot; is used instead of a specific subcommand,
      this line matches only commands where no subcommand was given.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The subcommand is always passed as the first argument to the executable
      program that is listed for that service unless no subcommand was

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If remctld receives the command &quot;help&quot; with one or two arguments,
      and no &quot;help&quot; command is defined in the configuration file, the
      server will take the command arguments as a command and subcommand. It
      will then look through the configuration for a configuration line matching
      that command and subcommand with a &quot;help&quot; option set. If one is
      found and the user is authorized to run that command, the server will run
      the specified <i>executable</i> with the argument <i>arg</i> and second
      and optional third arguments taken from the arguments to the
      &quot;help&quot; command, sending the output back to the user.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This permits a standard interface to get additional help for a particular

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">logmask=<i>n</i>[,...]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[1.4] Limit logging of command arguments. Any argument
      listed in the logmask list will have its value logged as
      &quot;**MASKED**&quot;. This is to avoid logging the arguments of commands
      that take private information such as passwords. The logmask list should
      contain argument numbers separated by commas, with the <i>subcommand</i>
      considered argument 1. The <i>command</i> argument cannot be masked.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, if the command is &quot;admin passwd <i>username</i>
      <i>password</i>&quot;, then you'd want to set logmask to 3, so the
      password argument gets logged as &quot;**MASKED**&quot;. If the command is
      &quot;user passwd <i>username</i> <i>old-password</i>
      <i>new-password</i>&quot;, you'd want to set logmask to
    &quot;3,4&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">stdin=(<i>n</i> | &quot;last&quot;)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[2.14] Specifies that the <i>n</i>th or last argument to
      the command be passed on standard input instead of on the command line.
      The value of this option must either be the number of argument to pass on
      standard input (with the <i>subcommand</i> considered argument 1) or the
      special value &quot;last&quot;, which indicates that the final argument
      (no matter how many there are) be passed on standard input.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>command</i> cannot be passed on standard input, so <i>n</i> must be
      at least 1. If this option is set to &quot;last&quot; and no arguments are
      given except the <i>command</i> and possibly the <i>subcommand</i>,
      nothing will be passed on standard input.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is used primarily for passing large amounts of data that may not
      fit on the command line or data that contains NUL characters. It can also
      be used for arguments like passwords that shouldn't be exposed on the
      command line. Only at most one argument may be passed on standard input to
      the command. Be aware that even if the <i>subcommand</i> is the designated
      argument to pass on standard input (&quot;stdin=1&quot;), the
      <i>subcommand</i> may not contain NUL characters.</dd>

      <b>sudo</b> is determined when <b>remctld</b> is built.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>user</i> option is simpler and easier if <b>remctld</b> is running as
      root. However, it may be desirable in some configurations to run
      <b>remctld</b> as a non-root user, and <b>remctl-shell</b> (which shares
      the same configuration files) usually runs as a non-root user. In those
      cases, this option can be used to use <b>sudo</b> to switch users before
      running the command.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since the argument is passed verbatim to <b>sudo</b>'s <b>-u</b> option, you
      can specify a numeric UID by prepending it with &quot;#&quot;.</dd>

    If remctld receives the command &quot;help&quot; with no arguments, and no
      &quot;help&quot; command is defined in the configuration file, the server
      will look through the configuration for any command with a
      &quot;summary&quot; option set. If this option is set, and the user is
      authorized to run the command, the server will run the specified
      <i>executable</i> with the argument <i>arg</i>, sending the output back to
      the user. It will do this for every command in the configuration that
      meets the above criteria.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This allows display of a summary of available commands to the user based on

      &quot;deny&quot; rules to be effective, they therefore must come before
      any ACLs they are intended to override. Be careful when using
      &quot;deny&quot; when including a directory of ACL files, since the files
      in that directory are read in an undefined order (not in alphabetical
      order by filename). It's best to explicitly include the file containing
      &quot;deny&quot; ACL rules first.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that &quot;deny&quot; only denies access; it never grants it. Thus,
      deny alone does not grant access to anyone, and using deny on itself as in
      &quot;deny:deny:foo&quot; neither denies nor grants access to anyone.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">gput</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[2.13] This method is used to grant access based on the CMU
      GPUT (Global Privileged User Table -- see <i>gput</i>(5)). The data is
      either a GPUT role name or a string of the form
      <i>group</i>[<i>xform</i>], where <i>group</i> is a GPUT role name and
      <i>xform</i> is a GPUT transform string. Access is granted if the user is
      a member of the specified GPUT group, after applying either the optional
      <i>xform</i> or the default transform.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This method is supported only if <b>remctld</b> was compiled with GPUT

  <dt class="It-tag">localgroup</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[3.9] This method is used to grant or deny access based on
      membership in local UNIX groups. The data is taken to be a name of a local
      system group. The user principal is converted to a local user name with
      <i>krb5_aname_to_localname</i>(3) and then compared to the members of the
      given group.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, to allow access to the members of group &quot;goodguys&quot;,
      use an ACL of &quot;localgroup:goodguys&quot; syntax. To deny access to
      the members of group &quot;badguys&quot;, use
      &quot;deny:localgroup:badguys&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>krb5_aname_to_localname()</i> follows local configuration rules to
      determine how to convert Kerberos principal to local users. If the realm
      of the principal is not in a local realm and is not otherwise covered by
      one of those rules, the principal will be unchanged, which will almost
      certainly mean that it will not be a member of any local group and access
      will be denied.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

The keyword ANYUSER may be used instead of the ACLs to allow access to all
  users. The user still needs to authenticate to <b>remctld</b>; this only
  affects authorization. This can be used for backend programs that want to
  check ACLs themselves and will retrieve the authenticated principal from the

<div class="Pp"></div>
When running in stand-alone mode, these environment variables will be cleared by
  <b>remctld</b> before running any commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following environment variables will be set for any commands run via
  <b>remctld</b> (annotated with the version at which they were added):
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">[2.16] The command string that caused this command to be

If the <b>-k</b> flag is used, <b>remctld</b> will also set KRB5_KTNAME to the
  provided keytab path. This is primarily for communication with the GSS-API
  library, but this setting will also be inherited by any commands run by
  <b>remctld</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Typically <b>remctld</b> is to be started as follows, where &quot;hostname&quot;
  is the machine where remctld will run, and 4373 is the port:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tcpserver hostname 4373 remctld
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The equivalent line for <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i> is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    4373 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/remctld
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    remctl stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/remctld
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
if the &quot;remctl&quot; service is listed in your <i>/etc/services</i> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start <b>remctld</b> in stand-alone mode instead, run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    remctld -m
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start <b>remctld</b> in stand-alone mode in the foreground, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    remctld -F -m
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a typical invocation with systemd using socket activation. For upstart
  (with &quot;expect stop&quot;), use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    remctld -F -m -Z
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example configuration file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 # Comments can be used like this.
 accounts create /usr/local/bin/doaccount  /etc/acl/group1 \
     /etc/acl/group2
 accounts delete /usr/local/bin/doaccount  /etc/acl/group3
 accounts view   /usr/local/bin/doaccount  ANYUSER
 accounts passwd /usr/local/bin/dopasswd   logmask=3 /etc/acl/group1
 printing ALL    /usr/local/bin/printthing /etc/acl/group2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The commands &quot;accounts create&quot;, &quot;accounts delete&quot;, and so
  forth will all be passed to /usr/local/bin/doaccount with the first argument
  being the specific subcommand, with the exception of &quot;accounts
  passwd&quot;. That command will be passed to /usr/local/bin/dopasswd instead,
  but it will still get &quot;passwd&quot; as its first argument. The third
  argument to &quot;accounts passwd&quot; (presumably the password) will not be
  logged to syslog. All commands starting with &quot;printing&quot; will be
  passed to /usr/local/bin/printthing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example ACL file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # This is a comment.
    deny:baduser@EXAMPLE.ORG
    file:/etc/remctl/acl/admins
    principal:service/admin@EXAMPLE.ORG
    service/other@EXAMPLE.ORG
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This ACL file will reject &quot;baduser@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot; even if that user
  would have been allowed by one of the other ACL rules. It will then grant
  access according to the ACL entries in <i>/etc/remctl/acl/admins</i> and the
  specific principals &quot;service/admin@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot; and
  &quot;service/other@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;. The last line takes advantage of the
  default ACL method of &quot;principal&quot; when processing an ACL file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="selflink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
The version at which various command-line and configuration options and ACL
  methods were added to <b>remctld</b> are noted in their descriptions. Below is
  the version information for more general features, in reverse order of when
  the feature was added.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for the systemd readiness protocol and socket activation, including
  honoring the environment variables LISTEN_FDS, LISTEN_PID, and NOTIFY_SOCKET,
  was added in version 3.7.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Special handling of the &quot;help&quot; and &quot;summary&quot; commands was
  added in version 3.2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for the &quot;ALL&quot; keyword in the command field of the
  configuration file was added in version 2.15. (It has always been supported in
  the subcommand field.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for the &quot;EMPTY&quot; keyword in the subcommand field of the
  configuration file was added in version 2.15.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for ACL schemes and the <i>method</i>:<i>data</i> syntax was added in
  remctl 2.13. Prior versions of <b>remctld</b> expected only files in the main
  <b>remctld</b> configuration file, and only principals or lines starting with
  &quot;include&quot; in those files, without any <i>method</i>: prefixes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default listening port with the <b>-m</b> option was changed to the
  IANA-registered port of 4373 in version 2.11.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for IPv6 addresses in the REMOTE_ADDR environment variable was added in
  version 2.4.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>remctld</b> used to set the environment variable SCPRINCIPAL when running
  commands, for (partial) backward compatibility with <b>sysctld</b>, but
  stopped doing so in version 2.1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;include&quot; directives in ACL files were added in version 1.11.
  &quot;include&quot; directives in configuration files were added in version
  1.8.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
When using Heimdal with triple-DES keys and talking to old clients that only
  speak version one of the remctl protocol, <b>remctld</b> may have problems
  with MIC verification. This doesn't affect new clients and servers since the
  version two protocol doesn't use MICs. If you are using Heimdal and run into
  MIC verification problems, see the COMPATIBILITY section of <i>gssapi</i>(3).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>remctld</b> does not itself impose any limits on the number of child
  processes or other system resources. You may want to set resource limits in
  your inetd server or with <b>ulimit</b> when running it as a standalone daemon
  or under <b>tcpserver</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Command arguments may not contain NUL characters and must be shorter than the
  operating system limit on the length of a command line since they're passed to
  the command as command-line arguments. The exception is an argument passed via
  standard input using the &quot;stdin=&quot; option in the configuration file.
  At most one argument may be passed that way.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
The remctl port number, 4373, was derived by tracing the diagonals of a QWERTY
  keyboard up from the letters &quot;remc&quot; to the number row.
