<p>REMCTLD(8) remctl REMCTLD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
remctld - Server for remctl, a remote command execution
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
remctld [-dFhmSvZ] [-b bind-address [-b bind-address ...]]
<br>
[-f config] [-k keytab] [-P file] [-p port] <br>
[-s service]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
remctld is the server for remctl. It accepts a connection
from remctl, receives the command to execute and the
arguments, verifies authorization of the user and executes
the <br>
command, returning the result back to the client. All
connections are authenticated using Kerberos GSS-API
Kerberos, and all transmissions are also encrypted using the
GSS-API <br>
privacy layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctld is normally started
using tcpserver or from inetd, but it may be run in
stand-alone mode as a daemon using -m. Either -s must be
given to use an alternate identity <br>
(which will require the same flag be used for remctl client
invocations), or it must be run as root to read the host
keytab file. remctld logs its activity using syslog (the
<br>
daemon facility).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The location of the
configuration file may be specified with the -f option. The
default location is /etc/remctl.conf. For information on the
format of the configuration file, <br>
see &quot;CONFIGURATION FILE&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the command is run, several
environment variables will be set providing information
about the remote connection. See ENVIRONMENT below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command-line and configuration
options and ACL methods are annotated below with the version
at which they were added. For version information for more
general features, see <br>
COMPATIBILITY below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The start of each option description is annotated with the
version of remctld in which that option was added with its
current meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bind-address <br>
[2.17] When running as a standalone server, bind to the
specified local address rather than listening on all
interfaces. This option may be given multiple times to bind
to <br>
multiple addresses. bind-address must be an IP address
(either IPv4 or IPv6), not a hostname. Only makes sense in
combination with -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored if
remctld is passed already open sockets via the systemd
socket activation protocol. In that case, the bind addresses
of the sockets should be <br>
controlled via the systemd configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d [1.10] Enable verbose debug
logging to syslog (or to standard output if -S is also
given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F [2.8] Normally when running
in stand-alone mode (-m), remctld backgrounds itself to run
as a daemon, changes directory to /, and drops any
controlling terminal. This flag <br>
suppresses this behavior, usually for debugging or so that
remctld can be monitored by other processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config <br>
[1.0] The configuration file for remctld, overriding the
default path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h [1.10] Show a brief usage
message and then exit. This usage method will include a list
of supported ACL types and can be used to determine if
optional ACL methods were <br>
compiled into a given remctld build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keytab <br>
[2.8] Use keytab as the keytab for server credentials rather
than the system default or the value of the KRB5_KTNAME
environment variable. Using -k just sets the KRB5_KTNAME
<br>
environment variable internally in the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m [2.8] Enable stand-alone
mode. remctld will listen to its configured port and fork a
new child for each incoming connection. By default, when
this option is used, remctld <br>
also changes directory to /, backgrounds itself, and closes
standard input, output, and error. To not background, pass
-F as well. To not close standard output and error <br>
and continue using them for logging, pass -S as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine the port, remctld
attempts to look up the &quot;remctl&quot; service in the
local /etc/services file and uses the port defined there. If
the &quot;remctl&quot; service could not be <br>
found, it uses 4373, the registered remctl port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P file <br>
[2.0] When running in stand-alone mode (-m), write the PID
of remctld to file. This option is ignored unless -m is also
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
[1.0] When running in stand-alone mode, listen on port port
rather than the default. This option does nothing unless
used with -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored if
remctld is passed already open sockets via the systemd
socket activation protocol. In that case, the listening port
should be controlled via the <br>
systemd configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S [2.3] Rather than logging to
syslog, log debug and routine connection messages to
standard output and error messages to standard error. This
option is mostly useful for <br>
testing and debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s service <br>
[1.0] Specifies which principal is used as the server
identity for client authentication. The client must also use
the same identity as the server identity for <br>
authentication to succeed. By default, remctld accepts any
principal with a key in the default keytab file (which can
be changed with the -k option). This is normally the <br>
most desirable behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [1.10] Print the version of
remctld and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z [3.7] When remctld is running
in stand-alone mode, after it has set up its network socket
and is ready to answer requests, raise SIGSTOP. This signals
to upstart, when using <br>
&quot;expect stop&quot;, that the daemon is ready to accept
connections, and upstart will raise SIGCONT to allow remctld
to continue. This option is probably only useful when using
<br>
upstart as the init system. Only makes sense in combination
with -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file defines the allowed commands and
specifies access control information. The configuration file
format is lines of space- or tab-separated strings, where
<br>
each line is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command subcommand executable
[option=value ...] acl [acl ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command consists of a
command, a subcommand, and zero or more arguments. Each
configuration line defines an acceptable command and
subcommand (or, if &quot;ALL&quot; is used as <br>
mentioned below under command and subcommand, a set of
commands). The first configuration line matching the
received command is used, so list more specific entries
before more <br>
general entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines and lines beginning
with &quot;#&quot; are ignored. Lines can be continued on
the next line by ending them with a backslash (&quot; <br>
with a backslash as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, a line
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will include file as if its
contents were pasted verbatim into the configuration file at
that point. file may be a directory, in which case all files
whose names do not contain <br>
a period found in that directory will be included (in no
particular order). file should be a fully qualified
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meaning of the fields on
each configuration line are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command <br>
The command being issued or the special keyword
&quot;ALL&quot;. Normally, related commands (such as all
commands for managing a particular service) are grouped
together as <br>
subcommands under one command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the keyword &quot;ALL&quot;
is used instead of a specific subcommand, this line matches
all commands with the given subcommand (so &quot;ALL
ALL&quot; matches any command) and can be used to <br>
dispatch all commands to the same executable with the same
ACLs. Since the first matching entry is used, list entries
for specific commands first (if any) and then the
&quot;ALL&quot; <br>
catch-all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that while the subcommand
is passed to the executable as a command-line option, the
command is not. The command is available to the executable
in the environment <br>
variable REMCTL_COMMAND (see ENVIRONMENT below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command &quot;help&quot; is
handled specially if no such command is defined in the
configuration file. See below under the &quot;help&quot; and
&quot;summary&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subcommand <br>
The subcommand within the command being requested, such as
&quot;release&quot; for the release function of the AFS
volume backend, or one of the special keywords
&quot;ALL&quot; or &quot;EMPTY&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the keyword &quot;ALL&quot;
is used instead of a specific subcommand, this line matches
all subcommands with the given command and can be used to
dispatch all subcommands under that <br>
command to the same executable with the same ACLs. Since the
first matching entry is used, list entries for specific
services first (if any) and then the &quot;ALL&quot;
catch-all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the keyword &quot;EMPTY&quot;
is used instead of a specific subcommand, this line matches
only commands where no subcommand was given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The subcommand is always passed
as the first argument to the executable program that is
listed for that service unless no subcommand was given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">executable <br>
The full path to the command executable to run for this
command and subcommand combination. (See examples
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option=value <br>
An option setting that applies to this command. Supported
option settings, annotated with the version at which that
option was added in its current form, are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help=arg <br>
[3.2] Specifies the argument for this command that will
print help for a particular subcommand to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If remctld receives the command
&quot;help&quot; with one or two arguments, and no
&quot;help&quot; command is defined in the configuration
file, the server will take the command arguments <br>
as a command and subcommand. It will then look through the
configuration for a configuration line matching that command
and subcommand with a &quot;help&quot; option set. If one
<br>
is found and the user is authorized to run that command, the
server will run the specified executable with the argument
arg and second and optional third arguments taken <br>
from the arguments to the &quot;help&quot; command, sending
the output back to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This permits a standard
interface to get additional help for a particular remctl
command. Also see the &quot;summary&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logmask=n[,...] <br>
[1.4] Limit logging of command arguments. Any argument
listed in the logmask list will have its value logged as
&quot;**MASKED**&quot;. This is to avoid logging the
arguments of <br>
commands that take private information such as passwords.
The logmask list should contain argument numbers separated
by commas, with the subcommand considered argument <br>
1. The command argument cannot be masked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if the command is
&quot;admin passwd username password&quot;, then you&rsquo;d
want to set logmask to 3, so the password argument gets
logged as &quot;**MASKED**&quot;. If the <br>
command is &quot;user passwd username old-password
new-password&quot;, you&rsquo;d want to set logmask to
&quot;3,4&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stdin=(n | &quot;last&quot;)
<br>
[2.14] Specifies that the nth or last argument to the
command be passed on standard input instead of on the
command line. The value of this option must either be the
<br>
number of argument to pass on standard input (with the
subcommand considered argument 1) or the special value
&quot;last&quot;, which indicates that the final argument
(no matter <br>
how many there are) be passed on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command cannot be passed on
standard input, so n must be at least 1. If this option is
set to &quot;last&quot; and no arguments are given except
the command and possibly the <br>
subcommand, nothing will be passed on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is used primarily
for passing large amounts of data that may not fit on the
command line or data that contains NUL characters. It can
also be used for <br>
arguments like passwords that shouldn&rsquo;t be exposed on
the command line. Only at most one argument may be passed on
standard input to the command. Be aware that even if <br>
the subcommand is the designated argument to pass on
standard input (&quot;stdin=1&quot;), the subcommand may not
contain NUL characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sudo=(username | #uid) <br>
[3.12] Run this command as the specified user using sudo.
This is exactly equivalent to prepending &quot;sudo -u
username --&quot; to the command before running it. The path
to <br>
sudo is determined when remctld is built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user option is simpler and
easier if remctld is running as root. However, it may be
desirable in some configurations to run remctld as a
non-root user, and remctl- <br>
shell (which shares the same configuration files) usually
runs as a non-root user. In those cases, this option can be
used to use sudo to switch users before running the <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the argument is passed
verbatim to sudo&rsquo;s -u option, you can specify a
numeric UID by prepending it with &quot;#&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summary=arg <br>
[3.13] Specifies the argument for this command that will
print a usage summary to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If remctld receives the command
&quot;help&quot; with no arguments, and no &quot;help&quot;
command is defined in the configuration file, the server
will look through the configuration for <br>
any command with a &quot;summary&quot; option set. If this
option is set, and the user is authorized to run the
command, the server will run the specified executable with
the <br>
argument arg, sending the output back to the user. It will
do this for every command in the configuration that meets
the above criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows display of a summary
of available commands to the user based on which commands
that user is authorized to run. It&rsquo;s a lightweight
form of service discovery. <br>
Also see the &quot;help&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user=(username | uid) <br>
[3.1] Run this command as the specified user, which can be
given as either a username or as a UID. Even if given as a
UID, the user must be found in the user database <br>
(searched via getpwuid(3)). remctld will run the command as
the specified user, including that user&rsquo;s primary and
supplemental groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acl One or more entries of the
form [method:]data, where method specifies an access control
method to be used, and data contains parameters whose
meaning depends on the method. <br>
If the method is omitted, the data is processed as described
for the &quot;file&quot; method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If method is omitted, acl must
either begin with &quot;/&quot; or must not contain
&quot;=&quot;. Otherwise, it will be parsed as an option
instead. If there is any ambiguity, prepend the <br>
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special exception for
backward compatibility, the ACL &quot;ANYUSER&quot;
(case-sensitive) is treated as equivalent to
&quot;anyuser:auth&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each entry is checked in order,
and access is granted as soon as an entry matches. If no
entry matches, access is denied. The following methods may
supported; however, be <br>
aware that the availability of several ACL types depends on
whether remctld was built with that support. Each ACL type
is annotated with the version in which it was added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">anyuser <br>
[3.10] Permit access to any user. This comes in two
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">anyuser:auth <br>
Permit any authenticated user. This means not only the local
Kerberos realm but also any realm with which there is a
cross-realm trust relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">anyuser:anonymous <br>
Permit entirely anonymous users. This means no
authentication whatsoever is required to run the command.
Any client with network access to the server can run the
<br>
command (using anonymous PKINIT), assuming that anonymous
service tickets are enabled for the local Kerberos
realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backwards compatibility, the
ACL &quot;ANYUSER&quot; is treated as identical to
&quot;anyuser:auth&quot;. This was the only supported
any-user ACL syntax prior to remctl 3.10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file <br>
[2.13] The data is the full path of an ACL file or to a
directory containing ACL files. Directories are handled as
described for the include directive in configuration <br>
files. An ACL file contains one entry per line, in the
[method:]data form described above. Entries are handled
exactly as if they had appeared in the configuration file
<br>
except that the default method is &quot;princ&quot; instead
of &quot;file&quot;. Blank lines and lines beginning with
&quot;#&quot; are ignored in the ACL files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility, a
line like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include
[&lt;method&gt;:]&lt;data&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in an ACL file behaves exactly
as if the &quot;include&quot; directive had been omitted,
except that the default method is &quot;file&quot;. Thus,
writing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include &lt;path&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in an ACL file is the same as
writing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file:&lt;path&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and is handled identically to
the include directive in configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">princ <br>
[2.13] The data is the name of a Kerberos v5 principal which
is to be granted access, such as
&quot;username@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deny <br>
[2.13] This method is used to selectively deny access. The
data is parsed as a [method:]data and evaluated as described
above, with the default scheme being &quot;princ&quot;. If
<br>
it matches, access is denied immediately without examining
any further entries. Otherwise, processing continues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that access is granted
as soon as an entry matches. For &quot;deny&quot; rules to
be effective, they therefore must come before any ACLs they
are intended to override. <br>
Be careful when using &quot;deny&quot; when including a
directory of ACL files, since the files in that directory
are read in an undefined order (not in alphabetical order by
<br>
filename). It&rsquo;s best to explicitly include the file
containing &quot;deny&quot; ACL rules first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;deny&quot; only
denies access; it never grants it. Thus, deny alone does not
grant access to anyone, and using deny on itself as in
&quot;deny:deny:foo&quot; neither denies <br>
nor grants access to anyone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gput <br>
[2.13] This method is used to grant access based on the CMU
GPUT (Global Privileged User Table -- see gput(5)). The data
is either a GPUT role name or a string of the <br>
form group[xform], where group is a GPUT role name and xform
is a GPUT transform string. Access is granted if the user is
a member of the specified GPUT group, after <br>
applying either the optional xform or the default
transform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is supported only if
remctld was compiled with GPUT support by using the
&quot;--with-gput&quot; configure option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localgroup <br>
[3.9] This method is used to grant or deny access based on
membership in local UNIX groups. The data is taken to be a
name of a local system group. The user principal <br>
is converted to a local user name with
krb5_aname_to_localname(3) and then compared to the members
of the given group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to allow access to
the members of group &quot;goodguys&quot;, use an ACL of
&quot;localgroup:goodguys&quot; syntax. To deny access to
the members of group &quot;badguys&quot;, use <br>
&quot;deny:localgroup:badguys&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5_aname_to_localname()
follows local configuration rules to determine how to
convert Kerberos principal to local users. If the realm of
the principal is not in a <br>
local realm and is not otherwise covered by one of those
rules, the principal will be unchanged, which will almost
certainly mean that it will not be a member of any <br>
local group and access will be denied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is supported only if
remctld was built with Kerberos support and the
getgrnam_r(3) library function was supported by the C
library when it was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcre <br>
[2.16] This method is used to grant or deny access based on
Perl-compatible regular expressions. The data is taken to be
a Perl-compatible regular expression and matched <br>
against the user identity. To deny access, use the
&quot;deny:pcre:regex&quot; syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is supported only if
remctld was compiled with PCRE support by using the
&quot;--with-pcre&quot; configure option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regex <br>
[2.16] This method is used to grant or deny access based on
POSIX extended regular expressions. The data is taken to be
a POSIX extended regular expression (like those <br>
used by egrep) and matched against the user identity. To
deny access, use the &quot;deny:regex:regex&quot;
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is supported only if
a library for POSIX-compatible regular expressions was found
when remctld was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see the list of ACL types
supported by a particular build of remctld, run
&quot;remctld -h&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword ANYUSER may be used
instead of the ACLs to allow access to all users. The user
still needs to authenticate to remctld; this only affects
authorization. This can <br>
be used for backend programs that want to check ACLs
themselves and will retrieve the authenticated principal
from the REMOTE_USER environment variable. Note that ANYUSER
<br>
accepts any authenticated user, including cross-realm users
from foreign Kerberos realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
remctld itself uses the following environment variables when
run in stand-alone mode (-m):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTEN_FDS <br>
LISTEN_PID <br>
If these environment variables are set, remctld will expect
to be provided its listening sockets via the systemd socket
activation protocol and will not attempt to bind its <br>
own sockets. For more details on the protocol, see daemon(7)
and sd_listen_fds(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY_SOCKET <br>
If this environment variable is set, remctld will notify the
socket named in this variable when it is ready to accept
incoming packets using the systemd status notification <br>
protocol. For more details, see daemon(7) and
sd_notify(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that using socket
activation is recommended when running under systemd in
stand-alone mode, and status notification is not necessary
or useful when using socket <br>
activation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running in stand-alone
mode, these environment variables will be cleared by remctld
before running any commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following environment
variables will be set for any commands run via remctld
(annotated with the version at which they were added):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMCTL_COMMAND <br>
[2.16] The command string that caused this command to be
run. This variable will contain only the command, not the
subcommand or any additional arguments (which are passed
<br>
as command arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_ADDR <br>
[2.1] The IP address of the remote host. This may be IPv4 or
IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_EXPIRES <br>
[3.10] The time (in seconds since UNIX epoch) when the
authenticated remote session will expire. This will normally
be the expiration time of the Kerberos ticket used to <br>
authenticate to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_HOST <br>
[2.1] The hostname of the remote host, if it was available.
If reverse name resolution failed, this environment variable
will not be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is determined via a simple
reverse DNS lookup and should be considered under the
control of the client. remctl commands should treat it with
skepticism and not use it <br>
for anything other than logging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE_USER <br>
REMUSER <br>
[1.0 for REMUSER, 2.1 for REMOTE_USER] Set to the Kerberos
principal of the authenticated client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -k flag is used, remctld
will also set KRB5_KTNAME to the provided keytab path. This
is primarily for communication with the GSS-API library, but
this setting will also <br>
be inherited by any commands run by remctld.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Typically remctld is to be started as follows, where
&quot;hostname&quot; is the machine where remctld will run,
and 4373 is the port:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpserver hostname 4373
remctld</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The equivalent line for
/etc/inetd.conf is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4373 stream tcp nowait root
/usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/remctld</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl stream tcp nowait root
/usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/remctld</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the &quot;remctl&quot;
service is listed in your /etc/services file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start remctld in stand-alone
mode instead, run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctld -m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start remctld in stand-alone
mode in the foreground, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctld -F -m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a typical invocation
with systemd using socket activation. For upstart (with
&quot;expect stop&quot;), use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctld -F -m -Z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Comments can be used like
this. <br>
accounts create /usr/local/bin/doaccount /etc/acl/group1
/etc/acl/group2 <br>
accounts delete /usr/local/bin/doaccount /etc/acl/group3
<br>
accounts view /usr/local/bin/doaccount ANYUSER <br>
accounts passwd /usr/local/bin/dopasswd logmask=3
/etc/acl/group1 <br>
printing ALL /usr/local/bin/printthing /etc/acl/group2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands &quot;accounts
create&quot;, &quot;accounts delete&quot;, and so forth will
all be passed to /usr/local/bin/doaccount with the first
argument being the specific subcommand, with the <br>
exception of &quot;accounts passwd&quot;. That command will
be passed to /usr/local/bin/dopasswd instead, but it will
still get &quot;passwd&quot; as its first argument. The
third argument to <br>
&quot;accounts passwd&quot; (presumably the password) will
not be logged to syslog. All commands starting with
&quot;printing&quot; will be passed to
/usr/local/bin/printthing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example ACL file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This is a comment. <br>
deny:baduser@EXAMPLE.ORG <br>
file:/etc/remctl/acl/admins <br>
principal:service/admin@EXAMPLE.ORG <br>
service/other@EXAMPLE.ORG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This ACL file will reject
&quot;baduser@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot; even if that user would have
been allowed by one of the other ACL rules. It will then
grant access according to the ACL entries <br>
in /etc/remctl/acl/admins and the specific principals
&quot;service/admin@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot; and
&quot;service/other@EXAMPLE.ORG&quot;. The last line takes
advantage of the default ACL method of <br>
&quot;principal&quot; when processing an ACL file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The version at which various command-line and configuration
options and ACL methods were added to remctld are noted in
their descriptions. Below is the version information for
<br>
more general features, in reverse order of when the feature
was added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for the systemd
readiness protocol and socket activation, including honoring
the environment variables LISTEN_FDS, LISTEN_PID, and
NOTIFY_SOCKET, was added in version <br>
3.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special handling of the
&quot;help&quot; and &quot;summary&quot; commands was added
in version 3.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for the &quot;ALL&quot;
keyword in the command field of the configuration file was
added in version 2.15. (It has always been supported in the
subcommand field.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for the
&quot;EMPTY&quot; keyword in the subcommand field of the
configuration file was added in version 2.15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for ACL schemes and the
method:data syntax was added in remctl 2.13. Prior versions
of remctld expected only files in the main remctld
configuration file, and only <br>
principals or lines starting with &quot;include&quot; in
those files, without any method: prefixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default listening port with
the -m option was changed to the IANA-registered port of
4373 in version 2.11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for IPv6 addresses in
the REMOTE_ADDR environment variable was added in version
2.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctld used to set the
environment variable SCPRINCIPAL when running commands, for
(partial) backward compatibility with sysctld, but stopped
doing so in version 2.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;include&quot; directives
in ACL files were added in version 1.11. &quot;include&quot;
directives in configuration files were added in version
1.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
When using Heimdal with triple-DES keys and talking to old
clients that only speak version one of the remctl protocol,
remctld may have problems with MIC verification. This <br>
doesn&rsquo;t affect new clients and servers since the
version two protocol doesn&rsquo;t use MICs. If you are
using Heimdal and run into MIC verification problems, see
the COMPATIBILITY <br>
section of gssapi(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctld does not itself impose
any limits on the number of child processes or other system
resources. You may want to set resource limits in your inetd
server or with ulimit <br>
when running it as a standalone daemon or under
tcpserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command arguments may not
contain NUL characters and must be shorter than the
operating system limit on the length of a command line since
they&rsquo;re passed to the command as <br>
command-line arguments. The exception is an argument passed
via standard input using the &quot;stdin=&quot; option in
the configuration file. At most one argument may be passed
that way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The remctl port number, 4373, was derived by tracing the
diagonals of a QWERTY keyboard up from the letters
&quot;remc&quot; to the number row.</p>
