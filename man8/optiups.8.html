<p>OPTIUPS(8) NUT Manual OPTIUPS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
optiups - Driver for Opti-UPS (Viewsonic) UPS and Zinto D
(ONLINE-USV) equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the optiups driver. For information about the core
driver, see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
optiups was originally written against a PowerES 280es in
nut-0.45. It was revised for nut-2.0.1 and tested against a
PowerES 420E. It is expected to work with at least the <br>
PowerES, PowerPS, and PowerVS models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This driver additionally
supports a Zinto D from ONLINE USV-Systeme AG because of
their very similar commands, but it is unknown if it also
works with other UPS from them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This driver will not work with
the PowerES stock serial cable. You will need to construct
your own three conductor cable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPS 6 -&gt; PC 3 <br>
UPS 9 -&gt; PC 2 <br>
UPS 4 -&gt; PC 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cable for Online-USV uses
pin UPS 7 (not UPS 4) &acirc; PC 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following optional settings in the
ups.conf(5) file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status_only <br>
Only poll for critical status information. Without this,
optiups (and all NUT drivers) poll all sorts of information
from the UPS fairly often. It is probably not often <br>
enough to hurt anything, so this option probably is not very
useful, unless you have a flaky serial connection or a
highly loaded machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nowarn_noimp <br>
Does not print warnings when the UPS reports that a variable
is not implemented or not pollable. Without the option you
will get a message sent to your system logs each time <br>
NUT polls the UPS. If you specify nowarn_noimp, this message
will only be logged once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fake_lowbatt <br>
This forces the low battery flag true. Without it, if you
want to test your UPS, you will have to unplug it and wait
until the battery drops to a low/critical voltage level <br>
before NUT will respond and power down your system. With the
flag, NUT should power down the system soon after you pull
the plug. When you are done testing, you should remove <br>
this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For basic shutdown configuration
testing, the command upsmon -c fsd is preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">powerup <br>
Zinto D from ONLINE-USV cannot be identified when switched
to standby. Set this flag to allow the driver to power-up
your Zinto UPS. This will also power-up your equipment <br>
connected to the UPS!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
On the 420E, ups.serial and ups.temperature are unsupported
features. This is not a bug in NUT or the NUT driver, just
the way things are with this UPS.</p>
