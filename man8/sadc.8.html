<p>SADC(8) Linux User&rsquo;s Manual SADC(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sadc - System activity data collector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/lib64/sa/sadc [ -C comment ] [ -F ] [ -L ] [ -V ] [ -S
{ INT | DISK | SNMP | IPV6 | POWER | XDISK | ALL | XALL } ]
[ interval [ count ] ] [ outfile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sadc command samples system data a specified number of
times (count) at a specified interval measured in seconds
(interval). It writes in binary format to the specified
out&acirc; <br>
file or to standard output. If outfile is set to -, then
sadc uses the standard system activity daily data file, the
/var/log/sa/sadd file, where the dd parameter indicates the
<br>
current day. In this case, sadc will overwrite the file if
it is from a previous month. By default sadc collects all
the data available from the kernel. Exceptions are
inter&acirc; <br>
rupts and disk data, for which the relevant options must be
explicitly passed to sadc (see options below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the count parameter is not
specified, sadc writes its data endlessly. When both
interval and count are not specified, and option -C is not
used, a dummy record, which is <br>
used at system startup to mark the time when the counter
restarts from 0, will be written. For example, one of the
system startup script may write the restart mark to the
daily <br>
data file by the command entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib64/sa/sadc -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sadc command is intended to
be used as a backend to the sar command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The sadc command only
reports on local activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C comment <br>
When neither the interval nor the count parameters are
specified, this option tells sadc to write a dummy record
containing the specified comment string. This comment can
<br>
then be displayed with option -C of sar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F The creation of outfile will
be forced. If the file already exists and has a format
unknown to sadc then it will be truncated. This may be
useful for daily data files cre&acirc; <br>
ated by an older version of sadc and whose format is no
longer compatible with current one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L sadc will try to get an
exclusive lock on the outfile before writing to it or
truncating it. Failure to get the lock is fatal, except in
the case of trying to write a nor&acirc; <br>
mal (i.e. not a dummy and not a header) record to an
existing file, in which case sadc will try again at the next
interval. Usually, the only reason a lock would fail <br>
would be if another sadc process were also writing to the
file. This can happen when cron is used to launch sadc. If
the system is under heavy load, an old sadc might <br>
still be running when cron starts a new one. Without
locking, this situation can result in a corrupted system
activity file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S { INT | DISK | SNMP | IPV6 |
POWER | XDISK | ALL | XALL } <br>
Specify which optional activities should be collected by
sadc. Some activities are optional to prevent data files
from growing too large. The INT keyword indicates that <br>
sadc should collect data for system interrupts. The DISK
keyword indicates that sadc should collect data for block
devices. The SNMP and IPV6 keywords indicate respec&acirc;
<br>
tively that SNMP and IPv6 statistics should be collected by
sadc. The POWER keyword indicates that sadc should collect
power management statistics. The ALL keyword is <br>
equivalent to specifying all the keywords above and
therefore all previous activities are collected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The XDISK keyword is an
extension to the DISK one and indicates that partition
statistics should be collected by sadc in addition to disk
statistics. This option works <br>
only with kernels 2.6.25 and later. The XALL keyword is
equivalent to specifying all the keywords above (including
keyword extensions) and therefore all possible activi&acirc;
<br>
ties are collected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important note: The activities
(including optional ones) saved in an existing data file
prevail over those selected with option -S. As a
consequence, appending data to an <br>
existing data file will result in option -S being
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The sadc command takes into account the following
environment variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_TIME_DEF_TIME <br>
If this variable exists and its value is UTC then sadc will
save its data in UTC time. sadc will also use UTC time
instead of local time to determine the current daily <br>
data file located in the /var/log/sa directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
/usr/lib64/sa/sadc 1 10 /tmp/datafile <br>
Write 10 records of one second intervals to the
/tmp/datafile binary file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib64/sa/sadc -C
Backup_Start /tmp/datafile <br>
Insert the comment Backup_Start into the file
/tmp/datafile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The /proc filesystem must be mounted for the sadc command to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the statistics are not
necessarily available, depending on the kernel version used.
sadc assumes that you are using at least a 2.6 kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/log/sa/sadd <br>
Indicate the daily data file, where the dd parameter is a
number representing the day of the month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc contains various files
with system statistics.</p>
