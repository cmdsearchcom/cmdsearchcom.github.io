dogtag-submit -E EE-URL -A AGENT-URL [-d dbdir] [-n
nickname] [-i cainfo] [-C capath] [-c certfile] [-k keyfile]
[-p pinfile] [-P pin] [-s serial (hex)] [-D serial
(decimal)] [-S <br>

file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dogtag-submit is the helper which certmonger can use to make
certificate enrollment and renewal requests to Dogtag
servers. It is not normally run interactively, but it can be
<br>
for troubleshooting purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preferred option is to
request a renewal of an already-issued certificate, using
its serial number, which can be read from a PEM-formatted
certificate provided in the CERT&acirc; <br>
MONGER_CERTIFICATE environment variable, or via the -s or -D
option on the command line. If no serial number is provided,
then the client will attempt to obtain a new certifi&acirc;
<br>
cate by submitting a signing request to the CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The signing request which is to
be submitted should either be in a file whose name is given
as an argument, or fed into dogtag-submit via stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">certmonger does not yet support
retrieving trust information from Dogtag CAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-E EE-URL <br>
The top-level URL for the end-entity interface provided by
the CA, through which the initial enrollment request will be
submitted. This is typically <br>
http://SERVER:EEPORT/ca/ee/ca.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A AGENT-URL <br>
The top-level URL for the agent interface provided by the
CA, through which the request can be approved using agent
credentials. This is typically https://SERVER:AGENT&acirc;
<br>
PORT/ca/agent/ca.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dbdir -n nickname -c certfile
-k keyfile <br>
The location of the key and certificate which the client
should use to authenticate to the CA&rsquo;s agent
interface. Exactly which values are meaningful depend on
which cryp&acirc; <br>
tography library your copy of libcurl was linked with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pinfile <br>
The name of a file which contains a PIN/password which will
be needed in order to make use of the agent credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i cainfo -C capath <br>
The location of a file containing a copy of the CA&rsquo;s
certificate, against which the CA server&rsquo;s certificate
will be verified, or a directory containing, among other
<br>
things, such a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s serial <br>
The serial number of an already-issued certificate for which
the client should attempt to obtain a new certificate, in
hexadecimal form, if one can not be read from the <br>
CERTMONGER_CERTIFICATE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D serial <br>
The serial number of an already-issued certificate for which
the client should attempt to obtain a new certificate, in
decimal form, if one can not be read from the CERT&acirc;
<br>
MONGER_CERTIFICATE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S state <br>
A cookie value provided by a previous instance of this
helper, if the helper is being asked to continue a
multi-step enrollment process. If the CERTMONGER_COOKIE
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable is set, its value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T profile <br>
The name of the type of certificate which the client should
request from the CA if it is not renewing a certificate (per
the -s option above). If the CERTMONGER_CA_PRO&acirc; <br>
FILE environment variable is set, its value is used.
Otherwise, the default value is caServerCert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O param=value <br>
An additional parameter to pass to the server when approving
the signing request using agent credentials. By default, any
server-supplied default settings are applied. <br>
This option can be used either to override a server-supplied
default setting, or to supply one which would otherwise have
not been used. Requires the -A option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Even if an already-issued
certificate is available in the CERTMONGER_CERTIFICATE
environment variable, or a serial number has been provided,
don&rsquo;t attempt to renew a cer&acirc; <br>
tificate using its serial number. Instead, attempt to obtain
a new certificate using the signing request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Negates the effect of the -N
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Instead of attempting to
obtain a new certificate, query the server for a list of the
enabled enrollment profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o param=value <br>
When initially submitting a request to the CA, add the
specified parameter and value along with any request
parameters which would otherwise be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Use agent credentials,
specified using some combination of the -d, -n, -c, and -k
flags, to authenticate to the CA when initially submitting a
request to the CA or <br>
retrieving the list of enabled enrollment profiles. This is
typically required when the enrollment profile being used
uses AgentCertAuth-based authentication, and <br>
requires that the URL specified using the -E flag be an
HTTPS URL, or when the URL specified using the -E flag is an
HTTPS URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username <br>
When initially submitting a request to the CA, supply the
specified value as a user name. This is typically required
when the enrollment profile being used uses UidPwdDi&acirc;
<br>
rAuth-based or NISAuth-based authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U userdn <br>
When initially submitting a request to the CA, supply the
specified value as the DN (distinguished name) of the
user&rsquo;s entry in a directory server which the CA is
config&acirc; <br>
ured to use for checking the user&rsquo;s password. This is
typically required when the enrollment profile being used
uses UdnPwdDirAuth-based authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W userpassword <br>
When initially submitting a request to the CA, supply the
specified value as the password for the user whose name is
specified with the -u option, or whose DN is specified <br>
with the -U option. This is typically only required when the
enrollment profile being used uses UidPwdDirAuth-based,
UserPwdDirAuth-based, or NISAuth-based authentica&acirc;
<br>
tion. If the URL specified using the -E flag is not an HTTPS
URL, this value will not be encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w userpasswordfile <br>
When initially submitting a request to the CA, read from the
specified file a password to supply for the user whose name
is specified with the -u option, or whose DN is <br>
specified with the -U option. This is typically only
required when the enrollment profile being used uses
UidPwdDirAuth-based, UserPwdDirAuth-based, or NISAuth-based
<br>
authentication. If the URL specified using the -E flag is
not an HTTPS URL, this value will not be encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y userpin <br>
When initially submitting a request to the CA, supply the
specified value as the PIN for the user whose name is
specified with the -u option, or whose DN is specified with
<br>
the -U option. This is typically only required when the
enrollment profile being used uses UidPwdPinDirAuth-based
authentication. If the URL specified using the -E flag <br>
is not an HTTPS URL, this value will not be encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y userpinfile <br>
When initially submitting a request to the CA, read from the
specified file a PIN to supply for the user whose name is
specified with the -u option, or whose DN is speci&acirc;
<br>
fied with the -U option. This is typically only required
when the enrollment profile being used uses
UidPwdPinDirAuth-based authentication. If the URL specified
using <br>
the -E flag is not an HTTPS URL, this value will not be
encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increases the logging level.
Use twice for more logging. This option is mainly useful for
troubleshooting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 if the certificate was issued. The certificate will be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 if the CA is still thinking. A
cookie (state) value will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 if the CA rejected the
request. An error message may be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 if the CA was unreachable. An
error message may be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 if critical configuration
information is missing. An error message may be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 if the CA is still thinking. A
suggested poll delay (specified in seconds) and a cookie
(state) value will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17 if the CA indicates that the
client needs to attempt enrollment using a new key pair.</p>
