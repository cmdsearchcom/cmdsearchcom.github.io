<p>ARPWATCH(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ARPWATCH(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
arpwatch - keep track of ethernet/ip address pairings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
arpwatch [ -dNp ] [ -f datafile ] [ -i interface ] <br>
[ -n net[/width ]] [ -r file ] [ -u username ] [ -e username
] [ -s username ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Arpwatch keeps track for ethernet/ip address pairings. It
syslogs activity and reports certain changes via email.
Arpwatch uses pcap(3) to listen for arp packets on a local
eth&acirc; <br>
ernet interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d flag is used enable
debugging. This also inhibits forking into the background
and emailing the reports. Instead, they are sent to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p flag disables promiscuous
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f flag is used to set the
ethernet/ip address database filename. The default is
arp.dat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i flag is used to override
the default interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n flag specifies additional
local networks. This can be useful to avoid
&quot;bogon&quot; warnings when there is more than one
network running on the same wire. If the optional width <br>
is not specified, the default netmask for the
network&rsquo;s class is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N flag disables reporting
any bogons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r flag is used to specify a
savefile (perhaps created by tcpdump(1) or pcapture(1)) to
read from instead of reading from the network. In this case,
arpwatch does not fork.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -u flag is used, arpwatch
drops root privileges and changes user ID to username and
group ID to that of the primary group of username. This is
recommended for security rea&acirc; <br>
sons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -e flag is used, arpwatch
sends e-mail messages to username rather than the default
(root). If a single &lsquo;-&rsquo; character is given for
the username, sending of e-mail is sup&acirc; <br>
pressed, but logging via syslog is still done as usual.
(This can be useful during initial runs, to collect data
without being flooded with messages about new stations.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s flag is used, arpwatch
sends e-mail messages with username as the return address,
rather than the default (root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that an empty arp.dat file
must be created before the first time you run arpwatch.
Also, the default directory (where arp.dat is stored) must
be owned by username if -u <br>
flag is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT MESSAGES <br>
Here&rsquo;s a quick list of the report messages generated
by arpwatch(1) (and arpsnmp(1)):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new activity <br>
This ethernet/ip address pair has been used for the first
time six months or more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new station <br>
The ethernet address has not been seen before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flip flop <br>
The ethernet address has changed from the most recently seen
address to the second most recently seen address. (If either
the old or new ethernet address is a DECnet <br>
address and it is less than 24 hours, the email version of
the report is suppressed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changed ethernet address <br>
The host switched to a new ethernet address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSLOG MESSAGES <br>
Here are some of the syslog messages; note that messages
that are reported are also sysloged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ethernet broadcast <br>
The mac ethernet address of the host is a broadcast
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip broadcast <br>
The ip address of the host is a broadcast address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bogon The source ip address is
not local to the local subnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ethernet broadcast <br>
The source mac or arp ethernet address was all ones or all
zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ethernet mismatch <br>
The source mac ethernet address didn&rsquo;t match the
address inside the arp packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reused old ethernet address <br>
The ethernet address has changed from the most recently seen
address to the third (or greater) least recently seen
address. (This is similar to a flip flop.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suppressed DECnet flip flop <br>
A &quot;flip flop&quot; report was suppressed because one of
the two addresses was a DECnet address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/arpwatch - default directory <br>
arp.dat - ethernet/ip address database <br>
ethercodes.dat - vendor ethernet block list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please send bug reports to arpwatch@ee.lbl.gov.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempts are made to suppress
DECnet flip flops but they aren&rsquo;t always
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most error messages are posted
using syslog.</p>
