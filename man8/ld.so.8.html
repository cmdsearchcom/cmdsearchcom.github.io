<p>LD.SO(8) Linux Programmer&rsquo;s Manual LD.SO(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ld.so, ld-linux.so* - dynamic linker/loader</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
The dynamic linker can be run either indirectly by running
some dynamically linked program or library (in which case no
command-line options to the dynamic linker can be passed
<br>
and, in the ELF case, the dynamic linker which is stored in
the .interp section of the program is executed) or directly
by running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib/ld-linux.so.* [OPTIONS]
[PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The programs ld.so and ld-linux.so* find and load the shared
libraries needed by a program, prepare the program to run,
and then run it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux binaries require dynamic
linking (linking at run time) unless the -static option was
given to ld(1) during compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program ld.so handles a.out
binaries, a format used long ago; ld-linux.so* handles ELF
(/lib/ld-linux.so.1 for libc5, /lib/ld-linux.so.2 for
glibc2), which everybody has been <br>
using for years now. Otherwise both have the same behavior,
and use the same support files and programs ldd(1),
ldconfig(8) and /etc/ld.so.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When resolving library
dependencies, the dynamic linker first inspects each
dependency string to see if it contains a slash (this can
occur if a library pathname containing <br>
slashes was specified at link time). If a slash is found,
then the dependency string is interpreted as a (relative or
absolute) pathname, and the library is loaded using that
<br>
pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a library dependency does not
contain a slash, then it is searched for in the following
order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o (ELF only) Using the
directories specified in the DT_RPATH dynamic section
attribute of the binary if present and DT_RUNPATH attribute
does not exist. Use of DT_RPATH is dep&acirc; <br>
recated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Using the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Except if the executable is a
set-user-ID/set-group-ID binary, in which case it is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o (ELF only) Using the
directories specified in the DT_RUNPATH dynamic section
attribute of the binary if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o From the cache file
/etc/ld.so.cache, which contains a compiled list of
candidate libraries previously found in the augmented
library path. If, however, the binary was linked <br>
with the -z nodeflib linker option, libraries in the default
library paths are skipped. Libraries installed in hardware
capability directories (see below) are preferred to <br>
other libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In the default path /lib, and
then /usr/lib. If the binary was linked with the -z nodeflib
linker option, this step is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rpath token expansion <br>
ld.so understands certain strings in an rpath specification
(DT_RPATH or DT_RUNPATH); those strings are substituted as
follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ORIGIN (or equivalently
${ORIGIN}) <br>
This expands to the directory containing the application
executable. Thus, an application located in somedir/app
could be compiled with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc
-Wl,-rpath,&rsquo;$ORIGIN/../lib&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so that it finds an associated
shared library in somedir/lib no matter where somedir is
located in the directory hierarchy. This facilitates the
creation of &quot;turn-key&quot; <br>
applications that do not need to be installed into special
directories, but can instead be unpacked into any directory
and still find their own shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LIB (or equivalently ${LIB})
<br>
This expands to lib or lib64 depending on the architecture
(e.g., on x86-64, it expands to lib64 and on x86-32, it
expands to lib).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PLATFORM (or equivalently
${PLATFORM}) <br>
This expands to a string corresponding to the processor type
of the host system (e.g., &quot;x86_64&quot;). On some
architectures, the Linux kernel doesn&rsquo;t provide a
platform <br>
string to the dynamic linker. The value of this string is
taken from the AT_PLATFORM value in the auxiliary vector
(see getauxval(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--list List all dependencies and how they are resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify <br>
Verify that program is dynamically linked and this dynamic
linker can handle it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--library-path PATH <br>
Use PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
setting (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inhibit-rpath LIST <br>
Ignore RPATH and RUNPATH information in object names in
LIST. This option is ignored if ld.so is set-user-ID or
set-group-ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--audit LIST <br>
Use objects named in LIST as auditors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HARDWARE CAPABILITIES <br>
Some libraries are compiled using hardware-specific
instructions which do not exist on every CPU. Such libraries
should be installed in directories whose names define the
<br>
required hardware capabilities, such as /usr/lib/sse2/. The
dynamic linker checks these directories against the hardware
of the machine and selects the most suitable version of <br>
a given library. Hardware capability directories can be
cascaded to combine CPU features. The list of supported
hardware capability names depends on the CPU. The following
<br>
names are currently recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alpha ev4, ev5, ev56, ev6,
ev67</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIPS loongson2e, loongson2f,
octeon, octeon2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PowerPC <br>
4xxmac, altivec, arch_2_05, arch_2_06, booke, cellbe, dfp,
efpdouble, efpsingle, fpu, ic_snoop, mmu, notb, pa6t,
power4, power5, power5+, power6x, ppc32, ppc601, ppc64, <br>
smt, spe, ucache, vsx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPARC flush, muldiv, stbar,

g5, highgprs, hpage, ldisp, msa, stfle, z900, z990, z9-109,
z10, zarch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x86 (32-bit only) <br>

i586, i686, mca, mmx, mtrr, pat, pbe, pge, pn, pse36, sep,
ss, sse, sse2, tm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
There are four important environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_ASSUME_KERNEL <br>
(glibc since 2.2.3) Each shared library can inform the
dynamic linker of the minimum kernel ABI version that it
requires. (This requirement is encoded in an ELF note
sec&acirc; <br>
tion that is viewable via readelf -n as a section labeled
NT_GNU_ABI_TAG.) At run time, the dynamic linker determines
the ABI version of the running kernel and will <br>
reject loading shared libraries that specify minimum ABI
versions that exceed that ABI version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_ASSUME_KERNEL can be used to
cause the dynamic linker to assume that it is running on a
system with a different kernel ABI version. For example, the
following command <br>
line causes the dynamic linker to assume it is running on
Linux 2.2.5 when loading the shared libraries required by
myprog:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
./myprog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that provide multiple
versions of a shared library (in different directories in
the search path) that have different minimum kernel ABI
version requirements, <br>
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL can be used to select the version of the
library that is used (dependent on the directory search
order). Historically, the most common use of the <br>
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL feature was to manually select the older
LinuxThreads POSIX threads implementation on systems that
provided both LinuxThreads and NPTL (which latter was <br>
typically the default on such systems); see pthreads(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_BIND_NOT <br>
(glibc since 2.2) Don&rsquo;t update the Global Offset Table
(GOT) and Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) when resolving a
symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_BIND_NOW <br>
(libc5; glibc since 2.1.1) If set to a nonempty string,
causes the dynamic linker to resolve all symbols at program
startup instead of deferring function call resolution <br>
to the point when they are first referenced. This is useful
when using a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
ELF libraries at execution-time. Similar to the PATH
environment variable. Ignored in set-user-ID and set- <br>
group-ID programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PRELOAD <br>
A list of additional, user-specified, ELF shared libraries
to be loaded before all others. The items of the list can be
separated by spaces or colons. This can be used <br>
to selectively override functions in other shared libraries.
The libraries are searched for using the rules given under
DESCRIPTION. For set-user-ID/set-group-ID ELF <br>
binaries, preload pathnames containing slashes are ignored,
and libraries in the standard search directories are loaded
only if the set-user-ID permission bit is enabled <br>
on the library file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS <br>
(ELF only) If set to a nonempty string, causes the program
to list its dynamic library dependencies, as if run by
ldd(1), instead of running normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then there are lots of more or
less obscure variables, many obsolete or only for internal
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
(libc5) Version of LD_LIBRARY_PATH for a.out binaries only.
Old versions of ld-linux.so.1 also supported
LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_AOUT_PRELOAD <br>
(libc5) Version of LD_PRELOAD for a.out binaries only. Old
versions of ld-linux.so.1 also supported LD_ELF_PRELOAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_AUDIT <br>
(glibc since 2.4) A colon-separated list of user-specified,
ELF shared objects to be loaded before all others in a
separate linker namespace (i.e., one that does not <br>
intrude upon the normal symbol bindings that would occur in
the process). These libraries can be used to audit the
operation of the dynamic linker. LD_AUDIT is ignored <br>
for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dynamic linker will notify
the audit libraries at so-called auditing
checkpoints&acirc;for example, loading a new library,
resolving a symbol, or calling a symbol from <br>
another shared object&acirc;by calling an appropriate
function within the audit library. For details, see
rtld-audit(7). The auditing interface is largely compatible
with that <br>
provided on Solaris, as described in its Linker and
Libraries Guide, in the chapter Runtime Linker Auditing
Interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_BIND_NOT <br>
(glibc since 2.1.95) Do not update the GOT (global offset
table) and PLT (procedure linkage table) after resolving a
symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_DEBUG <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Output verbose debugging information about
the dynamic linker. If set to all prints all debugging
information it has, if set to help prints a help mes&acirc;
<br>
sage about which categories can be specified in this
environment variable. Since glibc 2.3.4, LD_DEBUG is ignored
for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT <br>
(glibc since 2.1) File in which LD_DEBUG output should be
written. The default is standard output. LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT is
ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK <br>
(glibc since 2.1.91) Allow weak symbols to be overridden
(reverting to old glibc behavior). For security reasons,
since glibc 2.3.4, LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK is ignored for set- <br>
user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_HWCAP_MASK <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Mask for hardware capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_KEEPDIR <br>
(a.out only)(libc5) Don&rsquo;t ignore the directory in the
names of a.out libraries to be loaded. Use of this option is
strongly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_NOWARN <br>
(a.out only)(libc5) Suppress warnings about a.out libraries
with incompatible minor version numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_ORIGIN_PATH <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Path where the binary is found (for
non-set-user-ID programs). For security reasons, since glibc
2.4, LD_ORIGIN_PATH is ignored for set-user-ID/set- <br>
group-ID binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_POINTER_GUARD <br>
(glibc since 2.4) Set to 0 to disable pointer guarding. Any
other value enables pointer guarding, which is also the
default. Pointer guarding is a security mechanism <br>
whereby some pointers to code stored in writable program
memory (return addresses saved by setjmp(3) or function
pointers used by various glibc internals) are mangled <br>
semi-randomly to make it more difficult for an attacker to
hijack the pointers for use in the event of a buffer overrun
or stack-smashing attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PROFILE <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Shared object to be profiled, specified
either as a pathname or a soname. Profiling output is
written to the file whose name is:
&quot;$LD_PROFILE_OUT&acirc; <br>
PUT/$LD_PROFILE.profile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Directory where LD_PROFILE output should
be written. If this variable is not defined, or is defined
as an empty string, then the default is /var/tmp. <br>
LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT is ignored for set-user-ID and
set-group-ID programs, which always use /var/profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_SHOW_AUXV <br>
(glibc since 2.1) Show auxiliary array passed up from the
kernel. For security reasons, since glibc 2.3.5,
LD_SHOW_AUXV is ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID
binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS <br>
By default (i.e., if this variable is not defined)
executables and prelinked shared objects will honor base
addresses of their dependent libraries and (nonprelinked)
posi&acirc; <br>
tion-independent executables (PIEs) and other shared objects
will not honor them. If LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS is defined wit the
value, both executables and PIEs will honor the <br>
base addresses. If LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS is defined with the
value 0, neither executables nor PIEs will honor the base
addresses. This variable is ignored by set-user-ID and <br>
set-group-ID programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_VERBOSE <br>
(glibc since 2.1) If set to a nonempty string, output symbol
versioning information about the program if the
LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable has been
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_WARN <br>
(ELF only)(glibc since 2.1.3) If set to a nonempty string,
warn about unresolved symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDD_ARGV0 <br>
(libc5) argv[0] to be used by ldd(1) when none is
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/lib/ld.so <br>
a.out dynamic linker/loader <br>
/lib/ld-linux.so.{1,2} <br>
ELF dynamic linker/loader <br>
/etc/ld.so.cache <br>
File containing a compiled list of directories in which to
search for libraries and an ordered list of candidate
libraries. <br>
/etc/ld.so.preload <br>
File containing a whitespace-separated list of ELF shared
libraries to be loaded before the program. <br>
lib*.so* <br>
shared libraries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
