<p>aoe-sancheck(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
aoe-sancheck(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aoe-sancheck - verify storage network capabilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aoe-sancheck [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The aoe-sancheck command collects information about the
local interfaces and probes the network for ATA over
Ethernet devices, validating the paths for each device. It
does not <br>
use the aoe kernel module but rather the bpf interface to
evaluate the network. As such, the aoe module does not need
to be loaded to perform the test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the command is
divided into two sections: information about the local
interfaces followed by a list of detected AoE devices. The
first section displays the local <br>
interfaces, if the interface is up or down, its configured
MTU, and the PCI ID for the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second section lists
detected AoE devices, one per line, with the following
information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device The device name of the
form eX.Y where X is the AoE device shelf address, and Y is
the AoE device slot address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macs The number of mac addresses
detected for this device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Payload <br>
The number of bytes of data the device can handle in a
single AoE request. This number does not represent the total
frame size as it does not include bytes from ethernet <br>
or AoE headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local Interfaces <br>
The list of local interfaces from which the device is
visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-v Prints out additional raw information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSIS <br>
For each device, aoe-sancheck may print out additional lines
of suggestions or warnings. The following checks are
made:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MTU of the local interfaces
is set high enough to handle the AoE device&rsquo;s reported
payload. <br>
Depending on the host NIC&rsquo;s capabilities and storage
network switch&rsquo;s capabilities, best performance may or
may not be with local interface MTU set higher than a
device&rsquo;s <br>
payload size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of local interfaces
matches the number of interfaces on the device. <br>
Best performance comes from having a host and device with
comparable bandwidth. Aoe-sancheck simply counts the number
of interfaces involved and does not figure link band&acirc;
<br>
width in its comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All local interfaces for an AoE
device have the same MTU. <br>
If one interface for a device has a smaller MTU than the
others, the AoE driver must use the smaller payload size for
all interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each path to the device is
capable of the configured payload size. <br>
This check detects the situation where a local interface is
configured for jumbo frames and the AoE device is capable of
jumbo frames, but some aspect of the network is <br>
incapable of passing frames that size, for example, a
misconfigured switch. Aoe-sancheck reports the maximum
payload size the path is capable of if less than the
config&acirc; <br>
ured payload size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The program may sometimes display inconsistent results
between runs showing that a path is capable of a smaller
frame size than it actually is. If you see this behavior,
please <br>
email one of the authors with your verbose output.</p>
