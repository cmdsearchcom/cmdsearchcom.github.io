<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_opcodes - report supported SCSI commands or task
management functions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_opcodes [--alpha] [--help] [--hex] [--no-inquiry]
[--opcode=OP] [--raw] [--rctd] [--repd] [--sa=SA] [--tmf]
[--unsorted] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_opcodes [-a] [-n] [-o=OP]
[-q] [-R] [-s=SA] [-t] [-u] [-v] [-V] [-?] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility sends a SCSI REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES
or a REPORT SUPPORTED TASK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS command to
the DEVICE and then outputs the response. The default action
<br>
is to report supported operation codes. In this mode it will
either list all supported commands or give detailed
information on a specific command identified by the
--opcode=OP <br>
option (perhaps with additional information from the --sa=SA
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of a SCSI command
depends on its peripheral device type (e.g. a disk). The
REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES and REPORT SUPPORTED TASK
MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS commands are <br>
not supported in the MMC command set for CD and DVD devices.
This utility does an INQUIRY to obtain the peripheral device
type and prints out the vendor, product and revision <br>
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar facility to query
supported operation codes previously was available via the
CmdDt bit in the SCSI INQUIRY command (see sg_inq(8)).
However that facility was made obso&acirc; <br>
lete and replaced by the REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES
command in SPC-3 (revision 4) during February 2002.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility supports two
command line syntaxes, the preferred one is shown first in
the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section
on the old command line syntax <br>
outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --alpha <br>
when all supported commands are being listed there is no
requirement for the device server (i.e. the DEVICE) to sort
the list of commands. When this option is given the <br>
list of supported commands is sorted by name
(alphabetically). When this option and the --unsorted option
are both _not_ given then the list of supported commands is
<br>
sorted numerically (first by operation code and then by
service action).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
outputs the usage message summarizing command line options
then exits. Ignores DEVICE if given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
outputs the response in ASCII hexadecimal to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-inquiry <br>
Prior to calling a SCSI REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES or
a REPORT SUPPORTED TASK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS command, a SCSI
INQUIRY command is performed. The reason is to <br>
determine the peripheral device type (pdt) of the DEVICE as
this is helpful in translating operation codes to the
command names. By default this utility prints a summary <br>
of INQUIRY command response on stdout. If this option (or
the --raw option) is given then that summary is not printed
on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --old <br>
switch to older style options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --opcode=OP <br>
the DEVICE will be queried for the given operation code (
i.e. the OP value) which is the first byte of a SCSI
command. OP is decimal unless prefixed by &quot;0x&quot; or
it has a <br>
trailing &quot;h&quot;. OP should be in the range 0 to 255
(0xff) inclusive. When this option is not given then all
available SCSI commands supported by the DEVICE are
listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
output the response in binary to stdout. Error messages and
warnings, if any, are sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rctd <br>
set report command timeout descriptor (RCTD) bit in the cdb.
The response may or may not contain command timeout
descriptors. If available they are output. If supported <br>
there are two values: a nominal command timeout and a
recommended command timeout. Both have units of seconds. A
value of zero means that no timeout is indicated and this
<br>
is shown in the corresponding decoded output as
&quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --repd <br>
set read extended parameter data (REPD) bit in the report
task management functions cdb. 16 bytes rather than the
default 4 bytes expected in the response. This was added
<br>
in SPC-4 (revision 26).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sa=SA <br>
the DEVICE will be queried for a command with the given
service action (i.e. the SA value). Used in conjunction with
the --opcode=OP option. If this option is not given, <br>
--opcode=OP is given and the command in question does have a
service action then a value of 0 will be assumed. SA is
decimal and expected to be in the range 0 to 65535 <br>
(0xffff) inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tmf <br>
list supported task management functions. This is done with
the SCSI REPORT SUPPORTED TASK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS command.
When this option is chosen the --alpha, <br>
--opcode=OP, --rctd, --sa=SA and --unsorted options are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unsorted <br>
when all supported commands are being listed there is no
requirement for the device server (i.e. the DEVICE) to sort
the list of commands. When this option is given the <br>
list of supported commands is in the order given by the
DEVICE. When this option is not given the supported commands
are sorted numerically (first by operation code and <br>
then by service action).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print out version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
As of SPC-4 revision 7a the recognized task management
functions are: abort set, abort task set, clear ACA, clear
task set, I_T nexus reset, logical unit reset, query task,
tar&acirc; <br>
get reset and wakeup. As of SPC-4 revision 26 target reset
and wakeup have been made obsolete while query task set and
query asynchronous event notification have been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 2.4 series of Linux
kernels the DEVICE must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In
the 2.6 series block devices (e.g. SCSI disks and DVD
drives) can also be specified. For <br>
example &quot;sg_opcodes /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_opcodes is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The options in this section were the only ones available
prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23
and later these older options can be selected by either
set&acirc; <br>
ting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
&rsquo;--old&rsquo; (or &rsquo;-O) as the first option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a sort command alphabetically.
Equivalent to --alpha in main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n don&rsquo;t print a summary
of the SCSI INQUIRY response on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N switch to the newer style
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o=OP the DEVICE will be queried
for the given operation code (i.e. OP) which is the first
byte of a SCSI command. OP is hexadecimal and expected to be
in the range 0 to ff <br>
inclusive. When this option is not given then all available
SCSI commands supported by the DEVICE are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q set the read extended
parameter data (REPD) bit in report TMF cdb. Equivalent to
--repd in main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R set the report command
timeout descriptor (RCTD) bit in cdb. Equivalent to --rctd
in main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s=SA the DEVICE will be queried
for a command with the given service action (i.e. SA). Used
in conjunction with the -o=OP option. If this option is not
given, -o=OP is given <br>
and the command in question does have a service action then
a value of 0 will be assumed. SA is hexadecimal and expected
to be in the range 0 to ffff inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t list supported task
management functions. Equivalent to --tmf in the main
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u output all supported commands
in the order given by DEVICE. Equivalent to --unsorted in
main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v increase level of verbosity.
Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print out version string then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? output usage message. Ignore
all other parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The examples in this page use Linux device names. For
suitable device names in other supported Operating Systems
see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see the information about a
specific command give its operation code to the
&rsquo;--op=&rsquo; option. A command line invocation is
shown first followed by a typical response:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sg_opcodes --op=93h
/dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opcode=0x93 <br>
