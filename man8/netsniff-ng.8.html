<p>NETSNIFF-NG(8) netsniff-ng toolkit NETSNIFF-NG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
netsniff-ng - the packet sniffing beast</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
netsniff-ng { [options] [filter-expression] }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
netsniff-ng is a fast, minimal tool to analyze network
packets, capture pcap files, replay pcap files, and redirect
traffic between interfaces with the help of zero-copy <br>
packet(7) sockets. netsniff-ng uses both Linux specific
RX_RING and TX_RING interfaces to perform zero-copy. This is
to avoid copy and system call overhead between kernel and
<br>
user address space. When we started working on netsniff-ng,
the pcap(3) library did not use this zero-copy facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng is Linux specific,
meaning there is no support for other operating systems.
Therefore we can keep the code footprint quite minimal and
to the point. Linux packet(7) <br>
sockets and its RX_RING and TX_RING interfaces bypass the
normal packet processing path through the networking stack.
This is the fastest capturing or transmission performance
<br>
one can get from user space out of the box, without having
to load unsupported or non-mainline third-party kernel
modules. We explicitly refuse to build netsniff-ng on top of
<br>
ntop/PF_RING. Not because we do not like it (we do find it
interesting), but because of the fact that it is not part of
the mainline kernel. Therefore, the ntop project has to <br>
maintain and sync out-of-tree drivers to adapt them to their
DNA. Eventually, we went for untainted Linux kernel, since
its code has a higher rate of review, maintenance,
secu&acirc; <br>
rity and bug fixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng also supports early
packet filtering in the kernel. It has support for low-level
and high-level packet filters that are translated into
Berkeley Packet Filter <br>
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng can capture pcap
files in several different pcap formats that are
interoperable with other tools. It has different pcap I/O
methods supported (scatter-gather, <br>
mmap(2), read(2), and write(2)) for efficient to-disc
capturing. netsniff-ng is also able to rotate pcap files
based on data size or time intervals, thus, making it a
useful <br>
backend tool for subsequent traffic analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng itself also supports
analysis, replaying, and dumping of raw 802.11 frames. For
online or offline analysis, netsniff-ng has a built-in
packet dissector for the cur&acirc; <br>
rent 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.11* (WLAN), ARP, MPLS, 802.1Q
(VLAN), 802.1QinQ, LLDP, IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, IGMP,
TCP and UDP, including GeoIP location analysis. Since
net&acirc; <br>
sniff-ng does not establish any state or perform reassembly
during packet dissection, its memory footprint is quite low,
thus, making netsniff-ng quite efficient for offline <br>
analysis of large pcap files as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that netsniff-ng is
currently not multithreaded. However, this does not prevent
you from starting multiple netsniff-ng instances that are
pinned to different, non-overlap&acirc; <br>
ping CPUs and f.e. have different BPF filters attached.
Likely that at some point in time your harddisc might become
a bottleneck assuming you do not rotate such pcaps in ram
<br>
(and from there periodically scheduled move to slower
medias). You can then use mergecap(1) to transform all pcaps
into a single large pcap. Thus, netsniff-ng then works
multi&acirc; <br>
threaded eventually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng can also be used to
debug netlink traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i &lt;dev|pcap|-&gt;, -d &lt;dev|pcap|-&gt;, --in
&lt;dev|pcap|-&gt;, --dev &lt;dev|pcap|-&gt; <br>
Defines an input device. This can either be a networking
device, a pcap file or stdin (&acirc;-&acirc;). In case of a
pcap file, the pcap type (&acirc;-D&acirc; option) is
determined automatically by <br>
the pcap file magic. In case of stdin, it is assumed that
the input stream is a pcap file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;dev|pcap|dir|cfg|-&gt;,
--out &lt;dev|pcap|dir|cfg|-&gt; <br>
Defines the output device. This can either be a networking
device, a pcap file, a folder, a trafgen(8) configuration
file or stdout (&acirc;-&acirc;). In the case of a pcap file
that should <br>
not have the default pcap type (0xa1b2c3d4), the additional
option &acirc;-T&acirc; must be provided. If a directory is
given, then, instead of a single pcap file, multiple pcap
files are <br>
generated with rotation based on maximum file size or a
given interval (&acirc;-F&acirc; option). A trafgen
configuration file can currently only be specified if the
input device is a pcap <br>
file. If stdout is given as a device, then a trafgen
configuration will be written to stdout if the input device
is a pcap file, or a pcap file if the input device is a
network&acirc; <br>
ing device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;id&gt;, --fanout-group
&lt;id&gt; <br>
If multiple netsniff-ng instances are being started that all
have the same packet fanout group id, then the ingress
network traffic being captured is being
distributed/load-bal&acirc; <br>
anced among these group participants. This gives a much
better scaling than running multiple netsniff-ng processes
without a fanout group parameter in parallel, but only with
a <br>
BPF filter attached as a packet would otherwise need to be
delivered to all such capturing processes, instead of only
once to such a fanout member. Naturally, each fanout member
<br>
can have its own BPF filters attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K
&lt;hash|lb|cpu|rnd|roll|qm&gt;, --fanout-type
&lt;hash|lb|cpu|rnd|roll|qm&gt; <br>
This parameter specifies the fanout discipline, in other
words, how the captured network traffic is dispatched to the
fanout group members. Options are to distribute traffic by
<br>
the packet hash (&acirc;hash&acirc;), in a round-robin
manner (&acirc;lb&acirc;), by CPU the packet arrived on
(&acirc;cpu&acirc;), by random (&acirc;rnd&acirc;), by
rolling over sockets (&acirc;roll&acirc;) which means if one
socket&rsquo;s <br>
queue is full, we move on to the next one, or by NIC
hardware queue mapping (&acirc;qm&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;defrag|roll&gt;,
--fanout-opts &lt;defrag|roll&gt; <br>
Defines some auxillary fanout options to be used in addition
to a given fanout type. These options apply to any fanout
type. In case of &acirc;defrag&acirc;, the kernel is being
told to <br>
defragment packets before delivering to user space, and
&acirc;roll&acirc; provides the same roll-over option as the
&acirc;roll&acirc; fanout type, so that on any different
fanout type being used (e.g. <br>
&acirc;qm&acirc;) the socket may temporarily roll over to
the next fanout group member in case the original
one&rsquo;s queue is full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --filter
&lt;bpf-file|expr&gt; <br>
Specifies to not dump all traffic, but to filter the network
packet haystack. As a filter, either a bpfc(8) compiled file
can be passed as a parameter or a tcpdump(1)-like fil&acirc;
<br>
ter expression in quotes. For details regarding the bpf-file
have a look at bpfc(8), for details regarding a
tcpdump(1)-like filter have a look at section &acirc;filter
example&acirc; or at <br>
pcap-filter(7). A filter expression may also be passed to
netsniff-ng without option &acirc;-f&acirc; in case there is
no subsequent option following after the command-line filter
expres&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --type &lt;type&gt; <br>
This defines some sort of filtering mechanisms in terms of
addressing. Possible values for type are &acirc;host&acirc;
(to us), &acirc;broadcast&acirc; (to all),
&acirc;multicast&acirc; (to group), &acirc;others&acirc;
(pro&acirc; <br>
miscuous mode) or &acirc;outgoing&acirc; (from us).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --interval &lt;size|time&gt;
<br>
If the output device is a folder, with &acirc;-F&acirc;, it
is possible to define the pcap file rotation interval either
in terms of size or time. Thus, when the interval limit has
been <br>
reached, a new pcap file will be started. As size parameter,
the following values are accepted
&acirc;&lt;num&gt;KiB/MiB/GiB&acirc;; As time parameter, it
can be &acirc;&lt;num&gt;s/sec/min/hrs&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J, --jumbo-support <br>
By default, in pcap replay or redirect mode,
netsniff-ng&rsquo;s ring buffer frames are a fixed size of
2048 bytes. This means that if you are expecting jumbo
frames or even super <br>
jumbo frames to pass through your network, then you need to
enable support for that by using this option. However, this
has the disadvantage of performance degradation and a
big&acirc; <br>
ger memory footprint for the ring buffer. Note that this
doesn&rsquo;t affect (pcap) capturing mode, since tpacket in
version 3 is used!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rfraw <br>
In case the input or output networking device is a wireless
device, it is possible with netsniff-ng to turn this into
monitor mode and create a mon&lt;X&gt; device that
netsniff-ng <br>
will be listening on instead of wlan&lt;X&gt;, for instance.
This enables netsniff-ng to analyze, dump, or even replay
raw 802.11 frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;0|uint&gt;, --num
&lt;0|uint&gt; <br>
Process a number of packets and then exit. If the number of
packets is 0, then this is equivalent to infinite packets
resp. processing until interrupted. Otherwise, a number <br>
given as an unsigned integer will limit processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;name&gt;, --prefix
&lt;name&gt; <br>
When dumping pcap files into a folder, a file name prefix
can be defined with this option. If not otherwise specified,
the default prefix is &acirc;dump-&acirc; followed by a Unix
timestamp. <br>
Use &acirc;--prefex &quot;&quot;&acirc; to set filename as
seconds since the Unix Epoch e.g. 1369179203.pcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;pcap-magic&gt;, --magic
&lt;pcap-magic&gt; <br>
Specify a pcap type for storage. Different pcap types with
their various meta data capabilities are shown with option
&acirc;-D&acirc;. If not otherwise specified, the pcap-magic
0xa1b2c3d4, <br>
also known as a standard tcpdump-capable pcap format, is
used. Pcap files with swapped endianness are also
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --dump-pcap-types <br>
Dump all available pcap types with their capabilities and
magic numbers that can be used with option &acirc;-T&acirc;
to stdout and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --dump-bpf <br>
If a Berkeley Packet Filter is given, for example via option
&acirc;-f&acirc;, then dump the BPF disassembly to stdout
during ring setup. This only serves for informative or
verification <br>
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rand <br>
If the input and output device are both networking devices,
then this option will randomize packet order in the output
ring buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --no-promisc <br>
The networking interface will not be put into promiscuous
mode. By default, promiscuous mode is turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --no-sock-mem <br>
On startup and shutdown, netsniff-ng tries to increase
socket read and write buffers if appropriate. This option
will prevent netsniff-ng from doing so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mmap <br>
Use mmap(2) as pcap file I/O. This is the default when
replaying pcap files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --sg <br>
Use scatter-gather as pcap file I/O. This is the default
when capturing pcap files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --clrw <br>
Use slower read(2) and write(2) I/O. This is not the default
case anywhere, but in some situations it could be preferred
as it has a lower latency on write-back to disc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;size&gt;, --ring-size
&lt;size&gt; <br>
Manually define the RX_RING resp. TX_RING size in
&acirc;&lt;num&gt;KiB/MiB/GiB&acirc;. By default, the size
is determined based on the network connectivity rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k &lt;uint&gt;, --kernel-pull
&lt;uint&gt; <br>
Manually define the interval in micro-seconds where the
kernel should be triggered to batch process the ring buffer
frames. By default, it is every 10us, but it can manually be
<br>
prolonged, for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;cpu&gt;, --bind-cpu
&lt;cpu&gt; <br>
Pin netsniff-ng to a specific CPU and also pin resp. migrate
the NIC&rsquo;s IRQ CPU affinity to this CPU. This option
should be preferred in combination with &acirc;-s&acirc; in
case a middle to <br>
high packet rate is expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;uid&gt;, --user
&lt;uid&gt; resp. -g &lt;gid&gt;, --group &lt;gid&gt; <br>
After ring setup drop privileges to a non-root user/group
combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --prio-high <br>
Set this process as a high priority process in order to
achieve a higher scheduling rate resp. CPU time. This is
however not the default setting, since it could lead to
starva&acirc; <br>
tion of other processes, for example low priority kernel
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --notouch-irq <br>
Do not reassign the NIC&rsquo;s IRQ CPU affinity
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --silent <br>
Do not enter the packet dissector at all and do not print
any packet information to the terminal. Just shut up and be
silent. This option should be preferred in combination with
<br>
pcap recording or replay, since it will not flood your
terminal which causes a significant performance
degradation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --less <br>
Print a less verbose one-line information for each packet to
the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --hex <br>
Only dump packets in hex format to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --ascii <br>
Only display ASCII printable characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --update <br>
If geographical IP location is used, the built-in database
update mechanism will be invoked to get Maxmind&rsquo;s
latest database. To configure search locations for
databases, the <br>
file /etc/netsniff-ng/geoip.conf contains possible
addresses. Thus, to save bandwidth or for mirroring of
Maxmind&rsquo;s databases (to bypass their traffic limit
policy), different <br>
hosts or IP addresses can be placed into geoip.conf,
separated by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose during startup i.e. show detailed ring setup
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Show version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show user help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE EXAMPLE <br>
netsniff-ng <br>
The most simple command is to just run
&acirc;netsniff-ng&acirc;. This will start listening on all
available networking devices in promiscuous mode and dump
the packet dissector output to <br>
the terminal. No files will be recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in eth0 --out
dump.pcap -s -T 0xa1e2cb12 -b 0 tcp or udp <br>
Capture TCP or UDP traffic from the networking device eth0
into the pcap file named dump.pcap, which has netsniff-ng
specific pcap extensions (see &acirc;netsniff-ng -D&acirc;
for capabili&acirc; <br>
ties). Also, do not print the content to the terminal and
pin the process and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. The pcap
write method is scatter-gather I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in wlan0 --rfraw
--out dump.pcap --silent --bind-cpu 0 <br>
Put the wlan0 device into monitoring mode and capture all
raw 802.11 frames into the file dump.pcap. Do not dissect
and print the content to the terminal and pin the process
and <br>
NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. The pcap write method is
scatter-gather I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in dump.pcap
--mmap --out eth0 -k1000 --silent --bind-cpu 0 <br>
Replay the pcap file dump.pcap which is read through mmap(2)
I/O and send the packets out via the eth0 networking device.
Do not dissect and print the content to the terminal and
<br>
pin the process and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. Also, trigger
the kernel every 1000us to traverse the TX_RING instead of
every 10us. Note that the pcap magic type is detected <br>
automatically from the pcap file header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in eth0 --out eth1
--silent --bind-cpu 0 --type host -r <br>
Redirect network traffic from the networking device eth0 to
eth1 for traffic that is destined for our host, thus ignore
broadcast, multicast and promiscuous traffic. Randomize <br>
the order of packets for the outgoing device and do not
print any packet contents to the terminal. Also, pin the
process and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in team0 --out
/opt/probe/ -s -m --interval 100MiB -b 0 <br>
Capture on an aggregated team0 networking device and dump
packets into multiple pcap files that are split into 100MiB
each. Use mmap(2) I/O as a pcap write method, support for
<br>
super jumbo frames is built-in (does not need to be
configured here), and do not print the captured data to the
terminal. Pin netsniff-ng and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. The
<br>
default pcap magic type is 0xa1b2c3d4 (tcpdump-capable
pcap).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in vlan0 --out
dump.pcap -c -u &lsquo;id -u bob&lsquo; -g &lsquo;id -g
bob&lsquo; <br>
Capture network traffic on device wlan0 into a pcap file
called dump.pcap by using normal read(2), write(2) I/O for
the pcap file (slower but less latency). Also, after setting
<br>
up the RX_RING for capture, drop privileges from root to the
user and group &acirc;bob&acirc;. Invoke the packet
dissector and print packet contents to the terminal for
further analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in any --filter
http.bpf -B --ascii -V <br>
Capture from all available networking interfaces and install
a low-level filter that was previously compiled by bpfc(8)
into http.bpf in order to filter HTTP traffic. Super jumbo
<br>
frame support is automatically enabled and only print human
readable packet data to the terminal, and also be more
verbose during setup phase. Moreover, dump a BPF disassembly
of <br>
http.bpf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --in dump.pcap --out
dump.cfg --silent <br>
Convert the pcap file dump.pcap into a trafgen(8)
configuration file dump.cfg. Do not print pcap contents to
the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng -i dump.pcap -f
beacon.bpf -o - <br>
Convert the pcap file dump.pcap into a trafgen(8)
configuration file and write it to stdout. However, do not
dump all of its content, but only the one that passes the
low-level <br>
filter for raw 802.11 from beacon.bpf. The BPF engine here
is invoked in user space inside of netsniff-ng, so Linux
extensions are not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat foo.pcap | netsniff-ng -i -
-o - <br>
Read a pcap file from stdin and convert it into a trafgen(8)
configuration file to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modprobe nlmon <br>
ip link add type nlmon <br>
ip link set nlmon0 up <br>
netsniff-ng -i nlmon0 -o dump.pcap -s <br>
ip link set nlmon0 down <br>
ip link del dev nlmon0 <br>
rmmod nlmon <br>
In this example, netlink traffic is being captured. If not
already done, a netlink monitoring device needs to be set up
before it can be used to capture netlink socket buffers <br>
(iproute2&rsquo;s ip(1) commands are given for nlmon device
setup and teardown). netsniff-ng can then make use of the
nlmon device as an input device. In this example a pcap file
with <br>
netlink traffic is being recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng --fanout-group 1
--fanout-type cpu --fanout-opts defrag --bind-cpu 0
--notouch-irq --silent --in em1 --out /var/cap/cpu0/
--interval 120sec <br>
netsniff-ng --fanout-group 1 --fanout-type cpu --fanout-opts
defrag --bind-cpu 1 --notouch-irq --silent --in em1 --out
/var/cap/cpu1/ --interval 120sec <br>
Starts two netsniff-ng fanout instances. Both are assigned
into the same fanout group membership and traffic is
splitted among them by incoming cpu. Furthermore, the kernel
is <br>
supposed to defragment possible incoming fragments. First
instance is assigned to CPU 0 and the second one to CPU 1,
IRQ bindings are not altered as they might have been adapted
<br>
to this scenario by the user a-priori, and traffic is
captured on interface em1, and written out in 120 second
intervals as pcap files into /var/cap/cpu0/. Tools like
mergecap(1) <br>
will be able to merge the cpu0/1 split back together if
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILES <br>
Files under /etc/netsniff-ng/ can be modified to extend
netsniff-ng&rsquo;s functionality:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* oui.conf - OUI/MAC vendor
database <br>
* ether.conf - Ethernet type descriptions <br>
* tcp.conf - TCP port/services map <br>
* udp.conf - UDP port/services map <br>
* geoip.conf - GeoIP database mirrors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTER EXAMPLE <br>
netsniff-ng supports both, low-level and high-level filters
that are attached to its packet(7) socket. Low-level filters
are described in the bpfc(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Low-level filters can be used
with netsniff-ng in the following way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. bpfc foo &gt; bar <br>
2. netsniff-ng -f bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, foo is the bpfc program
that will be translated into a netsniff-ng readable
&acirc;opcodes&acirc; file and passed to netsniff-ng through
the -f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, high-level filter can
be either passed through the -f option, e.g. -f &quot;tcp or
udp&quot; or at the end of all options without the
&acirc;-f&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter syntax is the same as
in tcpdump(8), which is described in the man page
pcap-filter(7). Just to quote some examples from
pcap-filter(7):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host sundown <br>
To select all packets arriving at or departing from
sundown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host helios and hot or ace <br>
To select traffic between helios and either hot or ace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip host ace and not helios <br>
To select all IP packets between ace and any host except
helios.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">net ucb-ether <br>
To select all traffic between local hosts and hosts at
Berkeley.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gateway snup and (port ftp or
ftp-data) <br>
To select all FTP traffic through Internet gateway snup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip and not net localnet <br>
To select traffic neither sourced from, nor destined for,
local hosts. If you have a gateway to another network, this
traffic should never make it onto your local network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp[tcpflags] &amp;
(tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src and dst net localnet <br>
To select the start and end packets (the SYN and FIN
packets) of each TCP conversation that involve a non-local
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] -
((ip[0]&amp;0xf)&lt;&lt;2)) - ((tcp[12]&amp;0xf0)&gt;&gt;2))
!= 0) <br>
To select all IPv4 HTTP packets to and from port 80, that is
to say, print only packets that contain data, not, for
example, SYN and FIN packets and ACK-only packets. (IPv6 is
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCAP FORMATS: <br>
netsniff-ng supports a couple of pcap formats, visible
through &lsquo;&lsquo;netsniff-ng -D&rsquo;&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpdump-capable pcap (default)
<br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b2c3d4 resp. 0xd4c3b2a1.
As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in
microseconds, the original packet length and the captured
<br>
packet length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpdump-capable pcap with ns
resolution <br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b23c4d resp. 0x4d3cb2a1.
As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in
nanoseconds, the original packet length and the captured
<br>
packet length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alexey Kuznetzov&rsquo;s pcap
<br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b2cd34 resp. 0x34cdb2a1.
As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in
microseconds, the original packet length, the captured
packet <br>
length, the interface index (sll_ifindex), the
packet&rsquo;s protocol (sll_protocol), and the packet type
(sll_pkttype).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng pcap <br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1e2cb12 resp. 0x12cbe2a1.
As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in
nanoseconds, the original packet length, the captured packet
<br>
length, the timestamp hw/sw source, the interface index
(sll_ifindex), the packet&rsquo;s protocol (sll_protocol),
the packet type (sll_pkttype) and the hardware type
(sll_hatype).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further implementation
details or format support in your application, have a look
at pcap_io.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
For introducing bit errors, delays with random variation and
more while replaying pcaps, make use of tc(8) with its
disciplines such as netem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng does only some
basic, architecture generic tuning on startup. If you are
considering to do high performance capturing, you need to
carefully tune your machine, both <br>
hardware and software. Simply letting netsniff-ng run
without thinking about your underlying system might not
necessarily give you the desired performance. Note that
tuning your <br>
system is always a tradeoff and fine-grained balancing act
(throughput versus latency). You should know what you are
doing!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One recommendation for
software-based tuning is tuned(8). Besides that, there are
many other things to consider. Just to throw you a few
things that you might want to look at: <br>
NAPI networking drivers, tickless kernel, I/OAT DMA engine,
Direct Cache Access, RAM-based file systems, multi-queues,
and many more things. Also, you might want to read the
ker&acirc; <br>
nel&rsquo;s Documentation/networking/scaling.txt file
regarding technologies such as RSS, RPS, RFS, aRFS and XPS.
Also check your ethtool(8) settings, for example regarding
offloading <br>
or Ethernet pause frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, to get a deeper
understanding of netsniff-ng internals and how it interacts
with the Linux kernel, the kernel documentation under
Documentation/network&acirc; <br>
ing/{packet_mmap.txt, filter.txt, multiqueue.txt} might be
of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do you sniff in a switched
environment? I rudely refer to dSniff&rsquo;s documentation
that says:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easiest route is simply to
impersonate the local gateway, stealing client traffic en
route to some remote destination. Of course, the traffic
must be forwarded by your <br>
attacking machine, either by enabling kernel IP forwarding
or with a userland program that accomplishes the same
(fragrouter -B1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several people have reportedly
destroyed connectivity on their LAN to the outside world by
ARP spoofing the gateway, and forgetting to enable IP
forwarding on the attacking <br>
machine. Do not do this. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A safer option than ARP spoofing
would be to use a &quot;port mirror&quot; function if your
switch hardware supports it and if you have access to the
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not need to dump all
possible traffic, you have to consider running netsniff-ng
with a BPF filter for the ingress path. For that purpose,
read the bpfc(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, to aggregate multiple NICs
that you want to capture on, you should consider using team
devices, further explained in libteam resp. teamd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following netsniff-ng pcap
magic numbers are compatible with other tools, at least
tcpdump or Wireshark:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0xa1b2c3d4 (tcpdump-capable
pcap) <br>
0xa1b23c4d (tcpdump-capable pcap with ns resolution) <br>
0xa1b2cd34 (Alexey Kuznetzov&rsquo;s pcap)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pcap files with different meta
data endianness are supported by netsniff-ng as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When replaying pcap files, the timing information from the
pcap packet header is currently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, when replaying pcap files,
demultiplexing traffic among multiple networking interfaces
does not work. Currently, it is only sent via the interface
that is given by the <br>
--out parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing traffic capture
on the Ethernet interface, the pcap file is created and
packets are received but without a 802.1Q header. When one
uses tshark, all headers are <br>
visible, but netsniff-ng removes 802.1Q headers. Is that
normal behavior?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yes and no. The way VLAN headers
are handled in PF_PACKET sockets by the kernel is somewhat
&acirc;problematic&acirc; [1]. The problem in the Linux
kernel is that some drivers already handle <br>
VLANs, others do not. Those who handle it can have different
implementations, such as hardware acceleration and so on. So
in some cases the VLAN tag is even stripped before <br>
entering the protocol stack, in some cases probably not. The
bottom line is that a &quot;hack&quot; was introduced in
PF_PACKET so that a VLAN ID is visible in some helper data
structure <br>
that is accessible from the RX_RING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then it gets really messy in the
user space to artificially put the VLAN header back into the
right place. Not to mention the resulting performance
implications on all of libp&acirc; <br>
cap(3) tools since parts of the packet need to be copied for
reassembly via memmove(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user reported the following,
just to demonstrate this mess: some tests were made with two
machines, and it seems that results depend on the driver
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AR8131: <br>
ethtool -k eth0 gives &quot;rx-vlan-offload: on&quot; <br>
- wireshark gets the vlan header <br>
- netsniff-ng doesn&rsquo;t get the vlan header <br>
ethtool -K eth0 rxvlan off <br>
- wireshark gets a QinQ header even though noone sent QinQ
<br>
- netsniff-ng gets the vlan header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RTL8111/8168B: <br>
ethtool -k eth0 gives &quot;rx-vlan-offload: on&quot; <br>
- wireshark gets the vlan header <br>
- netsniff-ng doesn&rsquo;t get the vlan header <br>
ethtool -K eth0 rxvlan off <br>
- wireshark gets the vlan header <br>
- netsniff-ng doesn&rsquo;t get the vlan header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if we agreed on doing the
same workaround as libpcap, we still will not be able to see
QinQ, for instance, due to the fact that only one VLAN tag
is stored in the kernel <br>
helper data structure. We think that there should be a good
consensus on the kernel space side about what gets
transferred to userland first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update (28.11.2012): the Linux
kernel and also bpfc(8) has built-in support for hardware
accelerated VLAN filtering, even though tags might not be
visible in the payload itself <br>
as reported here. However, the filtering for VLANs works
reliable if your NIC supports it. See bpfc(8) for an
example.</p>
