ipmi-sel - display SEL entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmi-sel [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ipmi-sel is used to view and manage System Event Log (SEL)
entries. SEL records store system event information and may
be useful for debugging problems. Ipmi-sel does not inform
<br>
the user if an event is particularly good or bad, just that
the event occurred. Users may wish to use the
--output-event-state option to output the analyzed
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are general IPMI
options, tool specific options, trouble shooting
information, workaround information, examples, and known
issues. For a general introduction to <br>
FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7). To perform some advanced
SEL management, please see bmc-device(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
The following options are general options for configuring
IPMI communication and executing general tool commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D IPMIDRIVER,
--driver-type=IPMIDRIVER <br>
Specify the driver type to use instead of doing an auto
selection. The currently available outofband drivers are LAN
and LAN_2_0, which perform IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 <br>
respectively. The currently available inband drivers are
KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI, and SUNBMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-auto-probe <br>
Do not probe in-band IPMI devices for default settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--driver-address=DRIVER-ADDRESS
<br>
Specify the in-band driver address to be used instead of the
probed value. DRIVER-ADDRESS should be prefixed with
&quot;0x&quot; for a hex value and &rsquo;0&rsquo; for an
octal value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--driver-device=DEVICE <br>
Specify the in-band driver device path to be used instead of
the probed path.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--register-spacing=REGISTER-SPACING
<br>
Specify the in-band driver register spacing instead of the
probed value. Argument is in bytes (i.e. 32bit register
spacing = 4)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target-channel-number=CHANNEL-NUMBER
<br>
Specify the in-band driver target channel number to send
IPMI requests to.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target-slave-address=SLAVE-ADDRESS
<br>
Specify the in-band driver target slave number to send IPMI
requests to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...,
--hostname=IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMIHOST2[:PORT],... <br>
Specify the remote host(s) to communicate with. Multiple
hostnames may be separated by comma or may be specified in a
range format; see HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below. An <br>
optional port can be specified with each host, which may be
useful in port forwarding or similar situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
<br>
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the
remote host. If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous)
username is assumed. The user must have atleast USER
priv&acirc; <br>
ileges in order for this tool to operate fully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<br>
Specify the password to use when authenticationg with the
remote host. If not specified, a null password is assumed.
Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for <br>
IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --password-prompt <br>
Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in
process lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k K_G, --k-g=K_G <br>
Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the
remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not specified, a null key is
assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix <br>
the string with &rsquo;0x&rsquo;. E.g., the key
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; can be entered with the either the string
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; or the string &rsquo;0x616263&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --k-g-prompt <br>
Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to
20000 milliseconds (20 seconds) if not specified.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS
<br>
Specify the packet retransmission timeout in milliseconds.
Defaults to 1000 milliseconds (1 second) if not specified.
The retransmission timeout cannot be larger than the <br>
session timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a AUTHENTICATION-TYPE,
--authentication-type=AUTHENTICATION-TYPE <br>
Specify the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The
currently available authentication types are NONE,
STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I CIPHER-SUITE-ID,
--cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID <br>
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0
communi&acirc; <br>
cation. The authentication algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signa&acirc; <br>
tures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The following cipher suite <br>
ids are currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Authentication Algorithm =
None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
= None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96;
Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96;
Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality
Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality
Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17 - Authentication Algorithm =
HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128;
Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l PRIVILEGE-LEVEL,
--privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL <br>
Specify the privilege level to be used. The currently
available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-file=FILE <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W WORKAROUNDS,
--workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS <br>
Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
command line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
work&acirc; <br>
arounds (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Turn on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI-SEL OPTIONS <br>
The following options are specific to Ipmi-sel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Output verbose output. This
option will output event direction. Event direction may be
useful to differentiate severity between some events. For
example, some mother&acirc; <br>
boards may issue an event both when a temperature exceeds a
threshold and when it goes back down below it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Output very verbose output.
This option will output additional information than verbose
output. Most notably it will output additional hex codes to
given information on <br>
ambiguous SEL entries. For example, it will output Generator
ID hex codes for sensors without names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
Show general information about the SEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display=RECORD-IDS-LIST <br>
Display SEL records by record id. Accepts space or comma
separated lists.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-display=RECORD-IDS-LIST
<br>
Exclude display of SEL records by record id. Accepts space
or comma separated lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display-range=START-END <br>
Display SEL records from record id START to END.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-display-range=START-END
<br>
Exclude display of SEL records from record id START to
END.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date-range=DATE-DATE <br>
Display SEL records with events occurring in the specified
date range. Dates may be specified in MM/DD/YYYY or
MM-DD-YYYY format. The month may be specified as a numeral
<br>
or its abbreviated string name. The current local system
time can be specified with &quot;now&quot;. Note that
non-timestamped records will not be displayed automatically
because <br>
they do not possess a timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-date-range=DATE-DATE
<br>
Exclude display of SEL records with events occurring in the
specified date range. Dates may be specified in MM/DD/YYYY
or MM-DD-YYYY format. The month may be specified as <br>
a numeral or its abbreviated string name. The current local
system time can be specified with &quot;now&quot;. Note that
non-timestamped records will be displayed automatically <br>
because they do not possess a timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t SENSOR-TYPE-LIST,
--sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST <br>
Specify sensor types to show SEL events for. Multiple types
can be separated by commas or spaces. A special command line
type of &quot;all&quot;, will indicate all types should be
<br>
shown (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
Users may specify sensor types by string (see
--list-sensor-types below) or by number (decimal or
hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T SENSOR-TYPE-LIST,
--exclude-sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST <br>
Specify sensor types to not show SEL events for. Multiple
types can be separated by commas or spaces. A special
command line type of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
types should <br>
be excluded (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults). Users may specify sensor types by string (see
--list-sensor-types below) or by number (decimal or
hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --list-sensor-types <br>
List sensor types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tail=count <br>
Display approximately the last count SEL records. The
display count is calculated by approximating the record ids
of the last SEL records. It&rsquo;s correctness depends
highly <br>
on the SEL implementation by the vendor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear <br>
Clear SEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--post-clear <br>
Identical to --clear, except the SEL clearning will be
performed after SEL event records are displayed. This option
is useful for scripting if users intend to log SEL <br>
events to another log, then immediately clear SEL. Unlike
calling --clear in another execution of ipmi-sel, this
option will use SEL reservations to notify the user if a
<br>
SEL change has occurred while displaying and clearing the
SEL. This can protect users from a race, where a new SEL
event is unknowingly generated before clearing the SEL. <br>
Note that SEL reservations are optionally implemented by
vendors and may not be available on all machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete=RECORD-IDS-LIST <br>
Delete records by record id in the SEL. Accepts space or
comma separated lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-range=START-END <br>
Delete record ids from START to END in the SEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system-event-only <br>
Output only system event records (i.e. don&rsquo;t output
OEM records).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oem-event-only <br>
Output only OEM event records (i.e. don&rsquo;t output
system event records).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-manufacturer-id <br>
For OEM SEL record types, output the manufacturer ID along
with event data when available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-event-state <br>
Output event state in output. This will add an additional
output reporting if an event should be viewed as NOMINAL,
WARNING, or CRITICAL. The event state is an inter&acirc;
<br>
preted value based on the configuration file
/etc/freeipmi//freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf and the event
direction. See freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--event-state-config-file=FILE
<br>
Specify an alternate event state configuration file. Option
ignored if --output-event-state not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hex-dump <br>
Hex-dump SEL entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interpret-oem-data <br>
Attempt to interpret OEM data, such as event data, sensor
readings, or general extra info, etc. If an OEM
interpretation is not available, the default output will be
gen&acirc; <br>
erated. Correctness of OEM interpretations cannot be
guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors may make in
products, firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION below for
<br>
confirmed supported motherboard interpretations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-oem-event-strings <br>
Some motherboards support an IPMI OEM extension that returns
the string output for a system event. Such string output may
be beneficial for determining the meaning behind <br>
OEM specific events. This option will use the OEM event
string to describe all system events in the ipmi-sel output.
This option differs from --interpret-oem-data option <br>
in that all system events will output the vendor supplied
event string, not just events that are OEM specific. The
event string may be very different from the normal <br>
FreeIPMI event string output. If an OEM event strings is not
available, the default output will be output. This option is
confirmed to work for Fujitsu iRMC S1 and iRMC <br>
S2 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--entity-sensor-names <br>
Output sensor names prefixed with their entity id and
instance number when appropriate. This may be necessary on
some motherboards to help identify what sensors are
refer&acirc; <br>
encing. For example, a motherboard may have multiple sensors
named &rsquo;TEMP&rsquo;. The entity id and instance number
may help clarify which sensor refers to &quot;Processor
1&quot; vs. <br>
&quot;Processor 2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sensor-type-output <br>
Do not show sensor type output for each entry. On many
systems, the sensor type is redundant to the name of the
sensor. This can especially be true if --entity-sen&acirc;
<br>
sor-names is specified. If the sensor name is sufficient, or
if the sensor type is of no interest to the user, this
option can be specified to condense output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--comma-separated-output <br>
Output fields in comma separated format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-header-output <br>
Do not output column headers. May be useful in
scripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-abbreviated-units <br>
Output non-abbreviated units (e.g. &rsquo;Amps&rsquo;
instead of &rsquo;A&rsquo;). May aid in disambiguation of
units (e.g. &rsquo;C&rsquo; for Celsius or Coulombs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--legacy-output <br>
Output in legacy format. Newer options may not be applicable
to legacy output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SDR CACHE OPTIONS <br>
This tool requires access to the sensor data repository
(SDR) cache for general operation. By default, SDR data will
be downloaded and cached on the local machine. The following
<br>
options apply to the SDR cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --flush-cache <br>
Flush a cached version of the sensor data repository (SDR)
cache. The SDR is typically cached for faster subsequent
access. However, it may need to be flushed and re-gen&acirc;
<br>
erated if the SDR has been updated on a system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --quiet-cache <br>
Do not output information about cache creation/deletion. May
be useful in scripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sdr-cache-recreate <br>
If the SDR cache is out of date or invalid, automatically
recreate the sensor data repository (SDR) cache. This option
may be useful for scripting purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sdr-cache-file=FILE <br>
Specify a specific sensor data repository (SDR) cache file
to be stored or read from. If this option is used when
multiple hosts are specified, the same SDR cache file <br>
will be used for all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sdr-cache-directory=DIRECTORY
<br>
Specify an alternate directory for sensor data repository
(SDR) caches to be stored or read from. Defaults to the home
directory if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-sdr-cache <br>
Ignore SDR cache related processing. May lead to incomplete
or less useful information being output, however it will
allow functionality for systems without SDRs or when <br>
the correct SDR cannot be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED OPTIONS <br>
The following options manipulate hostranged output. See
HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information on
hostranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --buffer-output <br>
Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard
output until the node has completed its IPMI operation. When
specifying this option, data may appear to output <br>
slower to the user since the the entire IPMI operation must
complete before any data can be output. See HOSTRANGED
SUPPORT below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --consolidate-output <br>
Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output
from every node specified will be consolidated so that nodes
with identical output are not output twice. A <br>
header will list those nodes with the consolidated output.
When this option is specified, no output can be seen until
the IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If <br>
the user breaks out of the program early, all currently
consolidated output will be dumped. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F NUM, --fanout=NUM <br>
Specify multiple host fanout. A &quot;sliding window&quot;
(or fanout) algorithm is used for parallel IPMI
communication so that slower nodes or timed out nodes will
not impede par&acirc; <br>
allel communication. The maximum number of threads available
at the same time is limited by the fanout. The default is
64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --eliminate <br>
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by ipmidetect. This
attempts to remove the common issue of hostranged execution
timing out due to several nodes being removed <br>
from service in a large cluster. The ipmidetectd daemon must
be running on the node executing the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--always-prefix <br>
Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or
communicating in-band. This option is primarily useful for
scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if speci&acirc;
<br>
fied with the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED SUPPORT <br>
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma
separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the
general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt;
k, etc. The <br>
later form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19]
does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a
<br>
degenerate range: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This range syntax is meant only
as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming
convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list <br>
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of range usage
follow: <br>
foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 <br>
foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10 <br>
foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a reminder to the reader,
some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern
matching. Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to
enclose ranged lists within <br>
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple hosts are
specified by the user, a thread will be executed for each
host in parallel up to the configured fanout (which can be
adjusted via the -F option). This <br>
will allow communication to large numbers of nodes far more
quickly than if done in serial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, standard output from
each node specified will be output with the hostname
prepended to each line. Although this output is readable in
many situations, it may be dif&acirc; <br>
ficult to read in other situations. For example, output from
multiple nodes may be mixed together. The -B and -C options
can be used to change this default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In-band IPMI Communication will
be used when the host &quot;localhost&quot; is specified.
This allows the user to add the localhost into the
hostranged output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN problems involve a
misconfiguration of the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double
check to make sure the following are configured properly in
the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC: IP <br>
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connec&acirc; <br>
tions, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration <br>
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inband IPMI problems are
typically caused by improperly configured drivers or
non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password invalid&quot; -
The password entered (or a NULL password if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the
password for the user is not correctly configured <br>
on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password verification
timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed out. A
&quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above) or a
generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. <br>
During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The
K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is
not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level
insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher user
privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may <br>
require authenticating to a different user which has a
higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level cannot be
obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege level you are
attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
allowed for this user. Please try <br>
again with a lower privilege. It may also be possible the
maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try <br>
again with an alternate authentication type or alternate
privilege level. It may also be possible the available
authentication types you can authenticate with are not
correctly <br>
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher suite id
unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may <br>
also be possible the available cipher suite ids are not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
- IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please
try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection timeout&quot; -
Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of potential
errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be <br>
resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the
network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration
and connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;session timeout&quot; -
The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect. If this
error occurs often, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are con&acirc; <br>
siderably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;device not found&quot; -
The specified device could not be found. Please check
configuration or inputs and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;message timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC busy&quot; - The BMC
is currently busy. It may be processing information or have
too many simultaneous sessions to manage. Please wait and
try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;could not find inband
device&quot; - An inband device could not be found. Please
check configuration or specify specific device or driver on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; - The
inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC
or service processor. The BMC or service processor may be
busy or (worst case) possibly non- <br>
functioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;internal IPMI error&quot;
- An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how
to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to
report the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI-SEL TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Some timestamps in the SEL may report a date of 1-Jan-1970,
the epoch for SEL timestamps. This timestamp is not
necessarily incorrect. It usually indicates a hardware event
that <br>
occurred before a timestamp in firmware has been
initialized. For example, certain hardware components will
have their internal clocks reset during a power cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the internal clock
of the SEL appears to be regularly incorrect, you may need
to set the SEL time. This can be done using
bmc-device(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are common SEL
related messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;sel config file parse
error&quot; - A parse error was found in the sel event
interpretation configuration file. Please see
freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKAROUNDS <br>
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI
solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of
work&acirc; <br>
arounds currently available to handle discovered compliance
issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so
they will be transparent to the user. However, some will
<br>
require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardware listed below may
only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on.
Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
below. Similar machines from <br>
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds <br>
listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe your hardware has
an additional compliance issue that needs a workaround to be
implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or <br>
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumeio - This workaround flag
will assume inband interfaces communicate with system I/O
rather than being memory-mapped. This will work around
systems that report invalid base <br>
addresses. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;device not
supported&quot; or &quot;could not find inband device&quot;
errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spinpoll - This workaround flag
will inform some inband drivers (most notably the KCS
driver) to spin while polling rather than putting the
process to sleep. This may signifi&acirc; <br>
cantly improve the wall clock running time of tools because
an operating system scheduler&rsquo;s granularity may be
much larger than the time it takes to perform a single IPMI
message <br>
transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool
for a more useful task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authcap - This workaround flag
will skip early checks for username capabilities,
authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
authentication to succeed. It works <br>
around multiple issues in which the remote system does not
properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see <br>
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel <br>
SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochecksumcheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums <br>
due to implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise
valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes validation of packet integrity in a number of
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most
situations. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification time&acirc; <br>
out&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
&quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too.
Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F,
and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idzero - This workaround flag
will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client.
It works around IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs
to the client. Those hitting <br>
this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpectedauth - This workaround
flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked
as though they were expected. It works around an issue when
packets contain non-null <br>
authentication data when they should be null due to disabled
per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell
Pow&acirc; <br>
erEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forcepermsg - This workaround
flag will force per-message authentication to be used no
matter what is advertised by the remote system. It works
around an issue when per-message <br>
authentication is advertised as disabled on the remote
system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue <br>
observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endianseq - This workaround flag
will flip the endian of the session sequence numbers to
allow the session to continue properly. It works around IPMI
1.5 session sequence numbers <br>
that are the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noauthcodecheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command
responses. It works around systems that return <br>
invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the validity <br>
of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is
unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting this issue
may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session
timeout&quot;, or &quot;password veri&acirc; <br>
fication timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Xyratex
FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intel20 - This workaround flag
will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
password truncation if the <br>
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with <br>
Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermicro20 - This workaround
flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0
authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI
firmware. The issues covered include han&acirc; <br>
dling invalid length authentication codes. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors.
Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card.
Confirmed <br>
fixed on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sun20 - This workaround flag
will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and <br>
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround <br>
automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot;
workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opensesspriv - This workaround
flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s IPMI 2.0
connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing
algorithm used by the remote system. The privi&acirc; <br>
lege level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those
hit&acirc; <br>
ting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;,
&quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status
code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500
with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu <br>
II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and
Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is
automatically trig&acirc; <br>
gered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integritycheckvalue - This
workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check
value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity <br>
check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermi&acirc; <br>
cro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumemaxsdrrecordcount - This
workaround will inform SDR reading to stop reading after a
known maximum numer of SDR records have been read. This will
work around systems that <br>
have mis-implemented SDR reading functions that. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;SDR record count
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on unspecified Inspur
motherboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumesystemevent - This
workaround option will assume invalid SEL record types are
system event records. Records may be formatted correctly but
report invalid record types. <br>
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;Unknown SEL Record
Type&quot; errors. Output may be unknown, pray for the best.
This option is confirmed to work around compliances issues
on HP DL <br>
380 G5 motherboards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some
motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not
support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection <br>
timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be worked around by
using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
--driver-type=LAN_2_0. Issue observed on HP Proliant DL
145.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OEM INTERPRETATION <br>
The following motherboards are confirmed to have atleast
some support by the --interpret-oem-data option. While
highly probable the OEM data interpretations would work
across <br>
other motherboards by the same manufacturer, there are no
guarantees. Some of the motherboards below may be rebranded
by vendors/distributors.</p>

Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On error, exit
status is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple hosts are specified
for communication, the exit status is 0 if and only if all
targets successfully execute. Otherwise the exit status is
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
On older operating systems, if you input your username,
password, and other potentially security relevant
information on the command line, this information may be
discovered by <br>
other users when using tools like the ps(1) command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K <br>
options. Configuring security relevant information in the
FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way
to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent brute force
attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock up&quot;
after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need
to wait awhile in order to this tempo&acirc; <br>
rary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may authenticate
again.</p>
