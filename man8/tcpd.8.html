tcpd - access control facility for internet services
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>tcpd</i> program can be set up to monitor incoming requests for
  <i>telnet</i>, <i>finger</i>, <i>ftp</i>, <i>exec</i>, <i>rsh</i>,
  <i>rlogin</i>, <i>tftp</i>, <i>talk</i>, <i>comsat</i> and other services that
  have a one-to-one mapping onto executable files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program supports both 4.3BSD-style sockets and System V.4-style TLI.
  Functionality may be limited when the protocol underneath TLI is not an
  internet protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Operation is as follows: whenever a request for service arrives, the
  <i>inetd</i> daemon is tricked into running the <i>tcpd</i> program instead of
  the desired server. <i>tcpd</i> logs the request and does some additional
  checks. When all is well, <i>tcpd</i> runs the appropriate server program and
  goes away.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optional features are: pattern-based access control, client username lookups
  with the RFC 931 etc. protocol, protection against hosts that pretend to have
  someone elses host name, and protection against hosts that pretend to have
  someone elses network address.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#LOGGING">LOGGING</a></h1>
Connections that are monitored by <i>tcpd</i> are reported through the
  <i>syslog</i>(3) facility. Each record contains a time stamp, the client host
  name and the name of the requested service. The information can be useful to
  detect unwanted activities, especially when logfile information from several
  hosts is merged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to find out where your logs are going, examine the syslog configuration
  file, usually /etc/syslog.conf.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACCESS_CONTROL"><a class="selflink" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL">ACCESS
  CONTROL</a></h1>
Optionally, <i>tcpd</i> supports a simple form of access control that is based
  on pattern matching. The access-control software provides hooks for the
  execution of shell commands when a pattern fires. For details, see the
  <i>hosts_access</i>(5) manual page.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOST_NAME_VERIFICATION"><a class="selflink" href="#HOST_NAME_VERIFICATION">HOST
  NAME VERIFICATION</a></h1>
The authentication scheme of some protocols ( <i>rlogin, rsh</i>) relies on host
  names. Some implementations believe the host name that they get from any
  random name server; other implementations are more careful but use a flawed
  algorithm.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>tcpd</i> verifies the client host name that is returned by the
  address-&gt;name DNS server by looking at the host name and address that are
  returned by the name-&gt;address DNS server. If any discrepancy is detected,
  <i>tcpd</i> concludes that it is dealing with a host that pretends to have
  someone elses host name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the sources are compiled with -DPARANOID, <i>tcpd</i> will drop the
  connection in case of a host name/address mismatch. Otherwise, the hostname
  can be matched with the <i>PARANOID</i> wildcard, after which suitable action
  can be taken.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOST_ADDRESS_SPOOFING"><a class="selflink" href="#HOST_ADDRESS_SPOOFING">HOST
  ADDRESS SPOOFING</a></h1>
Optionally, <i>tcpd</i> disables source-routing socket options on every
  connection that it deals with. This will take care of most attacks from hosts
  that pretend to have an address that belongs to someone elses network. UDP
  services do not benefit from this protection. This feature must be turned on
  at compile time.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RFC_931"><a class="selflink" href="#RFC_931">RFC
  931</a></h1>
When RFC 931 etc. lookups are enabled (compile-time option) <i>tcpd</i> will
  attempt to establish the name of the client user. This will succeed only if
  the client host runs an RFC 931-compliant daemon. Client user name lookups
  will not work for datagram-oriented connections, and may cause noticeable
  delays in the case of connections from PCs.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The details of using <i>tcpd</i> depend on pathname information that was
  compiled into the program.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_1"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE_1">EXAMPLE
  1</a></h1>
This example applies when <i>tcpd</i> expects that the original network daemons
  will be moved to an &quot;other&quot; place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to monitor access to the <i>finger</i> service, move the original
  finger daemon to the &quot;other&quot; place and install tcpd in the place of
  the original finger daemon. No changes are required to configuration files.
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
# mkdir /other/place
# mv /usr/etc/in.fingerd /other/place
# cp tcpd /usr/etc/in.fingerd
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The example assumes that the network daemons live in /usr/etc. On some systems,
  network daemons live in /usr/sbin or in /usr/libexec, or have no `in.&#x00B4;
  prefix to their name.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_2"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE_2">EXAMPLE
  2</a></h1>
This example applies when <i>tcpd</i> expects that the network daemons are left
  in their original place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to monitor access to the <i>finger</i> service, perform the following
  edits on the <i>inetd</i> configuration file (usually <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>
  or <i>/etc/inet/inetd.conf</i>):
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
finger  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/etc/in.fingerd  in.fingerd
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
becomes:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
finger  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /some/where/tcpd     in.fingerd
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The example assumes that the network daemons live in /usr/etc. On some systems,
  network daemons live in /usr/sbin or in /usr/libexec, the daemons have no
  `in.&#x00B4; prefix to their name, or there is no userid field in the inetd
  configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similar changes will be needed for the other services that are to be covered by
  <i>tcpd</i>. Send a `kill -HUP&#x00B4; to the <i>inetd</i>(8) process to make
  the changes effective. AIX users may also have to execute the `inetimp&#x00B4;
  command.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_3"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE_3">EXAMPLE
  3</a></h1>
In the case of daemons that do not live in a common directory
  (&quot;secret&quot; or otherwise), edit the <i>inetd</i> configuration file so
  that it specifies an absolute path name for the process name field. For
  example:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    ntalk  dgram  udp  wait  root  /some/where/tcpd  /usr/local/lib/ntalkd
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only the last component (ntalkd) of the pathname will be used for access control
  and logging.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Some UDP (and RPC) daemons linger around for a while after they have finished
  their work, in case another request comes in. In the inetd configuration file
  these services are registered with the <i>wait</i> option. Only the request
  that started such a daemon will be logged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program does not work with RPC services over TCP. These services are
  registered as <i>rpc/tcp</i> in the inetd configuration file. The only
  non-trivial service that is affected by this limitation is <i>rexd</i>, which
  is used by the <i>on(1)</i> command. This is no great loss. On most systems,
  <i>rexd</i> is less secure than a wildcard in /etc/hosts.equiv.
<div class="Pp"></div>
RPC broadcast requests (for example: <i>rwall, rup, rusers</i>) always appear to
  come from the responding host. What happens is that the client broadcasts the
  request to all <i>portmap</i> daemons on its network; each <i>portmap</i>
  daemon forwards the request to a local daemon. As far as the <i>rwall</i> etc.
  daemons know, the request comes from the local host.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
The default locations of the host access control tables are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
/etc/hosts.allow
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
/etc/hosts.deny
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEE_ALSO"><a class="selflink" href="#SEE_ALSO">SEE
  ALSO</a></h1>
<pre>
hosts_access(5), format of the tcpd access control tables.
syslog.conf(5), format of the syslogd control file.
inetd.conf(5), format of the inetd control file.
