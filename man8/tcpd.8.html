<p>TCPD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual TCPD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcpd - access control facility for internet services</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The tcpd program can be set up to monitor incoming requests
for telnet, finger, ftp, exec, rsh, rlogin, tftp, talk,
comsat and other services that have a one-to-one mapping
onto <br>
executable files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program supports both
4.3BSD-style sockets and System V.4-style TLI. Functionality
may be limited when the protocol underneath TLI is not an
internet protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation is as follows:
whenever a request for service arrives, the inetd daemon is
tricked into running the tcpd program instead of the desired
server. tcpd logs the request <br>
and does some additional checks. When all is well, tcpd runs
the appropriate server program and goes away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional features are:
pattern-based access control, client username lookups with
the RFC 931 etc. protocol, protection against hosts that
pretend to have someone elses host <br>
name, and protection against hosts that pretend to have
someone elses network address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
Connections that are monitored by tcpd are reported through
the syslog(3) facility. Each record contains a time stamp,
the client host name and the name of the requested service.
<br>
The information can be useful to detect unwanted activities,
especially when logfile information from several hosts is
merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to find out where your
logs are going, examine the syslog configuration file,
usually /etc/syslog.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL <br>
Optionally, tcpd supports a simple form of access control
that is based on pattern matching. The access-control
software provides hooks for the execution of shell commands
when <br>
a pattern fires. For details, see the hosts_access(5) manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST NAME VERIFICATION <br>
The authentication scheme of some protocols (rlogin, rsh)
relies on host names. Some implementations believe the host
name that they get from any random name server; other
imple&acirc; <br>
mentations are more careful but use a flawed algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpd verifies the client host
name that is returned by the address-&gt;name DNS server by
looking at the host name and address that are returned by
the name-&gt;address DNS server. If <br>
any discrepancy is detected, tcpd concludes that it is
dealing with a host that pretends to have someone elses host
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the sources are compiled with
-DPARANOID, tcpd will drop the connection in case of a host
name/address mismatch. Otherwise, the hostname can be
matched with the PARANOID <br>
wildcard, after which suitable action can be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST ADDRESS SPOOFING <br>
Optionally, tcpd disables source-routing socket options on
every connection that it deals with. This will take care of
most attacks from hosts that pretend to have an address <br>
that belongs to someone elses network. UDP services do not
benefit from this protection. This feature must be turned on
at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC 931 <br>
When RFC 931 etc. lookups are enabled (compile-time option)
tcpd will attempt to establish the name of the client user.
This will succeed only if the client host runs an RFC <br>
931-compliant daemon. Client user name lookups will not work
for datagram-oriented connections, and may cause noticeable
delays in the case of connections from PCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The details of using tcpd depend on pathname information
that was compiled into the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 1 <br>
This example applies when tcpd expects that the original
network daemons will be moved to an &quot;other&quot;
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to monitor access to
the finger service, move the original finger daemon to the
&quot;other&quot; place and install tcpd in the place of the
original finger daemon. No changes are <br>
required to configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># mkdir /other/place <br>
# mv /usr/etc/in.fingerd /other/place <br>
# cp tcpd /usr/etc/in.fingerd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example assumes that the
network daemons live in /usr/etc. On some systems, network
daemons live in /usr/sbin or in /usr/libexec, or have no
&lsquo;in.&Acirc;&acute; prefix to their name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 2 <br>
This example applies when tcpd expects that the network
daemons are left in their original place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to monitor access to
the finger service, perform the following edits on the inetd
configuration file (usually /etc/inetd.conf or
/etc/inet/inetd.conf):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finger stream tcp nowait nobody
/usr/etc/in.fingerd in.fingerd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finger stream tcp nowait nobody
/some/where/tcpd in.fingerd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example assumes that the
network daemons live in /usr/etc. On some systems, network
daemons live in /usr/sbin or in /usr/libexec, the daemons
have no &lsquo;in.&Acirc;&acute; prefix to their <br>
name, or there is no userid field in the inetd configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar changes will be needed
for the other services that are to be covered by tcpd. Send
a &lsquo;kill -HUP&Acirc;&acute; to the inetd(8) process to
make the changes effective. AIX users may <br>
also have to execute the &lsquo;inetimp&Acirc;&acute;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 3 <br>
In the case of daemons that do not live in a common
directory (&quot;secret&quot; or otherwise), edit the inetd
configuration file so that it specifies an absolute path
name for the <br>
process name field. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntalk dgram udp wait root
/some/where/tcpd /usr/local/lib/ntalkd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the last component (ntalkd)
of the pathname will be used for access control and
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Some UDP (and RPC) daemons linger around for a while after
they have finished their work, in case another request comes
in. In the inetd configuration file these services are <br>
registered with the wait option. Only the request that
started such a daemon will be logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program does not work with
RPC services over TCP. These services are registered as
rpc/tcp in the inetd configuration file. The only
non-trivial service that is affected by <br>
this limitation is rexd, which is used by the on(1) command.
This is no great loss. On most systems, rexd is less secure
than a wildcard in /etc/hosts.equiv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPC broadcast requests (for
example: rwall, rup, rusers) always appear to come from the
responding host. What happens is that the client broadcasts
the request to all portmap <br>
daemons on its network; each portmap daemon forwards the
request to a local daemon. As far as the rwall etc. daemons
know, the request comes from the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The default locations of the host access control tables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/hosts.allow <br>
/etc/hosts.deny</p>
