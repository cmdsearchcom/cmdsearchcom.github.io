<p>COURIERFILTER(8) Double Precision, Inc.
COURIERFILTER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
courierfilter - Courier mail filters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
courierfilter [[start] | [stop] | [restart]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filterctl [[start] | [stop]]
[filter]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The filterctl commands install or uninstall global mail
filters. Global mail filters are used to selectively block
unwanted mail. More than one mail filter can be enabled at
the <br>
same time. Two filters - dupfilter(8)[1] and
courierperlfilter(8)[2] - are provided as examples for
writing mail filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">courierfilter start runs all
mail filters that have been installed by filterctl.
courierfilter stop shuts down all running mail filters.
After courierfilter start, any filterctl <br>
commands take effect immediately. After courierfilter stop
any filterctl commands will take effect at the next
courierfilter start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">courierfilter restart signals
the running courierfilter to reread its configuration files.
This is normally done automatically, by filterctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any mail filter is installed,
the mail filter must be running in order for any mail to be
processed. Mail filters are assumed to be empowered to
enforce system-wide mail <br>
policies, so if an installed mail filter is not running then
mail will not be accepted by the system. Note that mail will
not be rejected, if possible. Every attempt will be made
<br>
to send a temporary error code to an external mail system,
asking it to try again later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this reason, you should
modify your system boot script to run courierfilter start as
soon as possible, and run courierfilter stop during the
final portion of your system <br>
shutdown script. It is not necessary to run courierfilter if
you do not install a mail filter with filterctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIL FILTER IMPLEMENTATION <br>
This section explains how mail filters are implemented, and
how to write a new global mail filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available mail filter binaries
are located in the directory /usr/lib/courier/filters. The
filterctl script looks in this directory to see which mail
filters are available to be <br>
installed. Installing a mail filter consists of simply
creating a soft link from the directory
/etc/courier/filters/active to its corresponding binary in
<br>
/usr/lib/courier/filters. The courierfilter start command
simply reads /etc/courier/filters/active and runs every
program in this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filterctl script sends a HUP
signal to courierfilter after installing or uninstalling a
filter. courierfilter will reread the contents of
/etc/courier/filters/active then <br>
start or stop individual mail filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After starting, an individual
mail filter must create a filesystem domain socket in one of
two directories: /var/lib/courier/filters or
/var/lib/courier/allfilters. The name of <br>
the socket should be the same as a name of the filter, and
the mail filter must make sure to remove any socket by the
same name in the other directory. For various silly reasons,
<br>
the recommended implementation is to create
/var/lib/courier/filters/.NAME or
/var/lib/courier/allfilters/.NAME (after making sure that it
doesn&rsquo;t exist) then rename .NAME to <br>
NAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After initializing the socket,
the mail filter must then close its file descriptor #3. File
descriptor 3 is inherited by every mail filter that&rsquo;s
executed by the courierfilter <br>
start command. The mail filter&rsquo;s file descriptor 3 is
connected to the write end of a pipe, which may be relevant
to certain ways of implementing the closing of the file <br>
descriptor, for instance in Perl where you may be forced to
pseudo-open the descriptor (in write mode) before closing
it. The courierfilter start command will not exit until <br>
every started mail filter closes its file descriptor 3. This
allows for all mail filters to orderly initialize themselves
before courierfilter start command returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All mail filters also inherit a
pipe on standard input, and must terminate when the pipe is
closed. Mail filters must simultaneously listen for new
connections on the mail filter <br>
socket, and for their standard input to close.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mail filter receives a new
connection on its socket for every message that needs to be
filtered. After establishing a connection, the mail filter
will immediately read the <br>
following information from the new socket:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pathname to a file containing
the contents of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One or more pathnames to control
files for this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each pathname is terminated by a
single newline character. The last pathname is followed by a
second newline character. The pathnames may either be
relative pathnames to /usr or <br>
absolute pathnames, depending on the system
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mail filter is free to judge
the message&rsquo;s worthiness by reading its contents
and/or control file(s) as soon as a second consecutive
newline character is received. The final <br>
verdict is rendered by writing back a result code on the
same socket. The result code follows the same format as
regular SMTP replies (even though the message may not have
been <br>
received via SMTP), and can be used to communicate
acceptance, temporary failure, or a permanent failure. If
it&rsquo;s a failure, then the text portion of the result
code will be <br>
used, if possible. The result code may be a multiline
response, just like a regular SMTP reply. The mail filter
must immediately close the connection after writing the
result <br>
code. After closing the socket the mail filter must then
proceed to wait for another connection request on the
original listening socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mail filter can be
multithreaded or multitasked, and can accept multiple
connections simultaneously. When its standard input is
closed the mail filter should stop accepting <br>
new connections and wait for any existing connections to be
closed, prior to exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global mail filters must be
EXTREMELY resilient to runtime failures. Since mail will not
be processed if an installed mail filter is not running, if
a mail filter crashes it will <br>
effectively shut down the mail server. Currently
courierfilter does not attempt to restart mail filters which
crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIL FILTER INVOCATION <br>
The system administrator defines what mail gets filtered by
editing the contents of the enablefiltering configuration
file in /etc/courier. This configuration file contains a
<br>
list of mail sources that should be filtered, like esmtp or
local. See courier(8)[3] for more information. A default
/etc/courier/enablefiltering file is installed that
specifies <br>
only the esmtp mail source as subject to filtering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A message is not subject to
filtering if its source is not listed in
/etc/courier/enablefiltering. Otherwise the following rules
apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain mail destinations have
the ability to selectively whitelist arbitrary messages. For
example, local mail recipients have the ability to
selectively whitelist individual <br>
messages, provided that a local mail filter (independent of
any global mail filter) is installed that implements the
maildrop filtering API[4].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New messages are filtered by
connecting to every socket in /var/lib/courier/filters
and/or /var/lib/courier/allfilters, one at a time. All mail
filters must accept the message, <br>
for it to be accepted by Courier. If a socket exists but a
connection cannot be established then the message is not
accepted, and a temporary failure indication is returned.
<br>
That&rsquo;s why no mail will be accepted unless all
installed mail filters are running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail recipients that did not
whitelist the sender, via the maildrop API, will have their
mail filtered against everything in /var/lib/courier/filters
and <br>
/var/lib/courier/allfilters. Mail to recipients that
whitelisted the sender, or mail to destinations that do not
use a maildrop API-compatible filter, will be filtered only
<br>
against the contents of /var/lib/courier/allfilters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This gives system administrators
a choice whether to install selective, or mandatory mail
filters, or a combination of both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Many filesystem domain socket implementation are buggy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling of crashed mail filters
could be improved.</p>
