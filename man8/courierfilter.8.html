The <b>filterctl</b> commands install or uninstall global mail <i>filter</i>s.
  Global mail filters are used to selectively block unwanted mail. More than one
  mail filter can be enabled at the same time. Two filters -
  <b></b><b>dupfilter</b>(8)[1] and <b></b><b>courierperlfilter</b>(8)[2] - are
  provided as examples for writing mail filters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>courierfilter start</b> runs all mail filters that have been installed by
  <b>filterctl</b>. <b>courierfilter stop</b> shuts down all running mail
  filters. After <b>courierfilter start</b>, any <b>filterctl</b> commands take
  effect immediately. After <b>courierfilter stop</b> any <b>filterctl</b>
  commands will take effect at the next <b>courierfilter start</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>courierfilter restart</b> signals the running <b>courierfilter</b> to reread
  its configuration files. This is normally done automatically, by
  <b>filterctl</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If any mail filter is installed, the mail filter must be running in order for
  any mail to be processed. Mail filters are assumed to be empowered to enforce
  system-wide mail policies, so if an installed mail filter is not running then
  mail will not be accepted by the system. Note that mail will not be rejected,
  if possible. Every attempt will be made to send a temporary error code to an
  external mail system, asking it to try again later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For this reason, you should modify your system boot script to run
  <b>courierfilter start</b> as soon as possible, and run <b>courierfilter
  stop</b> during the final portion of your system shutdown script. It is not
  necessary to run <b>courierfilter</b> if you do not install a mail filter with
  <b>filterctl</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MAIL_FILTER_IMPLEMENTATION"><a class="selflink" href="#MAIL_FILTER_IMPLEMENTATION">MAIL
  FILTER IMPLEMENTATION</a></h1>
This section explains how mail filters are implemented, and how to write a new
  global mail filter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Available mail filter binaries are located in the directory
  /usr/lib/courier/filters. The <b>filterctl</b> script looks in this directory
  to see which mail filters are available to be installed. Installing a mail
  filter consists of simply creating a soft link from the directory
  /etc/courier/filters/active to its corresponding binary in
  /usr/lib/courier/filters. The courierfilter start command simply reads
  /etc/courier/filters/active and runs every program in this directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>filterctl</b> script sends a HUP signal to <b>courierfilter</b> after
  installing or uninstalling a filter. <b>courierfilter</b> will reread the
  contents of /etc/courier/filters/active then start or stop individual mail
  filters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After starting, an individual mail filter must create a filesystem domain socket
  in one of two directories: /var/lib/courier/filters or
  /var/lib/courier/allfilters. The name of the socket should be the same as a
  name of the filter, and the mail filter must make sure to remove any socket by
  the same name in the other directory. For various silly reasons, the
  recommended implementation is to create /var/lib/courier/filters/. <i>NAME</i>
  or /var/lib/courier/allfilters/. <i>NAME</i> (after making sure that it
  doesn't exist) then rename <i>.NAME</i> to <i>NAME</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After initializing the socket, the mail filter must then close its file
  descriptor #3. File descriptor 3 is inherited by every mail filter that's
  executed by the <b>courierfilter start</b> command. The mail filter's file
  descriptor 3 is connected to the <i>write</i> end of a pipe, which may be
  relevant to certain ways of implementing the closing of the file descriptor,
  for instance in Perl where you may be forced to pseudo-open the descriptor (in
  write mode) before closing it. The <b>courierfilter start</b> command will not
  exit until every started mail filter closes its file descriptor 3. This allows
  for all mail filters to orderly initialize themselves before <b>courierfilter
  start</b> command returns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All mail filters also inherit a pipe on standard input, and must terminate when
  the pipe is closed. Mail filters must simultaneously listen for new
  connections on the mail filter socket, and for their standard input to close.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mail filter receives a new connection on its socket for every message that
  needs to be filtered. After establishing a connection, the mail filter will
  immediately read the following information from the new socket:
<div class="Pp"></div>
A pathname to a file containing the contents of the message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One or more pathnames to control files for this message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each pathname is terminated by a single newline character. The last pathname is
  followed by a second newline character. The pathnames may either be relative
  pathnames to /usr or absolute pathnames, depending on the system
  configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mail filter is free to judge the message's worthiness by reading its
  contents and/or control file(s) as soon as a second consecutive newline
  character is received. The final verdict is rendered by writing back a result
  code on the same socket. The result code follows the same format as regular
  SMTP replies (even though the message may not have been received via SMTP),
  and can be used to communicate acceptance, temporary failure, or a permanent
  failure. If it's a failure, then the text portion of the result code will be
  used, if possible. The result code may be a multiline response, just like a
  regular SMTP reply. The mail filter must immediately close the connection
  after writing the result code. After closing the socket the mail filter must
  then proceed to wait for another connection request on the original listening
  socket.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mail filter can be multithreaded or multitasked, and can accept multiple
  connections simultaneously. When its standard input is closed the mail filter
  should stop accepting new connections and wait for any existing connections to
  be closed, prior to exiting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Global mail filters must be EXTREMELY resilient to runtime failures. Since mail
  will not be processed if an installed mail filter is not running, if a mail
  filter crashes it will effectively shut down the mail server. Currently
  <b>courierfilter</b> does not attempt to restart mail filters which crash.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MAIL_FILTER_INVOCATION"><a class="selflink" href="#MAIL_FILTER_INVOCATION">MAIL
  FILTER INVOCATION</a></h1>
The system administrator defines what mail gets filtered by editing the contents
  of the enablefiltering configuration file in /etc/courier. This configuration
  file contains a list of mail sources that should be filtered, like esmtp or
  local. See <b></b><b>courier</b>(8)[3] for more information. A default
  /etc/courier/enablefiltering file is installed that specifies only the esmtp
  mail source as subject to filtering.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A message is not subject to filtering if its source is not listed in
  /etc/courier/enablefiltering. Otherwise the following rules apply.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Certain mail destinations have the ability to selectively whitelist arbitrary
  messages. For example, local mail recipients have the ability to selectively
  whitelist individual messages, provided that a local mail filter (independent
  of any global mail filter) is installed that implements the <b>maildrop
  filtering API</b>[4].
<div class="Pp"></div>
New messages are filtered by connecting to every socket in
  /var/lib/courier/filters and/or /var/lib/courier/allfilters, one at a time.
  All mail filters must accept the message, for it to be accepted by Courier. If
  a socket exists but a connection cannot be established then the message is not
  accepted, and a temporary failure indication is returned. That's why no mail
  will be accepted unless all installed mail filters are running.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mail recipients that did not whitelist the sender, via the maildrop API, will
  have their mail filtered against everything in /var/lib/courier/filters and
  /var/lib/courier/allfilters. Mail to recipients that whitelisted the sender,
  or mail to destinations that do not use a maildrop API-compatible filter, will
  be filtered only against the contents of /var/lib/courier/allfilters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This gives system administrators a choice whether to install selective, or
  mandatory mail filters, or a combination of both.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Many filesystem domain socket implementation are buggy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Handling of crashed mail filters could be improved.
