<p>PPPD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual PPPD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pppd - Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pppd [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
PPP is the protocol used for establishing internet links
over dial-up modems, DSL connections, and many other types
of point-to-point links. The pppd daemon works together with
<br>
the kernel PPP driver to establish and maintain a PPP link
with another system (called the peer) and to negotiate
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each end of the link.
Pppd <br>
can also authenticate the peer and/or supply authentication
information to the peer. PPP can be used with other network
protocols besides IP, but such use is becoming
increas&acirc; <br>
ingly rare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS <br>
ttyname <br>
Use the serial port called ttyname to communicate with the
peer. If ttyname does not begin with a slash (/), the string
&quot;/dev/&quot; is prepended to ttyname to form the name
<br>
of the device to open. If no device name is given, or if the
name of the terminal connected to the standard input is
given, pppd will use that terminal, and will not fork <br>
to put itself in the background. A value for this option
from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">speed An option that is a
decimal number is taken as the desired baud rate for the
serial device. On systems such as 4.4BSD and NetBSD, any
speed can be specified. Other sys&acirc; <br>
tems (e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the commonly-used baud
rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asyncmap map <br>
This option sets the Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for
this end of the link. The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for
each of the ASCII control characters with values <br>
from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit indicates that the corresponding
control character should not be used in PPP packets sent to
this system. The map is encoded as a hexadecimal <br>
number (without a leading 0x) where the least significant
bit (00000001) represents character 0 and the most
significant bit (80000000) represents character 31. Pppd
will <br>
ask the peer to send these characters as a 2-byte escape
sequence. If multiple asyncmap options are given, the values
are ORed together. If no asyncmap option is given, <br>
the default is zero, so pppd will ask the peer not to escape
any control characters. To escape transmitted characters,
use the escape option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth Require the peer to
authenticate itself before allowing network packets to be
sent or received. This option is the default if the system
has a default route. If neither <br>
this option nor the noauth option is specified, pppd will
only allow the peer to use IP addresses to which the system
does not already have a route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call name <br>
Read additional options from the file /etc/ppp/peers/name.
This file may contain privileged options, such as noauth,
even if pppd is not being run by root. The name <br>
string may not begin with / or include .. as a pathname
component. The format of the options file is described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect script <br>
Usually there is something which needs to be done to prepare
the link before the PPP protocol can be started; for
instance, with a dial-up modem, commands need to be sent
<br>
to the modem to dial the appropriate phone number. This
option specifies an command for pppd to execute (by passing
it to a shell) before attempting to start PPP negotia&acirc;
<br>
tion. The chat (8) program is often useful here, as it
provides a way to send arbitrary strings to a modem and
respond to received characters. A value for this option <br>
from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crtscts <br>
Specifies that pppd should set the serial port to use
hardware flow control using the RTS and CTS signals in the
RS-232 interface. If neither the crtscts, the nocrtscts,
<br>
the cdtrcts nor the nocdtrcts option is given, the hardware
flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged.
Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) <br>
lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to
implement unidirectional flow control. The serial port will
suspend transmission when requested by the modem <br>
(via CTS) but will be unable to request the modem to stop
sending to the computer. This mode retains the ability to
use DTR as a modem control line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaultroute <br>
Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the
peer as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully
completed. This entry is removed when the PPP con&acirc;
<br>
nection is broken. This option is privileged if the
nodefaultroute option has been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnect script <br>
Execute the command specified by script, by passing it to a
shell, after pppd has terminated the link. This command
could, for example, issue commands to the modem to <br>
cause it to hang up if hardware modem control signals were
not available. The disconnect script is not run if the modem
has already hung up. A value for this option from <br>
a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape xx,yy,... <br>
Specifies that certain characters should be escaped on
transmission (regardless of whether the peer requests them
to be escaped with its async control character map). The
<br>
characters to be escaped are specified as a list of hex
numbers separated by commas. Note that almost any character
can be specified for the escape option, unlike the <br>
asyncmap option which only allows control characters to be
specified. The characters which may not be escaped are those
with hex values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file name <br>
Read options from file name (the format is described below).
The file must be readable by the user who has invoked
pppd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init script <br>
Execute the command specified by script, by passing it to a
shell, to initialize the serial line. This script would
typically use the chat(8) program to configure the <br>
modem to enable auto answer. A value for this option from a
privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock Specifies that pppd should
create a UUCP-style lock file for the serial device to
ensure exclusive access to the device. By default, pppd will
not create a lock file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mru n Set the MRU [Maximum
Receive Unit] value to n. Pppd will ask the peer to send
packets of no more than n bytes. The value of n must be
between 128 and 16384; the default <br>
is 1500. A value of 296 works well on very slow links (40
bytes for TCP/IP header + 256 bytes of data). Note that for
the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at least 1280.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtu n Set the MTU [Maximum
Transmit Unit] value to n. Unless the peer requests a
smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will request that
the kernel networking code send data <br>
packets of no more than n bytes through the PPP network
interface. Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MTU must be
at least 1280.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passive <br>
Enables the &quot;passive&quot; option in the LCP. With this
option, pppd will attempt to initiate a connection; if no
reply is received from the peer, pppd will then just wait
<br>
passively for a valid LCP packet from the peer, instead of
exiting, as it would without this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;local_IP_address&gt;:&lt;remote_IP_address&gt; <br>
Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses. Either
one may be omitted. The IP addresses can be specified with a
host name or in decimal dot notation (e.g. <br>
150.234.56.78). The default local address is the (first) IP
address of the system (unless the noipdefault option is
given). The remote address will be obtained from the <br>
peer if not specified in any option. Thus, in simple cases,
this option is not required. If a local and/or remote IP
address is specified with this option, pppd will not <br>
accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP
negotiation, unless the ipcp-accept-local and/or
ipcp-accept-remote options are given, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipv6
&lt;local_interface_identifier&gt;,&lt;remote_interface_identifier&gt;
<br>
Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier.
Either one may be omitted. The identifier must be specified
in standard ASCII notation of IPv6 addresses (e.g. <br>
::dead:beef). If the ipv6cp-use-ipaddr option is given, the
local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above). On
systems which supports a unique persistent id, such <br>
as EUI-48 derived from the Ethernet MAC address,
ipv6cp-use-persistent option can be used to replace the ipv6
&lt;local&gt;,&lt;remote&gt; option. Otherwise the
identifier is random&acirc; <br>
ized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">active-filter filter-expression
<br>
Specifies a packet filter to be applied to data packets to
determine which packets are to be regarded as link activity,
and therefore reset the idle timer, or cause the <br>
link to be brought up in demand-dialling mode. This option
is useful in conjunction with the idle option if there are
packets being sent or received regularly over the <br>
link (for example, routing information packets) which would
otherwise prevent the link from ever appearing to be idle.
The filter-expression syntax is as described for <br>
tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers which are inappropriate
for a PPP link, such as ether and arp, are not permitted.
Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in <br>
single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from
being interpreted by the shell. This option is currently
only available under Linux, and requires that the ker&acirc;
<br>
nel was configured to include PPP filtering support
(CONFIG_PPP_FILTER). Note that it is possible to apply
different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using
<br>
the inbound and outbound qualifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-ip address(es) <br>
Allow peers to use the given IP address or subnet without
authenticating themselves. The parameter is parsed as for
each element of the list of allowed IP addresses in <br>
the secrets files (see the AUTHENTICATION section
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-number number <br>
Allow peers to connect from the given telephone number. A
trailing &lsquo;*&rsquo; character will match all numbers
beginning with the leading part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsdcomp nr,nt <br>
Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using
the BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of nr
bits, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer <br>
with a maximum code size of nt bits. If nt is not specified,
it defaults to the value given for nr. Values in the range 9
to 15 may be used for nr and nt; larger values <br>
give better compression but consume more kernel memory for
compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for nr
or nt disables compression in the corresponding <br>
direction. Use nobsdcomp or bsdcomp 0 to disable
BSD-Compress compression entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdtrcts <br>
Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to
control the flow of data on the serial port. If neither the
crtscts, the nocrtscts, the cdtrcts nor the <br>
nocdtrcts option is given, the hardware flow control setting
for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports
(such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true RTS <br>
output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement true
bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow
control mode does not permit using DTR as a modem <br>
control line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chap-interval n <br>
If this option is given, pppd will rechallenge the peer
every n seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chap-max-challenge n <br>
Set the maximum number of CHAP challenge transmissions to n
(default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chap-restart n <br>
Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for
challenges) to n seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">child-timeout n <br>
When exiting, wait for up to n seconds for any child
processes (such as the command specified with the pty
command) to exit before exiting. At the end of the timeout,
<br>
pppd will send a SIGTERM signal to any remaining child
processes and exit. A value of 0 means no timeout, that is,
pppd will wait until all child processes have exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect-delay n <br>
Wait for up to n milliseconds after the connect script
finishes for a valid PPP packet from the peer. At the end of
this time, or when a valid PPP packet is received from <br>
the peer, pppd will commence negotiation by sending its
first LCP packet. The default value is 1000 (1 second). This
wait period only applies if the connect or pty <br>
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Enables connection
debugging facilities. If this option is given, pppd will log
the contents of all control packets sent or received in a
readable form. The packets are <br>
logged through syslog with facility daemon and level debug.
This information can be directed to a file by setting up
/etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see syslog.conf(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-asyncmap <br>
Disable asyncmap negotiation, forcing all control characters
to be escaped for both the transmit and the receive
direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-mru <br>
Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation. With this
option, pppd will use the default MRU value of 1500 bytes
for both the transmit and receive direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deflate nr,nt <br>
Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using
the Deflate scheme, with a maximum window size of 2**nr
bytes, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer <br>
with a maximum window size of 2**nt bytes. If nt is not
specified, it defaults to the value given for nr. Values in
the range 9 to 15 may be used for nr and nt; larger <br>
values give better compression but consume more kernel
memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value
of 0 for nr or nt disables compression in the corre&acirc;
<br>
sponding direction. Use nodeflate or deflate 0 to disable
Deflate compression entirely. (Note: pppd requests Deflate
compression in preference to BSD-Compress if the <br>
peer can do either.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">demand Initiate the link only on
demand, i.e. when data traffic is present. With this option,
the remote IP address must be specified by the user on the
command line or in an <br>
options file. Pppd will initially configure the interface
and enable it for IP traffic without connecting to the peer.
When traffic is available, pppd will connect to <br>
the peer and perform negotiation, authentication, etc. When
this is completed, pppd will commence passing data packets
(i.e., IP packets) across the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The demand option implies the
persist option. If this behaviour is not desired, use the
nopersist option after the demand option. The idle and
holdoff options are also <br>
useful in conjunction with the demand option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">domain d <br>
Append the domain name d to the local host name for
authentication purposes. For example, if gethostname()
returns the name porsche, but the fully qualified domain
name <br>
is porsche.Quotron.COM, you could specify domain
Quotron.COM. Pppd would then use the name
porsche.Quotron.COM for looking up secrets in the secrets
file, and as the <br>
default name to send to the peer when authenticating itself
to the peer. This option is privileged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dryrun With the dryrun option,
pppd will print out all the option values which have been
set and then exit, after parsing the command line and
options files and checking the <br>
option values, but before initiating the link. The option
values are logged at level info, and also printed to
standard output unless the device on standard output is the
<br>
device that pppd would be using to communicate with the
peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump With the dump option, pppd
will print out all the option values which have been set.
This option is like the dryrun option except that pppd
proceeds as normal rather than <br>
exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable-session <br>
Enables session accounting via PAM or wtwp/wtmpx, as
appropriate. When PAM is enabled, the PAM
&quot;account&quot; and &quot;session&quot; module stacks
determine behavior, and are enabled <br>
for all PPP authentication protocols. When PAM is disabled,
wtmp/wtmpx entries are recorded regardless of whether the
peer name identifies a valid user on the local sys&acirc;
<br>
tem, making peers visible in the last(1) log. This feature
is automatically enabled when the pppd login option is used.
Session accounting is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endpoint &lt;epdisc&gt; <br>
Sets the endpoint discriminator sent by the local machine to
the peer during multilink negotiation to &lt;epdisc&gt;. The
default is to use the MAC address of the first ether&acirc;
<br>
net interface on the system, if any, otherwise the IPv4
address corresponding to the hostname, if any, provided it
is not in the multicast or locally-assigned IP address <br>
ranges, or the localhost address. The endpoint discriminator
can be the string null or of the form type:value, where type
is a decimal number or one of the strings local, <br>
IP, MAC, magic, or phone. The value is an IP address in
dotted-decimal notation for the IP type, or a string of
bytes in hexadecimal, separated by periods or colons for
<br>
the other types. For the MAC type, the value may also be the
name of an ethernet or similar network interface. This
option is currently only available under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eap-interval n <br>
If this option is given and pppd authenticates the peer with
EAP (i.e., is the server), pppd will restart EAP
authentication every n seconds. For EAP SRP-SHA1, see also
<br>
the srp-interval option, which enables lightweight
rechallenge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eap-max-rreq n <br>
Set the maximum number of EAP Requests to which pppd will
respond (as a client) without hearing EAP Success or
Failure. (Default is 20.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eap-max-sreq n <br>
Set the maximum number of EAP Requests that pppd will issue
(as a server) while attempting authentication. (Default is
10.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eap-restart n <br>
Set the retransmit timeout for EAP Requests when acting as a
server (authenticator). (Default is 3 seconds.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eap-timeout n <br>
Set the maximum time to wait for the peer to send an EAP
Request when acting as a client (authenticatee). (Default is
20 seconds.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hide-password <br>
When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes
pppd to exclude the password string from the log. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">holdoff n <br>
Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the
link after it terminates. This option only has any effect if
the persist or demand option is used. The hold&acirc; <br>
off period is not applied if the link was terminated because
it was idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle n Specifies that pppd
should disconnect if the link is idle for n seconds. The
link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP packets) are
being sent or received. Note: it is <br>
not advisable to use this option with the persist option
without the demand option. If the active-filter option is
given, data packets which are rejected by the specified <br>
activity filter also count as the link being idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-accept-local <br>
With this option, pppd will accept the peer&rsquo;s idea of
our local IP address, even if the local IP address was
specified in an option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-accept-remote <br>
With this option, pppd will accept the peer&rsquo;s idea of
its (remote) IP address, even if the remote IP address was
specified in an option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-max-configure n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-request
transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-max-failure n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-NAKs returned
before starting to send configure-Rejects instead to n
(default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-max-terminate n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPCP terminate-request
transmissions to n (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-restart n <br>
Set the IPCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to n
seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipparam string <br>
Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up, ip-pre-up and
ip-down scripts. If this option is given, the string
supplied is given as the 6th parameter to those scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipv6cp-max-configure n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-request
transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipv6cp-max-failure n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-NAKs returned
before starting to send configure-Rejects instead to n
(default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipv6cp-max-terminate n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP terminate-request
transmissions to n (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipv6cp-restart n <br>
Set the IPv6CP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to
n seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx Enable the IPXCP and IPX
protocols. This option is presently only supported under
Linux, and only if your kernel has been configured to
include IPX support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-network n <br>
Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP configure request
frame to n, a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x).
There is no valid default. If this option is not spec&acirc;
<br>
ified, the network number is obtained from the peer. If the
peer does not have the network number, the IPX protocol will
not be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-node n:m <br>
Set the IPX node numbers. The two node numbers are separated
from each other with a colon character. The first number n
is the local node number. The second number m is <br>
the peer&rsquo;s node number. Each node number is a
hexadecimal number, at most 10 digits long. The node numbers
on the ipx-network must be unique. There is no valid
default. If <br>
this option is not specified then the node numbers are
obtained from the peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-router-name &lt;string&gt;
<br>
Set the name of the router. This is a string and is sent to
the peer as information data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-routing n <br>
Set the routing protocol to be received by this option. More
than one instance of ipx-routing may be specified. The
&rsquo;none&rsquo; option (0) may be specified as the only
instance <br>
of ipx-routing. The values may be 0 for NONE, 2 for RIP/SAP,
and 4 for NLSP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-accept-local <br>
Accept the peer&rsquo;s NAK for the node number specified in
the ipx-node option. If a node number was specified, and
non-zero, the default is to insist that the value be used.
<br>
If you include this option then you will permit the peer to
override the entry of the node number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-accept-network <br>
Accept the peer&rsquo;s NAK for the network number specified
in the ipx-network option. If a network number was
specified, and non-zero, the default is to insist that the
value <br>
be used. If you include this option then you will permit the
peer to override the entry of the node number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-accept-remote <br>
Use the peer&rsquo;s network number specified in the
configure request frame. If a node number was specified for
the peer and this option was not specified, the peer will be
<br>
forced to use the value which you have specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-max-configure n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPXCP configure request frames
which the system will send to n. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-max-failure n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK frames which the local
system will send before it rejects the options. The default
value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-max-terminate n <br>
Set the maximum number of IPXCP terminate request frames
before the local system considers that the peer is not
listening to them. The default value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdebug n <br>
Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver. The
argument values depend on the specific kernel driver, but in
general a value of 1 will enable general kernel <br>
debug messages. (Note that these messages are usually only
useful for debugging the kernel driver itself.) For the
Linux 2.2.x kernel driver, the value is a sum of bits: <br>
1 to enable general debug messages, 2 to request that the
contents of received packets be printed, and 4 to request
that the contents of transmitted packets be printed. <br>
On most systems, messages printed by the kernel are logged
by syslog(1) to a file as directed in the /etc/syslog.conf
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ktune Enables pppd to alter
kernel settings as appropriate. Under Linux, pppd will
enable IP forwarding (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
to 1) if the proxyarp option is <br>
used, and will enable the dynamic IP address option (i.e.
set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr to 1) in demand mode if
the local address changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-echo-failure n <br>
If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be
dead if n LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a
valid LCP echo-reply. If this happens, pppd will
termi&acirc; <br>
nate the connection. Use of this option requires a non-zero
value for the lcp-echo-interval parameter. This option can
be used to enable pppd to terminate after the <br>
physical connection has been broken (e.g., the modem has
hung up) in situations where no hardware modem control lines
are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-echo-interval n <br>
If this option is given, pppd will send an LCP echo-request
frame to the peer every n seconds. Normally the peer should
respond to the echo-request by sending an <br>
echo-reply. This option can be used with the
lcp-echo-failure option to detect that the peer is no longer
connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-max-configure n <br>
Set the maximum number of LCP configure-request
transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-max-failure n <br>
Set the maximum number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before
starting to send configure-Rejects instead to n (default
10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-max-terminate n <br>
Set the maximum number of LCP terminate-request
transmissions to n (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-restart n <br>
Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to n
seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linkname name <br>
Sets the logical name of the link to name. Pppd will create
a file named ppp-name.pid in /var/run (or /etc/ppp on some
systems) containing its process ID. This can be <br>
useful in determining which instance of pppd is responsible
for the link to a given peer system. This is a privileged
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local Don&rsquo;t use the modem
control lines. With this option, pppd will ignore the state
of the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem and will
not change the state of the DTR <br>
(Data Terminal Ready) signal. This is the opposite of the
modem option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logfd n <br>
Send log messages to file descriptor n. Pppd will send log
messages to at most one file or file descriptor (as well as
sending the log messages to syslog), so this option <br>
and the logfile option are mutually exclusive. The default
is for pppd to send log messages to stdout (file descriptor
1), unless the serial port is already open on std&acirc;
<br>
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logfile filename <br>
Append log messages to the file filename (as well as sending
the log messages to syslog). The file is opened with the
privileges of the user who invoked pppd, in append <br>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login Use the system password
database for authenticating the peer using PAP, and record
the user in the system wtmp file. Note that the peer must
have an entry in the <br>
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets file as well as the system password
database to be allowed access. See also the enable-session
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxconnect n <br>
Terminate the connection when it has been available for
network traffic for n seconds (i.e. n seconds after the
first network control protocol comes up).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxfail n <br>
Terminate after n consecutive failed connection attempts. A
value of 0 means no limit. The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modem Use the modem control
lines. This option is the default. With this option, pppd
will wait for the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem
to be asserted when opening <br>
the serial device (unless a connect script is specified),
and it will drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal
briefly when the connection is terminated and before
exe&acirc; <br>
cuting the connect script. On Ultrix, this option implies
hardware flow control, as for the crtscts option. This is
the opposite of the local option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mp Enables the use of PPP
multilink; this is an alias for the &lsquo;multilink&rsquo;
option. This option is currently only available under
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mppe-stateful <br>
Allow MPPE to use stateful mode. Stateless mode is still
attempted first. The default is to disallow stateful
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpshortseq <br>
Enables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in
multilink headers, as opposed to 24-bit sequence numbers.
This option is only available under Linux, and only has <br>
any effect if multilink is enabled (see the multilink
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mrru n Sets the Maximum
Reconstructed Receive Unit to n. The MRRU is the maximum
size for a received packet on a multilink bundle, and is
analogous to the MRU for the individual <br>
links. This option is currently only available under Linux,
and only has any effect if multilink is enabled (see the
multilink option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ms-dns &lt;addr&gt; <br>
If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows clients,
this option allows pppd to supply one or two DNS (Domain
Name Server) addresses to the clients. The first <br>
instance of this option specifies the primary DNS address;
the second instance (if given) specifies the secondary DNS
address. (This option was present in some older ver&acirc;
<br>
sions of pppd under the name dns-addr.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ms-wins &lt;addr&gt; <br>
If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows or
&quot;Samba&quot; clients, this option allows pppd to supply
one or two WINS (Windows Internet Name Services) server
addresses <br>
to the clients. The first instance of this option specifies
the primary WINS address; the second instance (if given)
specifies the secondary WINS address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multilink <br>
Enables the use of the PPP multilink protocol. If the peer
also supports multilink, then this link can become part of a
bundle between the local system and the peer. If <br>
there is an existing bundle to the peer, pppd will join this
link to that bundle, otherwise pppd will create a new
bundle. See the MULTILINK section below. This option <br>
is currently only available under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name name <br>
Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes
to name. This is a privileged option. With this option, pppd
will use lines in the secrets files which have <br>
name as the second field when looking for a secret to use in
authenticating the peer. In addition, unless overridden with
the user option, name will be used as the name <br>
to send to the peer when authenticating the local system to
the peer. (Note that pppd does not append the domain name to
name.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noaccomp <br>
Disable Address/Control compression in both directions (send
and receive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noauth Do not require the peer
to authenticate itself. This option is privileged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nobsdcomp <br>
Disables BSD-Compress compression; pppd will not request or
agree to compress packets using the BSD-Compress scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noccp Disable CCP (Compression
Control Protocol) negotiation. This option should only be
required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests
from pppd for CCP negotia&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocrtscts <br>
Disable hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) on the serial
port. If neither the crtscts nor the nocrtscts nor the
cdtrcts nor the nocdtrcts option is given, the hardware <br>
flow control setting for the serial port is left
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocdtrcts <br>
This option is a synonym for nocrtscts. Either of these
options will disable both forms of hardware flow
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodefaultroute <br>
Disable the defaultroute option. The system administrator
who wishes to prevent users from creating default routes
with pppd can do so by placing this option in the <br>
/etc/ppp/options file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodeflate <br>
Disables Deflate compression; pppd will not request or agree
to compress packets using the Deflate scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodetach <br>
Don&rsquo;t detach from the controlling terminal. Without
this option, if a serial device other than the terminal on
the standard input is specified, pppd will fork to become a
<br>
background process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noendpoint <br>
Disables pppd from sending an endpoint discriminator to the
peer or accepting one from the peer (see the MULTILINK
section below). This option should only be required if <br>
the peer is buggy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noip Disable IPCP negotiation
and IP communication. This option should only be required if
the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd
for IPCP negotiation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noipv6 Disable IPv6CP
negotiation and IPv6 communication. This option should only
be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by
requests from pppd for IPv6CP negotiation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noipdefault <br>
Disables the default behaviour when no local IP address is
specified, which is to determine (if possible) the local IP
address from the hostname. With this option, the <br>
peer will have to supply the local IP address during IPCP
negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on the command
line or in an options file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noipx Disable the IPXCP and IPX
protocols. This option should only be required if the peer
is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for IPXCP
negotiation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noktune <br>
Opposite of the ktune option; disables pppd from changing
system settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nolock Opposite of the lock
option; specifies that pppd should not create a UUCP-style
lock file for the serial device. This option is
privileged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nolog Do not send log messages
to a file or file descriptor. This option cancels the logfd
and logfile options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomagic <br>
Disable magic number negotiation. With this option, pppd
cannot detect a looped-back line. This option should only be
needed if the peer is buggy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomp Disables the use of PPP
multilink. This option is currently only available under
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomppe Disables MPPE (Microsoft
Point to Point Encryption). This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomppe-40 <br>
Disable 40-bit encryption with MPPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomppe-128 <br>
Disable 128-bit encryption with MPPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomppe-stateful <br>
Disable MPPE stateful mode. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nompshortseq <br>
Disables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in the
PPP multilink protocol, forcing the use of 24-bit sequence
numbers. This option is currently only available <br>
under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomultilink <br>
Disables the use of PPP multilink. This option is currently
only available under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nopcomp <br>
Disable protocol field compression negotiation in both the
receive and the transmit direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nopersist <br>
Exit once a connection has been made and terminated. This is
the default unless the persist or demand option has been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nopredictor1 <br>
Do not accept or agree to Predictor-1 compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noproxyarp <br>
Disable the proxyarp option. The system administrator who
wishes to prevent users from creating proxy ARP entries with
pppd can do so by placing this option in the <br>
/etc/ppp/options file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noremoteip <br>
Allow pppd to operate without having an IP address for the
peer. This option is only available under Linux. Normally,
pppd will request the peer&rsquo;s IP address, and if the
<br>
peer does not supply it, pppd will not bring up the link for
IP traffic. With this option, if the peer does not supply
its IP address, pppd will not ask the peer for it, <br>
and will not set the destination address of the ppp
interface. In this situation, the ppp interface can be used
for routing by creating device routes, but the peer itself
<br>
cannot be addressed directly for IP traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notty Normally, pppd requires a
terminal device. With this option, pppd will allocate itself
a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its
terminal device. Pppd will <br>
create a child process to act as a &lsquo;character
shunt&rsquo; to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty
master and its standard input and output. Thus pppd will
transmit char&acirc; <br>
acters on its standard output and receive characters on its
standard input even if they are not terminal devices. This
option increases the latency and CPU overhead of <br>
transferring data over the ppp interface as all of the
characters sent and received must flow through the character
shunt process. An explicit device name may not be <br>
given if this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">novj Disable Van Jacobson style
TCP/IP header compression in both the transmit and the
receive direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">novjccomp <br>
Disable the connection-ID compression option in Van Jacobson
style TCP/IP header compression. With this option, pppd will
not omit the connection-ID byte from Van Jacob&acirc; <br>
son compressed TCP/IP headers, nor ask the peer to do
so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">papcrypt <br>
Indicates that all secrets in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file
which are used for checking the identity of the peer are
encrypted, and thus pppd should not accept a password <br>
which, before encryption, is identical to the secret from
the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pap-max-authreq n <br>
Set the maximum number of PAP authenticate-request
transmissions to n (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pap-restart n <br>
Set the PAP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to n
seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pap-timeout n <br>
Set the maximum time that pppd will wait for the peer to
authenticate itself with PAP to n seconds (0 means no
limit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pass-filter filter-expression
<br>
Specifies a packet filter to applied to data packets being
sent or received to determine which packets should be
allowed to pass. Packets which are rejected by the filter
<br>
are silently discarded. This option can be used to prevent
specific network daemons (such as routed) using up link
bandwidth, or to provide a very basic firewall
capabil&acirc; <br>
ity. The filter-expression syntax is as described for
tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers which are inappropriate
for a PPP link, such as ether and arp, are not permitted.
<br>
Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in
single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from
being interpreted by the shell. Note that it is possible
<br>
to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing
packets using the inbound and outbound qualifiers. This
option is currently only available under Linux, and <br>
requires that the kernel was configured to include PPP
filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password password-string <br>
Specifies the password to use for authenticating to the
peer. Use of this option is discouraged, as the password is
likely to be visible to other users on the system (for <br>
example, by using ps(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">persist <br>
Do not exit after a connection is terminated; instead try to
reopen the connection. The maxfail option still has an
effect on persistent connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plugin filename <br>
Load the shared library object file filename as a plugin.
This is a privileged option. If filename does not contain a
slash (/), pppd will look in the /usr/lib/pppd/ver&acirc;
<br>
sion directory for the plugin, where version is the version
number of pppd (for example, 2.4.2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">predictor1 <br>
Request that the peer compress frames that it sends using
Predictor-1 compression, and agree to compress transmitted
frames with Predictor-1 if requested. This option has <br>
no effect unless the kernel driver supports Predictor-1
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">privgroup group-name <br>
Allows members of group group-name to use privileged
options. This is a privileged option. Use of this option
requires care as there is no guarantee that members of <br>
group-name cannot use pppd to become root themselves.
Consider it equivalent to putting the members of group-name
in the kmem or disk group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proxyarp <br>
Add an entry to this system&rsquo;s ARP [Address Resolution
Protocol] table with the IP address of the peer and the
Ethernet address of this system. This will have the effect
<br>
of making the peer appear to other systems to be on the
local ethernet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pty script <br>
Specifies that the command script is to be used to
communicate rather than a specific terminal device. Pppd
will allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use
<br>
the slave as its terminal device. The script will be run in
a child process with the pseudo-tty master as its standard
input and output. An explicit device name may not <br>
be given if this option is used. (Note: if the record option
is used in conjunction with the pty option, the child
process will have pipes on its standard input and out&acirc;
<br>
put.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive-all <br>
With this option, pppd will accept all control characters
from the peer, including those marked in the receive
asyncmap. Without this option, pppd will discard those <br>
characters as specified in RFC1662. This option should only
be needed if the peer is buggy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">record filename <br>
Specifies that pppd should record all characters sent and
received to a file named filename. This file is opened in
append mode, using the user&rsquo;s user-ID and permissions.
<br>
This option is implemented using a pseudo-tty and a process
to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty and the real
serial device, so it will increase the latency and <br>
CPU overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface.
The characters are stored in a tagged format with
timestamps, which can be displayed in readable form using
the <br>
pppdump(8) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remotename name <br>
Set the assumed name of the remote system for authentication
purposes to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remotenumber number <br>
Set the assumed telephone number of the remote system for
authentication purposes to number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refuse-chap <br>
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself
to the peer using CHAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refuse-mschap <br>
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself
to the peer using MS-CHAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refuse-mschap-v2 <br>
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself
to the peer using MS-CHAPv2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refuse-eap <br>
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself
to the peer using EAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refuse-pap <br>
With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself
to the peer using PAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-chap <br>
Require the peer to authenticate itself using CHAP
[Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol]
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-mppe <br>
Require the use of MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point
Encryption). This option disables all other compression
types. This option enables both 40-bit and 128-bit
encryption. <br>
In order for MPPE to successfully come up, you must have
authenticated with either MS-CHAP or MS-CHAPv2. This option
is presently only supported under Linux, and only if <br>
your kernel has been configured to include MPPE support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-mppe-40 <br>
Require the use of MPPE, with 40-bit encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-mppe-128 <br>
Require the use of MPPE, with 128-bit encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-mschap <br>
Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAP
[Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol]
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-mschap-v2 <br>
Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAPv2
[Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol,
Version 2] authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-eap <br>
Require the peer to authenticate itself using EAP
[Extensible Authentication Protocol] authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-pap <br>
Require the peer to authenticate itself using PAP [Password
Authentication Protocol] authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-password <br>
When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes
pppd to show the password string in the log message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">silent With this option, pppd
will not transmit LCP packets to initiate a connection until
a valid LCP packet is received from the peer (as for the
&lsquo;passive&rsquo; option with ancient <br>
versions of pppd).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">srp-interval n <br>
If this parameter is given and pppd uses EAP SRP-SHA1 to
authenticate the peer (i.e., is the server), then pppd will
use the optional lightweight SRP rechallenge mechanism <br>
at intervals of n seconds. This option is faster than
eap-interval reauthentication because it uses a hash-based
mechanism and does not derive a new session key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">srp-pn-secret string <br>
Set the long-term pseudonym-generating secret for the
server. This value is optional and if set, needs to be known
at the server (authenticator) side only, and should be <br>
different for each server (or poll of identical servers). It
is used along with the current date to generate a key to
encrypt and decrypt the client&rsquo;s identity contained
<br>
in the pseudonym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">srp-use-pseudonym <br>
When operating as an EAP SRP-SHA1 client, attempt to use the
pseudonym stored in ~/.ppp_pseudonym first as the identity,
and save in this file any pseudonym offered by the <br>
peer during authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync Use synchronous HDLC serial
encoding instead of asynchronous. The device used by pppd
with this option must have sync support. Currently supports
Microgate SyncLink <br>
adapters under Linux and FreeBSD 2.2.8 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unit num <br>
Sets the ppp unit number (for a ppp0 or ppp1 etc interface
name) for outbound connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">updetach <br>
With this option, pppd will detach from its controlling
terminal once it has successfully established the ppp
connection (to the point where the first network control
pro&acirc; <br>
tocol, usually the IP control protocol, has come up).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usehostname <br>
Enforce the use of the hostname (with domain name appended,
if given) as the name of the local system for authentication
purposes (overrides the name option). This option <br>
is not normally needed since the name option is
privileged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usepeerdns <br>
Ask the peer for up to 2 DNS server addresses. The addresses
supplied by the peer (if any) are passed to the
/etc/ppp/ip-up script in the environment variables DNS1 and
<br>
DNS2, and the environment variable USEPEERDNS will be set to
1. In addition, pppd will create an /var/run/ppp/resolv.conf
file containing one or two nameserver lines with <br>
the address(es) supplied by the peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user name <br>
Sets the name used for authenticating the local system to
the peer to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vj-max-slots n <br>
Sets the number of connection slots to be used by the Van
Jacobson TCP/IP header compression and decompression code to
n, which must be between 2 and 16 (inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">welcome script <br>
Run the executable or shell command specified by script
before initiating PPP negotiation, after the connect script
(if any) has completed. A value for this option from a <br>
privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xonxoff <br>
Use software flow control (i.e. XON/XOFF) to control the
flow of data on the serial port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FILES <br>
Options can be taken from files as well as the command line.
Pppd reads options from the files /etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc
and /etc/ppp/options.ttyname (in that order) before <br>
processing the options on the command line. (In fact, the
command-line options are scanned to find the terminal name
before the options.ttyname file is read.) In forming the
<br>
name of the options.ttyname file, the initial /dev/ is
removed from the terminal name, and any remaining /
characters are replaced with dots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An options file is parsed into a
series of words, delimited by whitespace. Whitespace can be
included in a word by enclosing the word in double-quotes
(&quot;). A backslash ( <br>
quotes the following character. A hash (#) starts a comment,
which continues until the end of the line. There is no
restriction on using the file or call options within an <br>
options file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
pppd provides system administrators with sufficient access
control that PPP access to a server machine can be provided
to legitimate users without fear of compromising the
secu&acirc; <br>
rity of the server or the network it&rsquo;s on. This
control is provided through restrictions on which IP
addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated
identity (if any), <br>
and through restrictions on which options a non-privileged
user may use. Several of pppd&rsquo;s options are
privileged, in particular those which permit potentially
insecure configu&acirc; <br>
rations; these options are only accepted in files which are
under the control of the system administrator, or if pppd is
being run by root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour of pppd is
to allow an unauthenticated peer to use a given IP address
only if the system does not already have a route to that IP
address. For example, a <br>
system with a permanent connection to the wider internet
will normally have a default route, and thus all peers will
have to authenticate themselves in order to set up a
connec&acirc; <br>
tion. On such a system, the auth option is the default. On
the other hand, a system where the PPP link is the only
connection to the internet will not normally have a default
<br>
route, so the peer will be able to use almost any IP address
without authenticating itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As indicated above, some
security-sensitive options are privileged, which means that
they may not be used by an ordinary non-privileged user
running a setuid-root pppd, either on <br>
the command line, in the user&rsquo;s ~/.ppprc file, or in
an options file read using the file option. Privileged
options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or in an
options file <br>
read using the call option. If pppd is being run by the root
user, privileged options can be used without
restriction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When opening the device, pppd
uses either the invoking user&rsquo;s user ID or the root
UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was
specified by the user or the system <br>
administrator. If the device name comes from a privileged
source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an options file read
using the call option, pppd uses full root privileges when
<br>
opening the device. Thus, by creating an appropriate file
under /etc/ppp/peers, the system administrator can allow
users to establish a ppp connection via a device which they
<br>
would not normally have permission to access. Otherwise pppd
uses the invoking user&rsquo;s real UID when opening the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the
other of its identity. This involves the first peer sending
its name to the other, together with some kind of secret
<br>
information which could only come from the genuine
authorized user of that name. In such an exchange, we will
call the first peer the &quot;client&quot; and the other the
&quot;server&quot;. The <br>
client has a name by which it identifies itself to the
server, and the server also has a name by which it
identifies itself to the client. Generally the genuine
client shares <br>
some secret (or password) with the server, and authenticates
itself by proving that it knows that secret. Very often, the
names used for authentication correspond to the inter&acirc;
<br>
net hostnames of the peers, but this is not essential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At present, pppd supports three
authentication protocols: the Password Authentication
Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
(CHAP), and Extensible Authenti&acirc; <br>
cation Protocol (EAP). PAP involves the client sending its
name and a cleartext password to the server to authenticate
itself. In contrast, the server initiates the CHAP <br>
authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client
(the challenge packet includes the server&rsquo;s name). The
client must respond with a response which includes its name
<br>
plus a hash value derived from the shared secret and the
challenge, in order to prove that it knows the secret. EAP
supports CHAP-style authentication, and also includes the
<br>
SRP-SHA1 mechanism, which is resistant to dictionary-based
attacks and does not require a cleartext password on the
server side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PPP protocol, being
symmetrical, allows both peers to require the other to
authenticate itself. In that case, two separate and
independent authentication exchanges will <br>
occur. The two exchanges could use different authentication
protocols, and in principle, different names could be used
in the two exchanges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour of pppd is
to agree to authenticate if requested, and to not require
authentication from the peer. However, pppd will not agree
to authenticate itself with <br>
a particular protocol if it has no secrets which could be
used to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pppd stores secrets for use in
authentication in secrets files (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for
PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for CHAP, MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, and
EAP MD5-Challenge, and <br>
/etc/ppp/srp-secrets for EAP SRP-SHA1). All secrets files
have the same format. The secrets files can contain secrets
for pppd to use in authenticating itself to other systems,
<br>
as well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating other
systems to itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in a secrets file
contains one secret. A given secret is specific to a
particular combination of client and server - it can only be
used by that client to authenticate <br>
itself to that server. Thus each line in a secrets file has
at least 3 fields: the name of the client, the name of the
server, and the secret. These fields may be followed by a
<br>
list of the IP addresses that the specified client may use
when connecting to the specified server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A secrets file is parsed into
words as for a options file, so the client name, server name
and secrets fields must each be one word, with any embedded
spaces or other special <br>
characters quoted or escaped. Note that case is significant
in the client and server names and in the secret.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the secret starts with an
&lsquo;@&rsquo;, what follows is assumed to be the name of a
file from which to read the secret. A &quot;*&quot; as the
client or server name matches any name. When <br>
selecting a secret, pppd takes the best match, i.e. the
match with the fewest wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any following words on the same
line are taken to be a list of acceptable IP addresses for
that client. If there are only 3 words on the line, or if
the first word is &quot;-&quot;, then <br>
all IP addresses are disallowed. To allow any address, use
&quot;*&quot;. A word starting with &quot;!&quot; indicates
that the specified address is not acceptable. An address may
be followed by <br>
&quot;/&quot; and a number n, to indicate a whole subnet,
i.e. all addresses which have the same value in the most
significant n bits. In this form, the address may be
followed by a plus <br>
sign (&quot;+&quot;) to indicate that one address from the
subnet is authorized, based on the ppp network interface
unit number in use. In this case, the host part of the
address will be <br>
set to the unit number plus one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus a secrets file contains
both secrets for use in authenticating other hosts, plus
secrets which we use for authenticating ourselves to others.
When pppd is authenticating <br>
the peer (checking the peer&rsquo;s identity), it chooses a
secret with the peer&rsquo;s name in the first field and the
name of the local system in the second field. The name of
the local <br>
system defaults to the hostname, with the domain name
appended if the domain option is used. This default can be
overridden with the name option, except when the usehostname
<br>
option is used. (For EAP SRP-SHA1, see the srp-entry(8)
utility for generating proper validator entries to be used
in the &quot;secret&quot; field.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When pppd is choosing a secret
to use in authenticating itself to the peer, it first
determines what name it is going to use to identify itself
to the peer. This name can be <br>
specified by the user with the user option. If this option
is not used, the name defaults to the name of the local
system, determined as described in the previous paragraph.
<br>
Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in the first
field and the peer&rsquo;s name in the second field. Pppd
will know the name of the peer if CHAP or EAP authentication
is <br>
being used, because the peer will have sent it in the
challenge packet. However, if PAP is being used, pppd will
have to determine the peer&rsquo;s name from the options
specified by <br>
the user. The user can specify the peer&rsquo;s name
directly with the remotename option. Otherwise, if the
remote IP address was specified by a name (rather than in
numeric form), <br>
that name will be used as the peer&rsquo;s name. Failing
that, pppd will use the null string as the peer&rsquo;s
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When authenticating the peer
with PAP, the supplied password is first compared with the
secret from the secrets file. If the password doesn&rsquo;t
match the secret, the password is <br>
encrypted using crypt() and checked against the secret
again. Thus secrets for authenticating the peer can be
stored in encrypted form if desired. If the papcrypt option
is <br>
given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is omitted, for
better security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, if the login option
was specified, the username and password are also checked
against the system password database. Thus, the system
administrator can set up the <br>
pap-secrets file to allow PPP access only to certain users,
and to restrict the set of IP addresses that each user can
use. Typically, when using the login option, the secret in
<br>
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be &quot;&quot;, which will match
any password supplied by the peer. This avoids the need to
have the same secret in two places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authentication must be
satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or any other Network
Control Protocol) can be started. If the peer is required to
authenticate itself, and fails to <br>
do so, pppd will terminated the link (by closing LCP). If
IPCP negotiates an unacceptable IP address for the remote
host, IPCP will be closed. IP packets can only be sent or
<br>
received when IPCP is open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases it is desirable to
allow some hosts which can&rsquo;t authenticate themselves
to connect and use one of a restricted set of IP addresses,
even when the local host gener&acirc; <br>
ally requires authentication. If the peer refuses to
authenticate itself when requested, pppd takes that as
equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string
for the <br>
username and password. Thus, by adding a line to the
pap-secrets file which specifies the empty string for the
client and password, it is possible to allow restricted
access to <br>
hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROUTING <br>
When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will
inform the kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for
the ppp interface. This is sufficient to create a host <br>
route to the remote end of the link, which will enable the
peers to exchange IP packets. Communication with other
machines generally requires further modification to routing
<br>
tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables. In
most cases the defaultroute and/or proxyarp options are
sufficient for this, but in some cases further intervention
is <br>
required. The /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be used for
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is desirable to add
a default route through the remote host, as in the case of a
machine whose only connection to the Internet is through the
ppp interface. The <br>
defaultroute option causes pppd to create such a default
route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the link is
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases it is desirable to
use proxy ARP, for example on a server machine connected to
a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to communicate with the
remote host. The prox&acirc; <br>
yarp option causes pppd to look for a network interface on
the same subnet as the remote host (an interface supporting
broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a point-to-point or
<br>
loopback interface). If found, pppd creates a permanent,
published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host
and the hardware address of the network interface found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the demand option is used,
the interface IP addresses have already been set at the
point when IPCP comes up. If pppd has not been able to
negotiate the same addresses that <br>
it used to configure the interface (for example when the
peer is an ISP that uses dynamic IP address assignment),
pppd has to change the interface IP addresses to the
negotiated <br>
addresses. This may disrupt existing connections, and the
use of demand dialling with peers that do dynamic IP address
assignment is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTILINK <br>
Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more
PPP links between a pair of machines into a single
&lsquo;bundle&rsquo;, which appears as a single virtual PPP
link which has the <br>
combined bandwidth of the individual links. Currently,
multilink PPP is only supported under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pppd detects that the link it is
controlling is connected to the same peer as another link
using the peer&rsquo;s endpoint discriminator and the
authenticated identity of the peer (if <br>
it authenticates itself). The endpoint discriminator is a
block of data which is hopefully unique for each peer.
Several types of data can be used, including
locally-assigned <br>
strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC addresses, randomly
strings of bytes, or E-164 phone numbers. The endpoint
discriminator sent to the peer by pppd can be set using the
end&acirc; <br>
point option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some circumstances the peer
may send no endpoint discriminator or a non-unique value.
The bundle option adds an extra string which is added to the
peer&rsquo;s endpoint discrimina&acirc; <br>
tor and authenticated identity when matching up links to be
joined together in a bundle. The bundle option can also be
used to allow the establishment of multiple bundles <br>
between the local system and the peer. Pppd uses a TDB
database in /var/run/pppd2.tdb to match up links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming that multilink is
enabled and the peer is willing to negotiate multilink, then
when pppd is invoked to bring up the first link to the peer,
it will detect that no other <br>
link is connected to the peer and create a new bundle, that
is, another ppp network interface unit. When another pppd is
invoked to bring up another link to the peer, it will <br>
detect the existing bundle and join its link to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first link terminates
(for example, because of a hangup or a received LCP
terminate-request) the bundle is not destroyed unless there
are no other links remaining in the <br>
bundle. Rather than exiting, the first pppd keeps running
after its link terminates, until all the links in the bundle
have terminated. If the first pppd receives a SIGTERM or
<br>
SIGINT signal, it will destroy the bundle and send a SIGHUP
to the pppd processes for each of the links in the bundle.
If the first pppd receives a SIGHUP signal, it will
termi&acirc; <br>
nate its link but not the bundle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: demand mode is not
currently supported with multilink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file
contains the auth option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options
file in the ppp distribution).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Probably the most common use of
pppd is to dial out to an ISP. This can be done with a
command such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pppd call isp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp
file is set up by the system administrator to contain
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttyS0 19200 crtscts <br>
connect &rsquo;/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp&rsquo;
<br>
noauth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, we are using
chat to dial the ISP&rsquo;s modem and go through any logon
sequence required. The /etc/ppp/chat-isp file contains the
script used by chat; it could for <br>
example contain something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot;
<br>
ABORT &quot;NO DIALTONE&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;ERROR&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;NO ANSWER&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;BUSY&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;Username/Password Incorrect&quot; <br>
&quot;&quot; &quot;at&quot; <br>
OK &quot;at&amp;d0&amp;c1&quot; <br>
OK &quot;atdt2468135&quot; <br>
&quot;name:&quot; &quot;^Umyuserid&quot; <br>
&quot;word:&quot; &quot;qmypassword&quot; <br>
&quot;ispts&quot; &quot;q^Uppp&quot; <br>
&quot;~-^Uppp-~&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the chat(8) man page for
details of chat scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pppd can also be used to provide
a dial-in ppp service for users. If the users already have
login accounts, the simplest way to set up the ppp service
is to let the users log in <br>
to their accounts and run pppd (installed setuid-root) with
a command such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pppd proxyarp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To allow a user to use the PPP
facilities, you need to allocate an IP address for that
user&rsquo;s machine and create an entry in
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets, or <br>
/etc/ppp/srp-secrets (depending on which authentication
method the PPP implementation on the user&rsquo;s machine
supports), so that the user&rsquo;s machine can authenticate
itself. For <br>
example, if Joe has a machine called &quot;joespc&quot; that
is to be allowed to dial in to the machine called
&quot;server&quot; and use the IP address joespc.my.net, you
would add an entry like <br>
this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">joespc server &quot;joe&rsquo;s
secret&quot; joespc.my.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(See srp-entry(8) for a means to
generate the server&rsquo;s entry when SRP-SHA1 is in use.)
Alternatively, you can create a username called (for
example) &quot;ppp&quot;, whose login shell is <br>
pppd and whose home directory is /etc/ppp. Options to be
used when pppd is run this way can be put in
/etc/ppp/.ppprc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your serial connection is any
more complicated than a piece of wire, you may need to
arrange for some control characters to be escaped. In
particular, it is often useful to <br>
escape XON (^Q) and XOFF (^S), using asyncmap a0000. If the
path includes a telnet, you probably should escape ^] as
well (asyncmap 200a0000). If the path includes an rlogin,
<br>
you will need to use the escape ff option on the end which
is running the rlogin client, since many rlogin
implementations are not transparent; they will remove the
sequence <br>
[0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes] from the
stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility
LOG_DAEMON. (This can be overridden by recompiling pppd with
the macro LOG_PPP defined as the desired facility.) See the
<br>
syslog(8) documentation for details of where the syslog
daemon will write the messages. On most systems, the syslog
daemon uses the /etc/syslog.conf file to specify the
destina&acirc; <br>
tion(s) for syslog messages. You may need to edit that file
to suit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debug option causes the
contents of all control packets sent or received to be
logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP, EAP, or IPCP packets.
This can be useful if the PPP nego&acirc; <br>
tiation does not succeed or if authentication fails. If
debugging is enabled at compile time, the debug option also
causes other debugging messages to be logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging can also be enabled or
disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the pppd process.
This signal acts as a toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of pppd is set to indicate whether any error
was detected, or the reason for the link being terminated.
The values used are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Pppd has detached, or
otherwise the connection was successfully established and
terminated at the peer&rsquo;s request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 An immediately fatal error of
some kind occurred, such as an essential system call
failing, or running out of virtual memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 An error was detected in
processing the options given, such as two mutually exclusive
options being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Pppd is not setuid-root and
the invoking user is not root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 The kernel does not support
PPP, for example, the PPP kernel driver is not included or
cannot be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Pppd terminated because it was
sent a SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 The serial port could not be
locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 The serial port could not be
opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 The connect script failed
(returned a non-zero exit status).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 The command specified as the
argument to the pty option could not be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 The PPP negotiation failed,
that is, it didn&rsquo;t reach the point where at least one
network protocol (e.g. IP) was running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 The peer system failed (or
refused) to authenticate itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 The link was established
successfully and terminated because it was idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">13 The link was established
successfully and terminated because the connect time limit
was reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14 Callback was negotiated and
an incoming call should arrive shortly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15 The link was terminated
because the peer is not responding to echo requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 The link was terminated by
the modem hanging up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17 The PPP negotiation failed
because serial loopback was detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">18 The init script failed
(returned a non-zero exit status).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">19 We failed to authenticate
ourselves to the peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPTS <br>
Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing
which can be used to perform site-specific ancillary
processing. These scripts are usually shell scripts, but
could be <br>
executable code files instead. Pppd does not wait for the
scripts to finish (except for the ip-pre-up script). The
scripts are executed as root (with the real and effective
<br>
user-id set to 0), so that they can do things such as update
routing tables or run privileged daemons. Be careful that
the contents of these scripts do not compromise your
sys&acirc; <br>
tem&rsquo;s security. Pppd runs the scripts with standard
input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an
environment that is empty except for some environment
variables <br>
that give information about the link. The environment
variables that pppd sets are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE The name of the serial
tty device being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IFNAME The name of the network
interface being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPLOCAL <br>
The IP address for the local end of the link. This is only
set when IPCP has come up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPREMOTE <br>
The IP address for the remote end of the link. This is only
set when IPCP has come up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PEERNAME <br>
The authenticated name of the peer. This is only set if the
peer authenticates itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPEED The baud rate of the tty
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORIG_UID <br>
The real user-id of the user who invoked pppd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PPPLOGNAME <br>
The username of the real user-id that invoked pppd. This is
always set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the ip-down and auth-down
scripts, pppd also sets the following variables giving
statistics for the connection:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECT_TIME <br>
The number of seconds from when the PPP negotiation started
until the connection was terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BYTES_SENT <br>
The number of bytes sent (at the level of the serial port)
during the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BYTES_RCVD <br>
The number of bytes received (at the level of the serial
port) during the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINKNAME <br>
The logical name of the link, set with the linkname
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNS1 If the peer supplies DNS
server addresses, this variable is set to the first DNS
server address supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNS2 If the peer supplies DNS
server addresses, this variable is set to the second DNS
server address supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pppd invokes the following
scripts, if they exist. It is not an error if they
don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/auth-up <br>
A program or script which is executed after the remote
system successfully authenticates itself. It is executed
with the parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface-name peer-name
user-name tty-device speed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this script is not
executed if the peer doesn&rsquo;t authenticate itself, for
example when the noauth option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/auth-down <br>
A program or script which is executed when the link goes
down, if /etc/ppp/auth-up was previously executed. It is
executed in the same manner with the same parameters as <br>
/etc/ppp/auth-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ip-pre-up <br>
A program or script which is executed just before the ppp
network interface is brought up. It is executed with the
same parameters as the ip-up script (below). At this <br>
point the interface exists and has IP addresses assigned but
is still down. This can be used to add firewall rules before
any IP traffic can pass through the interface. <br>
Pppd will wait for this script to finish before bringing the
interface up, so this script should run quickly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ip-up <br>
A program or script which is executed when the link is
available for sending and receiving IP packets (that is,
IPCP has come up). It is executed with the parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface-name tty-device speed
local-IP-address remote-IP-address ipparam</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ip-down <br>
A program or script which is executed when the link is no
longer available for sending and receiving IP packets. This
script can be used for undoing the effects of the <br>
/etc/ppp/ip-up and /etc/ppp/ip-pre-up scripts. It is invoked
in the same manner and with the same parameters as the ip-up
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ipv6-up <br>
Like /etc/ppp/ip-up, except that it is executed when the
link is available for sending and receiving IPv6 packets. It
is executed with the parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface-name tty-device speed
local-link-local-address remote-link-local-address
ipparam</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ipv6-down <br>
Similar to /etc/ppp/ip-down, but it is executed when IPv6
packets can no longer be transmitted on the link. It is
executed with the same parameters as the ipv6-up script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/ipx-up <br>
A program or script which is executed when the link is
available for sending and receiving IPX packets (that is,
IPXCP has come up). It is executed with the parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface-name tty-device speed

/etc/ppp/ipx-up script. It is invoked in the same manner and
with the same parameters as the ipx-up script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/run/pppn.pid (BSD or Linux), /etc/ppp/pppn.pid (others)
<br>
Process-ID for pppd process on ppp interface unit n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/ppp-name.pid (BSD or
Linux), <br>
/etc/ppp/ppp-name.pid (others) Process-ID for pppd process
for logical link name (see the linkname option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/pppd2.tdb <br>
Database containing information about pppd processes,
interfaces and links, used for matching links to bundles in
multilink operation. May be examined by external pro&acirc;
<br>
grams to obtain information about running pppd instances,
the interfaces and devices they are using, IP address
assignments, etc. /etc/ppp/pap-secrets Usernames,
pass&acirc; <br>
words and IP addresses for PAP authentication. This file
should be owned by root and not readable or writable by any
other user. Pppd will log a warning if this is not <br>
the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/chap-secrets <br>
Names, secrets and IP addresses for CHAP/MS-CHAP/MS-CHAPv2
authentication. As for /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, this file
should be owned by root and not readable or writable by <br>
any other user. Pppd will log a warning if this is not the
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/srp-secrets <br>
Names, secrets, and IP addresses for EAP authentication. As
for /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, this file should be owned by root
and not readable or writable by any other user. <br>
Pppd will log a warning if this is not the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ppp_pseudonym <br>
Saved client-side SRP-SHA1 pseudonym. See the
srp-use-pseudonym option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/options <br>
System default options for pppd, read before user default
options or command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ppprc <br>
User default options, read before
/etc/ppp/options.ttyname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/options.ttyname <br>
System default options for the serial port being used, read
after ~/.ppprc. In forming the ttyname part of this
filename, an initial /dev/ is stripped from the port name
<br>
(if present), and any slashes in the remaining part are
converted to dots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/peers <br>
A directory containing options files which may contain
privileged options, even if pppd was invoked by a user other
than root. The system administrator can create options <br>
files in this directory to permit non-privileged users to
dial out without requiring the peer to authenticate, but
only to certain trusted peers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Some limited degree of control can be exercised over a
running pppd process by sending it a signal from the list
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT, SIGTERM <br>
These signals cause pppd to terminate the link (by closing
LCP), restore the serial device settings, and exit. If a
connector or disconnector process is currently run&acirc;
<br>
ning, pppd will send the same signal to its process group,
so as to terminate the connector or disconnector
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP This signal causes pppd
to terminate the link, restore the serial device settings,
and close the serial device. If the persist or demand option
has been specified, pppd <br>
will try to reopen the serial device and start another
connection (after the holdoff period). Otherwise pppd will
exit. If this signal is received during the holdoff <br>
period, it causes pppd to end the holdoff period
immediately. If a connector or disconnector process is
running, pppd will send the same signal to its process
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
This signal toggles the state of the debug option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
This signal causes pppd to renegotiate compression. This can
be useful to re-enable compression after it has been
disabled as a result of a fatal decompression error. <br>
(Fatal decompression errors generally indicate a bug in one
or other implementation.)</p>
