<p>YPXFR(8) NIS Reference Manual YPXFR(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ypxfr - transfer NIS database from remote server to local
host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/lib/yp/ypxfr [-f] [-c] [-d target domain] [-h source
host] [-s source domain] [-C taskid program-number ipaddr
port] [-p yp_path] mapname...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ypxfr copies an NIS database from one NIS server to the
local host by using the NIS service. ypxfr is generally
invoked by ypinit or by ypserv, when ypserv receives a map
<br>
transfer request from yppush. It creates a temporary map in
the directory /var/yp/domain (this directory must already
exist; domain is the default domainname for the local <br>
host), fills it by getting the map&Acirc;&acute;s entries
and fetches the map parameters (master and order number). If
the transfer was successful, the old version of the map will
be deleted <br>
and the temporary copy will be moved into its place. Then,
ypxfr will attempt to send a &quot;clear current map&quot;
request to the local ypserv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If run interactively, ypxfr
writes its output to stderr. However, if it is invoked
without a controlling terminal, it will log the output to
syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ypxfr is used primarily in
environments where several NIS servers are in use. For all
maps, you have a NIS master server, which maintains a
canonical copy of the NIS map, and all <br>
the other servers, the NIS slaves, copy the new version of
the map from the master whenever a update was made.
Normally, you have one NIS master for all maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to maintain consistency
across all NIS servers, ypxfr can be run periodically in a
cron job. Maps which change infrequently need only be
updated once a day (preferably <br>
late at night when system usage is lowest), where those with
frequent changes (such as passwd.byname and passwd.byuid )
should be updated perhaps once every hour. Examples are in
<br>
/usr/lib/yp: ypxfr_1perday, ypxfr_2perday, and
ypxfr_1perhour. They can serve as reasonable first cuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally all updates should be
propagated by yppush when /var/yp/Makefile is run on the NIS
master server, however it is a good practice on large
networks where possible outages <br>
could cause NIS slaves to fall out of sync with the
master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Force a map transfer. Normally, ypxfr will not transfer a
map if it determines that the NIS master&Acirc;&acute;s copy
is not newer than the existing copy already on the local
host. This <br>
flag forces a transfer regardless of which
server&Acirc;&acute;s version is more recent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Do not send a &quot;clear current map&quot; request to the
ypserv process running on the local host. This flag is
normally used when invoking ypxfr by ypinit or if ypserv is
not <br>
running locally at the time you are running ypxfr.
Otherwise, ypxfr will complain that it cannot talk to the
local ypserv, and the transfer will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d domain <br>
Specify a domain other than the default NIS domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h source host <br>
Get the map from host, regardless of what the map says the
master is. If host is not specified, ypxfr asks the NIS
service for the name of the master, and tries to get the
<br>
map from there. This option is used to insure that ypxfr
only copies maps from the NIS master server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s source domain <br>
Specify a source domain from which to transfer a map that
should be the same across domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C taskid progam-number ipaddr
port <br>
This option is only for use by ypserv . When ypserv invokes
ypxfr, it specifies that ypxfr should call back a yppush
process at the host with IP address ipaddr, registered <br>
as program number progam-number, listening on port port, and
waiting for a response to transaction taskid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p yp_path <br>
Change the directory for the maps to yp_path/[domainname]/,
the default is /var/yp/[domainname].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mapname <br>
One or more names of the map to transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/yp/[domainname]/[maps]</p>
