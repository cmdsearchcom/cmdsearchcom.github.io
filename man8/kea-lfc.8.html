<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kea-lfc - Lease File Cleanup process in Kea</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kea-lfc [-4|-6] [-c config-file] [-p pid-file] [-x
previous-file] [-i copy-file] [-o output-file] [-f
finish-file] [-v] [-V] [-W] [-d] [-h]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The kea-lfc service process removes redundant information
from the files used to provide persistent storage for the
memfile data base backend. The service is written to run as
a <br>
stand alone process. While it can be started externally,
there is usually no need to do this. It will be run on a
periodic basis by the Kea DHCP servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
The arguments are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
Verbose mode sets the logging level to debug. This is
primarily for development purposes in stand-alone mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
version causes the version stamp to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Version causes a longer form of the version stamp to be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W <br>
Display the configuration report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Help causes the usage string to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 | -6 <br>
The protocol version of the lease files, must be one of 4 or
6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Configuration file including the configuration for kea-lfc
process. It may also contain configuration entries for other
Kea services. Currently kea-lfc gets all of its <br>
arguments from the command line, in the future it will be
extended to get some arguments from the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
PID file - When the kea-lfc process starts it attempts to
determine if another instance of the process is already
running by examining the pid file. If one is already running
<br>
the new process is terminated. If one isn&rsquo;t running it
writes its pid into the pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
Previous or ex lease file - When kea-lfc starts this is the
result of any previous run of kea-lfc. When kea-lfc finishes
it is the result of this run. If kea-lfc is <br>
interrupted before completing, this file may not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Input or copy of lease file - Before the DHCP server invokes
kea-lfc it will move the current lease file here and then
call kea-lfc with this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o <br>
Output lease file - The temporary file kea-lfc should use to
write the leases. Upon completion of writing this this file
it will be moved to the finish file (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Finish or completion file - Another temporary file kea-lfc
uses for bookkeeping. When kea-lfc completes writing the
output file it moves it to this file name. After kea-lfc
<br>
finishes deleting the other files (previous and input) it
moves this file to previous lease file. By moving the files
in this fashion the kea-lfc and the DHCP server <br>
processes can determine the correct file to use even if one
of the processes was interrupted before completing its
task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOCUMENTATION <br>
Kea comes with an extensive Kea User&rsquo;s Guide
documentation that covers all aspects of running the Kea
software - compilation, installation, configuration,
configuration examples <br>
and many more. Kea also features a Kea Messages Manual,
which lists all possible messages Kea can print with a brief
description for each of them. Both documents are typically
<br>
available in various formats (txt, html, pdf) with your Kea
distribution. The on-line version is available at
http://kea.isc.org/docs/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kea source code is documented in
the Kea Developer&rsquo;s Guide. It&rsquo;s on-line version
is available at http://kea.isc.org. Please follow
Developer&rsquo;s Guide link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kea project website is available
at: http://kea.isc.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT <br>
There are two mailing lists available for Kea project.
kea-users (kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea
users, while kea-dev (kea-dev at lists.isc.org) is intended
for <br>
Kea developers, prospective contributors and other advanced
users. Both lists are available at http://lists.isc.org. The
community provides best effort type of support on both of
<br>
those lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ISC provides professional
support for Kea services. See https://www.isc.org/kea/ for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The kea-lfc process was first coded in January 2015 by the
ISC Kea/DHCP team.</p>
