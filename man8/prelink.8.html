prelink - prelink ELF shared libraries and binaries to speed up startup time
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
prelink [OPTION...]&#x00A0;[FILES]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>prelink</b> is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF
  dynamically linked binaries in such a way that the time needed for the dynamic
  linker to perform relocations at startup significantly decreases. Due to fewer
  relocations, the run-time memory consumption decreases as well (especially the
  number of unshareable pages). The prelinking information is only used at
  startup time if none of the dependent libraries have changed since prelinking;
  otherwise programs are relocated normally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>prelink</b> first collects ELF binaries to be prelinked and all the ELF
  shared libraries they depend on. Then it assigns a unique virtual address
  space slot to each library and relinks the shared library to that base
  address. When the dynamic linker attempts to load such a library, unless that
  virtual address space slot is already occupied, it maps the library into the
  given slot. After this is done, <b>prelink</b>, with the help of dynamic
  linker, resolves all relocations in the binary or library against its
  dependent libraries and stores the relocations into the ELF object. It also
  stores a list of all dependent libraries together with their checksums into
  the binary or library. For binaries, it also computes a list of
  <i>conflicts</i> (relocations that resolve differently in the binary's symbol
  search scope than in the smaller search scope in which the dependent library
  was resolved) and stores it into a special ELF section.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At runtime, the dynamic linker first checks whether all dependent libraries were
  successfully mapped into their designated address space slots, and whether
  they have not changed since the prelinking was done. If all checks are
  successful, the dynamic linker just replays the list of conflicts (which is
  usually significantly shorter than total number of relocations) instead of
  relocating each library.

      <b>prelink</b> sees a binary during incremental prelinking which puts
      together two libraries which were not present together in any other binary

Command-line arguments should be either directory hierarchies (in which case
  <i>-l</i> and <i>-h</i> options apply), or particular ELF binaries or shared
  libraries. Specifying a shared library explicitly on the command line causes
  it to be prelinked even if no binary is linked against it. Otherwise, binaries
  are collected together and only the libraries they depend on are prelinked
  with them.
