<p>prelink(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual prelink(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
prelink - prelink ELF shared libraries and binaries to speed
up startup time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
prelink [OPTION...] [FILES]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
prelink is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and
ELF dynamically linked binaries in such a way that the time
needed for the dynamic linker to perform relocations at <br>
startup significantly decreases. Due to fewer relocations,
the run-time memory consumption decreases as well
(especially the number of unshareable pages). The prelinking
infor&acirc; <br>
mation is only used at startup time if none of the dependent
libraries have changed since prelinking; otherwise programs
are relocated normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prelink first collects ELF
binaries to be prelinked and all the ELF shared libraries
they depend on. Then it assigns a unique virtual address
space slot to each library and <br>
relinks the shared library to that base address. When the
dynamic linker attempts to load such a library, unless that
virtual address space slot is already occupied, it maps the
<br>
library into the given slot. After this is done, prelink,
with the help of dynamic linker, resolves all relocations in
the binary or library against its dependent libraries and
<br>
stores the relocations into the ELF object. It also stores a
list of all dependent libraries together with their
checksums into the binary or library. For binaries, it also
<br>
computes a list of conflicts (relocations that resolve
differently in the binary&rsquo;s symbol search scope than
in the smaller search scope in which the dependent library
was <br>
resolved) and stores it into a special ELF section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At runtime, the dynamic linker
first checks whether all dependent libraries were
successfully mapped into their designated address space
slots, and whether they have not changed <br>
since the prelinking was done. If all checks are successful,
the dynamic linker just replays the list of conflicts (which
is usually significantly shorter than total number of <br>
relocations) instead of relocating each library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v --verbose <br>
Verbose mode. Print the virtual address slots assigned to
libraries and what binary or library is currently being
prelinked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n --dry-run <br>
Don&rsquo;t actually prelink anything; just collect the
binaries/libraries, assign them addresses, and with -v print
what would be prelinked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a --all <br>
Prelink all binaries and dependent libraries found in
directory hierarchies specified in /etc/prelink.conf.
Normally, only binaries specified on the command line and
<br>
their dependent libraries are prelinked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m --conserve-memory <br>
When assigning addresses to libraries, allow overlap of
address space slots provided that the two libraries are not
present together in any of the binaries or libraries. <br>
This results in a smaller virtual address space range used
for libraries. On the other hand, if prelink sees a binary
during incremental prelinking which puts together <br>
two libraries which were not present together in any other
binary and were given the same virtual address space slots,
then the binary cannot be prelinked. Without this <br>
option, each library is assigned a unique virtual address
space slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R --random <br>
When assigning addresses to libraries, start with a random
address within the architecture-dependent virtual address
space range. This can make some buffer overflow <br>
attacks slightly harder to exploit, because libraries are
not present on the same addresses across different machines.
Normally, assigning virtual addresses starts at the <br>
bottom of the architecture-dependent range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r --reloc-only=ADDRESS <br>
Instead of prelinking, just relink given shared libraries to
the specified base address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N --no-update-cache <br>
Don&rsquo;t save the cache file after prelinking. Normally,
the list of libraries (and with -m binaries also) is stored
into the /etc/prelink.cache file together with their <br>
given address space slots and dependencies, so the cache can
be used during incremental prelinking (prelinking without -a
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --config-file=CONFIG <br>
Specify an alternate config file instead of default
/etc/prelink.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C --cache-file=CACHE <br>
Specify an alternate cache file instead of default
/etc/prelink.cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --force <br>
Force re-prelinking even for already prelinked objects whose
dependencies are unchanged. This option causes new virtual
address space slots to be assigned to all <br>
libraries. Normally, only binaries or libraries which are
either not prelinked yet, or whose dependencies have
changed, are prelinked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quick <br>
Run prelink in quick mode. This mode checks just mtime and
ctime timestamps of libraries and binaries stored in the
cache file. If they are unchanged from the last pre&acirc;
<br>
link run, it is assumed that the library in question did not
change, without parsing or verifying its ELF headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --print-cache <br>
Print the contents of the cache file (normally
/etc/prelink.cache) and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dynamic-linker=LDSO <br>
Specify an alternate dynamic linker instead of the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ld-library-path=PATH <br>
Specify a special LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be used when prelink
queries the dynamic linker about symbol resolution
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--layout-page-size=SIZE <br>
Layout start of libraries at given boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--libs-only <br>
Only prelink ELF shared libraries, don&rsquo;t prelink any
binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --dereference <br>
When processing command line directory arguments, follow
symbolic links when walking directory hierarchies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l --one-file-system <br>
When processing command line directory arguments, limit
directory tree walk to a single file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u --undo <br>
Revert binaries and libraries to their original content
before they were prelinked. Without the -a option, this
causes only the binaries and libraries specified on the <br>
command line to be reverted to their original state (and
e.g. not their dependencies). If used together with the -a
option, all binaries and libraries from command line, <br>
all their dependencies, all binaries found in directories
specified on command line and in the config file, and all
their dependencies are undone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y --verify <br>
Verifies a prelinked binary or library. This option can be
used only on a single binary or library. It first applies an
--undo operation on the file, then prelinks just <br>
that file again and compares this with the original file. If
both are identical, it prints the file after --undo
operation on standard output and exits with zero status.
<br>
Otherwise it exits with error status. Thus if --verify
operation returns zero exit status and its standard output
is equal to the content of the binary or library before <br>
prelinking, you can be sure that nobody modified the
binaries or libraries after prelinking. Similarly with
message digests and checksums (unless you trigger the
improba&acirc; <br>
ble case of modified file and original file having the same
digest or checksum).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--md5 This is similar to
--verify option, except instead of outputting the content of
the binary or library before prelinking to standard output,
MD5 digest is printed. See <br>
md5sum(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sha This is similar to
--verify option, except instead of outputting the content of
the binary or library before prelinking to standard output,
SHA1 digest is printed. See <br>
sha1sum(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exec-shield --no-exec-shield
<br>
On IA-32, if the kernel supports Exec-Shield, prelink
attempts to lay libraries out similarly to how the kernel
places them (i.e. if possible below the binary, most widely
<br>
used into the ASCII armor zone). These switches allow
overriding prelink detection of whether Exec-Shield is
supported or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b --black-list=PATH <br>
This option allows blacklisting certain paths, libraries or
binaries. Prelink will not touch them during prelinking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o --undo-output=FILE <br>
When performing an --undo operation, don&rsquo;t overwrite
the prelinked binary or library with its original content
(before it was prelinked), but save that into the specified
<br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V --version <br>
Print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? --help <br>
Print short help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Print short usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
Command-line arguments should be either directory
hierarchies (in which case -l and -h options apply), or
particular ELF binaries or shared libraries. Specifying a
shared <br>
library explicitly on the command line causes it to be
prelinked even if no binary is linked against it. Otherwise,
binaries are collected together and only the libraries they
<br>
depend on are prelinked with them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
# /usr/sbin/prelink -avmR <br>
prelinks all binaries found in directories specified in
/etc/prelink.conf and all their dependent libraries,
assigning libraries unique virtual address space slots only
if they <br>
ever appear together, and starts assigning libraries at a
random address. <br>
# /usr/sbin/prelink -vm ~/bin/progx <br>
prelinks ~/bin/progx program and all its dependent libraries
(unless they were prelinked already e.g. during prelink -a
invocation). <br>
# /usr/sbin/prelink -au <br>
reverts all binaries and libraries to their original
content. <br>
# /usr/sbin/prelink -y /bin/prelinked_prog &gt;
/tmp/original_prog; echo $? verifies whether
/bin/prelinked_prog is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/prelink.cache Binary file containing a list of
prelinked libraries and/or binaries together with their
assigned virtual address space slots and dependencies. You
can run <br>
/usr/sbin/prelink -p to see what is stored in there. <br>
/etc/prelink.conf Configuration file containing a list of
directory hierarchies that contain ELF shared libraries or
binaries which should be prelinked. This configuration <br>
file is used in -a mode to find binaries which should be
prelinked and also, no matter whether -a is given or not, to
limit which dependent shared libraries <br>
should be prelinked. If prelink finds a dependent library of
some binary or other library which is not present in any of
the directories specified either in <br>
/etc/prelink.conf or on the command line, then it cannot be
prelinked. Each line of the config file should be either a
comment starting with #, or a direc&acirc; <br>
tory name, or a blacklist specification. Directory names can
be prefixed by the -l switch, meaning the tree walk of the
given directory is only limited to <br>
one file system; or the -h switch, meaning the tree walk of
the given directory follows symbolic links. A blacklist
specification should be prefixed by -b <br>
and optionally also -l or -h if needed. A blacklist entry
can be either an absolute directory name (in that case all
files in that directory hierarchy are <br>
ignored by the prelinker); an absolute filename (then that
particular library or binary is skipped); or a glob pattern
without a / character in it (then all <br>
files matching that glob in any directory are ignored). SEE
