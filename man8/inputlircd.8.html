<p>INPUTLIRCD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
INPUTLIRCD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
inputlircd &acirc; zeroconf LIRC daemon using input event
devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
inputlircd [-d socket] [-f] [-c] [-r repeat-rate] [-m
keycode] [-n device name] [-u username] device [device
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
inputlircd is a small LIRC daemon that reads from
/dev/input/eventX devices and sends the received keycodes to
connecting LIRC clients. inputlircd needs no configuration,
it uses <br>
the standardised names for the keycodes as used by the
kernel. Many USB remote controls that present HID devices,
as well as multimedia keyboards should work out of the
box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inputlircd expects a list of
input event devices as commandline parameters. It will only
read events from those devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d socket <br>
Location of the UNIX socket to which LIRC clients can
connect. The default is /var/run/lirc/lircd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Run in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Capture modifier keys. This
causes the CTRL, SHIFT, ALT and META keys to be treated as
modifer keys that, when used in combination with another
keys, change the LIRC event <br>
from that key rather than being sent as their own LIRC
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r repeat-rate <br>
Set the repeat rate (in milliseconds) of the remote control.
The default is 0. Repeated keys that arrive less than
repeat-rate milliseconds apart will be flagged as as <br>
repeat LIRC events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Grab the input device(s).
This gives inputlircd exclusive access to the input devices
and stops events from propagating any further.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m keycode <br>
Minimum keycode to send to LIRC clients. Keycodes lower than
this number are filtered out. The default is 88, this
filters out the alphanumeric section and the keypad
sec&acirc; <br>
tion of normal keyboards, but allows all extended keys. The
rationale is that clients should not be able to grab normal
keypresses, this could be a security risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n device name <br>
Name of an input device to read events from. This scans all
available input event devices, and if the symbolic name of
an event device matches device name, adds it to the <br>
list of devices to read from. The device name can contain
wildcard patterns, see glob(7). To get a list of available
devices and their names, cat /proc/bus/input/devices or <br>
use lsinput(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username <br>
Set user and group id to that of username after opening the
devices and UNIX socket as root. The default is nobody.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t path <br>
Provides the path to a file containing a mapping between
input event key names and the commands which should be
reported via lirc. The files should contain lines of the
form <br>
KEY_FOO = bar. This is useful for backward compatibility.
The default is not to use a translation table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">device <br>
One or more input event devices. If you want to use
inputlircd to process multimedia keys on the keyboard, then
/dev/input/event0 is the most likely choice. If you have
<br>
other input devices, such as USB remote controllers that act
like a HID device, then you probably need one of the other
event devices present. See /proc/bus/input/devices <br>
for a list of available input devices. If unsure, you can
add all available input event devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/run/lirc/lircd <br>
Default location of the UNIX socket to which LIRC clients
can connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/input/eventX <br>
The kernel input layer&rsquo;s event device files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/bus/input/devices <br>
List of all input devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
