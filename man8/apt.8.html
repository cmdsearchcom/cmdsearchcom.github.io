<b>apt</b> provides a high-level commandline interface for the package
  management system. It is intended as an end user interface and enables some
  options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more
  specialized APT tools like <b>apt-get</b>(8) and <b>apt-cache</b>(8).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Much like <b>apt</b> itself, its manpage is intended as an end user interface
  and as such only mentions the most used commands and options partly to not
  duplicate information in multiple places and partly to avoid overwhelming
  readers with a cornucopia of options and details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>update</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><b>update</b> is used to download package
  information from all configured sources. Other commands operate on this data
  to e.g. perform package upgrades or search in and display details about all
  packages available for installation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>upgrade</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><b>upgrade</b> is used to install available
  upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources
  configured via <b>sources.list</b>(5). New packages will be installed if
  required to statisfy dependencies, but existing packages will never be
  removed. If an upgrade for a package requires the remove of an installed
  package the upgrade for this package isn't performed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>full-upgrade</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade
  but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the
  system as a whole.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>install</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>purge</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Performs the requested action on one or more
  packages specified via <b>regex</b>(7), <b>glob</b>(7) or exact match. The
  requested action can be overridden for specific packages by append a plus (+)
  to the package name to install this package or a minus (-) to remove it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following
  the package name with an equals (=) and the version of the package to select.
  Alternatively the version from a specific release can be selected by following
  the package name with a forward slash (/) and codename (jessie, stretch, sid
  ...) or suite name (stable, testing, unstable). This will also select versions
  from this release for dependencies of this package if needed to satisfy the
  request.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Removing a package removes all packaged data, but leaves usually small
  (modified) user configuration files behind, in case the remove was an
  accident. Just issuing an installation request for the accidentally removed
  package will restore its function as before in that case. On the other hand
  you can get rid of these leftovers by calling <b>purge</b> even on already
  removed packages. Note that this does not affect any data or configuration
  stored in your home directory.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>autoremove</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">autoremove is used to remove packages that
  were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and
  are now no longer needed as dependencies changed or the package(s) needing
  them were removed in the meantime.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You should check that the list does not include applications you have grown to
  like even though they were once installed just as a dependency of another
  package. You can mark such a package as manually installed by using
  <b>apt-mark</b>(8). Packages which you have installed explicitly via
  <b>install</b> are also never proposed for automatic removal.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>search</b> (<b>apt-cache</b>(8))
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><b>search</b> can be used to search for the
  given <b>regex</b>(7) term(s) in the list of available packages and display
  matches. This can e.g. be useful if you are looking for packages having a
  specific feature. If you are looking for a package including a specific file
  try <b>apt-file</b>(1).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>show</b> (<b>apt-cache</b>(8))
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show information about the given package(s)
  including its dependencies, installation and download size, sources the
  package is available from, the description of the packages content and much
  more. It can e.g. be helpful to look at this information before allowing
  <b>apt</b>(8) to remove a package or while searching for new packages to
  install.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>list</b> (work-in-progress)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"><b>list</b> is somewhat similar to
  <b>dpkg-query --list</b> in that it can display a list of packages satisfying
  certain criteria. It supports <b>glob</b>(7) patterns for matching package
  names as well as options to list installed ( <b>--installed</b>), upgradeable
  ( <b>--upgradeable</b>) or all available (<b>--all-versions</b>)
  versions.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>edit-sources</b> (work-in-progress)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">edit-sources lets you edit your
  <b>sources.list</b>(5) files in your preferred texteditor while also providing
  basic sanity checks.</div>

  USAGE AND DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER APT TOOLS</a></h1>
The <b>apt</b>(8) commandline is designed as an end-user tool and it may change
  behavior between versions. While it tries not to break backward compatibility
  this is not guaranteed either if a change seems beneficial for interactive
  use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All features of <b>apt</b>(8) are available in dedicated APT tools like
  <b>apt-get</b>(8) and <b>apt-cache</b>(8) as well. <b>apt</b>(8) just changes
  the default value of some options (see <b>apt.conf</b>(5) and specifically the
  Binary scope). So you should prefer using these commands (potentially with
  some additional options enabled) in your scripts as they keep backward
  compatibility as much as possible.
