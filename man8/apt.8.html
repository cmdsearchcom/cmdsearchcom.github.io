<p>APT(8) APT APT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apt - command-line interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apt [-h] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file]
[-t=target_release] [-a=architecture] {list | search | show
| update | install pkg [{=pkg_version_number |
/target_release}]... | <br>
remove pkg... | upgrade | full-upgrade | edit-sources | {-v
| --version} | {-h | --help}}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apt provides a high-level commandline interface for the
package management system. It is intended as an end user
interface and enables some options better suited for
interactive <br>
usage by default compared to more specialized APT tools like
apt-get(8) and apt-cache(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Much like apt itself, its
manpage is intended as an end user interface and as such
only mentions the most used commands and options partly to
not duplicate information in <br>
multiple places and partly to avoid overwhelming readers
with a cornucopia of options and details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update (apt-get(8)) <br>
update is used to download package information from all
configured sources. Other commands operate on this data to
e.g. perform package upgrades or search in and display <br>
details about all packages available for installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade (apt-get(8)) <br>
upgrade is used to install available upgrades of all
packages currently installed on the system from the sources
configured via sources.list(5). New packages will be <br>
installed if required to statisfy dependencies, but existing
packages will never be removed. If an upgrade for a package
requires the remove of an installed package the <br>
upgrade for this package isn&rsquo;t performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">full-upgrade (apt-get(8)) <br>
full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but will
remove currently installed packages if this is needed to
upgrade the system as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install, remove, purge
(apt-get(8)) <br>
Performs the requested action on one or more packages
specified via regex(7), glob(7) or exact match. The
requested action can be overridden for specific packages by
append a <br>
plus (+) to the package name to install this package or a
minus (-) to remove it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A specific version of a package
can be selected for installation by following the package
name with an equals (=) and the version of the package to
select. Alternatively the <br>
version from a specific release can be selected by following
the package name with a forward slash (/) and codename
(jessie, stretch, sid ...) or suite name (stable, testing,
<br>
unstable). This will also select versions from this release
for dependencies of this package if needed to satisfy the
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removing a package removes all
packaged data, but leaves usually small (modified) user
configuration files behind, in case the remove was an
accident. Just issuing an <br>
installation request for the accidentally removed package
will restore its function as before in that case. On the
other hand you can get rid of these leftovers by calling
<br>
purge even on already removed packages. Note that this does
not affect any data or configuration stored in your home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoremove (apt-get(8)) <br>
autoremove is used to remove packages that were
automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other
packages and are now no longer needed as dependencies
changed or the <br>
package(s) needing them were removed in the meantime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should check that the list
does not include applications you have grown to like even
though they were once installed just as a dependency of
another package. You can mark <br>
such a package as manually installed by using apt-mark(8).
Packages which you have installed explicitly via install are
also never proposed for automatic removal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search (apt-cache(8)) <br>
search can be used to search for the given regex(7) term(s)
in the list of available packages and display matches. This
can e.g. be useful if you are looking for packages <br>
having a specific feature. If you are looking for a package
including a specific file try apt-file(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show (apt-cache(8)) <br>
Show information about the given package(s) including its
dependencies, installation and download size, sources the
package is available from, the description of the packages
<br>
content and much more. It can e.g. be helpful to look at
this information before allowing apt(8) to remove a package
or while searching for new packages to install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list (work-in-progress) <br>
list is somewhat similar to dpkg-query --list in that it can
display a list of packages satisfying certain criteria. It
supports glob(7) patterns for matching package names <br>
as well as options to list installed (--installed),
upgradeable (--upgradeable) or all available
(--all-versions) versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit-sources (work-in-progress)
<br>
edit-sources lets you edit your sources.list(5) files in
your preferred texteditor while also providing basic sanity
checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPT USAGE AND DIFFERENCES
FROM OTHER APT TOOLS <br>
The apt(8) commandline is designed as an end-user tool and
it may change behavior between versions. While it tries not
to break backward compatibility this is not guaranteed <br>
either if a change seems beneficial for interactive use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All features of apt(8) are
available in dedicated APT tools like apt-get(8) and
apt-cache(8) as well. apt(8) just changes the default value
of some options (see apt.conf(5) and <br>
specifically the Binary scope). So you should prefer using
these commands (potentially with some additional options
enabled) in your scripts as they keep backward compatibility
<br>
as much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
apt returns zero on normal operation, decimal 100 on
error.</p>
