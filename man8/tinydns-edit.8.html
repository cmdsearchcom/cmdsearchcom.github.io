<p>tinydns-edit(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
tinydns-edit(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tinydns-edit - edit the (source form of the) database served
by tinydns/axfrdns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tinydns-edit data data.tmp add type name address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tinydns-edit edits the data file, which is the source form
of the database that is compiled by tinydns-data(8) and that
is served by tinydns(8) and axfrdns(8). The update to <br>
data is performed atomically, by first writing the updated
database content to the file data.tmp and then renaming
data.tmp to data . The two files must, of course, reside on
<br>
the same volume in order that this can be achieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On success, tinydns-edit returns
zero. If, for any reason, an error occurs it will exit with
a non-zero code and data will not be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the &quot;add&quot; verb,
tinydns-edit appends to the database a record whose type is
determined by type , with the fully-qualified name name and
the IP address address . type can be <br>
one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ns A &rsquo;.&rsquo; record is
created. This record specifies that the domain name is
published by a DNS content server that is listening on the
IP address address .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the DNS content
server is not directly specifiable. Names are automatically
assigned by tinydns-edit itself, following the pattern
[a-z].ns.name . tinydns- <br>
edit will assign the first letter of the alphabet that is
not already used in another &rsquo;.&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; record as the name of a DNS content
server. If no letters of the alphabet <br>
remain unused, tinydns-edit will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &rsquo;.&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; record for the domain already exists,
proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the new record for
the same length of time as they are allowed to cache the
<br>
existing records. Otherwise, proxy DNS servers are allowed
to cache the record for up to 3 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">childns <br>
A &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; record is created. This record
specifies that queries for names in the domain name should
be referred to a (&quot;child&quot;) DNS content server that
is listening on the IP <br>
address address .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the DNS content
server is not directly specifiable. Names are automatically
assigned by tinydns-edit itself, following the pattern
[a-z].ns.name . tinydns- <br>
edit will assign the first letter of the alphabet that is
not already used in another &rsquo;.&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; record as the name of a DNS content
server. If no letters of the alphabet <br>
remain unused, tinydns-edit will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &rsquo;.&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; record for the domain already exists,
proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache the new record for
the same length of time as they are allowed to cache the
<br>
existing records. Otherwise, proxy DNS servers are allowed
to cache the record for up to 3 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mx A &rsquo;@&rsquo; record is
created. This record specifies that mail to names in the
domain name should be sent to an SMTP server that is
listening on the IP address address .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the SMTP server is
not directly specifiable. Names are automatically assigned
by tinydns-edit itself, following the pattern [a-z].mx.name
. tinydns-edit will <br>
assign the first letter of the alphabet that is not already
used in another &rsquo;@&rsquo; record as the name of an
SMTP server. If no letters of the alphabet remain unused,
<br>
tinydns-edit will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to specify
the distance value for the SMTP server. tinydns-edit will
leave that field blank, meaning that tinydns-data (8) will
use whatever the <br>
default value is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &rsquo;@&rsquo; record for
the domain already exists, proxy DNS servers are allowed to
cache the new record for the same length of time as they are
allowed to cache the existing <br>
records. Otherwise, proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache
the record for up to 1 day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host A &rsquo;=&rsquo; record is
created, that proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache for up
to 1 day. This record specifies that the name name maps to
the IP address address and vice <br>
versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tinydns-edit will fail if a
&rsquo;=&rsquo; record already exists that uses either name
or address .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias A &rsquo;+&rsquo; record
is created, that proxy DNS servers are allowed to cache for
up to 1 day. This record specifies that the name name maps
to the IP address address but that <br>
there is no reverse mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because this is an alias record,
tinydns-edit will not fail if there happen to already be
existing records that use address .</p>
