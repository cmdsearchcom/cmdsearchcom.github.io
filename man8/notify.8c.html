<p>NOTIFY(8C) NOTIFY(8C)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
notify - HylaFAX user notification script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/var/spool/hylafax/bin/notify qfile why jobtime [ nextTry
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bin/notify is the command script invoked by the facsimile
server to notify a user about the status of an outbound job.
It is designed to be customizable by the administrator. <br>
(Ideally this is done by creating a customized notify script
in a different filename or by copying the default script to
a different filename, customizing that new file, and then
<br>
using NotifyCmd in the scheduler config file to point
faxq(8C) at the customized script. See
hylafax-config(5F).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default notification script
sends the user electronic mail describing the event or
action. The arguments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qfile the pathname of the job
description file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">why a string that specifies why
the user is being notified; one of: <br>
Why Notes Meaning <br>
done job was completed successfully <br>
failed &Acirc;&sup1; job was not completed <br>
rejected job was rejected for specified reasons <br>
blocked job is blocked by concurrent jobs <br>
requeued &Acirc;&sup1; job was not completed, but was
requeued for retry <br>
removed job was deleted from the queue <br>
killed job was deleted from the queue <br>
timedout job could not be sent before kill time expired <br>
format_failed document conversion failed <br>
no_formatter the document conversion program was not found
<br>
poll_rejected &Acirc;&sup1; a polling request was rejected
by the remote side <br>
poll_no_document &Acirc;&sup1; a polling request failed
because nothing was available <br>
poll_failed &Acirc;&sup1; a polling request failed for an
unknown reason <br>
&Acirc;&sup1; A transcript of the failed communication is
returned to the sender.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobtime the total transmission
time of a successful job or the connect time of a failed
request (passed as a string).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nextTry the time (passed as a
string) at which the next attempt will be made to complete
the job. This parameter is passed only if why is
&lsquo;&lsquo;requeued&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The behavior of notify is intended to be customizable via
the etc/FaxNotify script, if present. FaxNotify is sourced
after the q-file is parsed and all default values are
pre&acirc; <br>
set. Useful settings for FaxNotify are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY is identical to why
mentioned above and can be useful in determining under what
conditions various settings should take effect. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ &quot;$WHY&quot; !=
&quot;done&quot; ]; then <br>
RETURNFILETYPE=pdf; <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would only set
RETURNFILETYPE when the job did not complete
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURNFILETYPE <br>
can be set to &lsquo;&lsquo;tif&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;pdf&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;ps&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;original&rsquo;&rsquo;. If set, this causes
notify to return a copy of the submitted documents to the
SENDER address along with the noti&acirc; <br>
fication message. The &lsquo;&lsquo;original&rsquo;&rsquo;
setting uses the format type that was used in the
submission. Multiple values may be specified by separating
them with whitespace. In <br>
that case a separate attachment is created for each
filetype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURNTECHINFO <br>
defaults to &lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo; and is used to
indicate whether or not technical information such as the
session parameters should be included with the notification
message. If set <br>
to anything other than &lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo; this
information will not be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURNTRANSCRIPT <br>
defaults to &lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo; and is used to
indicate whether or not the session transcript (log) should
be returned with the notification message on the error
conditions noted <br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY_FAXMASTER <br>
is used to deliver a notification message to TOADDR (which
defaults to &lsquo;&lsquo;FaxMaster&rsquo;&rsquo;) that
contains technical information about the job. This is useful
in allowing the <br>
administrator to be aware of any problems before those
problems are reported by the users. Possible settings are
&lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;always&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;never&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;errors&rsquo;&rsquo;. <br>
If &lsquo;&lsquo;errors&rsquo;&rsquo; is used then the
notification message is only sent to FaxMaster when the job
experienced an error. The default is
&lsquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG controls the localization
of the text of the job notification messages.</p>
