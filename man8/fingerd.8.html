<p>FINGERD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FINGERD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fingerd &acirc; remote user information server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fingerd [-wulf] [-pL path] [-t timeout]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fingerd is a simple daemon based on RFC1196 that provides an
interface to the &acirc;finger&acirc; program at most
network sites. The program is supposed to return a friendly,
human-oriented <br>
status report on either the system at the moment or a
particular person in depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -w option is given,
remote users will get an additional &acirc;Welcome to
...&acirc; banner which also shows some informations (e.g.
uptime, operating system name and release) about the <br>
system the fingerd is running on. Some sites may consider
this a security risk as it gives out information that may be
useful to crackers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -u option is given,
requests of the form &acirc;finger @host&acirc; are
rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -l option is given,
information about requests made is logged. This option
probably violates users&rsquo; privacy and should not be
used on multiuser boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -f option is given,
finger forwarding (user@host1@host2) is allowed. Useful
behind firewalls, but probably not wise for security and
resource reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option allows
specification of an alternate location for fingerd to find
the &acirc;finger&acirc; program. The -L option is
equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t option specifies the time
to wait for a request before closing the connection. A value
of 0 waits forever. The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting and stopping the daemon
is handled by systemd(1). Fingerd is not enabled by default
after the installation. Its running state can be managed
using systemctl(1) commands. <br>
If you need to specify some options to fingerd you should
copy the finger@.service file from /lib/systemd/system to
/etc/systemd/system and edit it there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The finger protocol consists
mostly of specifying command arguments. The systemd(1) runs
fingerd for TCP requests received on port 79. Once connected
fingerd reads a single com&acirc; <br>
mand line terminated by a &acirc;&uml;CRLF&acirc;&copy;
which is passed to finger(1). It closes its connections as
soon as all output is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the line is empty (i.e. just
a &acirc;&uml;CRLF&acirc;&copy; is sent) then finger returns
a &acirc;default&acirc; report that lists all people logged
into the system at that moment. This feature is blocked by
the <br>
-u option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a user name is specified
(e.g. eric&acirc;&uml;CRLF&acirc;&copy;) then the response
lists more extended information for only that particular
user, whether logged in or not. Allowable
&acirc;names&acirc; in the <br>
command line include both &acirc;login names&acirc; and
&acirc;user names&acirc;. If a name is ambiguous, all
possible derivations are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
finger(1), systemd(1), systemctl(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Connecting directly to the server from a TIP or an equally
narrow-minded TELNET-protocol user program can result in
meaningless attempts at option negotiation being sent to the
<br>
server, which will foul up the command line
interpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The finger daemon appeared in 4.3BSD.</p>
