<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Send a SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command to <i>DEVICE</i>. Alternatively this utility
  can find the number of element in a &quot;grown&quot; or &quot;primary&quot;
  defect list with a SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command. These SCSI commands are
  defined in SBC-2 for direct access devices (e.g. a disk). Reassign blocks is
  designed to change the physical location of a logical block that is known or
  suspected to be defective to another area on the media. Disks are typically
  formatted with blocks held in reserve for this situation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If neither the <i>--grown</i> nor <i>--primary</i> option is supplied then one
  or more addresses need to be given. If the address (or all of the addresses)
  fit into 4 bytes and '--eight=1' is not given then the parameter block passed
  to <i>DEVICE</i> is made up of 4 byte logical block addresses. If any of the
  addresses need more than 4 bytes to represent (i.e. &gt;= 2**32) or
  '--eight=1' is given then the parameter block passed to <i>DEVICE</i> is made
  up of 8 byte logical block addresses.

      Each number is interpreted as decimal unless prefixed by '0x' or '0X' (or
      it has a trailing 'h' or 'H'). If multiple logical block addresses are
      given they must be separated by a comma or a (single) space. A string that
      contains any space separators needs to be quoted. At least one address

Note that if the ARRE field (for reads) and/or the AWRE field (for writes) are
  set in the &quot;Read Write Error Recovery&quot; mode page then recoverable
  read and/or write errors cause automatic reassignment of the defective block.
  The PER bit in the same mode page controls whether a RECOVERED ERROR sense key
  is reported on not (PER=1 implies do report). Irrespective of the ARRE, AWRE
  or PER field settings, the error counter log pages reflect any errors
  (recovered or otherwise). Whenever a block is reassigned, a new entry is added
  in the &quot;grown&quot; defect list. Apart from doing selftests (see
  sg_senddiag or smartmontools) regularly, monitoring the grown defect list of a
  disk is a reasonable metric of its health. If the grown list starts growing
  quickly that is an ominous sign. The best grown defect lists are empty ones.
  The number of elements in the grown defect list can be viewed with the
  <i>--grown</i> option. The contents of the grown defect list can be viewed
  with the 'sginfo -G' utility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an unrecoverable error is detected at a logical block address then REASSIGN
  BLOCKS is needed to reassign the block. Also if the ARRE and/or AWRE fields
  are clear and a recoverable error is detected then the logical block in
  question may be reassigned with this utility (otherwise the error counter log
  pages will continually be incremented for each recovered access).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number of blocks held in reserve for the purposes of REASSIGN BLOCKS is
  vendor specific and may well be limited to the zone within the media where the
  original (defective) block lay. When this number is exhausted subsequent
  invocations of this utility may result in a sense key of hardware error and an
  additional sense of 'No defect spare location available'. The next step would
  be to reformat the disk (or get a replacement).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The SBC-2 draft standard (revision 16) notes that when multiple addresses are
  given to the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command and there is some failure at one of
  the later addresses then all addresses prior to that have already be
  reassigned. Care should be taken in such a case. Re-executing the command with
  the same addresses will cause the earlier addresses to be reassigned again. At
  some stage the disk will run out of reserved locations. So unless a large
  number of addresses are involved it may be safer to reassign them one address
  at a time.

The exit status of sg_reassign is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
