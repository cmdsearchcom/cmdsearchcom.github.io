<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_reassign - send SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_reassign [--address=A,A...] [--dummy] [--eight=0|1]
[--grown] [--help] [--longlist=0|1] [--primary] [--verbose]
[--version] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Send a SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command to DEVICE. Alternatively
this utility can find the number of element in a
&quot;grown&quot; or &quot;primary&quot; defect list with a
SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) <br>
command. These SCSI commands are defined in SBC-2 for direct
access devices (e.g. a disk). Reassign blocks is designed to
change the physical location of a logical block that is <br>
known or suspected to be defective to another area on the
media. Disks are typically formatted with blocks held in
reserve for this situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the --grown nor
--primary option is supplied then one or more addresses need
to be given. If the address (or all of the addresses) fit
into 4 bytes and &rsquo;--eight=1&rsquo; is <br>
not given then the parameter block passed to DEVICE is made
up of 4 byte logical block addresses. If any of the
addresses need more than 4 bytes to represent (i.e. &gt;=
2**32) or <br>
&rsquo;--eight=1&rsquo; is given then the parameter block
passed to DEVICE is made up of 8 byte logical block
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --address=A,A... <br>
where A,A... is a string of comma separated numbers. Each
number is interpreted as decimal unless prefixed by
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; or &rsquo;0X&rsquo; (or it has a trailing
&rsquo;h&rsquo; or &rsquo;H&rsquo;). If multiple <br>
logical block addresses are given they must be separated by
a comma or a (single) space. A string that contains any
space separators needs to be quoted. At least one <br>
address must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --address=- <br>
reads one or more logical block addresses from stdin. These
may be comma, space, tab or linefeed (newline) separated. If
a line contains &quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters
<br>
on that line are ignored. Otherwise each non separator
sequence of characters should resolve to a decimal number
unless prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or &rsquo;0X&rsquo; (or
has a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;). <br>
At least one address must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dummy <br>
prepare for but do not execute the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS
command. Since the REASSIGN BLOCKS command is essentially
irreversible, paranoid users may wish to check the
invo&acirc; <br>
cation of this utility before reassigning defective blocks
on a disk. Useful with &rsquo;-vv&rsquo; for those who wish
to view the parameter block that will accompany the
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --eight=0 | 1 <br>
when value is 1 then it sets the &rsquo;LONGLBA&rsquo; flag
in the command indicating that the addresses in the
associated parameter block are 8 byte quantities. When value
is 0 then <br>
it clears the &rsquo;LONGLBA&rsquo; flag in the command
indicating that the addresses in the associated parameter
block are 4 byte quantities. If this option is not given
then 4 byte <br>
quantities are assumed unless one of the address is too
large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --grown <br>
use the SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command to determine the
number of elements in the &quot;grown defect list&quot;.
When this option is given there is no reassignment of blocks
<br>
(i.e. this utility is passive). When this option is given
then the --address= option is not permitted. See the
discussion below concerning the relationship between
reas&acirc; <br>
signed blocks and the grown defect list. This list is
sometimes referred to as the GLIST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --longlist=0 | 1 <br>
sets the REASSIGN BLOCKS cdb field of the same name to the
given value. Only 1000 addresses are permitted so there
should be no need to specify a value of 1. The short <br>
list variant restricts the parameter block length to 2 ** 16
bytes (i.e. about 16000 4 byte addresses or 8000 8 byte
addresses). Added for completeness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --primary <br>
use the SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command to determine the
number of elements in the &quot;primary defect list&quot;
which is established during the manufacturing process. When
<br>
this option is given there is no reassignment of blocks
(i.e. this utility is passive). When this option is given
then the --address= option is not permitted. This list is
<br>
sometimes referred to as the PLIST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Note that if the ARRE field (for reads) and/or the AWRE
field (for writes) are set in the &quot;Read Write Error
Recovery&quot; mode page then recoverable read and/or write
errors cause <br>
automatic reassignment of the defective block. The PER bit
in the same mode page controls whether a RECOVERED ERROR
sense key is reported on not (PER=1 implies do report).
Irre&acirc; <br>
spective of the ARRE, AWRE or PER field settings, the error
counter log pages reflect any errors (recovered or
otherwise). Whenever a block is reassigned, a new entry is
added in <br>
the &quot;grown&quot; defect list. Apart from doing
selftests (see sg_senddiag or smartmontools) regularly,
monitoring the grown defect list of a disk is a reasonable
metric of its health. <br>
If the grown list starts growing quickly that is an ominous
sign. The best grown defect lists are empty ones. The number
of elements in the grown defect list can be viewed with <br>
the --grown option. The contents of the grown defect list
can be viewed with the &rsquo;sginfo -G&rsquo; utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an unrecoverable error is
detected at a logical block address then REASSIGN BLOCKS is
needed to reassign the block. Also if the ARRE and/or AWRE
fields are clear and a recov&acirc; <br>
erable error is detected then the logical block in question
may be reassigned with this utility (otherwise the error
counter log pages will continually be incremented for each
<br>
recovered access).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of blocks held in
reserve for the purposes of REASSIGN BLOCKS is vendor
specific and may well be limited to the zone within the
media where the original (defective) <br>
block lay. When this number is exhausted subsequent
invocations of this utility may result in a sense key of
hardware error and an additional sense of &rsquo;No defect
spare location <br>
available&rsquo;. The next step would be to reformat the
disk (or get a replacement).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SBC-2 draft standard
(revision 16) notes that when multiple addresses are given
to the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command and there is some
failure at one of the later addresses <br>
then all addresses prior to that have already be reassigned.
Care should be taken in such a case. Re-executing the
command with the same addresses will cause the earlier <br>
addresses to be reassigned again. At some stage the disk
will run out of reserved locations. So unless a large number
of addresses are involved it may be safer to reassign them
<br>
one address at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_reassign is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
