<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
psad - The Port Scan Attack Detector</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
psad [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
psad makes use of iptables log messages to detect, alert,
and (optionally) block port scans and other suspect traffic.
For TCP scans psad analyzes TCP flags to determine the <br>
scan type (syn, fin, xmas, etc.) and corresponding command
line options that could be supplied to nmap to generate such
a scan. In addition, psad makes use of many TCP, UDP, and
<br>
ICMP signatures contained within the Snort intrusion
detection system (see http://www.snort.org/) to detect
suspicious network traffic such as probes for common
backdoors, DDoS <br>
tools, OS fingerprinting attempts, and more. By default psad
also provides alerts for snort rules that are detected
directly by iptables through the use of a ruleset generated
<br>
by fwsnort (http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwsnort/). This
enables psad to send alerts for application layer attacks.
psad features a set of highly configurable danger thresholds
<br>
(with sensible defaults provided) that allow the
administrator to define what constitutes a port scan or
other suspect traffic. Email alerts sent by psad contain the
scanning <br>
ip, number of packets sent to each port, any TCP, UDP, or
ICMP signatures that have been matched (e.g. &quot;NMAP XMAS
scan&quot;), the scanned port range, the current danger
level (from 1 <br>
to 5), reverse dns info, and whois information. psad also
makes use of various packet header fields associated with
TCP SYN packets to passively fingerprint remote operating
<br>
systems (in a manner similar to the p0f fingerprinter) from
which scans originate. This requires the use of the
--log-tcp-options argument for iptables logging rules; if
this <br>
option is not used, psad will fall back to a fingerprinting
method that makes use of packet length, TTL and TOS values,
IP ID, and TCP window sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psad reads all iptables log data
by default from the /var/log/messages file. By parsing
firewall log messages, psad is provided with data that
represents packets that have been <br>
logged (and possibly dropped) by the running iptables
policy. In this sense, psad is supplied with a pure data
stream that exclusively contains packets that the firewall
has <br>
deemed unfit to enter the network. psad consists of three
daemons: psad, kmsgsd, and psadwatchd. psad is responsible
for processing all packets that have been logged by the <br>
firewall and applying the signature logic in order to
determine what type of scan has been leveraged against the
machine and/or network. kmsgsd (deprecated) reads all
messages <br>
that have been written to the /var/lib/psad/psadfifo named
pipe and writes any message that matches a particular
regular expression (or string) to /var/log/psad/fwdata.
kmsgsd <br>
is only used if the ENABLE_SYSLOG_FILE variable is disabled
in psad.conf. psadwatchd is a software watchdog that will
restart any of the other two daemons should a daemon die
<br>
for any reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A, --Analyze-msgs <br>
Analyze an iptables logfile for scans and exit. This will
generate email alerts just as a normal running psad process
would have for all logged scans. By default the <br>
psad data file /var/log/psad/fwdata is parsed for old scans,
but any file can be specified through the use of the
--messages-file command line option. For example it <br>
might be useful to point psad at your /var/log/messages
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--analysis-fields &lt;search
fields&gt; <br>
In --Analyze mode restrict analysis to iptables log messages
that have specific values for particular fields. Examples
include &quot;SRC:1.2.3.4&quot;, &quot;DST:10.0.0.0/24, and
<br>
&quot;TTL:64&quot;, and multiple fields are supported as a
comma-separated list like &quot;SRC:1.2.3.4, LEN:44,
DST:10.0.0.0/24&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interface
&lt;interface&gt; <br>
Specify the interface that psad will examine for iptables
log messages. This interface will be the IN= interface for
packets that are logged in the INPUT and FORWARD <br>
chains, and the OUT= interface for packets logged in the
OUTPUT chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sig-update <br>
Instruct psad to download the latest set of modified Snort
signatures from http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/signatures so
that psad can take advantage of signature updates <br>
before a new release is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --Override-config
&lt;file&gt; <br>
Override config variable values that are normally read from
the /etc/psad/psad.conf file with values from the specified
file. Multiple override config files can be given <br>
as a comma separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --Dump-conf <br>
Dump the current psad config to STDOUT and exit. Various
pieces of information such as the home network, alert email
addresses, and DShield user id are removed from the <br>
resulting output so it is safe to send to others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --Flush <br>
Remove any auto-generated firewall block rules if psad was
configured to automatically respond to scans (see the
ENABLE_AUTO_IDS variable in psad.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --Status <br>
Display the status of any psad processes that may or not be
running. The status output contains a listing of the number
of packets that have been processed by psad, along <br>
with all IP addresses and corresponding danger levels that
have scanned the network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status-ip &lt;ip&gt; <br>
Display status information associated with ip such as the
protocol packet counters as well as the last 10 packets
logged by iptables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status-dl &lt;dl&gt; <br>
Display status information only for scans that have reached
a danger level of at least dl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status-summary <br>
Instruct psad to omit detailed IP information from --Status
and --Analyze modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --messages-file &lt;file&gt;
<br>
This option is used to specify the file that will be parsed
in analysis mode (see the --Analyze-msgs option). The
default path is the psad data file /var/log/psad/fwdata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV Instruct psad to parse
iptables log messages out of /var/log/messages (by defult,
but this path can be changed with the -m option), and print
the packet fields on STDOUT <br>
in comma-separate value format. This is useful for graphing
iptables log data with AfterGlow (see
http://afterglow.sourceforge.net/index.html).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
Acquire iptables log data from STDIN instead of the default
/var/log/messages file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV-fields &lt;tokens&gt; <br>
Instruct psad to only include a specific set of iptables log
message fields within the CSV output. AfterGlow accepts up
to three fields for its graph data, so the most <br>
common usage of this option is &quot;src dst dp&quot; to
print the source and destination IP addresses, and the
destination port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --Kill <br>
Kill the current psad process along with psadwatchd and
kmsgsd. This provides a quick and easy way to kill all psad
processes without having to look in the process table <br>
or appeal to the psad-init script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --Restart <br>
Restart the currently running psad processes. This option
will preserve the command line options that were supplied to
the original psad process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --USR1 <br>
Send a running psad process a USR1 signal. This will cause
psad to dump the contents of the %Scan hash to the file
&quot;/var/log/psad/scan_hash.$$&quot; where &quot;$$&quot;
represents the <br>
pid of the psad process. This is mostly useful for debugging
purposes, but it also allows the administrator to peer into
the %Scan hash, which is the primary data struc&acirc; <br>
ture used to store scan data within system memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --HUP <br>
Send all running psad daemons a HUP signal. This will
instruct the daemons to re-read their respective
configuration files without causing scan data to be lost in
the <br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --Benchmark <br>
Run psad in benchmark mode. By default benchmark mode will
simulate a scan of 10,000 packets (see the --packets option)
and then report the elapsed time. This is useful <br>
to see how fast psad can process packets on a specific
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --packets &lt;packets&gt;
<br>
Specify the number of packets to analyze in --Analyze mode
or use in --Benchmark mode. The default is 10,000 packets in
--Benchmark mode, and unlimited in --Analyze mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Run psad in debugging mode. This will automatically prevent
psad from running as a daemon, and will print the contents
of the %Scan hash and a few other things on STDOUT <br>
at crucial points as psad executes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config
&lt;configuration-file&gt; <br>
By default all of the psad makes use of the configuration
file /etc/psad/psad.conf for almost all configuration
parameters. psad can be made to override this path by <br>
specifying a different file on the command line with the
--config option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--signatures
&lt;signatures-file&gt; <br>
The iptables firewalling code included within the linux
2.4.x kernel series has the ability to distinguish and log
any of the TCP flags present within TCP packets that <br>
traverse the firewall interfaces. psad makes use of this
logging capability to detect several types of TCP scan
signatures included within /etc/psad/signatures. The
sig&acirc; <br>
natures were originally included within the snort intrusion
detection system. New signatures can be included and
modifications to existing signatures can be made to the <br>
signature file and psad will import the changes upon
receiving a HUP signal (see the --HUP command line option)
without having to restart the psad process. psad also <br>
detects many UDP and ICMP signatures that were originally
included within snort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --email-analysis <br>
Send alert emails when run in --Analyze-msgs mode. Depending
on the size of the iptables logfile, using the
--email-analysis option could extend the runtime of psad by
<br>
quite a bit since normally both DNS and whois lookups will
be issued against each scanning IP address. As usual these
lookups can be disabled with the --no-rdns and --no- <br>
whois options respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --whois-analysis <br>
By default psad does not issue whois lookups when running in
--Analyze-msgs mode. The --whois-analysis option will
override this behavior (when run in analysis mode) and <br>
instruct psad to issue whois lookups against IP addresses
from which scans or other suspect traffic has
originated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--analysis-auto-block <br>
Enable auto-blocking responses when running in
--Analyze-msgs mode. This is mostly useful only for the psad
test suite when auto-blocking responses are tested and
veri&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--snort-type &lt;type&gt; <br>
Restrict the type of snort sids to type. Allowed types match
the file names given to snort rules files such as
&quot;ddos&quot;, &quot;backdoor&quot;, and
&quot;web-attacks&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--snort-rdir
&lt;snort-rules-directory&gt; <br>
Manually specify the directory where the snort rules files
are located. The default is /etc/psad/snort_rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passive-os-sigs
&lt;passive-os-sigs-file&gt; <br>
Manually specify the path to the passive operating system
fingerprinting signatures file. The default is
/etc/psad/posf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-dl &lt;auto-dl-file&gt;
<br>
Occasionally certain IP addresses are repeat offenders and
should automatically be given a higher danger level than
would normally be assigned. Additionally, some IP <br>
addresses can always be ignored depending on your network
configuration (the loopback interface 127.0.0.1 might be a
good candidate for example). /etc/psad/auto_dl pro&acirc;
<br>
vides an interface for psad to automatically
increase/decrease/ignore scanning IP danger levels.
Modifications can be made to auto_dl (installed by default
in /etc/psad) <br>
and psad will import them with &rsquo;psad -H&rsquo; or by
restarting the psad process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-search
&lt;fw_search-file&gt; <br>
By default all of the psad makes use of the firewall search
configuration file /etc/psad/fw_search.conf for firewall
search mode and search strings. psad can be made to <br>
override this path by specifying a different file on the
command line with the --fw-search option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-list-auto <br>
List all rules in iptables chains that are used by psad in
auto-blocking mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-analyze <br>
Analyze the local iptables ruleset, send any alerts if
errors are discovered, and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-del-chains <br>
By default, if ENABLE_AUTO_IDS is set to &quot;Y&quot; psad
will not delete the auto-generated iptables chains (see the
IPT_AUTO_CHAIN keywords in psad.conf) if the --Flush option
<br>
is given. The --fw-del-chains option overrides this behavior
and deletes the auto-blocking chains from a running iptables
firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-dump <br>
Instruct psad to dump the contents of the iptables policy
that is running on the local system. All IP addresses are
removed from the resulting output, so it is safe to <br>
post to the psad list, or communicate to others. This option
is most often used with --Dump-conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-block-ip &lt;ip&gt; <br>
Specify an IP address or network to add to the iptables
controls that are auto-generated by psad. This allows psad
to manage the rule timeouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-rm-block-ip &lt;ip&gt; <br>
Specify an IP address or network to remove from the iptables
controls that are auto-generated by psad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fw-file &lt;policy-file&gt;
<br>
Analyze the iptables ruleset contained within policy-file
instead of the ruleset currently loaded on the local
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV-regex &lt;regex&gt; <br>
Instruct psad to only print CSV data that matches the
supplied regex. This regex is used to match against each of
the entire iptables log messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV-neg-regex &lt;regex&gt;
<br>
Instruct psad to only print CSV data that does not match the
supplied regex. This regex is used to negatively match
against each of the entire iptables log messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV-uniq-lines <br>
Instruct psad to only print unique CSV data. That is, each
line printed in --CSV mode will be unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV-max-lines &lt;num&gt; <br>
Limit the number of CSV-formatted lines that psad generates
on STDOUT. This is useful to allow AfterGlow graphs to be
created that are not too cluttered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV-start-line &lt;num&gt;
<br>
Specify the beginning line number to start parsing out of
the iptables log file in --CSV output mode. This is useful
for when the log file is extremely large, and you <br>
want to begin parsing a specific place within the file. The
default is begin parsing at the beginning of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CSV-end-line &lt;num&gt; <br>
Specify the ending line number to stop parsing the iptables
log file in --CSV output mode. This is useful for when the
log file is extremely large, and you do not want <br>
psad to process the entire thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot <br>
Enter into Gnuplot mode whereby psad parses an iptables
logfile and creates .gnu and .dat files that are suitable
for graphing with Gnuplot. The various --CSV command <br>
line arguments apply to plotting iptables log with
Gnuplot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-template &lt;file&gt;
<br>
Use a template file for all Gnuplot graphing directives
(this is usually a .gnu file by convention). Normally psad
builds all of the graphing directives based on various <br>
--gnuplot command line arguments, but the --gnuplot-template
switch allows you to override this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-file-prefix
&lt;file&gt; <br>
Specify a prefix for the .gnu, .dat, and .png files that are
generated in --gnuplot mode. So, when visualizing attacks
captured in an iptables logfile (let&rsquo;s say you are
<br>
interested in port scans), you could use this option to have
psad create the two files portscan.dat, portscan.gnu, and
Gnuplot will create an additional file portscan.png <br>
when the portscan.gnu file is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-x-label &lt;label&gt;
<br>
Set the label associated with the x-axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-x-range &lt;range&gt;
<br>
Set the x-axis range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-y-label &lt;label&gt;
<br>
Set the label associated with the y-axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-y-range &lt;range&gt;
<br>
Set the y-axis range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-z-label &lt;label&gt;
<br>
Set the label associated with the z-axis (only if
--gnuplot-3D is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-z-range &lt;range&gt;
<br>
Set the z-axis range. (only if --gnuplot-3D is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-3D <br>
Generate a Gnuplot splot graph. This produces a
three-dimensional graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-view <br>
Set the viewing angle when graphing data in --gnuplot-3D
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnuplot-title &lt;title&gt;
<br>
Set the graph title for the Gnuplot graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --Interval &lt;seconds&gt;
<br>
Specify the interval (in seconds) that psad should use to
check whether or not packets have been logged by the
firewall. psad will use the default of 15 seconds unless a
<br>
different value is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --log-server <br>
This option should be used if psad is being executed on a
syslog logging server. Running psad on a logging server
requires that check_firewall_rules() and <br>
auto_psad_response() not be executed since the firewall is
probably not being run locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --Version <br>
Print the psad version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-daemon <br>
Do not run psad as a daemon. This option will display scan
alerts on STDOUT instead of emailing them out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ipt-errors <br>
Occasionally iptables messages written by syslog to
/var/log/messages seem to not conform to the normal firewall
logging format if the kernel ring buffer used by klogd <br>
becomes full. psad will write these message to
/var/log/psad/errs/fwerrorlog by default. Passing the
--no-ipt-errors option will make psad ignore all such
erroneous <br>
firewall messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-whois <br>
By default psad will issue a whois query against any IP from
which a scan has originated, but this can be disabled with
the --no-whois command line argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-fwcheck <br>
psad performs a rudimentary check of the firewall ruleset
that exists on the machine on which psad is deployed to
determine whether or not the firewall has a compatible <br>
configuration (i.e. iptables has been configured to log
packets). Passing the --no-fwcheck or --log-server options
will disable this check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-auto-dl <br>
Disable auto danger level assignments. This will instruct to
not import any IP addresses or networks from the file
/etc/psad/auto_dl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-snort-sids <br>
Disable snort sid processing mode. This will instruct psad
to not import snort rules (for snort SID matching in a
policy generated by fwsnort ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-signatures <br>
Disable psad signature processing. Note that this is
independent of snort SID matching in iptables messages
generated by fwsnort and also from the ICMP type/code
valida&acirc; <br>
tion routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-icmp-types <br>
Disable ICMP type and code field validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-passive-os <br>
By default psad will attempt to passively (i.e. without
sending any packets) fingerprint the remote operating system
from which a scan originates. Passing the --no-pas&acirc;
<br>
sive-os option will disable this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-rdns <br>
psad normally attempts to find the name associated with a
scanning IP address, but this feature can be disabled with
the --no-rdns command line argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-kmsgsd <br>
Disable startup of kmsgsd. This option is most useful for
debugging with individual iptables messages so that new
messages are not appended to the /var/log/psad/fwdata <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-netstat <br>
By default for iptables firewalls psad will determine
whether or not your machine is listening on a port for which
a TCP signature has been matched. Specifying --no-net&acirc;
<br>
stat disables this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a page of usage information for psad and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/psad/psad.conf <br>
The main psad configuration file which contains
configuration variables mentioned in the section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/psad/fw_search.conf <br>
Used to configure the strategy both psad and kmsgsd employ
to parse iptables messages. Using configuration directive
within this file, psad can be configured to parse all <br>
iptables messages or only those that match specific log
prefix strings (see the --log-prefix option to
iptables).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/psad/signatures <br>
Contains the signatures psad uses to recognize nasty
traffic. The signatures are written in a manner similar to
the *lib signature files used in the snort IDS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/psad/icmp_types <br>
Contains all valid ICMP types and corresponding codes as
defined by RFC 792. By default, ICMP packets are validated
against these values and an alert will be generated if <br>
a non-matching ICMP packet is logged by iptables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/psad/snort_rules/*.rules
<br>
Snort rules files that are consulted by default unless the
--no-snort-sids commmand line argument is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/psad/auto_dl <br>
Contains a listing of any IP addresses that should be
assigned a danger level based on any traffic that is logged
by the firewall. The syntax is &quot;&lt;IP address&gt;
&lt;danger <br>
level&gt;&quot; where &lt;danger level&gt; is an integer
from 0 to 5, with 0 meaning to ignore all traffic from
&lt;IP address&gt;, and 5 is to assign the highest danger
level to &lt;IP <br>
address&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/psad/posf <br>
Contains a listing of all passive operating system
fingerprinting signatures. These signatures include packet
lengths, ttl, tos, IP ID, and TCP window size values that
<br>
are specific to various operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSAD CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
<br>
This section describes what each of the more important psad
configuration variables do and how they can be tuned to meet
your needs. Most of the variables are located in the <br>
psad configuration file /etc/psad/psad.conf but the
FW_SEARCH_ALL and FW_MSG_SEARCH variables are located in the
file /etc/psad/fw_search.conf. Each variable is assigned
sensi&acirc; <br>
ble defaults for most network architectures during the
install process. More information on psad config keywords
may be found at:
http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/config.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMAIL_ADDRESSES <br>
Contains a comma-separated list of email addresses to which
email alerts will be sent. The default is
&quot;root@localhost&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTNAME <br>
Defines the hostname of the machine on which psad is
running. This will be used in the email alerts generated by
psad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME_NET <br>
Define the internal network(s) that are connected to the
local system. This will be used in the signature matching
code to determine whether traffic matches snort rules, <br>
which invariably contain a source and destination network.
Multiple networks are supported as a comma separated list,
and each network should be specified in CIDR nota&acirc;
<br>
tion. Normally the network(s) contained in the HOME_NET
variable should be directly connected to the machine that is
running psad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORT_OLD_SCANS <br>
Preserve scan data across restarts of psad or even across
reboots of the machine. This is accomplished by importing
the data contained in the filesystem cache psad writes <br>
to during normal operation back into memory as psad is
started. The filesystem cache data in contained within the
directory /var/log/psad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FW_SEARCH_ALL <br>
Defines the search mode psad uses to parse iptables
messages. By default FW_SEARCH_ALL is set to &quot;Y&quot;
since normally most people want all iptables log messages to
be <br>
parsed for scan activity. However, if FW_SEARCH_ALL is set
to &quot;N&quot;, psad will only parse those iptables log
messages that match certain search strings that appear in
ipta&acirc; <br>
bles logs with the --log-prefix option. This is useful for
restricting psad to only operate on specific iptables chains
or rules. The strings that will be searched for <br>
are defined with the FW_MSG_SEARCH variable (see below). The
FW_SEARCH_ALL variable is defined in the file
/etc/psad/fw_search.conf since it is referenced by both psad
<br>
and kmsgsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FW_MSG_SEARCH <br>
Defines a set of search strings that psad uses to identify
iptables messages that should be parsed for scan activity.
These search strings should match the log prefix <br>
strings specified in the iptables ruleset with the
--log-prefix option, and the default value for FW_MSG_SEARCH
is &quot;DROP&quot;. Note that psad normally parses all
iptables <br>
messages, and so the FW_MSG_SEARCH variable is only needed
if FW_SEARCH_ALL (see above) is set to &quot;N&quot;. The
FW_MSG_SEARCH variable is referenced by both psad and kmsgsd
so <br>
it lives in the file /etc/psad/fw_search.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSLOG_DAEMON <br>
Define the specific syslog daemon that psad should interface
with. Psad supports three syslog daemons: syslogd,
syslog-ng, and metalog. The default value of
SYSLOG_DAE&acirc; <br>
MON is syslogd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORE_PORTS <br>
Specify a list of port ranges and/or individual ports and
corresponding protocols that psad should complete ignore.
This is particularly useful for ignore ports that are <br>
used as a part of a port knocking scheme (such as fwknop
http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/) for network
authentication since such log messages generated by the
knock <br>
sequence may otherwise be interpreted as a scan. Multiple
ports and/or port ranges may be specified as a
comma-separated list, e.g. &quot;tcp/22, tcp/61000-61356,
udp/53&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENABLE_PERSISTENCE <br>
If &quot;Y&quot;, psad will keep all scans in memory and not
let them timeout. This can help discover stealthy scans
where an attacker tries to slip beneath IDS thresholds by
only <br>
scanning a few ports over a long period of time.
ENABLE_PERSISTENCE is set to &quot;Y&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCAN_TIMEOUT <br>
If ENABLE_PERSISTENCE is &quot;N&quot; then psad will use
the value set by SCAN_TIMEOUT to remove packets from the
scan threshold calculation. The default is 3600 seconds (1
hour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DANGER_LEVEL{1,2,3,4,5} <br>
psad uses a scoring system to keep track of the severity a
scans reaches (represented as a &quot;danger level&quot;)
over time. The DANGER_LEVEL{n} variables define the number
of <br>
packets that must be dropped by the firewall before psad
will assign the respective danger level to the scan. A scan
may also be assigned a danger level if the scan <br>
matches a particular signature contained in the signatures
file. There are five possible danger levels with one being
the lowest and five the highest. Note there are <br>
several factors that can influence how danger levels are
calculated: whether or not a scan matches a signature listed
in /etc/psad/signatures, the value of <br>
PORT_RANGE_SCAN_THRESHOLD (see below), whether or not a scan
comes from an IP that is listed in the /etc/psad/auto_dl
file, and finally whether or not scans are allowed to <br>
timeout as determined by SCAN_TIMEOUT above. If a signature
is matched or the scanning IP is listed in
/etc/psad/auto_dl, then the corresponding danger level is
automati&acirc; <br>
cally assigned to the scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORT_RANGE_SCAN_THRESHOLD <br>
Defines the minimum difference between the lowest port and
the highest port scanned before an alert is sent (the
default is 1 which means that at least two ports must be
<br>
scanned to generate an alert). For example, suppose an ip
repeatedly scans a single port for which there is no special
signature in signatures. Then if <br>
PORT_RANGE_SCAN_THRESHOLD=1, psad will never send an alert
for this &quot;scan&quot; no matter how many packets are
sent to the port (i.e. no matter what the value of
DANGER_LEVEL1 <br>
is). The reason for the default of 1 is that a
&quot;scan&quot; usually means that at least two ports are
probed, but if you want psad to be extra paranoid you can
set <br>
PORT_RANGE_SCAN_THRESHOLD=0 to alert on scans to single
ports (as long as the number of packets also exceeds
DANGER_LEVEL1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHOW_ALL_SIGNATURES <br>
If &quot;Y&quot;, psad will display all signatures detected
from a single scanning IP since a scan was first detected
instead of just displaying newly-detected signatures. <br>
SHOW_ALL_SIGNATURES is set to &quot;N&quot; by default. All
signatures are listed in the file /etc/psad/signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SNORT_SID_STR <br>
Defines the string kmsgsd will search for in iptables log
messages that are generated by iptables rules designed to
detect snort rules. The default is &quot;SID&quot;. See
fwsnort <br>
(http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwsnort/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENABLE_DSHIELD_ALERTS <br>
Enable dshield alerting mode. This will send a parsed
version of iptables log messages to dshield.org which is a
(free) distributed intrusion detection service. For more
<br>
information, see http://www.dshield.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORE_CONNTRACK_BUG_PKTS <br>
If &quot;Y&quot;, all TCP packets that have the ACK or RST
flag bits set will be ignored by psad since usually we see
such packets being blocked as a result of the iptables
connec&acirc; <br>
tion tracking bug. Note there are no signatures that make
use of the RST flag and very few that use ACK flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALERT_ALL <br>
If &quot;Y&quot;, send email for all new bad packets instead
of just when a danger level increases. ALERT_ALL is set to
&quot;Y&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSAD_EMAIL_LIMIT <br>
Defines the maximum number of emails that will be sent for a
single scanning IP (default is 50). This variable gives you
some protection from psad sending countless <br>
alerts if an IP scans your machine constantly. psad will
send a special alert if an IP has exceeded the email limit.
If PSAD_EMAIL_LIMIT is set to zero, then psad will <br>
ignore the limit and send alert emails indefinitely for any
scanning ip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMAIL_ALERT_DANGER_LEVEL <br>
Defines the danger level a scan must reach before any alert
is sent. This variable is set to 1 by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENABLE_AUTO_IDS <br>
psad has the capability of dynamically blocking all traffic
from an IP that has reached a (configurable) danger level
through modification of iptables or tcpwrapper rule&acirc;
<br>
sets. IMPORTANT: This feature is disabled by default since
it is possible for an attacker to spoof packets from a well
known (web)site in an effort to make it look as <br>
though the site is scanning your machine, and then psad will
consequently block all access to it. Also, psad works by
parsing firewall messages for packets the firewall <br>
has already dropped, so the &quot;scans&quot; are
unsuccessful anyway. However, some administrators prefer to
take this risk anyway reasoning that they can always review
which <br>
sites are being blocked and manually remove the block if
necessary (see the --Flush option). Your mileage will
vary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_IDS_DANGER_LEVEL <br>
Defines the danger level a scan must reach before psad will
automatically block the IP (ENABLE_AUTO_IDS must be set to
&quot;Y&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples illustrate the command line arguments
that could be supplied to psad in a few situations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signature checking, passive OS
fingerprinting, and automatic IP danger level assignments
are enabled by default without having to specify any command
line arguments (best for <br>
most situations):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># psad</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above, but this time we
use the init script to start psad:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># /etc/init.d/psad start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use psad as a forensics tool to
analyze an old iptables logfile (psad defaults to analyzing
the /var/log/messages file if the -m option is not
specified):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># psad -A -m &lt;iptables
logfile&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run psad in forensics mode, but
limit its operations to a specific IP address
&quot;10.1.1.1&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># psad -A -m &lt;iptables
logfile&gt; --analysis-fields src:10.1.1.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generate graphs of scan data
using AfterGlow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># psad --CSV --CSV-fields src
dst dp --CSV-max 1000 -m &lt;iptables logfile&gt; | perl
afterglow.pl -c color.properties | neato -Tgif -o
iptables_graph.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The psad.conf, signatures, and
auto_dl files are normally located within the /etc/psad/
directory, but the paths to each of these files can be
changed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># psad -c &lt;config file&gt; -s
&lt;signatures file&gt; -a &lt;auto ips file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disable the firewall check and
the local port lookup subroutines; most useful if psad is
deployed on a syslog logging server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># psad --log-server
--no-netstat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disable reverse dns and whois
lookups of scanning IP addresses; most useful if speed of
psad is the main concern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># psad --no-rdns --no-whois</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPENDENCIES <br>
psad requires that iptables is configured with a &quot;drop
and log&quot; policy for any traffic that is not explicitly
allowed through. This is consistent with a secure network
configu&acirc; <br>
ration since all traffic that has not been explicitly
allowed should be blocked by the firewall ruleset. By
default, psad attempts to determine whether or not the
firewall has <br>
been configured in this way. This feature can be disabled
with the --no-fwcheck or --log-server options. The
--log-server option is useful if psad is running on a syslog
log&acirc; <br>
ging server that is separate from the firewall. For more
information on compatible iptables rulesets, see the
FW_EXAMPLE_RULES file that is bundled with the psad source
distri&acirc; <br>
bution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psad by default parses the
/var/log/messages file for all iptables log data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The --debug option can be used to display crucial
information about the psad data structures on STDOUT as a
scan generates firewall log messages. --debug disables
daemon mode <br>
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another more effective way to
peer into the runtime execution of psad is to send (as root)
a USR1 signal to the psad process which will cause psad to
dump the contents of the <br>
%Scan hash to /var/log/psad/scan_hash.$$ where $$ represents
the pid of the psad process.</p>

Send bug reports to mbr@cipherdyne.org. Suggestions and/or
comments are always welcome as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For iptables firewalls as of
Linux kernel version 2.4.26, if the ip_conntrack module is
loaded (or compiled into the kernel) and the firewall has
been configured to keep state of <br>
connections, occasionally packets that are supposed to be
part of normal TCP traffic will not be correctly identified
due to a bug in the firewall state timeouts and hence <br>
dropped. Such packets will then be interpreted as a scan by
psad even though they are not part of any malicious
activity. Fortunately, an interim fix for this problem is to
<br>
simply extend the TCP_CONNTRACK_CLOSE_WAIT timeout value in
linux/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_proto_tcp.c from 60
seconds to 2 minutes, and a set of kernel patches is <br>
included within the patches/ directory in the psad sources
to change this. (Requires a kernel recompile of course; see
the Kernel-HOWTO.) Also, by default the IGNORE_CON&acirc;
<br>
NTRACK_BUG_PKTS variable is set to &quot;Y&quot; in
psad.conf which causes psad to ignore all TCP packets that
have the ACK bit set unless the packets match a specific
signature.</p>
