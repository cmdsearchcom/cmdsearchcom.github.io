<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lvchange allows you to change the attributes of a logical
volume including making them known to the kernel ready for
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a|--activate [a][e|s|l]{y|n}
<br>
Controls the availability of the logical volumes for use.
Communicates with the kernel device-mapper driver via
libdevmapper to activate (-ay) or deactivate (-an) the <br>
logical volumes. <br>
Activation of a logical volume creates a symbolic link
/dev/VolumeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName pointing to the
device node. This link is removed on deactivation. All <br>
software and scripts should access the device through this
symbolic link and present this as the name of the device.
The location and name of the underlying device node <br>
may depend on the distribution and configuration (e.g. udev)
and might change from release to release. <br>
If autoactivation option is used (-aay), the logical volume
is activated only if it matches an item in the
activation/auto_activation_volume_list set in lvm.conf(5).
If <br>
this list is not set, then all volumes are considered for
activation. The -aay option should be also used during
system boot so it&rsquo;s possible to select which volumes
to <br>
activate using the activation/auto_activation_volume_list
setting. <br>
In a clustered VG, clvmd is used for activation, and the
following options are possible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -aey, clvmd activates the
LV in exclusive mode (with an exclusive lock), allowing a
single node to activate the LV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -asy, clvmd activates the
LV in shared mode (with a shared lock), allowing multiple
nodes to activate the LV concurrently. If the LV type
prohibits shared access, <br>
such as an LV with a snapshot, the &rsquo;s&rsquo; option is
ignored and an exclusive lock is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -ay (no mode specified),
clvmd activates the LV in shared mode if the LV type allows
concurrent access, such as a linear LV. Otherwise, clvmd
activates the LV in <br>
exclusive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -aey, -asy, and -ay, clvmd
attempts to activate the LV on all nodes. If exclusive mode
is used, then only one of the nodes will be successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -an, clvmd attempts to
deactivate the LV on all nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -aly, clvmd activates the
LV only on the local node, and -aln deactivates only on the
local node. If the LV type allows concurrent access, then
shared mode is used, <br>
otherwise exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LVs with snapshots are always
activated exclusively because they can only be used on one
node at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For local VGs -ay, -aey, and
-asy are all equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--activationmode
{complete|degraded|partial} <br>
The activation mode determines whether logical volumes are
allowed to activate when there are physical volumes missing
(e.g. due to a device failure). complete is the <br>
most restrictive; allowing only those logical volumes to be
activated that are not affected by the missing PVs. degraded
allows RAID logical volumes to be activated even <br>
if they have PVs missing. (Note that the &quot;mirror&quot;
segment type is not considered a RAID logical volume. The
&quot;raid1&quot; segment type should be used instead.)
Finally, par&acirc; <br>
tial allows any logical volume to be activated even if
portions are missing due to a missing or failed PV. This
last option should only be used when performing recovery
<br>
or repair operations. degraded is the default mode. To
change it, modify activation_mode in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K|--ignoreactivationskip <br>
Ignore the flag to skip Logical Volumes during
activation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k|--setactivationskip {y|n}
<br>
Controls whether Logical Volumes are persistently flagged to
be skipped during activation. By default, thin snapshot
volumes are flagged for activation skip. To activate <br>
such volumes, an extra --ignoreactivationskip option must be
used. The flag is not applied during deactivation. To see
whether the flag is attached, use lvs(8) command <br>
where the state of the flag is reported within lv_attr
bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cachemode
{passthrough|writeback|writethrough} <br>
Specifying a cache mode determines when the writes to a
cache LV are considered complete. When writeback is
specified, a write is considered complete as soon as it is
<br>
stored in the cache pool LV. If writethough is specified, a
write is considered complete only when it has been stored in
the cache pool LV and on the origin LV. While <br>
writethrough may be slower for writes, it is more resilient
if something should happen to a device associated with the
cache pool LV. With passthrough mode, all reads are <br>
served from origin LV (all reads miss the cache) and all
writes are forwarded to the origin LV; additionally, write
hits cause cache block invalidates. See lvmcache(7) for <br>
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cachepolicy Policy,
--cachesettings Key=Value <br>
Only applicable to cached LVs; see also lvmcache(7). Sets
the cache policy and its associated tunable settings. In
most use-cases, default values should be adequate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C|--contiguous {y|n} <br>
Tries to set or reset the contiguous allocation policy for
logical volumes. It&rsquo;s only possible to change a
non-contiguous logical volume&rsquo;s allocation policy to
contiguous, <br>
if all of the allocated physical extents are already
contiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detachprofile <br>
Detach any metadata configuration profiles attached to given
Logical Volumes. See lvm.conf(5) for more information about
metadata profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--discards
{ignore|nopassdown|passdown} <br>
Set this to ignore to ignore any discards received by a thin
pool Logical Volume. Set to nopassdown to process such
discards within the thin pool itself and allow the no- <br>
longer-needed extents to be overwritten by new data. Set to
passdown (the default) to process them both within the thin
pool itself and to pass them down the underlying <br>
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--errorwhenfull {y|n} <br>
Sets thin pool behavior when data space is exhaused. See
lvcreate(8) for information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignoremonitoring <br>
Make no attempt to interact with dmeventd unless --monitor
is specified. Do not use this if dmeventd is already
monitoring a device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--major Major <br>
Sets the major number. This option is supported only on
older systems (kernel version 2.4) and is ignored on modern
Linux systems where major numbers are dynamically <br>
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minor Minor <br>
Set the minor number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--metadataprofile ProfileName
<br>
Uses and attaches ProfileName configuration profile to the
logical volume metadata. Whenever the logical volume is
processed next time, the profile is automatically <br>
applied. If the volume group has another profile attached,
the logical volume profile is preferred. See lvm.conf(5) for
more information about metadata profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--monitor {y|n} <br>
Start or stop monitoring a mirrored or snapshot logical
volume with dmeventd, if it is installed. If a device used
by a monitored mirror reports an I/O error, the failure <br>
is handled according to mirror_image_fault_policy and
mirror_log_fault_policy set in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noudevsync <br>
Disable udev synchronisation. The process will not wait for
notification from udev. It will continue irrespective of any
possible udev processing in the background. You <br>
should only use this if udev is not running or has rules
that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p|--permission {r|rw} <br>
Change access permission to read-only or read/write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M|--persistent {y|n} <br>
Set to y to make the minor number specified persistent.
Change of persistent numbers is not supported for pool
volumes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--poll {y|n} <br>
Without polling a logical volume&rsquo;s backgrounded
transformation process will never complete. If there is an
incomplete pvmove or lvconvert (for example, on rebooting
after <br>
a crash), use --poll y to restart the process from its last
checkpoint. However, it may not be appropriate to
immediately poll a logical volume when it is activated, use
<br>
--poll n to defer and then --poll y to restart the
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[raid]rebuild PhysicalVolume
<br>
Option can be repeated multiple times. Selects
PhysicalVolume(s) to be rebuild in a RaidLV. Use this option
instead of --resync or --[raid]syncaction repair in case the
<br>
PVs with corrupted data are known and their data should be
reconstructed rather than reconstructing default (rotating)
data. <br>
E.g. in a raid1 mirror, the master leg on /dev/sda may hold
corrupt data due to a known transient disk error, thus <br>
lvchange --rebuild /dev/sda LV <br>
will request the master leg to be rebuild rather than
rebuilding all other legs from the master. On a raid5 with
rotating data and parity <br>
lvchange --rebuild /dev/sda LV <br>
will rebuild all data and parity blocks in the stripe on
/dev/sda.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[raid]maxrecoveryrate
Rate[b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G] <br>
Sets the maximum recovery rate for a RAID logical volume.
Rate is specified as an amount per second for each device in
the array. If no suffix is given, then <br>
KiB/sec/device is assumed. Setting the recovery rate to 0
means it will be unbounded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[raid]minrecoveryrate
Rate[b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G] <br>
Sets the minimum recovery rate for a RAID logical volume.
Rate is specified as an amount per second for each device in
the array. If no suffix is given, then <br>
KiB/sec/device is assumed. Setting the recovery rate to 0
means it will be unbounded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[raid]syncaction
{check|repair} <br>
This argument is used to initiate various RAID
synchronization operations. The check and repair options
provide a way to check the integrity of a RAID logical
volume <br>
(often referred to as &quot;scrubbing&quot;). These options
cause the RAID logical volume to read all of the data and
parity blocks in the array and check for any discrepancies
<br>
(e.g. mismatches between mirrors or incorrect parity
values). If check is used, the discrepancies will be counted
but not repaired. If repair is used, the discrepancies <br>
will be corrected as they are encountered. The lvs(8)
command can be used to show the number of discrepancies
found or repaired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[raid]writebehind IOCount <br>
Specify the maximum number of outstanding writes that are
allowed to devices in a RAID1 logical volume that are marked
as write-mostly. Once this value is exceeded, <br>
writes become synchronous (i.e. all writes to the
constituent devices must complete before the array signals
the write has completed). Setting the value to zero clears
<br>
the preference and allows the system to choose the value
arbitrarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[raid]writemostly
PhysicalVolume[:{y|n|t}] <br>
Mark a device in a RAID1 logical volume as write-mostly. All
reads to these drives will be avoided unless absolutely
necessary. This keeps the number of I/Os to the <br>
drive to a minimum. The default behavior is to set the
write-mostly attribute for the specified physical volume in
the logical volume. It is possible to also remove the <br>
write-mostly flag by appending a &quot;:n&quot; to the
physical volume or to toggle the value by specifying
&quot;:t&quot;. The --writemostly argument can be specified
more than one time in <br>
a single command; making it possible to toggle the
write-mostly attributes for all the physical volumes in a
logical volume at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r|--readahead
{ReadAheadSectors|auto|none} <br>
Set read ahead sector count of this logical volume. For
volume groups with metadata in lvm1 format, this must be a
value between 2 and 120 sectors. The default value is <br>
&quot;auto&quot; which allows the kernel to choose a
suitable value automatically. &quot;none&quot; is equivalent
to specifying zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh <br>
If the logical volume is active, reload its metadata. This
is not necessary in normal operation, but may be useful if
something has gone wrong or if you&rsquo;re doing
cluster&acirc; <br>
ing manually without a clustered lock manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resync <br>
Forces the complete resynchronization of a mirror. In normal
circumstances you should not need this option because
synchronization happens automatically. Data is read <br>
from the primary mirror device and copied to the others, so
this can take a considerable amount of time - and during
this time you are without a complete redundant copy of <br>
your data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sysinit <br>
Indicates that lvchange(8) is being invoked from early
system initialisation scripts (e.g. rc.sysinit or an
initrd), before writeable filesystems are available. As
such, <br>
some functionality needs to be disabled and this option acts
as a shortcut which selects an appropriate set of options.
Currently this is equivalent to using --ignore&acirc; <br>
lockingfailure, --ignoremonitoring, --poll n and setting
LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --sysinit is used in
conjunction with lvmetad(8) enabled and running,
autoactivation is preferred over manual activation via
direct lvchange call. Logical volumes are <br>
autoactivated according to auto_activation_volume_list set
in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z|--zero {y|n} <br>
Set zeroing mode for thin pool. Note: already provisioned
blocks from pool in non-zero mode are not cleared in
unwritten parts when setting zero to y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES <br>
Suppress locking failure messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
Changes the permission on volume lvol1 in volume group vg00
to be read-only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvchange -pr vg00/lvol1</p>
