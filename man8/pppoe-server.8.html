<p>PPPOE-SERVER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
PPPOE-SERVER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pppoe-server - user-space PPPoE server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pppoe-server [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pppoe-server is a user-space server for PPPoE
(Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) for Linux and other
UNIX systems. pppoe-server works in concert with the pppoe
client to <br>
respond to PPPoE discovery packets and set up PPPoE
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-F The -F option causes pppoe-server not to fork and become
a daemon. The default is to fork and become a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I interface <br>
The -I option specifies the Ethernet interface to use. Under
Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1. The interface should be
&quot;up&quot; before you start pppoe-server, but need <br>
not have an IP address. You can supply multiple -I options
if you want the server to respond on more than one
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X pidfile <br>
This option causes pppoe-server to write its process ID to
pidfile. Additionally, it keeps the file locked so that only
a single process may be started for a given pid&acirc; <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q /path/to/pppd <br>
Specifies the full path to the pppd program. The default is
determined at compile time. One use of this option is to
supply a wrapper program that modifies the arguments <br>
passed to pppd. This lets you do things not directly
supported by the server (for example, specify IPv6
addresses.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q /path/to/pppoe <br>
Specifies the full path to the pppoe program. The default is
determined at compile time. This option is only relevant if
you are not using kernel-mode PPPoE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T timeout <br>
This option is passed directly to pppoe; see pppoe(8) for
details. If you are using kernel-mode PPPoE, this option has
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C ac_name <br>
Specifies which name to report as the access concentrator
name. If not supplied, the host name is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S name <br>
Offer a service named name. Multiple -S options may be
specified; each one causes the named service to be
advertised in a Service-Name tag in the PADO frame. The
first <br>
-S option specifies the default service, and is used if the
PPPoE client requests a Service-Name of length zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSS This option is passed
directly to pppoe; see pppoe(8) for details. If you are
using kernel-mode PPPoE, this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x n Limit the number of
sessions per peer MAC address to n. If a given MAC address
attempts to create more than n sessions, then its PADI and
PADR packets are ignored. If <br>
you set n to 0 (the default), then no limit is imposed on
the number of sessions per peer MAC address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s This option is passed
directly to pppoe; see pppoe(8) for details. In addition, it
causes pppd to be invoked with the sync option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L ip Sets the local IP address.
This is passed to spawned pppd processes. If not specified,
the default is 10.0.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R ip Sets the starting remote
IP address. As sessions are established, IP addresses are
assigned starting from ip. pppoe-server automatically keeps
track of the pool of <br>
addresses and passes a valid remote IP address to pppd. If
not specified, a starting address of 10.67.15.1 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Delegate the allocation of IP
addresses to pppd. If specified, no local and remote
addresses passed to pppd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N num Allows at most num
concurrent PPPoE sessions. If not specified, the default is
64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O fname <br>
This option causes pppoe-server to tell pppd to use the
option file fname instead of the default
/etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p fname <br>
Reads the specified file fname which is a text file
consisting of one IP address per line. These IP addresses
will be assigned to clients. The number of sessions allowed
<br>
will equal the number of addresses found in the file. The -p
option overrides both -R and -N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to containing IP
addresses, the pool file can contain lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a.b.c.d-e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which includes all IP addresses
from a.b.c.d to a.b.c.e. For example, the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2.3.4-7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2.3.4 <br>
1.2.3.5 <br>
1.2.3.6 <br>
1.2.3.7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Tells the PPPoE server to
randomly permute session numbers. Instead of handing out
sessions in order, the session numbers are assigned in an
unpredictable order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Tells the server to invoke
pppd with the unit option. Note that this option only works
for pppd version 2.4.0 or newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o offset <br>
Instead of numbering PPPoE sessions starting at 1, they will
be numbered starting at offset+1. This allows you to run
multiple servers on a given machine; just make sure <br>
that their session numbers do not overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f disc:sess <br>
The -f option sets the Ethernet frame types for PPPoE
discovery and session frames. The types are specified as
hexadecimal numbers separated by a colon. Standard PPPoE
<br>
uses frame types 8863:8864. You should not use this option
unless you are absolutely sure the peer you are dealing with
uses non-standard frame types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k The -k option tells the
server to use kernel-mode PPPoE on Linux. This option is
available only on Linux kernels 2.4.0 and later, and only if
the server was built with <br>
kernel-mode support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i The -i option tells the
server to completely ignore PADI frames if there are no free
session slots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h The -h option prints a brief
usage message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
pppoe-server listens for incoming PPPoE discovery packets.
When a session is established, it spawns a pppd process. The
following options are passed to pppd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodetach noaccomp nobsdcom
nodeflate nopcomp novj novjccomp <br>
default-asyncmap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the local and
remote IP address are set based on the -L and -R options.
The pty option is supplied along with a pppoe command to
initiate the PPPoE session. <br>
Finally, additional pppd options can be placed in the file
/etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options (which must exist, even if it
is just empty!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that pppoe-server is meant
mainly for testing PPPoE clients. It is not a
high-performance server meant for production use.</p>
