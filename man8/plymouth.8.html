plymouth - A graphical boot system and logger
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>plymouth</b> is a graphical boot system for Linux which takes advantage of
  the kernel-based mode setting (KMS) available for modern graphic cards to
  provide a seamless, flickerfree and attractive boot screen. It allows to
  choose between various, static or animated graphical themes to spruce up the
  startup and avoid the noise generated by the vast amount of kernel messages
  while the machine boots into X. On systems where kernel-based mode setting is
  not available, plymouth falls back to a text mode boot screen which provides a
  simple progress bar to pro&#x2010; vide feedback during boot.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order for the configured default plymouth theme to be loaded during boot, the
  option `splash' (or `rhgb' for backward compatibility with the RHGB boot
  splash) must be provided at the kernel command line. Without this command line
  option, plymouth will default to showing detailed boot output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
During the boot process, the user can switch between the graphical theme and the
  detailed boot output using the Escape key.
