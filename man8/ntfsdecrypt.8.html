<p>NTFSDECRYPT(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
NTFSDECRYPT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntfsdecrypt - decrypt or update NTFS files encrypted
according to EFS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntfsdecrypt [options] -k key.pfx device file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntfsdecrypt decrypts a file from an unmounted device and
print the decrypted data on the standard output. It can also
update an encrypted file with the encryption key
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NTFS file encryption (known
as EFS) uses a two-level encryption : first, the file
contents is encrypted with a random symmetric key, then this
symmetric key is encrypted with <br>
the public keys of each of the users allowed to decrypt the
file (RSA public key encryptions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three symmetric encryption modes
are currently implemented in ntfsdecrypt : DESX (a DES
variant), 3DES (triple DES) and AES_256 (an AES
variant).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the encrypted symmetric keys
are stored along with the file in a special extended
attribute named &quot;$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM&quot;. Usually,
at least two users are allowed to read <br>
the file : its owner and the recovery manager who is able to
decrypt all the files in a company. When backing up an
encrypted file, it is important to also backup the
corre&acirc; <br>
sponding $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM, otherwise the file cannot
be decrypted, even by the recovery manager. Also note that
encrypted files are slightly bigger than apparent, and the
<br>
option &quot;efs_raw&quot; has to be used when backing up
encrypted files with ntfs-3g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ntfsdecrypt is used to
update a file, the keys and the $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM are
kept unchanged, so a single key file has to be
designated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note : the EFS encryption is
only available in professional versions of Windows;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsdecrypt
accepts. Nearly all options have two equivalent names. The
short name is preceded by - and the long name is preceded by
<br>
--. Any single letter options, that don&rsquo;t take an
argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g. -fv is
equivalent to -f -v. Long named options can be abbreviated
to <br>
any unique prefix of their name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --inode NUM <br>
Display or update the contents of a file designated through
its inode number instead of its name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --encrypt <br>
Update an existing encrypted file and get the new contents
from the standard input. The full public and private key
file has to be designated, as the symmetric key is kept <br>
unchanged, so the private key is needed to extract it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using
a mounted volume. Use this option with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keyfile-name key.pfx <br>
Define the file which contains the public and private keys
in PKCS#12 format. This file obviously contains the keys of
one of the users allowed to decrypt or update the <br>
file. It has to be extracted from Windows in PKCS#12 format
(its usual suffix is .p12 or .pfx), and it is protected by a
passphrase which has to be typed in for the keys <br>
to be extracted. This can be the key file of any user
allowed to read the file, including the one of the recovery
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show a list of options with a brief description of each
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show the version number, copyright and license of
ntfsdecrypt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Display more debug/warning/error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Display the contents of the file hamlet.doc in the directory
Documents of the root of the NTFS file system on the device
/dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfsdecrypt -k foo.key /dev/sda1
Documents/hamlet.doc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update the file hamlet.doc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfsdecrypt -k foo.key /dev/sda1
Documents/hamlet.doc &lt; new.doc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are no known problems with ntfsdecrypt. If you find a
bug please send an email describing the problem to the
development team: <br>
ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
ntfsdecrypt was written by Yuval Fledel, Anton Altaparmakov
and Yura Pakhuchiy. It was ported to ntfs-3g by Erik Larsson
and upgraded by Jean-Pierre Andre.</p>
