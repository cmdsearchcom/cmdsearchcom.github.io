<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gdnsd-plugin-simplefo is designed to do simple
active/passive failover between one primary address and one
secondary address. The status of the addresses are checked
with <br>
standard gdnsd &quot;service_types&quot; monitoring. If you
need more than a simple two-address failover list, the
&quot;metafo&quot; plugin is more appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOP-LEVEL PLUGIN CONFIG <br>
At the top level of the plugin&rsquo;s configuration stanza,
the special parameter &quot;service_types&quot; is
supported. These sets the default per-resource
&quot;service_types&quot; for all resources. <br>
The default default &quot;service_types&quot; is &quot;[ up
]&quot;, which simply sets them all &quot;UP&quot;
statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the hash entries at
the top level are the names of the resources you define.
Each resource gets a configuration hash of its own for
containing resource-specific <br>
address info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCE CONFIG <br>
Within a resource, &quot;service_types&quot; is again
supported, to set the monitored service type(s) for this
specific resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;addrs_v4&quot; is
defined, it must be a hash containing two keys:
&quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot;, each of which
has an IPv4 string address value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, if
&quot;addrs_v6&quot; is defined, it must be a hash
containing two keys: &quot;primary&quot; and
&quot;secondary&quot;, each of which has an IPv6 string
address value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither of those two
sub-stanzas is defined, you must define a single pair of
&quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; addresses for
the whole resource. These can be of either address <br>
family, so long as they are both the same family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;addrs_v4&quot; and/or
&quot;addrs_v6&quot; are used, &quot;service_types&quot; can
also be overridden within each, for different behavior
per-address-family (e.g. force one protocol always <br>
up/down).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATIONAL MECHANICS <br>
For each address family for which you have supplied data,
the following logic is applied independently:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; First, the worst
monitored state of all &quot;service_types&quot; checks for
the primary address is obtained. If this state is
&quot;UP&quot;, the primary address is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the primary
address was &quot;DOWN&quot;, the secondary address is
checked: If the secondary is &quot;UP&quot;, it will be
used. If the secondary is also &quot;DOWN&quot;, then the
primary is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In any case
other than the primary being exactly &quot;UP&quot;, the
response RR-set TTL from the zonefile will be cut in half
for both address families.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both &quot;primary&quot; and
&quot;secondary&quot; were &quot;DOWN&quot; for either
address family, this plugin will signal total resource
failure to any upstream module (geoip or metafo). The
cutting of <br>
the TTL only happens once for all address RRs, even if both
families had a non-&quot;UP&quot; primary.</p>
