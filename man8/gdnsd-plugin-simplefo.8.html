<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>gdnsd-plugin-simplefo</b> is designed to do simple active/passive failover
  between one primary address and one secondary address. The status of the
  addresses are checked with standard gdnsd &quot;service_types&quot;
  monitoring. If you need more than a simple two-address failover list, the
  &quot;metafo&quot; plugin is more appropriate.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TOP-LEVEL_PLUGIN_CONFIG"><a class="selflink" href="#TOP-LEVEL_PLUGIN_CONFIG">TOP-LEVEL
  PLUGIN CONFIG</a></h1>
At the top level of the plugin's configuration stanza, the special parameter
  &quot;service_types&quot; is supported. These sets the default per-resource
  &quot;service_types&quot; for all resources. The default default
  &quot;service_types&quot; is &quot;[ up ]&quot;, which simply sets them all
  &quot;UP&quot; statically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The rest of the hash entries at the top level are the names of the resources you
  define. Each resource gets a configuration hash of its own for containing
  resource-specific address info.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESOURCE_CONFIG"><a class="selflink" href="#RESOURCE_CONFIG">RESOURCE
  CONFIG</a></h1>
Within a resource, &quot;service_types&quot; is again supported, to set the
  monitored service type(s) for this specific resource.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If &quot;addrs_v4&quot; is defined, it must be a hash containing two keys:
  &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot;, each of which has an IPv4
  string address value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, if &quot;addrs_v6&quot; is defined, it must be a hash containing two
  keys: &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot;, each of which has an IPv6
  string address value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If neither of those two sub-stanzas is defined, you must define a single pair of
  &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; addresses for the whole
  resource. These can be of either address family, so long as they are both the
  same family.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When &quot;addrs_v4&quot; and/or &quot;addrs_v6&quot; are used,
  &quot;service_types&quot; can also be overridden within each, for different
  behavior per-address-family (e.g. force one protocol always up/down).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPERATIONAL_MECHANICS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPERATIONAL_MECHANICS">OPERATIONAL
  MECHANICS</a></h1>
For each address family for which you have supplied data, the following logic is
  applied independently:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">First, the worst monitored state of all
      &quot;service_types&quot; checks for the primary address is obtained. If
      this state is &quot;UP&quot;, the primary address is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the primary address was &quot;DOWN&quot;, the secondary
      address is checked: If the secondary is &quot;UP&quot;, it will be used.
      If the secondary is also &quot;DOWN&quot;, then the primary is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In any case other than the primary being exactly
      &quot;UP&quot;, the response RR-set TTL from the zonefile will be cut in
      half for both address families.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If both &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; were &quot;DOWN&quot; for
  <b>either</b> address family, this plugin will signal total resource failure
  to any upstream module (geoip or metafo). The cutting of the TTL only happens
  once for all address RRs, even if both families had a non-&quot;UP&quot;
  primary.
