<p>MD-MX-CTRL(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
MD-MX-CTRL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
md-mx-ctrl - Control mimedefang-multiplexor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
md-mx-ctrl [options] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
md-mx-ctrl is a command-line tool for communicating with
mimedefang-multiplexor(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Displays usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s path <br>
Specifies the path to the mimedefang-multiplexor socket. If
not specified, defaults to
/var/spool/MIMEDefang/mimedefang-multiplexor.sock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This flag causes md-mx-ctrl
to sit in a loop, reading commands on standard input and
printing results to standard output. It is intended for use
by a monitoring program <br>
such as watch-mimedefang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Prints the status of all
slave Perl processes in human-readable format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawstatus <br>
Prints the status of all slave Perl processes in a format
easy to parse by computer. The result is a single line with
six words on it. The words are separated by a sin&acirc;
<br>
gle space character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each character in the first word
corresponds to a slave, and is &quot;I&quot; for an idle
slave, &quot;B&quot; for a busy slave, &quot;S&quot; for a
slave which is not running, and &quot;K&quot; for a slave
<br>
which has been killed, but has not yet exited. A slave is
&quot;idle&quot; if there is a running Perl process waiting
to do work. &quot;Busy&quot; means the Perl process is
currently fil&acirc; <br>
tering a message. &quot;S&quot; means there is no associated
Perl process with the slave, but one can be started if the
load warrants. Finally, &quot;K&quot; means the slave Perl
process <br>
has been killed, but has yet to terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second word is the total
number of messages processed since the multiplexor started
up. The third word is the total number of slaves which have
been activated since <br>
the multiplexor started up. (That is, it&rsquo;s a count of
the number of times the multiplexor has forked and
exec&rsquo;d the Perl filter.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fourth word is the size of
the queue for request queuing, and the fifth word is the
actual number of requests in the queue. The sixth word is
the number of seconds <br>
elapsed since the multiplexor was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">barstatus <br>
Prints the status of busy slaves and queued requests in a
nice &quot;bar chart&quot; format. This lets you keep an eye
on things with a script like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while true ; do <br>
md-mx-ctrl barstatus <br>
sleep 1 <br>
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histo Prints a histogram showing
the number of slaves that were busy each time a request was
processed. A single line is printed for the numbers from 1
up to the maximum number <br>
of slaves. Each line contains the count of busy slaves (1,
2, 3 up to MX_MAXIMUM), a space, and the number of times
that many slaves were busy when a request was pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load Prints a table showing
&quot;load averages&quot; for the last 10 seconds, 1 minute,
5 minutes and 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each row in the table
corresponds to a time interval, displayed in the first
column. The remaining columns in the table are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Msgs: The number of messages
scanned within the row&rsquo;s time interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Msgs/Sec: The average number of
messages scanned per second within the row&rsquo;s time
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avg Busy Slaves: The average
number of busy slaves whenever a message was scanned. (If
you are processing any mail at all, this number will be at
least 1, because there <br>
is always 1 busy slave when a message is scanned.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have the watch(1) command
on your system, you can keep an eye on the load with this
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch -n 10 md-mx-ctrl load</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not have watch, the
following shell script is a less fancy equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
while true; do <br>
clear <br>
date <br>
md-mx-ctrl load <br>
sleep 10 <br>
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawload</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints the load averages in
computer-readable format. The format consists of twenty-nine
space-separated numbers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first four are integers
representing the number of messages scanned in the last 10
seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second four are
floating-point numbers representing the average number of
busy slaves in the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and
10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third four are
floating-point numbers representing the average time per
scan in milliseconds over the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5
minutes and 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fourth four are the number
of slave activations (new slaves started) over the last 10
seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fifth four are the number of
slaves reaped (slaves that have exited) over the last 10
seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sixth four are the number of
busy, idle, stopped and killed slaves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The seventh four are the number
of messages processed, the number of slave activations, the
size of the request queue, and the number of requests
actually on the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final number is the number
of seconds since the multiplexor was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-relayok <br>
Similar to load, but shows timings for filter_relay
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-senderok <br>
Similar to load, but shows timings for filter_sender
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-recipok <br>
Similar to load, but shows timings for filter_recipient
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawload-relayok <br>
Similar to rawload, but shows timings for filter_relay
calls. Note that the slave activation and reap statistics
are present, but always 0. They are only valid in a <br>
rawload command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawload-senderok <br>
Similar to rawload, but shows timings for filter_sender
calls. Note that the slave activation and reap statistics
are present, but always 0. They are only valid in a <br>
rawload command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawload-recipok <br>
Similar to rawload, but shows timings for filter_recipient
calls. Note that the slave activation and reap statistics
are present, but always 0. They are only valid in a <br>
rawload command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load1 nsecs <br>
The load1 command displays the load for various commands
over the last nsecs seconds, where nsecs is an integer from
10 to 600. The load1 command combines the output of <br>
load, load-relayok, load-senderokf and load-recipok into one
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might use the command like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch -n 10 md-mx-ctrl load1
60</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawload1 nsecs <br>
Returns the load1 data in human-readable format. The result
is a line containing twenty-six space-separated numbers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first three numbers are the
number of scans performed in the last nsecs seconds, the
average number of busy slaves when a scan was initiated and
the average number of <br>
milliseconds per scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second three are the same
measurements for filter_relay calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third three are the same
measurements for filter_sender calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fourth three are the same
measurements for filter_relay calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The thirteenth through sixteenth
numbers are the number of busy, idle, stopped and killed
slaves, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The seventeenth number is the
number of scans since mimedefang-multiplexor was
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The eighteenth number is the
number of times a new slave has been activated since program
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nineteenth number is the
size of the request queue and the twentieth number is the
actual number of queued requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The twenty-first number is the
time since program startup and the twenty-second number is a
copy of nsecs for convenience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The twenty-third through
twenty-sixth numbers are the number of slaves currently
executing a scan, relayok, senderok and recipok command
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slaves Displays a list of slaves
and their process IDs. Each line of output consists of a
slave number, a status (I, B, K, or S), and for idle or busy
slaves, the process-ID of <br>
the slave. For busy slaves, the line may contain additional
information about what the slave is doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">busyslaves <br>
Similar to slaves, but only outputs a line for each busy
slave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slaveinfo n <br>
Displays information about slave number n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reread Forces
mimedefang-multiplexor to kill all idle slaves, and
terminate and restart busy slaves when they become idle.
This forces a reread of filter rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msgs Prints the total number of
messages scanned since the multiplexor started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDITIONAL COMMANDS <br>
You can supply any other command and arguments to
md-mx-ctrl. It percent-encodes each command-line argument,
glues the encoded arguments together with a single space
between <br>
each, and sends the result to the multiplexor as a command.
This allows you to send arbitrary commands to your Perl
slaves. See the section &quot;EXTENDING MIMEDEFANG&quot; in
mimede&acirc; <br>
fang-filter(5) for additional details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERMISSIONS <br>
md-mx-ctrl uses the multiplexor&rsquo;s socket; therefore,
it probably needs to be run as root or the same user as
mimedefang-multiplexor.</p>
