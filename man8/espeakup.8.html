<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Espeakup bridges the gap between two tools: the Speakup
screen review system and the ESppeak text-to-speech engine.
Each of these tools performs a well-defined task. Speakup is
<br>
a kernel-based screen reader for the Linux console. It
extracts and processes the text that is displayed on the
foreground virtual console. It supports several hardware
based <br>
speech synthesizers directly. However, since it is in kernel
space, it cannot support a software speech synthesizer
directly since these are in user space. ESpeak is a popular
<br>
software speech synthesizer. It is small, light weight, very
responsive, and supports multiple languages. Espeakup is a
connector which will read text sent to it by speakup and
<br>
forward it to ESpeak. This allows Speakup to use ESpeak as
its speech synthesizer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Espeakup is a daemon. Typically,
it is started at boot time, and it terminates when the
system is halted or rebooted. It should be started by the
system&rsquo;s init scripts. This <br>
process varies among Linux distributions, but the details
are usually managed by the person who packaged Espeakup for
your distribution. From the perspective of an average user,
<br>
Espeakup&rsquo;s operation is invisible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Espeakup is still classified as alpha software. Bugs are
periodically found and fixed. If you find a bug, please do
report it to the author. You might also consider mentioning
<br>
it on the mailing list for the Speakup screenreader. Visit
http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup to
learn more about the mailing list.</p>
