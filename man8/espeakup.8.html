Espeakup bridges the gap between two tools: the Speakup screen review system and
  the ESppeak text-to-speech engine. Each of these tools performs a well-defined
  task. Speakup is a kernel-based screen reader for the Linux console. It
  extracts and processes the text that is displayed on the foreground virtual
  console. It supports several hardware based speech synthesizers directly.
  However, since it is in kernel space, it cannot support a software speech
  synthesizer directly since these are in user space. ESpeak is a popular
  software speech synthesizer. It is small, light weight, very responsive, and
  supports multiple languages. Espeakup is a connector which will read text sent
  to it by speakup and forward it to ESpeak. This allows Speakup to use ESpeak
  as its speech synthesizer.

Espeakup is a daemon. Typically, it is started at boot time, and it terminates
  when the system is halted or rebooted. It should be started by the system's
  init scripts. This process varies among Linux distributions, but the details
  are usually managed by the person who packaged Espeakup for your distribution.
  From the perspective of an average user, Espeakup's operation is invisible.

Espeakup is still classified as alpha software. Bugs are periodically found and
  fixed. If you find a bug, please do report it to the author. You might also
  consider mentioning it on the mailing list for the Speakup screenreader. Visit
  http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup to learn more about the
  mailing list.
