<p>XINETD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual XINETD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xinetd - the extended Internet services daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xinetd [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xinetd performs the same function as inetd: it starts
programs that provide Internet services. Instead of having
such servers started at system initialization time, and be
dor&acirc; <br>
mant until a connection request arrives, xinetd is the only
daemon process started and it listens on all service ports
for the services listed in its configuration file. When a
<br>
request comes in, xinetd starts the appropriate server.
Because of the way it operates, xinetd (as well as inetd) is
also referred to as a super-server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The services listed in
xinetd&rsquo;s configuration file can be separated into two
groups. Services in the first group are called
multi-threaded and they require the forking of a new <br>
server process for each new connection request. The new
server then handles that connection. For such services,
xinetd keeps listening for new requests so that it can spawn
new <br>
servers. On the other hand, the second group includes
services for which the service daemon is responsible for
handling all new connection requests. Such services are
called <br>
single-threaded and xinetd will stop handling new requests
for them until the server dies. Services in this group are
usually datagram-based.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So far, the only reason for the
existence of a super-server was to conserve system resources
by avoiding to fork a lot of processes which might be
dormant for most of their life&acirc; <br>
time. While fulfilling this function, xinetd takes advantage
of the idea of a super-server to provide features such as
access control and logging. Furthermore, xinetd is not <br>
limited to services listed in /etc/services. Therefore,
anybody can use xinetd to start special-purpose servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEWARE of xinetd reload
termination handling. For services with type = INTERNAL,
SIGTERM signal will be sent. For services without type =
INTERNAL, SIGKILL signall will be <br>
sent. Take this into an account when dealing with proper
handling of the SIGTERM and SIGKILL. It is important to be
aware of this as your xinetd service could be killed on a
<br>
xinetd reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Enables debug mode. This produces a lot of debugging
output, and it makes it possible to use a debugger on
xinetd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-syslog syslog_facility <br>
This option enables syslog logging of xinetd-produced
messages using the specified syslog facility. The following
facility names are supported: daemon, auth, user, <br>
local[0-7] (check syslog.conf(5) for their meanings). This
option is ineffective in debug mode since all relevant
messages are sent to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-filelog logfile <br>
xinetd-produced messages will be placed in the specified
file. Messages are always appended to the file. If the file
does not exist, it will be created. This option is <br>
ineffective in debug mode since all relevant messages are
sent to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config_file <br>
Determines the file that xinetd uses for configuration. The
default is /etc/xinetd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pidfile pid_file <br>
The process ID is written to the file. This option is
ineffective in debug mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dontfork <br>
Tells xinetd to stay in the foreground rather than detaching
itself, to support being run from init or daemontools. This
option automatically sets -stayalive (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stayalive <br>
Tells xinetd to stay running even if no services are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-limit proc_limit <br>
This option places a limit on the number of concurrently
running processes that can be started by xinetd. Its purpose
is to prevent process table overflows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logprocs limit <br>
This option places a limit on the number of concurrently
running servers for remote userid acquisition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
This option causes xinetd to print out its version
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inetd_compat <br>
This option causes xinetd to read /etc/inetd.conf in
addition to the standard xinetd config files.
/etc/inetd.conf is read after the standard xinetd config
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc interval <br>
This option instructs xinetd to perform periodic consistency
checks on its internal state every interval seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syslog and filelog options
are mutually exclusive. If none is specified, the default is
syslog using the daemon facility. You should not confuse
xinetd messages with mes&acirc; <br>
sages related to service logging. The latter are logged only
if this is specified via the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROLLING XINETD <br>
xinetd performs certain actions when it receives certain
signals. The actions associated with the specific signals
can be redefined by editing config.h and recompiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP causes a hard
reconfiguration, which means that xinetd re-reads the
configuration file and terminates the servers for services
that are no longer available. Access <br>
control is performed again on running servers by checking
the remote location, access times and server instances. If
the number of server instances is lowered, <br>
some arbitrarily picked servers will be killed to satisfy
the limit; this will happen after any servers are terminated
because of failing the remote location or <br>
access time checks. Also, if the INTERCEPT flag was clear
and is set, any running servers for that service will be
terminated; the purpose of this is to ensure <br>
that after a hard reconfiguration there will be no running
servers that can accept packets from addresses that do not
meet the access control criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGQUIT causes program
termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM terminates all running
servers before terminating xinetd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 causes an internal state
dump (the default dump file is /var/run/xinetd.dump; to
change the filename, edit config.h and recompile).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGIOT causes an internal
consistency check to verify that the data structures used by
the program have not been corrupted. When the check is
completed xinetd will gen&acirc; <br>
erate a message that says if the check was successful or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On reconfiguration the log files
are closed and reopened. This allows removal of old log
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/xinetd.conf default configuration file <br>
/var/run/xinetd.dump <br>
default dump file</p>
