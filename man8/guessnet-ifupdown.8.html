<p>GUESSNET(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
GUESSNET(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
guessnet - guess which LAN a network interface is connected
to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
guessnet [options] [network_interface]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Guessnet guesses which LAN a network interface is connected
to. Given a list of candidate profiles each of which
includes a test description, guessnet runs all the tests in
par&acirc; <br>
allel and prints the name of the profile whose test was the
first one to succeed. If no test succeeds within a certain
timeout period then a default profile name is printed. <br>
After printing a profile name, guessnet immediately kills
any tests that are still running and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Candidate profiles are read
either from a test description file or, in ifupdown mode,
from /etc/network/interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options follow the usual GNU conventions. In ifupdown mode,
options can also be specified on the standard input in the
form &quot;&lt;long-option-name&gt;:
&lt;value&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --config-file=filename <br>
Name of the configuration file to use if not specified on
command line. Default: standard input or
/etc/network/interfaces in ifupdown mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autofilter <br>
Only useful when operating in ifupdown mode (see below).
Instructs guessnet to only consider logical interface names
that start with physical interface name being mapped. <br>
(ie: eth0-home only matches when mapping eth0) Default:
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Print debugging messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --default=string <br>
Interface name to print if no known networks are found.
Default: none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show a brief summary of
command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ifupdown-mode <br>
Operate in ifupdown mode: parse the input as if it is in the
format of /etc/network/interfaces and read from
/etc/network/interfaces instead of the standard input if the
<br>
configuration filename is not specified. See the ifupdown
mode section below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--init-time=int <br>
Time in seconds to wait for the interface to initialize when
it is not found already up at program startup. Default: 3
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--init-delay=int <br>
Sleep a given number of seconds before starting operations.
May be useful in case interface driver needs a little time
to settle before reacting to commands. Default: 0 <br>
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--iwscan-tries=int <br>
Retry wireless network scanning a given amount. Useful if
your driver needs some attempts to return a network list.
Default: 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog <br>
Send messages to syslog facility DAEMON, in addition to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout=int <br>
Timeout in seconds used to wait for tests to terminate.
Default: 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Operate verbosely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version number of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST DESCRIPTION FILE <br>
guessnet takes as input a description of the tests it should
perform. The test description file looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Empty lines and lines starting
with &rsquo;#&rsquo; are ignored. <br>
# Other lines contain: <br>
# &lt;profile-name&gt; &lt;test-method&gt;
&lt;parameters&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># At home, look for a host with
the given IP and MAC address <br>
home peer 192.168.1.1 00:01:02:03:04:05</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># At the university, check for
the presence of at least one <br>
# of the following hosts <br>
university peer 130.136.1.1 05:06:03:02:01:0A <br>
university peer 130.136.1.2 15:13:B3:A2:2F:CD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># If the peer doesn&rsquo;t
reply to ARP packets coming from 0.0.0.0 <br>
# then you can additionally specify a source address to use
<br>
university peer 130.136.1.2 15:13:B3:A2:2F:CD
130.136.1.250</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># For the work network use a
custom script <br>
work command /usr/local/bin/check_work</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Commands are executed by
&quot;sh -c&quot; so shell syntax can be used <br>
john-irda command grep -q &lsquo;cat
~enrico/john-irda-id&lsquo; /proc/net/irda/discovery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Location name and interface
name are exported in NAME and IFACE <br>
weirdnet command /usr/local/bin/weirddetect
&quot;$NAME&quot; &quot;$IFACE&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Profile &quot;none&quot; is
selected if no network signal is detected <br>
# (i.e. there is no cable plugged into the socket) <br>
no-net missing-cable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Match a wireless network with
the given essid <br>
home wireless essid Home <br>
# You can also match the mac address of the access point
<br>
home wireless mac 01:02:03:04:0A:0B <br>
# Or both <br>
home wireless essid Home mac 01:02:03:04:0A:0B <br>
# You can also match any open network <br>
anyopen wireless open</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every non-comment line
represents a test to perform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first word in the line is
the name that will be printed if the test succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second word is the test
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remainder of the line
contains parameters for the selected test; these vary
depending on the test type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IFUPDOWN MODE <br>
ifupdown, Debian&rsquo;s standard network configuration
system, permits one to define different &quot;logical
interfaces&quot; (ifupdown&rsquo;s name for configuration
profiles) and to choose among <br>
them when one configures a network interface. The choice can
be delegated to an external &quot;mapping&quot; program.
guessnet can be used as such a program if it is run in
&quot;ifupdown <br>
mode&quot;. guessnet runs in ifupdown mode if it is invoked
as guessnet-ifupdown or if it is given the --ifupdown-mode
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ifupdown mode guessnet reads
test data directly from the logical interface definitions in
/etc/network/interfaces rather than from a separate test
description file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ifupdown mode if names are
passed to guessnet on its standard input then guessnet
considers only those logical interface definitions;
otherwise it considers them all. You can <br>
have ifupdown deliver data to guessnet&rsquo;s standard
input using the map directive. See interfaces(5) for more
information. If names are preceded with &quot;!&quot;
character then match is <br>
inverted, meaning that all logical interfaces will be
processed except for the ones specified in standard input.
You cannot mix normal and negated interface names in the
same <br>
mapping directive. Note: when using autofilter option (see
above) you can broaden or tighten the automatic matching by
specifying interface names as descripted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that you have to
specify the fully qualified path to guessnet
(/usr/sbin/guessnet-ifupdown), as otherwise it won&rsquo;t
be run at system boot, as /usr/sbin is not on PATH <br>
of networking init script any more. Also, you need to ensure
/usr is actually mounted at that moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ifupdown mode options are
selected by passing &quot;&lt;long-option-name&gt;:
&lt;value&gt;&quot; on guessnet&rsquo;s standard input. This
feature is provided because ifupdown cannot pass command
line <br>
arguments to mapping scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you prefer you can precede
the test keyword in /etc/network/interfaces with the word
guessnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifupdown does not allow two
option lines in /etc/network/interfaces to start with the
same word. To work around this limitation, multiple test (or
guessnet) lines can have dif&acirc; <br>
ferent numerals suffixed to their initial keywords (test1,
test2, or guessnet1, guessnet2, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an example of an
/etc/network/interfaces file that has been set up for
guessnet:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto lo eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface lo inet loopback</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mapping eth0 <br>

map default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mapping eth1 <br>
script /usr/sbin/guessnet-ifupdown <br>
# Disable open net checking, just comment out if you are
<br>
# desperate enough :) (see relative stanza below) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifupdown mode syntax: <br>
test peer address IP-address [mac MAC-address] [source
IP-address]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description: <br>
Look for peer using ARP. The test will succeed if a network
interface with the specified IP address (and MAC address if
specified) is connected to the local network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can omit the MAC address, in
which case guessnet only tests for the presence of a host
with the specified IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the peer whose presence you
want to test for refuses to reply to ARP packets coming from
0.0.0.0 then specify some source IP address from which the
peer will accept <br>
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple peers can be specified
(on multiple lines) but each peer must have a different IP
address. This restriction may be eliminated in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also omit the IP address
and only use the MAC: that is useful to test for the
existance of physical interfaces with changing IP addresses.
This kind of scan uses <br>
an ICMP ping packet requires a source address in most cases,
as hosts tend not to reply to pings coming from nowhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wireless <br>
Test description file syntax: <br>
profile wireless [essid essid] [mac MAC-address]
[open|closed]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifupdown mode syntax: <br>
test wireless [essid essid] [mac MAC-address]
[open|closed]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description: <br>
Perform a wireless scan like iwlist scan does, and match the
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The test succeeds if the scan
reports at least one network for which all the tests (essid,
mac of the access point, network is open or closed)
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case more than one profile
matches a network, only the first one, as found in the
configuration file, will succeed. This allows prioritising
profiles: for example, you <br>
can prefer your home access point to an open network by
listing it first in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing-cable <br>
Test description file syntax: <br>
profile missing-cable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifupdown mode syntax: <br>
test missing-cable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description: <br>
Check for link beat. The test is successful if link beat is
not detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature allows guessnet to
detect the case where there is no cable plugged into a
network socket; in this case it makes no sense to go through
other detection phases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This test can be used in
ifupdown mode too if a dummy logical interface is defined
that includes the test missing-cable option. Bear in mind
that when the cable is <br>
unplugged, ifupdown will consider the interface to be
configured as this dummy logical interface. That is somewhat
counterintuitive; one might prefer the interface to be <br>
deconfigured in that case. Unfortunately, guessnet is not
currently able to tell ifup to refrain from configuring an
interface. The problem can be solved, however, by <br>
means of the ifplugd(8) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link beat detection is not
supported on all network hardware. If the interface or its
driver does not support link beat detection then this test
does not succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command <br>
Test description file syntax: <br>
profile command command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifupdown mode syntax: <br>
test command command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description: <br>
Test using an arbitrary command. The test is considered
successful if the command terminates with exit status 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Location name and interface name
are exported to the script via the NAME and IFACE
environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility,
script can be used instead of command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experimental tests <br>

Test description file syntax: <br>
profile pppoe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifupdown mode syntax: <br>
test pppoe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description: <br>
Use the pppoe program to send PADI packets in order to look
for access concentrators. The test should succeed if a PPPOE
modem is present on the given interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this test requires that
pppoe be installed on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wireless <br>
Test description file syntax: <br>
profile wireless [mac MAC-address] [essid ESSID]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifupdown mode syntax: <br>
test wireless [mac MAC-address] [essid ESSID]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description: <br>
Test certain properties of the wireless interface. More
specifically, test the MAC address and/or the ESSID of the
associated access point. If both are given then <br>
MAC-address must precede ESSID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blanks may be included in the
ESSID. For example, <br>
prof1 wireless essid My LAN <br>
tests for an ESSID of &quot;My LAN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the wireless test does
not attempt to change these properties; it only examines
them. This test is designed to work with programs such as
waproamd which inde&acirc; <br>
pendently and dynamically manage the wireless network
adapter to keep it associated to an access point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the wireless test is
not yet implemented cleanly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if one of several
tests terminates successfully then any other tests still
running will be terminated with the KILL signal. Therefore,
test programs should not need to <br>
do any special cleanup on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Getting remote host MAC addresses <br>
When you prepare the test data for guessnet you may need to
know the MAC address of a remote interface in the local
network. There are various ways to obtain this. The easiest
<br>
is to use the arping utility by doing &quot;arping
[hostname]&quot;. If you don&rsquo;t have arping installed
on your system then try the command &quot;arp -a
[hostname]&quot; which will display the MAC <br>
address if it is in the ARP cache of your machine. You might
want to ping the remote interface first to make sure that
you have the information in the cache. You can also take
<br>
a look at the /usr/share/doc/guessnet/examples/getmac
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple tests <br>
Currently guessnet only supports specifying one kind of test
per profile.</p>
