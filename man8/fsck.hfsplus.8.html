<p>FSCK_HFS(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FSCK_HFS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fsck.hfsplus &acirc; HFS file system consistency check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fsck.hfsplus -q [-df] special ... <br>
fsck.hfsplus -p [-df] special ... <br>
fsck.hfsplus [-n | -y | -r] [-dfgxlE] [-D flags] [-b size]
[-B path] [-m mode] [-c size] [-R flags] special ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fsck.hfsplus utility verifies and repairs standard HFS
and HFS+ file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form of fsck.hfsplus
quickly checks the specified file systems to determine
whether they were cleanly unmounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form of fsck.hfsplus
preens the specified file systems. It is normally started by
fsck(8) run from /etc/rc.boot during automatic reboot, when
a HFS file system is <br>
detected. When preening file systems, fsck.hfsplus will fix
common inconsistencies for file systems that were not
unmounted cleanly. If more serious problems are found, <br>
fsck.hfsplus does not try to fix them, indicates that it was
not successful, and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form of fsck.hfsplus
checks the specified file systems and tries to repair all
detected inconsistencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no options are specified
fsck.hfsplus will always check and attempt to fix the
specified file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c size Specify the size of the
cache used by fsck.hfsplus internally. Bigger size can
result in better performance but can result in deadlock when
used with -l option. <br>
Size can be specified as a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal
number. If the number ends with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;k&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;m&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;g&rsquo;&rsquo;, the number is multiplied by
1024 (1K), 1048576 <br>
(1M), or 1073741824 (1G), respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Display debugging
information. This option may provide useful information when
fsck.hfsplus cannot repair a damaged file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D flags Print extra debugging
information. The flags are a bitmap that control which kind
of debug information is printed. The following values are
currently implemented: <br>
0x0001 Informational messages <br>
0x0002 Error messages <br>
0x0010 Extended attributes related messages <br>
0x0020 Overlapped extents related messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b size Specify the size, in
bytes, of the physical blocks used by the -B option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B path Print the files
containing the physical blocks listed in the file path. The
file should contain one or more decimal, octal (with leading
0) or hexadecimal (with <br>
leading 0x) numbers separated by white space. The physical
block numbers are relative to the start of the partition, so
if you have block numbers relative to the <br>
start of the device, you will have to subtract the block
number of the start of the partition. The size of a physical
block is given with the -b option; the default <br>
is 512 bytes per block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f When used with the -p option,
force fsck.hfsplus to check &lsquo;clean&rsquo; file
systems, otherwise it means force fsck.hfsplus to check and
repair journaled HFS+ file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Causes fsck.hfsplus to
generate its output strings in GUI format. This option is
used when another application with a graphical user
interface (like Mac OS X Disk <br>
Utility) is invoking the fsck.hfsplus tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Causes fsck.hfsplus to
generate its output strings in XML (plist) format. This
option implies the -g option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Lock down the file system and
perform a test-only check. This makes it possible to check a
file system that is currently mounted, although no repairs
can be made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mode Mode is an octal number
that will be used to set the permissions for the lost+found
directory when it is created. The lost+found directory is
only created when a <br>
volume is repaired and orphaned files or directories are
detected. fsck.hfsplus places orphaned files and directories
into the lost+found directory (located at the <br>
root of the volume). The default mode is 01777.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Preen the specified file
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Causes fsck.hfsplus to
quickly check whether the volume was unmounted cleanly. If
the volume was unmounted cleanly, then the exit status is 0.
If the volume was not <br>
unmounted cleanly, then the exit status will be non-zero. In
either case, a message is printed to standard output
describing whether the volume was clean or dirty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Always attempt to repair any
damage that is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Never attempt to repair any
damage that is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Cause fsck.hfsplus to exit
(with a value of 47) if it encounters any major errors. A
&lsquo;&lsquo;major error&rsquo;&rsquo; is considered one
which would impact using the volume in normal <br>
usage; an inconsistency which would not impact such use is
considered &lsquo;&lsquo;minor&rsquo;&rsquo; for this
option. Only valid with the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R flags Rebuilds the requested
btree. The following flags are supported: <br>
a Attribute btree <br>
c Catalog btree <br>
e Extents overflow btree <br>
Rebuilding a btree will only work if there is enough free
space on the file system for the new btree file, and if
fsck.hfsplus is able to traverse each of the nodes <br>
in the requested btree successfully. Rebuilding btrees is
not supported on HFS Standard volumes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Rebuild the catalog btree.
This is synonymous with -Rc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of inconsistencies
between the block device and the buffer cache, the raw
device should always be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT VALUES <br>
fsck.hfsplus indicates some status by exit value. The
current list of exit status results is: <br>
0 No errors found, or successfully repaired. <br>
3 A quick-check (the -n option) found a dirty filesystem; no
repairs were made. <br>
4 During boot, the root filesystem was found to be dirty;
repairs were made, and the filesystem was remounted. The
system should be rebooted. <br>
8 A corrupt filesystem was found during a check, or repairs
did not succeed. <br>
47 A major error was found with -E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
fsck.hfsplus is not able to fix some inconsistencies that it
detects.</p>
