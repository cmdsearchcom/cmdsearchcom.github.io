 -c : Check configuration
<br/>

<br/>

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
-c checks your installed configuration. This makes sure there are no existing
  errors in the current <i>cfingerd.conf</i> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-e allows you to emulate a local finger on a user that exists on your system.
  This lets you test cfingerd on your system before installing it. Using the
  &quot;-e&quot; directive is the same as installing the software, typing
  &quot;finger username@&quot; and getting the output. Using &quot;-e
  username&quot; does the same.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-o turns off all finger queries. This makes it so that no one can finger your
  system - no matter what they try to do. Unlike the other options, this option
  is used in inetd.conf, not on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-v requests cfingerd version information.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>CFINGERD</b> is a totally new, and totally configurable finger daemon - one
  of the first. It listenes on the finger port (port 79) to provide useful
  information about each user that is on your system according to the finger
  protocol as described in RFC 1288. Only thing is, cfingerd provides a unique
  twist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>CFINGERD</b> was designed for the sole purpose of making output on finger
  queries configurable. If you want to change any text that is displayed during
  finger queries, you can configure the finger daemon to display just about
  anything you want.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>CFINGERD</b> also takes into account any security breaches, and attempts to
  close them. With the added bonus of creating &quot;.nofinger&quot; files, this
  is displayed instead of finger information, making it possible for users to
  keep themselves relatively anonymous from outside users. For a maximum of
  users privacy you should place an exact copy of
  <i>/etc/cfingerd/nouser_banner.txt</i> in your <i>.nofinger</i> file.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHY_WAS_IT_DONE?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHY_WAS_IT_DONE?">WHY
  WAS IT DONE?</a></h1>
The answer is simple. Security. Many sites turn off finger for the reason that
  they don't want outside users to see who's on their system, or get information
  about a specific user on their system. This seemed unfair to the rest of the
  users out there, so this program was created. Besides, those sites were
  waiting for this type of program. Many sites that originally had their finger
  turned off turned them back on because of cfingerd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many sites have complained that they wanted the ability to create a
  &quot;fake-user&quot;, or a user that doesn't exist but calls a pre-written
  shell script. <b>CFINGERD</b> has taken this into account, and provides the
  best method possible for creating such scripts. (See cfingerd.conf(5) for more
  information on the configuration file.)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FEATURES_CFINGERD_PROVIDES,_AND_DESCRIPTIONS_OF_EACH"><a class="selflink" href="#FEATURES_CFINGERD_PROVIDES,_AND_DESCRIPTIONS_OF_EACH">FEATURES
  CFINGERD PROVIDES, AND DESCRIPTIONS OF EACH</a></h1>
<b>CFINGERD</b> was totally rewritten. Why is this? Well, the older version of
  cfingerd had quite a few bugs, and it didn't quite do all of the things that
  cfingerd now does. This new version was totally revamped, and most of the bugs
  that were in the older version of cfingerd were removed in this one. Besides,
  the code in here was more compact.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Header and footer displays</b> were a very big part of the original release
  of cfingerd, and shall continue to remain in all versions. Headers and footers
  are only displays at the beginning and ending of all finger displays, and are
  used as unique little &quot;advertisements&quot; or such.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Last time displayed</b> is always a critical issue. It's covered in cfingerd.
  Cfingerd simply shows how many times this user is connected, what their idle
  time is on each TTY they're connected to, and whether or not they are
  accepting messages. If they're not accepting messages, a &quot;[MESG-N]&quot;
  display will be shown if this is the case. This display also shows the last
  time mail was read, and whether or not this user has mail. If this is still
  too much for your taste, each of these items can be disabled system wide.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Stand-alone and INETD support</b> is compiled into the program, but only
  INETD support is given for the time being. The reason being is that I have not
  yet added the code for stand-alone daemon mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>.nofinger files</b> are used when a user wishes to remain anonymous. These
  files should be placed in their home directories, and can display anything
  they want. There's just a few restrictions. These <i>.nofinger</i> display
  files cannot be character devices, directories, fifos, soft or hard links, or
  anything else of that caliber. They must only be normal files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Fakeusers</b> were supported for the simple fact that many sites want to
  create users that don't exist, and make them execute a shell. If you want this
  done, then install a fake user. Read up in <b>cfingerd.conf</b>(5) for more
  information on these useful options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Service listings</b> were used to show what fakeusers you have installed on
  your system. These can be formatted however you wish, and are explained (once
  again) in <b>cfingerd.conf</b>(5).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Searching for usernames</b> is a very powerful feature that <b>cfingerd</b>
  takes full advantage of. If you are looking for a specific username on the
  system, or don't know what their name is, simply use the search.pattern
  directive with <b>cfingerd</b> will search for all users containing pattern in
  their real name or username on that system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Searching for usernames is NOT case sensitive. You may search for a specific
  username or real name, for part of the username or real ame, or for a pattern
  matching the entire username or the entire real ame. If you search for part of
  a user's name, chances are, it'll be displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Warning</b> searching will currently return the names of daemon users and
  users
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and you will be able to search for a user on your system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Security</b> is a given. If you don't want to show someone something, then it
  won't display what you don't want. Simply edit the cfingerd.conf file and make
  changes. It's that simple.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Searching for usernames is NOT case sensitive. If you are searching for a
  specific username, or part of the user's name. If you search for part of a
  user's name or username, chances are, it'll be displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Not just PLAN, or PROJECT</b> but there's also an option to display your
  public PGP key, if you have one. This is very useful if you want to keep your
  mail or other information secret to yourself, and don't want &quot;big
  brother&quot; watching over your shoulder as you talk amongst yourselves.
  (Thanks to Andy Smith for this patch). (For your info, the standard plan file
  is <i>.plan</i>, project is <i>.project</i>, PGP info is <i>.pgpkey</i>, and
  XFace icon information is <i>.xface</i>)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember, any or all of these options stated above, can be turned on or off at
  will. If you want a specific option turned off, turn it off. :)

<b>cfingerd</b> provides a set of builtin fake users. Two of them are also used

  MESSAGES</a></h1>
Any error messages that result are fairly easy to debug if you know what to look
  for.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Segmentation Violations</b> don't always occur, but if they ever do, you can
  pretty easily figure out what's going on. Unfortunately, <b>cfingerd</b>
  doesn't have any compatibility with older <i>cfingerd.conf</i> files, so if
  you get a Segmentation Violation, this (usually) means that your
  <i>cfingerd.conf</i> file needs to be replaced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Timeouts</b> usually mean that a script has timed out, or a connection to
  another site timed out.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSLOGGING_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSLOGGING_MESSAGES">SYSLOGGING
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
Well, there's no real way to describe SYSLOG messages since they can be changed
  as the system administrator chooses. Although, examples can be given based on
  the standard configuration that was distributed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If any IP addresses cannot be matched to a name it will display a &quot;IP:
  Hostname not matched&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the renice fails (to make the program run at the highest priority) then it
  will display &quot;Fatal - Nice died: (reason)&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is no buffer information waiting in the STDIN buffer, it will display
  &quot;STDIN contains no data&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a trusted host fingers your site, a &quot;&lt;- Trusted&quot; will appear.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a rejected host fingers your site, a &quot;&lt;- Rejected&quot; will appear.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If root is fingered on your site, it will display &quot;Root&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a service listing was fingered on your site, it will display &quot;Service
  listing&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a user listing was requested, it will display &quot;User listing&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a fake user was requested, it will display &quot;Fake user&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If &quot;whois&quot; data was requested, it will display &quot;Whois
  request&quot;. (Note, whois was not implemented in this release, since it
  wasn't 'RFC' compliant.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any extra information pertaining to the incoming finger is displayed in the
  syslogging area. (It's also recommended that you reconfigure
  <b>syslog.conf</b>(5) to display to an unused VT. :)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PLANS"><a class="selflink" href="#PLANS">PLANS</a></h1>
Any other options or improvements will probably come from user suggestions. :)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Later plans will make it so that you can define your own display formats for the
  finger display. This means that you can re-define how you want your finger
  display to look.
