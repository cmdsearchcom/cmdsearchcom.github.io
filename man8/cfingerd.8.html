<p>CFINGERD(8) Configurable Finger Daemon CFINGERD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cfingerd - Configurable finger daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cfingerd [ -c | -e | -o | -v ] <br>
-c : Check configuration <br>
-e : Emulate local finger w/o inetd <br>
-o : Turn off all finger queries <br>
-v : Request version information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c checks your installed
configuration. This makes sure there are no existing errors
in the current cfingerd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e allows you to emulate a local
finger on a user that exists on your system. This lets you
test cfingerd on your system before installing it. Using the
&quot;-e&quot; directive is the <br>
same as installing the software, typing &quot;finger
username@&quot; and getting the output. Using &quot;-e
username&quot; does the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o turns off all finger queries.
This makes it so that no one can finger your system - no
matter what they try to do. Unlike the other options, this
option is used in <br>
inetd.conf, not on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v requests cfingerd version
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
CFINGERD is a totally new, and totally configurable finger
daemon - one of the first. It listenes on the finger port
(port 79) to provide useful information about each user that
<br>
is on your system according to the finger protocol as
described in RFC 1288. Only thing is, cfingerd provides a
unique twist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CFINGERD was designed for the
sole purpose of making output on finger queries
configurable. If you want to change any text that is
displayed during finger queries, you can con&acirc; <br>
figure the finger daemon to display just about anything you
want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CFINGERD also takes into account
any security breaches, and attempts to close them. With the
added bonus of creating &quot;.nofinger&quot; files, this is
displayed instead of finger <br>
information, making it possible for users to keep themselves
relatively anonymous from outside users. For a maximum of
users privacy you should place an exact copy of
/etc/cfin&acirc; <br>
gerd/nouser_banner.txt in your .nofinger file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY WAS IT DONE? <br>
The answer is simple. Security. Many sites turn off finger
for the reason that they don&rsquo;t want outside users to
see who&rsquo;s on their system, or get information about a
specific <br>
user on their system. This seemed unfair to the rest of the
users out there, so this program was created. Besides, those
sites were waiting for this type of program. Many <br>
sites that originally had their finger turned off turned
them back on because of cfingerd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many sites have complained that
they wanted the ability to create a &quot;fake-user&quot;,
or a user that doesn&rsquo;t exist but calls a pre-written
shell script. CFINGERD has taken this into <br>
account, and provides the best method possible for creating
such scripts. (See cfingerd.conf(5) for more information on
the configuration file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES CFINGERD PROVIDES, AND
DESCRIPTIONS OF EACH <br>
CFINGERD was totally rewritten. Why is this? Well, the older
version of cfingerd had quite a few bugs, and it
didn&rsquo;t quite do all of the things that cfingerd now
does. This <br>
new version was totally revamped, and most of the bugs that
were in the older version of cfingerd were removed in this
one. Besides, the code in here was more compact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Header and footer displays were
a very big part of the original release of cfingerd, and
shall continue to remain in all versions. Headers and
footers are only displays at the <br>
beginning and ending of all finger displays, and are used as
unique little &quot;advertisements&quot; or such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Last time displayed is always a
critical issue. It&rsquo;s covered in cfingerd. Cfingerd
simply shows how many times this user is connected, what
their idle time is on each TTY <br>
they&rsquo;re connected to, and whether or not they are
accepting messages. If they&rsquo;re not accepting messages,
a &quot;[MESG-N]&quot; display will be shown if this is the
case. This display <br>
also shows the last time mail was read, and whether or not
this user has mail. If this is still too much for your
taste, each of these items can be disabled system wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stand-alone and INETD support is
compiled into the program, but only INETD support is given
for the time being. The reason being is that I have not yet
added the code for stand- <br>
alone daemon mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.nofinger files are used when a
user wishes to remain anonymous. These files should be
placed in their home directories, and can display anything
they want. There&rsquo;s just a few <br>
restrictions. These .nofinger display files cannot be
character devices, directories, fifos, soft or hard links,
or anything else of that caliber. They must only be normal
<br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fakeusers were supported for the
simple fact that many sites want to create users that
don&rsquo;t exist, and make them execute a shell. If you
want this done, then install a fake <br>
user. Read up in cfingerd.conf(5) for more information on
these useful options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Service listings were used to
show what fakeusers you have installed on your system. These
can be formatted however you wish, and are explained (once
again) in cfingerd.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching for usernames is a
very powerful feature that cfingerd takes full advantage of.
If you are looking for a specific username on the system, or
don&rsquo;t know what their name <br>
is, simply use the search.pattern directive with cfingerd
will search for all users containing pattern in their real
name or username on that system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching for usernames is NOT
case sensitive. You may search for a specific username or
real name, for part of the username or real ame, or for a
pattern matching the entire <br>
username or the entire real ame. If you search for part of a
user&rsquo;s name, chances are, it&rsquo;ll be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning searching will currently
return the names of daemon users and users</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and you will be able to search
for a user on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security is a given. If you
don&rsquo;t want to show someone something, then it
won&rsquo;t display what you don&rsquo;t want. Simply edit
the cfingerd.conf file and make changes. It&rsquo;s that
<br>
simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching for usernames is NOT
case sensitive. If you are searching for a specific
username, or part of the user&rsquo;s name. If you search
for part of a user&rsquo;s name or username, <br>
chances are, it&rsquo;ll be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not just PLAN, or PROJECT but
there&rsquo;s also an option to display your public PGP key,
if you have one. This is very useful if you want to keep
your mail or other information <br>
secret to yourself, and don&rsquo;t want &quot;big
brother&quot; watching over your shoulder as you talk
amongst yourselves. (Thanks to Andy Smith for this patch).
(For your info, the standard <br>
plan file is .plan, project is .project, PGP info is
.pgpkey, and XFace icon information is .xface)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember, any or all of these
options stated above, can be turned on or off at will. If
you want a specific option turned off, turn it off. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FULL LIST OF BUILTIN USER NAMES
<br>
cfingerd provides a set of builtin fake users. Two of them
are also used internally by cfingerd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ List logged on users without
.nofinger file. If the system_list_sites option is used in
the main configuration file cfingerd will try to gather
information from all <br>
listed hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userlist@ <br>
Same as @, except that it only lists people who are idle no
longer than one day. This is intended to give a better
overview of who&rsquo;s really online at the moment of
fin&acirc; <br>
gering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userlist-only@ <br>
List logged on users without .nofinger file - without
headers and footers. This fake user is used internally to
gather system information from remote hosts for @.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userlist-online@ <br>
List logged on users without .nofinger file - without
headers and footers. Only users will be listed who are idle
no longer than a day. This fake user is used internally <br>
to gather system information from remote hosts for
userlist@.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version@ <br>
Display version information for cfingerd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">services@ <br>
List all fake users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search.pattern@ <br>
Search for users using the GCOS field in /etc/passwd. Only
users will be displayed who don&rsquo;t have a
.nofinger-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help@ Help text listing all of
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These can be disabled in
cfingerd.conf(5) as follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ and userlist@ <br>
Set SYSTEM_LIST to FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">userlist-only@ and
userlist-online@ <br>
Disable ALLOW_USERLIST_ONLY (i.e. prefix it with a minus
sign) or disable SYSTEM_LIST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version@ <br>
Disable ALLOW_CONFESSION (i.e. prefix it with a minus
sign).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">services@ <br>
Disable ALLOW_FAKEUSER_FINGER (i.e. prefix it with a minus
sign).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search.pattern@ <br>
Disable ALLOW_SEARCHABLE_FINGER (i.e. prefix it with a minus
sign).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help@ Disable ALLOW_CONFESSION
(i.e. prefix it with a minus sign).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR MESSAGES <br>
Any error messages that result are fairly easy to debug if
you know what to look for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Segmentation Violations
don&rsquo;t always occur, but if they ever do, you can
pretty easily figure out what&rsquo;s going on.
Unfortunately, cfingerd doesn&rsquo;t have any compatibility
with <br>
older cfingerd.conf files, so if you get a Segmentation
Violation, this (usually) means that your cfingerd.conf file
needs to be replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timeouts usually mean that a
script has timed out, or a connection to another site timed
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSLOGGING MESSAGES <br>
Well, there&rsquo;s no real way to describe SYSLOG messages
since they can be changed as the system administrator
chooses. Although, examples can be given based on the
standard con&acirc; <br>
figuration that was distributed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any IP addresses cannot be
matched to a name it will display a &quot;IP: Hostname not
matched&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the renice fails (to make the
program run at the highest priority) then it will display
&quot;Fatal - Nice died: (reason)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no buffer
information waiting in the STDIN buffer, it will display
&quot;STDIN contains no data&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a trusted host fingers your
site, a &quot;&lt;- Trusted&quot; will appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a rejected host fingers your
site, a &quot;&lt;- Rejected&quot; will appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If root is fingered on your
site, it will display &quot;Root&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a service listing was
fingered on your site, it will display &quot;Service
listing&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a user listing was requested,
it will display &quot;User listing&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a fake user was requested, it
will display &quot;Fake user&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;whois&quot; data was
requested, it will display &quot;Whois request&quot;. (Note,
whois was not implemented in this release, since it
wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;RFC&rsquo; compliant.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any extra information pertaining
to the incoming finger is displayed in the syslogging area.
(It&rsquo;s also recommended that you reconfigure
syslog.conf(5) to display to an unused <br>
VT. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLANS <br>
Any other options or improvements will probably come from
user suggestions. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Later plans will make it so that
you can define your own display formats for the finger
display. This means that you can re-define how you want your
finger display to look.</p>
