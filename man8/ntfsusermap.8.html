ntfsusermap - NTFS Building a User Mapping File
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>ntfsusermap</b> <i>windows-system-device</i>
  <b>[</b><i>other-ntfs-device</i><b>...</b><b>]</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where <i>windows-system-device</i> is the device containing the Windows system
  whose users are to be mapped to current Linux system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
And <i>other-ntfs-device</i> is another device containing files which are to be
  accessed both by the Windows mentioned above and current Linux system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
the ntfsusermap command must be started as root, and the designated devices must
  not be mounted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typing ntfsusermap with no args will display a summary of command arguments.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>ntfsusermap</b> creates the file defining the mapping of Windows accounts to
  Linux logins for users who owns files which should be visible from both
  Windows and Linux.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It relies on existing files which were created on Windows, trying to locate
  significant files and asking which Linux user or group should own them. When a
  Linux owner or group is requested, the reply may be :
<div class="Pp"></div>
- the uid or gid (numeric or symbolic) of Linux owner or group of the file.
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In that situation, no more file with the same
  Windows owner will be selected.</div>
- or no answer, when not able to define the owner or group.
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In that situation another file owned by the
  same Windows user or group may be selected later so that a mapping can be
  defined.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mappings for standard Windows users, such as &quot;Administrator&quot; or
  &quot;All Users&quot; are defined implicitly. As a consequence a user mapping
  should never be defined as Linux root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When there are no more significant files, ntfsusermap create the mapping file
  into the file UserMapping in the current directory. This file has to be moved
  to the hidden directory .NTFS-3G in the root of all the NTFS file systems to
  be shared between Windows and Linux. This requires the file system to be
  mounted, but the created file will not be taken into account if not present at
  mount time, which means the file system has to be unmounted and mounted again
  for the new mapping file to be taken into account.
