<p>NTFSUSERMAP(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
NTFSUSERMAP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntfsusermap - NTFS Building a User Mapping File</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntfsusermap windows-system-device [other-ntfs-device...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where windows-system-device is
the device containing the Windows system whose users are to
be mapped to current Linux system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And other-ntfs-device is another
device containing files which are to be accessed both by the
Windows mentioned above and current Linux system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the ntfsusermap command must be
started as root, and the designated devices must not be
mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing ntfsusermap with no args
will display a summary of command arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntfsusermap creates the file defining the mapping of Windows
accounts to Linux logins for users who owns files which
should be visible from both Windows and Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It relies on existing files
which were created on Windows, trying to locate significant
files and asking which Linux user or group should own them.
When a Linux owner or group is <br>
requested, the reply may be :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the uid or gid (numeric or
symbolic) of Linux owner or group of the file. <br>
In that situation, no more file with the same Windows owner
will be selected. <br>
- or no answer, when not able to define the owner or group.
<br>
In that situation another file owned by the same Windows
user or group may be selected later so that a mapping can be
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mappings for standard
Windows users, such as &quot;Administrator&quot; or
&quot;All Users&quot; are defined implicitly. As a
consequence a user mapping should never be defined as Linux
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there are no more
significant files, ntfsusermap create the mapping file into
the file UserMapping in the current directory. This file has
to be moved to the hidden direc&acirc; <br>
tory .NTFS-3G in the root of all the NTFS file systems to be
shared between Windows and Linux. This requires the file
system to be mounted, but the created file will not be taken
<br>
into account if not present at mount time, which means the
file system has to be unmounted and mounted again for the
new mapping file to be taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
No option is defined for ntfsusermap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Map the users defined on the Windows system present on
/dev/sda1 :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfsusermap /dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A detailed example, with screen
displays is available on
http://jp-andre.pagesperso-orange.fr/ntfsusermap.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
ntfsusermap exits with a value of 0 when no error was
detected, and with a value of 1 when an error was
detected.</p>
