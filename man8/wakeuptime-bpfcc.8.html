<p>wakeuptime(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
wakeuptime(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wakeuptime - Summarize sleep to wakeup time by waker kernel
stack. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wakeuptime [-h] [-u] [-p PID] [-v] [-f] [duration]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program shows the kernel stack traces for threads that
woke up other blocked threads, along with the process names
of the waker and target, along with a sum of the time that
<br>
the target was blocked: the &quot;blocked time&quot;. It
works by tracing when threads block and when they were then
woken up, and measuring the time delta. This time
measurement will be <br>
very similar to off-CPU time, however, off-CPU time may
include a little extra time spent waiting on a run queue to
be scheduled. The stack traces, process names, and time
spent <br>
blocked is summarized in the kernel using an eBPF map for
efficiency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output summary will help you
identify reasons why threads were blocking by showing who
woke them up, along with the time they were blocked. This
spans all types of blocking <br>
activity: disk I/O, network I/O, locks, page faults,
involuntary context switches, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used in conjunction
with offcputime, which shows the stack trace of the blocked
thread. wakeuptime shows the stack trace of the waker
thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stack depth is currently
limited to 20, and the stack traces are kernel mode only.
Check for newer versions where either may be improved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This currently only works on
x86_64. Check for future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Print output in folded stack
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Only trace user threads (not
kernel threads).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Show raw addresses (for
non-folded format).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PID Trace this process ID
only (filtered in-kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duration <br>
Duration to trace, in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Trace all thread blocking events, and summarize (in-kernel)
by kernel stack trace and total blocked time: <br>
# wakeuptime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace user-mode target threads
only: <br>
# wakeuptime -u</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace for 5 seconds only: <br>
# wakeuptime 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace for 5 seconds, and emit
output in folded stack format (suitable for flame graphs):
<br>
# wakeuptime -f 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace PID 185 only: <br>
# wakeuptime -p 185</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERHEAD <br>
This summarizes unique stack traces in-kernel for
efficiency, allowing it to trace a higher rate of events
than methods that post-process in user space. The stack
trace and time <br>
data is only copied to user space once, when the output is
printed. While these techniques greatly lower overhead,
scheduler events are still a high frequency event, as they
can <br>
exceed 1 million events per second, and so caution should
still be used. Test before production use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the overhead is still a
problem, take a look at the MINBLOCK_US tunable in the code.
If your aim is to chase down longer blocking events, then
this could be increased to fil&acirc; <br>
ter shorter blocking events, further lowering overhead.</p>
