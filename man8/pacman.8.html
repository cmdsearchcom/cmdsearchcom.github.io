<p>PACMAN(8) Pacman Manual PACMAN(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pacman - package manager utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pacman &lt;operation&gt; [options] [targets]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Pacman is a package management utility that tracks installed
packages on a Linux system. It features dependency support,
package groups, install and uninstall scripts, and the <br>
ability to sync your local machine with a remote repository
to automatically upgrade packages. Pacman packages are a
zipped tar format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since version 3.0.0, pacman has
been the front-end to libalpm(3), the &acirc;Arch Linux
Package Management&acirc; library. This library allows
alternative front-ends to be written (for <br>
instance, a GUI front-end).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoking pacman involves
specifying an operation with any potential options and
targets to operate on. A target is usually a package name,
file name, URL, or a search string. <br>
Targets can be provided as command line arguments.
Additionally, if stdin is not from a terminal and a single
hyphen (-) is passed as an argument, targets will be read
from <br>
stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATIONS <br>
-D, --database <br>
Operate on the package database. This operation allows you
to modify certain attributes of the installed packages in
pacman&acirc;s database. It also allows you to check the
<br>
databases for internal consistency. See Database Options
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --query <br>
Query the package database. This operation allows you to
view installed packages and their files, as well as
meta-information about individual packages (dependencies,
<br>
conflicts, install date, build date, size). This can be run
against the local package database or can be used on
individual package files. In the first case, if no package
<br>
names are provided in the command line, all installed
packages will be queried. Additionally, various filters can
be applied on the package list. See Query Options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --remove <br>
Remove package(s) from the system. Groups can also be
specified to be removed, in which case every package in that
group will be removed. Files belonging to the specified <br>
package will be deleted, and the database will be updated.
Most configuration files will be saved with a .pacsave
extension unless the --nosave option is used. See Remove
<br>
Options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --sync <br>
Synchronize packages. Packages are installed directly from
the remote repositories, including all dependencies required
to run the packages. For example, pacman -S qt will <br>
download and install qt and all the packages it depends on.
If a package name exists in more than one repository, the
repository can be explicitly specified to clarify the <br>
package to install: pacman -S testing/qt. You can also
specify version requirements: pacman -S
&quot;bash&gt;=3.2&quot;. Quotes are needed, otherwise the
shell interprets &quot;&gt;&quot; as <br>
redirection to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to packages, groups
can be specified as well. For example, if gnome is a defined
package group, then pacman -S gnome will provide a prompt
allowing you to select <br>
which packages to install from a numbered list. The package
selection is specified using a space- and/or comma-separated
list of package numbers. Sequential packages may be <br>
selected by specifying the first and last package numbers
separated by a hyphen (-). Excluding packages is achieved by
prefixing a number or range of numbers with a caret <br>
(^).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packages that provide other
packages are also handled. For example, pacman -S foo will
first look for a foo package. If foo is not found, packages
that provide the same <br>
functionality as foo will be searched for. If any package is
found, it will be installed. A selection prompt is provided
if multiple packages providing foo are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use pacman -Su to
upgrade all packages that are out-of-date. See Sync Options
below. When upgrading, pacman performs version comparison to
determine which <br>
packages need upgrading. This behavior operates as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alphanumeric: <br>
1.0a &lt; 1.0b &lt; 1.0beta &lt; 1.0p &lt; 1.0pre &lt; 1.0rc
&lt; 1.0 &lt; 1.0.a &lt; 1.0.1 <br>
Numeric: <br>
1 &lt; 1.0 &lt; 1.1 &lt; 1.1.1 &lt; 1.2 &lt; 2.0 &lt;
3.0.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, version strings
can have an epoch value defined that will overrule any
version comparison, unless the epoch values are equal. This
is specified in an <br>
epoch:version-rel format. For example, 2:1.0-1 is always
greater than 1:3.6-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --deptest <br>
Check dependencies; this is useful in scripts such as
makepkg to check installed packages. This operation will
check each dependency specified and return a list of <br>
dependencies that are not currently satisfied on the system.
This operation accepts no other options. Example usage:
pacman -T qt &quot;bash&gt;=3.2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --upgrade <br>
Upgrade or add package(s) to the system and install the
required dependencies from sync repositories. Either a URL
or file path can be specified. This is a
&acirc;remove-then-add&acirc; <br>
process. See Upgrade Options below; also see Handling Config
Files for an explanation on how pacman takes care of
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --files <br>
Query the files database. This operation allows you to look
for packages owning certain files or display files owned by
certain packages. Only packages that are part of your <br>
sync databases are searched. See File Options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display syntax for the given operation. If no operation was
supplied, then the general syntax is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --dbpath &lt;path&gt; <br>
Specify an alternative database location (a typical default
is /var/lib/pacman). This should not be used unless you know
what you are doing. NOTE: If specified, this is an <br>
absolute path, and the root path is not automatically
prepended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --root &lt;path&gt; <br>
Specify an alternative installation root (default is /).
This should not be used as a way to install software into
/usr/local instead of /usr. This option is used if you want
<br>
to install a package on a temporarily mounted partition that
is &quot;owned&quot; by another system. NOTE: If database
path or log file are not specified on either the command
line or <br>
in pacman.conf(5), their default location will be inside
this root path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Output paths such as as the Root, Conf File, DB Path, Cache
Dirs, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch &lt;arch&gt; <br>
Specify an alternate architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cachedir &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Specify an alternative package cache location (a typical
default is /var/cache/pacman/pkg). Multiple cache
directories can be specified, and they are tried in the
order they <br>
are passed to pacman. NOTE: This is an absolute path, and
the root path is not automatically prepended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color &lt;when&gt; <br>
Specify when to enable coloring. Valid options are always,
never, or auto. always forces colors on; never forces colors
off; and auto only automatically enables colors when <br>
outputting onto a tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config &lt;file&gt; <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Display debug messages. When reporting bugs, this option is
recommended to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gpgdir &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Specify a directory of files used by GnuPG to verify package
signatures (a typical default is /etc/pacman.d/gnupg). This
directory should contain two files: pubring.gpg and <br>
trustdb.gpg. pubring.gpg holds the public keys of all
packagers. trustdb.gpg contains a so-called trust database,
which specifies that the keys are authentic and trusted.
<br>
NOTE: This is an absolute path, and the root path is not
automatically prepended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hookdir &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Specify a alternative directory containing hook files (a
typical default is /etc/pacman.d/hooks). Multiple hook
directories can be specified with hooks in later directories
<br>
taking precedence over hooks in earlier directories. NOTE:
This is an absolute path, and the root path is not
automatically prepended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
Specify an alternate log file. This is an absolute path,
regardless of the installation root setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noconfirm <br>
Bypass any and all &acirc;Are you sure?&acirc; messages.
It&acirc;s not a good idea to do this unless you want to run
pacman from a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--confirm <br>
Cancels the effects of a previous --noconfirm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSACTION OPTIONS (APPLY TO
-S, -R AND -U) <br>
-d, --nodeps <br>
Skips dependency version checks. Package names are still
checked. Normally, pacman will always check a
package&acirc;s dependency fields to ensure that all
dependencies are <br>
installed and there are no package conflicts in the system.
Specify this option twice to skip all dependency checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--assume-installed
&lt;package=version&gt; <br>
Add a virtual package &quot;package&quot; with version
&quot;version&quot; to the transaction to satisfy
dependencies. This allows to disable specific dependency
checks without affecting all <br>
dependency checks. To disable all dependency checking, see
the --nodeps option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbonly <br>
Adds/removes the database entry only, leaving all files in
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noprogressbar <br>
Do not show a progress bar when downloading files. This can
be useful for scripts that call pacman and capture the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noscriptlet <br>
If an install scriptlet exists, do not execute it. Do not
use this unless you know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --print <br>
Only print the targets instead of performing the actual
operation (sync, remove or upgrade). Use --print-format to
specify how targets are displayed. The default format <br>
string is &quot;%l&quot;, which displays URLs with -S, file
names with -U, and pkgname-pkgver with -R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-format &lt;format&gt;
<br>
Specify a printf-like format to control the output of the
--print operation. The possible attributes are:
&quot;%n&quot; for pkgname, &quot;%v&quot; for pkgver,
&quot;%l&quot; for location, &quot;%r&quot; for <br>
repository, and &quot;%s&quot; for size. Implies
--print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPGRADE OPTIONS (APPLY TO -S AND
-U) <br>
--force <br>
Bypass file conflict checks and overwrite conflicting files.
If the package that is about to be installed contains files
that are already installed, this option will cause <br>
all those files to be overwritten. Using --force will not
allow overwriting a directory with a file or installing
packages with conflicting files and directories. This option
<br>
should be used with care, ideally not at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--asdeps <br>
Install packages non-explicitly; in other words, fake their
install reason to be installed as a dependency. This is
useful for makepkg and other build-from-source tools that
<br>
need to install dependencies before building the
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--asexplicit <br>
Install packages explicitly; in other words, fake their
install reason to be explicitly installed. This is useful if
you want to mark a dependency as explicitly installed so
<br>
it will not be removed by the --recursive remove
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore &lt;package&gt; <br>
Directs pacman to ignore upgrades of package even if there
is one available. Multiple packages can be specified by
separating them with a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignoregroup &lt;group&gt; <br>
Directs pacman to ignore upgrades of all packages in group,
even if there is one available. Multiple groups can be
specified by separating them with a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--needed <br>
Do not reinstall the targets that are already
up-to-date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUERY OPTIONS <br>
-c, --changelog <br>
View the ChangeLog of a package if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --deps <br>
Restrict or filter output to packages installed as
dependencies. This option can be combined with -t for
listing real orphans - packages that were installed as
dependencies <br>
but are no longer required by any installed package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --explicit <br>
Restrict or filter output to explicitly installed packages.
This option can be combined with -t to list explicitly
installed packages that are not required by any other <br>
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --groups <br>
Display all packages that are members of a named group. If a
name is not specified, list all grouped packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
Display information on a given package. The -p option can be
used if querying a package file instead of the local
database. Passing two --info or -i flags will also display
<br>
the list of backup files and their modification states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --check <br>
Check that all files owned by the given package(s) are
present on the system. If packages are not specified or
filter flags are not provided, check all installed packages.
<br>
Specifying this option twice will perform more detailed file
checking (including permissions, file sizes, and
modification times) for packages that contain the needed
mtree <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List all files owned by a given package. Multiple packages
can be specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --foreign <br>
Restrict or filter output to packages that were not found in
the sync database(s). Typically these are packages that were
downloaded manually and installed with --upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --native <br>
Restrict or filter output to packages that are found in the
sync database(s). This is the inverse filter of
--foreign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --owns &lt;file&gt; <br>
Search for packages that own the specified file(s). The path
can be relative or absolute, and one or more files can be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --file <br>
Signifies that the package supplied on the command line is a
file and not an entry in the database. The file will be
decompressed and queried. This is useful in combination <br>
with --info and --list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Show less information for certain query operations. This is
useful when pacman&acirc;s output is processed in a script.
Search will only show package names and not version, group,
<br>
and description information; owns will only show package
names instead of &quot;file is owned by pkg&quot; messages;
group will only show package names and omit group names;
list will <br>
only show files and omit package names; check will only show
pairs of package names and missing files; a bare query will
only show package names rather than names and <br>
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --search &lt;regexp&gt; <br>
Search each locally-installed package for names or
descriptions that match regexp. When including multiple
search terms, only packages with descriptions matching ALL
of those <br>
terms are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --unrequired <br>
Restrict or filter output to packages not required or
optionally required by any currently installed package.
Specify this option twice to only filter packages that are
<br>
direct dependencies (i.e. do not filter optional
dependencies).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --upgrades <br>
Restrict or filter output to packages that are out-of-date
on the local system. Only package versions are used to find
outdated packages; replacements are not checked here. <br>
This option works best if the sync database is refreshed
using -Sy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOVE OPTIONS <br>
-c, --cascade <br>
Remove all target packages, as well as all packages that
depend on one or more target packages. This operation is
recursive and must be used with care, since it can remove
<br>
many potentially needed packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nosave <br>
Instructs pacman to ignore file backup designations.
Normally, when a file is removed from the system, the
database is checked to see if the file should be renamed
with a <br>
.pacsave extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --recursive <br>
Remove each target specified including all of their
dependencies, provided that (A) they are not required by
other packages; and (B) they were not explicitly installed
by the <br>
user. This operation is recursive and analogous to a
backwards --sync operation, and it helps keep a clean system
without orphans. If you want to omit condition (B), pass
<br>
this option twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unneeded <br>
Removes targets that are not required by any other packages.
This is mostly useful when removing a group without using
the -c option, to avoid breaking any dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNC OPTIONS <br>
-c, --clean <br>
Remove packages that are no longer installed from the cache
as well as currently unused sync databases to free up disk
space. When pacman downloads packages, it saves them in <br>
a cache directory. In addition, databases are saved for
every sync DB you download from and are not deleted even if
they are removed from the configuration file <br>
pacman.conf(5). Use one --clean switch to only remove
packages that are no longer installed; use two to remove all
files from the cache. In both cases, you will have a yes or
<br>
no option to remove packages and/or unused downloaded
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use a network shared
cache, see the CleanMethod option in pacman.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --groups <br>
Display all the members for each package group specified. If
no group names are provided, all groups will be listed; pass
the flag twice to view all groups and their members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
Display information on a given sync database package.
Passing two --info or -i flags will also display those
packages in all repositories that depend on this
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List all packages in the specified repositories. Multiple
repositories can be specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Show less information for certain sync operations. This is
useful when pacman&acirc;s output is processed in a script.
Search will only show package names and not repository, <br>
version, group, and description information; list will only
show package names and omit databases and versions; group
will only show package names and omit group names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --search &lt;regexp&gt; <br>
This will search each package in the sync databases for
names or descriptions that match regexp. When you include
multiple search terms, only packages with descriptions <br>
matching ALL of those terms will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --sysupgrade <br>
Upgrades all packages that are out-of-date. Each
currently-installed package will be examined and upgraded if
a newer package exists. A report of all packages to upgrade
will <br>
be presented, and the operation will not proceed without
user confirmation. Dependencies are automatically resolved
at this level and will be installed/upgraded if
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass this option twice to enable
package downgrades; in this case, pacman will select sync
packages whose versions do not match with the local
versions. This can be useful <br>
when the user switches from a testing repository to a stable
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional targets can also be
specified manually, so that -Su foo will do a system upgrade
and install/upgrade the &quot;foo&quot; package in the same
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --downloadonly <br>
Retrieve all packages from the server, but do not
install/upgrade anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --refresh <br>
Download a fresh copy of the master package database from
the server(s) defined in pacman.conf(5). This should
typically be used each time you use --sysupgrade or -u.
Passing <br>
two --refresh or -y flags will force a refresh of all
package databases, even if they appear to be up-to-date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATABASE OPTIONS <br>
--asdeps &lt;package&gt; <br>
Mark a package as non-explicitly installed; in other words,
set their install reason to be installed as a
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--asexplicit &lt;package&gt;
<br>
Mark a package as explicitly installed; in other words, set
their install reason to be explicitly installed. This is
useful it you want to keep a package installed even when
<br>
it was initially installed as a dependency of another
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --check <br>
Check the local package database is internally consistent.
This will check all required files are present and that
installed packages have the required dependencies, do not
<br>
conflict and that multiple packages do not own the same
file. Specifying this option twice will perform a check on
the sync databases to ensure all specified dependencies are
<br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE OPTIONS <br>
-y, --refresh <br>
Download fresh package databases from the server. Use twice
to force a refresh even if databases are up to date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List the files owned by the queried package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --search <br>
Search package file names for matching strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --regex <br>
Treat arguments to --search as regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --owns <br>
Search for packages that own a particular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Show less information for certain file operations. This is
useful when pacman&acirc;s output is processed in a script,
however, you may want to use --machinereadable instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--machinereadable <br>
Use a machine readable output format for --list, --search
and --owns. The format is repository pkgname pkgver pathwith
being the NULL character and a linefeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HANDLING CONFIG FILES <br>
Pacman uses the same logic as rpm to determine action
against files that are designated to be backed up. During an
upgrade, three MD5 hashes are used for each backup file to
<br>
determine the required action: one for the original file
installed, one for the new file that is about to be
installed, and one for the actual file existing on the file
system. <br>
After comparing these three hashes, the follow scenarios can
result:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">original=X, current=X, new=X
<br>
All three files are the same, so overwrites are not an
issue. Install the new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">original=X, current=X, new=Y
<br>
The current file is the same as the original, but the new
one differs. Since the user did not ever modify the file,
and the new one may contain improvements or bug fixes, <br>
install the new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">original=X, current=Y, new=X
<br>
Both package versions contain the exact same file, but the
one on the file system has been modified. Leave the current
file in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">original=X, current=Y, new=Y
<br>
The new file is identical to the current file. Install the
new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">original=X, current=Y, new=Z
<br>
All three files are different, so install the new file with
a .pacnew extension and warn the user. The user must then
manually merge any necessary changes into the original <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">original=NULL, current=Y, new=Z
<br>
The package was not previously installed, and the file
already exists on the file system. Install the new file with
a .pacnew extension and warn the user. The user must then
<br>
manually merge any necessary changes into the original
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
pacman -Ss ne.hack <br>
Search for regexp &quot;ne.hack&quot; in package
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pacman -S gpm <br>
Download and install gpm including dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pacman -U
/home/user/ceofhack-0.6-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.gz <br>
Install ceofhack-0.6-1 package from a local file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pacman -Syu <br>
Update package list and upgrade all packages afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pacman -Syu gpm <br>
Update package list, upgrade all packages, and then install
gpm if it wasn&acirc;t already installed.</p>
