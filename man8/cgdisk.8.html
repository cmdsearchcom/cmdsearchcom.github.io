<p>CGDISK(8) GPT fdisk Manual CGDISK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cgdisk - Curses-based GUID partition table (GPT)
manipulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cgdisk device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GPT fdisk is a text-mode family of programs for creation and
manipulation of partition tables. The cgdisk member of this
family employs a curses-based user interface for
interac&acirc; <br>
tion using a text-mode menuing system. It will automatically
convert an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition
table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR carrier
parti&acirc; <br>
tion to the newer Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)
Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID partition
table. Other members of this program family are gdisk (the
most <br>
feature-rich program of the group, with a non-curses-based
interactive user interface) and sgdisk (which is driven via
command-line options for use by experts or in scripts). <br>
FixParts is a related program for fixing a limited set of
problems with MBR disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information on MBR vs. GPT,
as well as GPT terminology and structure, see the extended
GPT fdisk documentation at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/
or consult Wikipedia.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cgdisk program employs a
user interface similar to that of Linux&rsquo;s cfdisk, but
cgdisk modifies GPT partitions. It also has the capability
of transforming MBR partitions or <br>
BSD disklabels into GPT partitions. Like the original cfdisk
program, cgdisk does not modify disk structures until you
explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a mistake,
<br>
you can exit from the program with the Quit option to leave
your partitions unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, cgdisk operates on
disk device files, such as /dev/sda or /dev/hda under Linux,
/dev/disk0 under Mac OS X, or /dev/ad0 or /dev/da0 under
FreeBSD. The program can also <br>
operate on disk image files, which can be either copies of
whole disks (made with dd, for instance) or raw disk images
used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that only
<br>
raw disk images are supported; cgdisk cannot work on
compressed or other advanced disk image formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon start, cgdisk attempts to
identify the partition type in use on the disk. If it finds
valid GPT data, cgdisk will use it. If cgdisk finds a valid
MBR or BSD disklabel but no <br>
GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR or disklabel
into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have unusable
first and/or final partitions because they overlap with the
<br>
GPT data structures, though.) Upon exiting with the
&rsquo;w&rsquo; option, cgdisk replaces the MBR or disklabel
with a GPT. This action is potentially dangerous! Your
system may become <br>
unbootable, and partition type codes may become corrupted if
the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot problems are
particularly likely if you&rsquo;re multi-booting with any
<br>
GPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly launch cgdisk on an MBR
disk, you can safely exit the program without making any
changes by using the Quit option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating a fresh partition
table, certain considerations may be in order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For data (non-boot) disks, and
for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the
boot loader, partitions may be created in whatever order and
in whatever sizes <br>
are desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Boot disks for EFI-based
systems require an EFI System Partition (GPT fdisk internal
code 0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32. The recommended size of
this partition is between <br>
100 and 300 MiB. Boot-related files are stored here. (Note
that GNU Parted identifies such partitions as having the
&quot;boot flag&quot; set.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The GRUB 2 boot loader for
BIOS-based systems makes use of a BIOS Boot Partition (GPT
fdisk internal code 0xEF02), in which the secondary boot
loader is stored, without <br>
the benefit of a filesystem. This partition can typically be
quite small (roughly 32 KiB to 1 MiB), but you should
consult your boot loader documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If Windows is to boot from a
GPT disk, a partition of type Microsoft Reserved (GPT fdisk
internal code 0x0C01) is recommended. This partition should
be about 128 MiB in <br>
size. It ordinarily follows the EFI System Partition and
immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that
old versions of GNU Parted create all FAT partitions <br>
as this type, which actually makes the partition unusable
for normal file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some OSes&rsquo; GPT utilities
create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after each
partition. The intent is to enable future disk utilities to
use this space. Such free space <br>
is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help in
future disk maintenance. You can use GPT fdisk&rsquo;s
relative partition positioning option (specifying the
starting <br>
sector as &rsquo;+128M&rsquo;, for instance) to simplify
creating such gaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Interactions with cgdisk occur with its interactive
text-mode menus. The display is broken into two interactive
parts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The partition display area, in
which partitions and gaps between them (marked as &quot;free
space&quot;) are summarized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The option selection area, in
which buttons for the main options appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the top of the
display shows the program&rsquo;s name and version number,
the device filename associated with the disk, and the
disk&rsquo;s size in both sectors and IEEE-1541 <br>
units (GiB, TiB, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the following keys
to move among the various options and to select among
them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">up arrow <br>
This key moves the partition selection up by one
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down arrow <br>
This key moves the partition selection down by one
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Page Up <br>
This key moves the partition selection up by one screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Page Down <br>
This key moves the partition selection down by one
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">right arrow <br>
This key moves the option selection to the right by one
item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left arrow <br>
This key moves the option selection to the left by one
item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter This key activates the
currently selected option. You can also activate an option
by typing the capitalized letter in the option&rsquo;s name
on the keyboard, such as a to acti&acirc; <br>
vate the Align option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more partitions exist than
can be displayed in one screen, you can scroll between
screens using the partition selection keys, much as in a
text editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available options are as
described below. (Note that cgdisk provides a much more
limited set of options than its sibling gdisk. If you need
to perform partition table recovery, <br>
hybrid MBR modifcation, or other advanced operations, you
should consult the gdisk documentation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Align Change the sector
alignment value. Disks with more logical sectors than
physical sectors (such as modern Advanced Format drives),
some RAID configurations, and many SSD <br>
devices, can suffer performance problems if partitions are
not aligned properly for their internal data structures. On
new disks, GPT fdisk attempts to align partitions on <br>
2048-sector (1MiB) boundaries by default, which optimizes
performance for all of these disk types. On pre-partitioned
disks, GPT fdisk attempts to identify the alignment <br>
value used on that disk, but will set 8-sector alignment on
disks larger than 300 GB even if lesser alignment values are
detected. In either case, it can be changed by <br>
using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backup Save partition data to a
backup file. You can back up your current in-memory
partition table to a disk file using this option. The
resulting file is a binary file consist&acirc; <br>
ing of the protective MBR, the main GPT header, the backup
GPT header, and one copy of the partition table, in that
order. Note that the backup is of the current in-memory <br>
data structures, so if you launch the program, make changes,
and then use this option, the backup will reflect your
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete Delete a partition. This
action deletes the entry from the partition table but does
not disturb the data within the sectors originally allocated
to the partition on the <br>
disk. If a corresponding hybrid MBR partition exists, gdisk
deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent 0xEE (EFI GPT)
MBR protective partition to fill the new free <br>
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help Print brief descriptions of
all the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info Show detailed partition
information. The summary information shown in the partition
display area necessarily omits many details, such as the
partitions&rsquo; unique GUIDs and <br>
the partitions&rsquo; sector-exact start and end points. The
Info option displays this information for a single
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load Load partition data from a
backup file. This option is the reverse of the Backup
option. Note that restoring partition data from anything but
the original disk is not rec&acirc; <br>
ommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">naMe Change the GPT name of a
partition. This name is encoded as a UTF-16 string, but
proper entry and display of anything beyond basic ASCII
values requires suitable locale <br>
and font support. For the most part, Linux ignores the
partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. GPT
fdisk sets a default name based on the partition type <br>
code. Note that the GPT partition name is different from the
filesystem name, which is encoded in the filesystem&rsquo;s
data structures. Note also that to activate this item by
<br>
typing its alphabetic equivalent, you must use M, not the
more obvious N, because the latter is used by the next
option....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Create a new partition. You
enter a starting sector, a size, a type code, and a name.
The start sector can be specified in absolute terms as a
sector number or as a posi&acirc; <br>
tion measured in kibibytes (K), mebibytes (M), gibibytes
(G), tebibytes (T), or pebibytes (P); for instance, 40M
specifies a position 40MiB from the start of the disk. You
<br>
can specify locations relative to the start or end of the
specified default range by preceding the number by a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; symbol, as in +2G to specify a point 2GiB
after the <br>
default start sector. The size value can use the K, M, G, T,
and P suffixes, too. Pressing the Enter key with no input
specifies the default value, which is the start of <br>
the largest available block for the start sector and the
full available size for the size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit Quit from the program
without saving your changes. Use this option if you just
wanted to view information or if you make a mistake and want
to back out of all your <br>
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type Change a single
partition&rsquo;s type code. You enter the type code using a
two-byte hexadecimal number. You may also enter a GUID
directly, if you have one and cgdisk doesn&rsquo;t <br>
know it. If you don&rsquo;t know the type code for your
partition, you can type L to see a list of known type
codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verify Verify disk. This option
checks for a variety of problems, such as incorrect CRCs and
mismatched main and backup data. This option does not
automatically correct most <br>
problems, though; for that, you must use gdisk. If no
problems are found, this command displays a summary of
unallocated disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write Write data. Use this
command to save your changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As of January 2013 (version 0.8.6), cgdisk should be
considered beta software. Although the underlying partition
manipulation code is much older, the cgdisk ncurses user
inter&acirc; <br>
face is brand new with GPT fdisk version 0.8.0. Known bugs
and limitations include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program compiles correctly
only on Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. In theory, it should
compile under Windows if the Ncurses library for Windows is
installed, but I have <br>
not tested this capability. Linux versions for x86-64
(64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have been
tested, with the x86-64 version having seen the most
testing. <br>
Under FreeBSD, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions
have been tested. Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X has been
tested by the author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The FreeBSD version of the
program can&rsquo;t write changes to the partition table to
a disk when existing partitions on that disk are mounted.
(The same problem exists with <br>
many other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.)
This limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program can load only up
to 128 partitions (4 primary partitions and 124 logical
partitions) when converting from MBR format. This limit can
be raised by changing the <br>
#define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in the basicmbr.h source code
file and recompiling; however, such a change will require
using a larger-than-normal partition table. (The limit <br>
of 128 partitions was chosen because that number equals the
128 partitions supported by the most common partition table
size.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Converting from MBR format
sometimes fails because of insufficient space at the start
or (more commonly) the end of the disk. Resizing the
partition table (using the &rsquo;s&rsquo; <br>
option in the experts&rsquo; menu in gdisk) can sometimes
overcome this problem; however, in extreme cases it may be
necessary to resize a partition using GNU Parted or a
simi&acirc; <br>
lar tool prior to conversion with GPT fdisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* MBR conversions work only if
the disk has correct LBA partition descriptors. These
descriptors should be present on any disk over 8 GiB in size
or on smaller disks parti&acirc; <br>
tioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* BSD disklabel support can
create first and/or last partitions that overlap with the
GPT data structures. This can sometimes be compensated by
adjusting the partition table <br>
size, but in extreme cases the affected partition(s) may
need to be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Because of the highly variable
nature of BSD disklabel structures, conversions from this
form may be unreliable -- partitions may be dropped,
converted in a way that cre&acirc; <br>
ates overlaps with other partitions, or converted with
incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with
caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Booting after converting an
MBR or BSD disklabel disk is likely to be disrupted.
Sometimes re-installing a boot loader will fix the problem,
but other times you may need <br>
to switch boot loaders. Except on EFI-based platforms,
Windows through at least Windows 7 doesn&rsquo;t support
booting from GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the
&rsquo;h&rsquo; <br>
option on the recovery &amp; transformation menu in gdisk)
or abandoning GPT in favor of MBR may be your only options
in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The cgdisk Verify function and
the partition type listing obtainable by typing L in the
Type function (or when specifying a partition type while
creating a new partition) <br>
both currently exit ncurses mode. This limitation is a minor
cosmetic blemish that does not affect functionality.</p>
