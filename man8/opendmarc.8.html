<p>opendmarc(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
opendmarc(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
opendmarc - DMARC email policy filter for MTAs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
opendmarc [-A] [-c configfile] [-f] [-l] [-n] [-p
socketspec] [-P pidfile] [-t file[,file[...]]] [-u
userid[:group]] [-v] [-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
opendmarc implements the proposed DMARC specification for
authentication of message and reporting of observed
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opendmarc uses the milter
interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of
sendmail(8), to provide a DMARC processing service for mail
transiting a milter-aware MTA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most, if not all, of the command
line options listed below can also be set using a
configuration file. See the -c option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opendmarc relies on addition of
Authentication-Results fields by upsteam filters on trusted
hosts to collect input to the DMARC algorithm. It does not
itself do DKIM or SPF <br>
evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A Automatically re-start on failures. Use with caution; if
the filter fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a
tight fork(2) loop. This can be mitigated using <br>
some values in the configuration file to limit restarting.
See opendmarc.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c configfile <br>
Read the named configuration file. See the opendmarc.conf(5)
man page for details. Values in the configuration file are
overridden when their equivalents are provided on <br>
the command line until a configuration reload occurs. The
OPERATION section describes how reloads are triggered. The
default is to read a configuration file from <br>
/etc/opendmarc.conf if one exists, or otherwise to apply
defaults to all values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Normally opendmarc forks and
exits immediately, leaving the service running in the
background. This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it
runs in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Log via calls to syslog(3)
any interesting activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Parse the configuration file
and command line arguments, reporting any errors found, and
then exit. The exit value will be 0 if the filter would
start up without com&acirc; <br>
plaint, or non-zero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p socketspec <br>
Specifies the socket that should be established by the
filter to receive connections from sendmail(8) in order to
provide service. socketspec is in one of two forms: <br>
local:path which creates a UNIX domain socket at the
specified path, or inet:port[@host] or inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified port within the
<br>
specified protocol family. If the host is not given as
either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces. If neither socket type is <br>
specified, local is assumed, meaning the parameter is
interpreted as a path at which the socket should be created.
If an IP address is used, it must be enclosed in square <br>
brackets. This parameter is mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P pidfile <br>
Specifies a file into which the filter should write its
process ID at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t file[,file[,...]] <br>
Reads email messages from the named files and processes them
as if they were received by the filter. The service is not
started, and actions normally sent back to the MTA <br>
will instead be printed on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u userid[:group] <br>
Attempts to be come the specified userid before starting
operations. The process will be assigned all of the groups
and primary group ID of the named userid unless an <br>
alternate group is specified. See the FILE PERMISSIONS
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase verbose output
during test mode (see -t above). May be specified more than
once to request increasing amounts of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number and
supported canonicalization and signature algorithms, and
then exit without doing anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Upon receiving SIGUSR1, if the filter was started with a
configuration file, it will be re-read and the new values
used. Note that any command line overrides provided at
startup <br>
time will be lost when this is done. Also, the following
configuration file values (and their corresponding command
line items, if any) are not reloaded through this process:
<br>
AutoRestart (-A), AutoRestartCount, AutoRestartRate,
Background, MilterDebug, PidFile (-P), Socket (-p), UMask,
UserID (-u). The filter does not automatically check the
configu&acirc; <br>
ration file for changes and reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
