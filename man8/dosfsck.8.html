<p>FSCK.FAT(8) dosfstools FSCK.FAT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fsck.fat - check and repair MS-DOS filesystems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fsck.fat|fsck.msdos|fsck.vfat [-aAflnprtvVwy] [-d PATH -d
...] [-u PATH -u ...] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fsck.fat verifies the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems and
optionally tries to repair them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following filesystem
problems can be corrected (in this order):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* FAT contains invalid cluster
numbers. Cluster is changed to EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* File&rsquo;s cluster chain
contains a loop. The loop is broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Bad clusters (read errors).
The clusters are marked bad and they are removed from files
owning them. This check is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Directories with a large
number of bad entries (probably corrupt). The directory can
be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Files . and .. are
non-directories. They can be deleted or renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Directories . and .. in root
directory. They are deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Bad filenames. They can be
renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Duplicate directory entries.
They can be deleted or renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Directories with non-zero size
field. Size is set to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Directory . does not point to
parent directory. The start pointer is adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Directory .. does not point to
parent of parent directory. The start pointer is
adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Start cluster number of a file
is invalid. The file is truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* File contains bad or free
clusters. The file is truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* File&rsquo;s cluster chain is
longer than indicated by the size fields. The file is
truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Two or more files share the
same cluster(s). All but one of the files are truncated. If
the file being truncated is a directory file that has
already been read, the filesys&acirc; <br>
tem check is restarted after truncation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* File&rsquo;s cluster chain is
shorter than indicated by the size fields. The file is
truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Clusters are marked as used
but are not owned by a file. They are marked as free.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the following
problems are detected, but not repaired:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Invalid parameters in boot
sector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Absence of . and .. entries in
non-root directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When fsck.fat checks a
filesystem, it accumulates all changes in memory and
performs them only after all checks are complete. This can
be disabled with the -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Automatically repair the filesystem. No user intervention
is necessary. Whenever there is more than one method to
solve a problem, the least destructive approach is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Use Atari variation of the
MS-DOS filesystem. This is default if fsck.fat is run on an
Atari, then this option turns off Atari format. There are
some minor differences in <br>
Atari format: Some boot sector fields are interpreted
slightly different, and the special FAT entries for
end-of-file and bad cluster can be different. Under MS-DOS
0xfff8 is <br>
used for EOF and Atari employs 0xffff by default, but both
systems recognize all values from 0xfff8...0xffff as
end-of-file. MS-DOS uses only 0xfff7 for bad clusters, where
<br>
on Atari values 0xfff0...0xfff7 are for this purpose (but
the standard value is still 0xfff7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Make read-only boot sector
check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Delete the specified file. If
more that one file with that name exists, the first one is
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Salvage unused cluster chains
to files. By default, unused clusters are added to the free
disk space except in auto mode (-a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List path names of files
being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No-operation mode:
non-interactively check for errors, but don&rsquo;t write
anything to the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Same as (-a), for
compatibility with other *fsck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Interactively repair the
filesystem. The user is asked for advice whenever there is
more than one approach to fix an inconsistency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Mark unreadable clusters as
bad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Try to undelete the specified
file. fsck.fat tries to allocate a chain of contiguous
unallocated clusters beginning with the start cluster of the
undeleted file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Generates
slightly more output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Perform a verification pass.
The filesystem check is repeated after the first run. The
second pass should never report any fixable errors. It may
take considerably longer <br>
than the first pass, because the first pass may have
generated long list of modifications that have to be scanned
for each disk read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Write changes to disk
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Same as -a (automatically
repair filesystem) for compatibility with other fsck
tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If -a and -r are absent,
the filesystem is only checked, but not repaired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 No recoverable errors have been detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Recoverable errors have been
detected or fsck.fat has discovered an internal
inconsistency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Usage error. fsck.fat did not
access the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
fsck0000.rec, fsck0001.rec, ... <br>
When recovering from a corrupted filesystem, fsck.fat dumps
recovered data into files named &rsquo;fsckNNNN.rec&rsquo;
in the top level directory of the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Does not create . and .. files where necessary. Does not
remove entirely empty directories. Should give more
diagnostic messages. Undeleting files should use a more
sophisticated <br>
algorithm.</p>
