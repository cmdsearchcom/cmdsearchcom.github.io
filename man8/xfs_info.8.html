Manager&rsquo;s Manual xfs_growfs(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfs_growfs, xfs_info - expand an XFS filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfs_growfs [ -dilnrx ] [ -D size ] [ -e rtextsize ] [ -L
size ] [ -m maxpct ] [ -t mtab ] [ -R size ] mount-point
<br>
xfs_growfs -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_info [ -t mtab ] mount-point
<br>
xfs_info -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfs_growfs expands an existing XFS filesystem (see xfs(5)).
The mount-point argument is the pathname of the directory
where the filesystem is mounted. The filesystem must be <br>
mounted to be grown (see mount(8)). The existing contents of
the filesystem are undisturbed, and the added space becomes
available for additional file storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_info is equivalent to
invoking xfs_growfs with the -n option (see discussion
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d | -D size <br>
Specifies that the data section of the filesystem should be
grown. If the -D size option is given, the data section is
grown to that size, otherwise the data section is <br>
grown to the largest size possible with the -d option. The
size is expressed in filesystem blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Allows the real-time extent
size to be specified. In mkfs.xfs(8) this is specified with
-r extsize=nnnn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i The new log is an internal
log (inside the data section). [NOTE: This option is not
implemented]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l | -L size <br>
Specifies that the log section of the filesystem should be
grown, shrunk, or moved. If the -L size option is given, the
log section is changed to be that size, if possi&acirc; <br>
ble. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks. The size of
an internal log must be smaller than the size of an
allocation group (this value is printed at mkfs(8) time).
<br>
If neither -i nor -x is given with -l, the log continues to
be internal or external as it was before. [NOTE: These
options are not implemented]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Specify a new value for the
maximum percentage of space in the filesystem that can be
allocated as inodes. In mkfs.xfs(8) this is specified with
-i maxpct=nn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Specifies that no change to
the filesystem is to be made. The filesystem geometry is
printed, and argument checking is performed, but no growth
occurs. See output exam&acirc; <br>
ples below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r | -R size <br>
Specifies that the real-time section of the filesystem
should be grown. If the -R size option is given, the
real-time section is grown to that size, otherwise the real-
<br>
time section is grown to the largest size possible with the
-r option. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks. The
filesystem does not need to have contained a real- <br>
time section before the xfs_growfs operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Specifies an alternate mount
table file (default is /proc/mounts if it exists, else
/etc/mtab). This is used when working with filesystems
mounted without writing to <br>
/etc/mtab file - refer to mount(8) for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the version number and
exits. The mount-point argument is not required with -V.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_growfs is most often used in
conjunction with logical volumes (see md(4) and lvm(8) on
Linux). However, it can also be used on a regular disk
partition, for example if a <br>
partition has been enlarged while retaining the same
starting block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRACTICAL USE <br>
Filesystems normally occupy all of the space on the device
where they reside. In order to grow a filesystem, it is
necessary to provide added space for it to occupy. Therefore
<br>
there must be at least one spare new disk partition
available. Adding the space is often done through the use of
a logical volume manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Understanding xfs_info output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose one has the following
&quot;xfs_info /dev/sda&quot; output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">meta-data=/dev/sda isize=256
agcount=32, agsize=16777184 blks <br>
= sectsz=512 attr=2 <br>
data = bsize=4096 blocks=536869888, imaxpct=5 <br>
= sunit=32 swidth=128 blks <br>
naming =version 2 bsize=4096 <br>
log =internal bsize=4096 blocks=32768, version=2 <br>
= sectsz=512 sunit=32 blks, lazy-count=1 <br>
realtime =none extsz=524288 blocks=0, rtextents=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, the data section of the
output indicates &quot;bsize=4096&quot;, meaning the data
block size for this filesystem is 4096 bytes. This section
also shows &quot;sunit=32 swidth=128 blks&quot;, <br>
which means the stripe unit is 32*4096 bytes = 128 kibibytes
and the stripe width is 128*4096 bytes = 512 kibibytes. A
single stripe of this filesystem therefore consists of <br>
four stripe units (128 blocks / 32 blocks per unit).</p>
