<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ettercap - multipurpose sniffer/content filter for man in
the middle attacks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">***** IMPORTANT NOTE ****** <br>
Since ettercap NG (formerly 0.7.0), all the options have
been changed. Even the target specification has been
changed. Please read carefully this man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ettercap [OPTIONS] [TARGET1] [TARGET2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If IPv6 is enabled: <br>
TARGET is in the form MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs <br>
Otherwise, <br>
TARGET is in the form MAC/IPs/PORTs <br>
where IPs and PORTs can be ranges (e.g.
/192.168.0.1-30,40,50/20,22,25)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ettercap was born as a sniffer for switched LAN (and
obviously even &quot;hubbed&quot; ones), but during the
development process it has gained more and more features
that have changed it <br>
to a powerful and flexible tool for man-in-the-middle
attacks. It supports active and passive dissection of many
protocols (even ciphered ones) and includes many features
for <br>
network and host analysis (such as OS fingerprint).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It has two main sniffing
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIFIED, this method sniffs all
the packets that pass on the cable. You can choose to put or
not the interface in promisc mode (-p option). The packet
not directed to the host <br>
running ettercap will be forwarded automatically using layer
3 routing. So you can use a mitm attack launched from a
different tool and let ettercap modify the packets and
for&acirc; <br>
ward them for you. <br>
The kernel ip_forwarding is always disabled by ettercap.
This is done to prevent to forward a packet twice (one by
ettercap and one by the kernel). This is an invasive
behaviour <br>
on gateways. So we recommend you to use ettercap on the
gateways ONLY with the UNOFFENSIVE MODE ENABLED. Since
ettercap listens only on one network interface, launching it
on the <br>
gateway in offensive mode will not allow packets to be
rerouted back from the second interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRIDGED, it uses two network
interfaces and forward the traffic from one to the other
while performing sniffing and content filtering. This
sniffing method is totally stealthy <br>
since there is no way to find that someone is in the middle
on the cable. You can look at this method as a mitm attack
at layer 1. You will be in the middle of the cable between
<br>
two entities. Don&rsquo;t use it on gateways or it will
transform your gateway into a bridge. HINT: you can use the
content filtering engine to drop packets that should not
pass. This <br>
way ettercap will work as an inline IPS ;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also perform man in the
middle attacks while using the unified sniffing. You can
choose the mitm attack that you prefer. The mitm attack
module is independent from the <br>
sniffing and filtering process, so you can launch several
attacks at the same time or use your own tool for the
attack. The crucial point is that the packets have to arrive
to <br>
ettercap with the correct mac address and a different ip
address (only these packets will be forwarded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most relevant ettercap
features are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH1 support : you can sniff
User and Pass, and even the data of an SSH1 connection.
ettercap is the first software capable to sniff an SSH
connection in FULL-DUPLEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL support : you can sniff SSL
secured data... a fake certificate is presented to the
client and the session is decrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Characters injection in an
established connection : you can inject characters to the
server (emulating commands) or to the client (emulating
replies) maintaining the connection <br>
alive !!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packet filtering/dropping: You
can set up a filter script that searches for a particular
string (even hex) in the TCP or UDP payload and replace it
with yours or drop the entire <br>
packet. The filtering engine can match any field of the
network protocols and modify whatever you want (see
etterfilter(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote traffic sniffing through
tunnels and route mangling: You can play with linux cooked
interfaces or use the integrated plugin to sniff tunneled or
route-mangled remote con&acirc; <br>
nections and perform mitm attacks on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plug-ins support : You can
create your own plugin using the ettercap&rsquo;s API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password collector for : TELNET,
FTP, POP, RLOGIN, SSH1, ICQ, SMB, MySQL, HTTP, NNTP, X11,
NAPSTER, IRC, RIP, BGP, SOCKS 5, IMAP 4, VNC, LDAP, NFS,
SNMP, HALF LIFE, QUAKE 3, MSN, <br>
YMSG (other protocols coming soon...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passive OS fingerprint: you scan
passively the lan (without sending any packet) and gather
detailed info about the hosts in the LAN: Operating System,
running services, open <br>
ports, IP, mac address and network adapter vendor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill a connection: from the
connections list you can kill all the connections you
want</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGET SPECIFICATION <br>
There is no concept of SOURCE nor DEST. The two targets are
intended to filter traffic coming from one to the other and
vice-versa (since the connection is bidirectional).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGET is in the form
MAC/IPs/PORTs. <br>
NOTE: If IPv6 is enabled, TARGET is in the form
MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want you can omit any of
its parts and this will represent an ANY in that part. <br>
e.g. <br>
&quot;//80&quot; means ANY mac address, ANY ip and ONLY port
80 <br>
&quot;/10.0.0.1/&quot; means ANY mac address, ONLY ip
10.0.0.1 and ANY port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAC must be unique and in the
form 00:11:22:33:44:55</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPs is a range of IP in dotted
notation. You can specify range with the - (hyphen) and
single ip with , (comma). You can also use ; (semicolon) to
indicate different ip <br>
addresses. <br>
e.g. <br>
&quot;10.0.0.1-5;10.0.1.33&quot; expands into ip 10.0.0.1,
2, 3, 4, 5 and 10.0.1.33</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTs is a range of PORTS. You
can specify range with the - (hyphen) and single port with ,
(comma). <br>
e.g. <br>
&quot;20-25,80,110&quot; expands into ports 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 80 and 110</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: <br>
you can reverse the matching of the TARGET by adding the -R
option to the command line. So if you want to sniff ALL the
traffic BUT the one coming or going to 10.0.0.1 you can <br>
specify &quot;./ettercap -R /10.0.0.1/&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: <br>
TARGETs are also responsible of the initial scan of the lan.
You can use them to restrict the scan to only a subset of
the hosts in the netmask. The result of the merging between
<br>
the two targets will be scanned. remember that not
specifying a target means &quot;no target&quot;, but
specifying &quot;//&quot; means &quot;all the hosts in the
subnet&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRIVILEGES DROPPING <br>
ettercap needs root privileges to open the Link Layer
sockets. After the initialization phase, the root privs are
not needed anymore, so ettercap drops them to UID = 65535
<br>
(nobody). Since ettercap has to write (create) log files, it
must be executed in a directory with the right permissions
(e.g. /tmp/). If you want to drop privs to a different <br>
uid, you can export the environment variable EC_UID with the
value of the uid you want to drop the privs to (e.g. export
EC_UID=500) or set the correct parameter in the <br>
etter.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL MITM ATTACK <br>
While performing the SSL mitm attack, ettercap substitutes
the real ssl certificate with its own. The fake certificate
is created on the fly and all the fields are filled
accord&acirc; <br>
ing to the real cert presented by the server. Only the
issuer is modified and signed with the private key contained
in the &rsquo;etter.ssl.crt&rsquo; file. If you want to use
a different <br>
private key you have to regenerate this file. To regenerate
the cert file use the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openssl genrsa -out
etter.ssl.crt 1024 <br>
openssl req -new -key etter.ssl.crt -out tmp.csr <br>
openssl x509 -req -days 1825 -in tmp.csr -signkey
etter.ssl.crt -out tmp.new <br>
cat tmp.new &gt;&gt; etter.ssl.crt <br>
rm -f tmp.new tmp.csr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: SSL mitm is not available
(for now) in bridged mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: You can use the
--certificate/--private-key long options if you want to
specify a different file rather than the etter.ssl.crt
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options that make sense together can generally be combined.
ettercap will warn the user about unsupported option
combinations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SNIFFING AND ATTACK OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap NG has a new unified
sniffing method. This implies that ip_forwarding in the
kernel is always disabled and the forwarding is done by
ettercap. Every packet with destina&acirc; <br>
tion mac address equal to the host&rsquo;s mac address and
destination ip address different for the one bound to the
iface will be forwarded by ettercap. Before forwarding them,
etter&acirc; <br>
cap can content filter, sniff, log or drop them. It does not
matter how these packets are hijacked, ettercap will process
them. You can even use external programs to hijack <br>
packet. <br>
You have full control of what ettercap should receive. You
can use the internal mitm attacks, set the interface in
promisc mode, use plugins or use every method you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT NOTE: if you run
ettercap on a gateway, remember to re-enable the
ip_forwarding after you have killed ettercap. Since ettercap
drops its privileges, it cannot restore <br>
the ip_forwarding for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --mitm &lt;METHOD:ARGS&gt;
<br>
MITM attack <br>
This option will activate the man in the middle attack. The
mimt attack is totally independent from the sniffing. The
aim of the attack is to hijack packets and redirect <br>
them to ettercap. The sniffing engine will forward them if
necessary. <br>
You can choose the mitm attack that you prefer and also
combine some of them to perform different attacks at the
same time. <br>
If a mitm method requires some parameters you can specify
them after the colon. (e.g. -M dhcp:ip_pool,netmask,etc
)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following mitm attacks are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arp ([remote],[oneway]) <br>
This method implements the ARP poisoning mitm attack. ARP
requests/replies are sent to the victims to poison their ARP
cache. Once the cache has been poisoned the <br>
victims will send all packets to the attacker which, in
turn, can modify and forward them to the real
destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In silent mode (-z option) only
the first target is selected, if you want to poison multiple
target in silent mode use the -j option to load a list from
a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can select empty targets and
they will be expanded as &rsquo;ANY&rsquo; (all the hosts in
the LAN). The target list is joined with the hosts list
(created by the arp scan) <br>
and the result is used to determine the victims of the
attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter &quot;remote&quot;
is optional and you have to specify it if you want to sniff
remote ip address poisoning a gateway. Indeed if you specify
a victim and the gw <br>
in the TARGETS, ettercap will sniff only connection between
them, but to enable ettercap to sniff connections that pass
thru the gw, you have to use this parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter &quot;oneway&quot;
will force ettercap to poison only from TARGET1 to TARGET2.
Useful if you want to poison only the client and not the
router (where an arp <br>
watcher can be in place).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the targets are: /10.0.0.1-5/
/10.0.0.15-20/ <br>
and the host list is: 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.16
10.0.0.18</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the associations between the
victims will be: <br>
1 and 16, 1 and 18, 3 and 16, 3 and 18</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the targets overlap each
other, the association with identical ip address will be
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: if you manage to poison a
client, you have to set correct routing table in the kernel
specifying the GW. If your routing table is incorrect, the
poisoned <br>
clients will not be able to navigate the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmp (MAC/IP) <br>
This attack implements ICMP redirection. It sends a spoofed
icmp redirect message to the hosts in the lan pretending to
be a better route for internet. All connec&acirc; <br>
tions to internet will be redirected to the attacker which,
in turn, will forward them to the real gateway. The
resulting attack is a HALF-DUPLEX mitm. Only the <br>
client is redirected, since the gateway will not accept
redirect messages for a directly connected network. BE SURE
TO NOT USE FILTERS THAT MODIFY THE PAYLOAD <br>
LENGTH. you can use a filter to modify packets, but the
length must be the same since the tcp sequences cannot be
updated in both ways. <br>
You have to pass as argument the MAC and the IP address of
the real gateway for the lan. <br>
Obviously you have to be able to sniff all the traffic. If
you are on a switch you have to use a different mitm attack
such as arp poisoning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: to restrict the
redirection to a given target, specify it as a TARGET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M
icmp:00:11:22:33:44:55/10.0.0.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will redirect all the
connections that pass thru that gateway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp (ip_pool/netmask/dns) <br>
This attack implements DHCP spoofing. It pretends to be a
DHCP server and tries to win the race condition with the
real one to force the client to accept the <br>
attacker&rsquo;s reply. This way ettercap is able to
manipulate the GW parameter and hijack all the outgoing
traffic generated by the clients. <br>
The resulting attack is a HALF-DUPLEX mitm. So be sure to
use appropriate filters (see above in the ICMP section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You have to pass the ip pool to
be used, the netmask and the ip of the dns server. Since
ettercap tries to win the race with the real server, it DOES
NOT CHECK if <br>
the ip is already assigned. You have to specify an ip pool
of FREE addresses to be used. The ip pool has the same form
of the target specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the client sends a dhcp
request (suggesting an ip address) ettercap will ack on that
ip and modify only the gw option. If the client makes a dhcp
discovery, <br>
ettercap will use the first unused ip address of the list
you have specified on command line. Every discovery consumes
an ip address. When the list is over, etter&acirc; <br>
cap stops offering new ip addresses and will reply only to
dhcp requests. <br>
If you don&rsquo;t want to offer any ip address, but only
change the router information of dhcp request/ack, you can
specify an empty ip_pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BIG WARNING: if you specify a
list of ip that are in use, you will mess your network! In
general, use this attack carefully. It can really mess
things up! When you <br>
stop the attack, all the victims will be still convinced
that ettercap is the gateway until the lease expires...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M
dhcp:192.168.0.30,35,50-60/255.255.255.0/192.168.0.1 <br>
reply to DHCP offer and request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M
dhcp:/255.255.255.0/192.168.0.1 <br>
reply only to DHCP request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port ([remote],[tree]) <br>
This attack implements Port Stealing. This technique is
useful to sniff in a switched environment when ARP poisoning
is not effective (for example where static <br>
mapped ARPs are used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It floods the LAN (based on
port_steal_delay option in etter.conf) with ARP packets. If
you don&rsquo;t specify the &quot;tree&quot; option, the
destination MAC address of each <br>
&quot;stealing&quot; packet is the same as the
attacker&rsquo;s one (other NICs won&rsquo;t see these
packets), the source MAC address will be one of the MACs in
the host list. This <br>
process &quot;steals&quot; the switch port of each victim
host in the host list. Using low delays, packets destined to
&quot;stolen&quot; MAC addresses will be received by the
<br>
attacker, winning the race condition with the real port
owner. When the attacker receives packets for
&quot;stolen&quot; hosts, it stops the flooding process and
performs an <br>
ARP request for the real destination of the packet. When it
receives the ARP reply it&rsquo;s sure that the victim has
&quot;taken back&quot; his port, so ettercap can re-send the
<br>
packet to the destination as is. Now we can re-start the
flooding process waiting for new packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the &quot;tree&quot;
option, the destination MAC address of each stealing packet
will be a bogus one, so these packets will be propagated to
other switches (not <br>
only the directly connected one). This way you will be able
to steal ports on other switches in the tree (if any), but
you will generate a huge amount of traffic <br>
(according to port_steal_delay). The &quot;remote&quot;
option has the same meaning as in &quot;arp&quot; mitm
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you stop the attack,
ettercap will send an ARP request to each stolen host giving
back their switch ports. <br>
You can perform either HALF or FULL DUPLEX mitm according to
target selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Use this mitm method only
on ethernet switches. Use it carefully, it could produce
performances loss or general havoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: You can NOT use this
method in only-mitm mode (-o flag), because it hooks the
sniffing engine, and you can&rsquo;t use interactive data
injection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: It could be dangerous to
use it in conjunction with other mitm methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This mitm method
doesn&rsquo;t work on Solaris and Windows because of the
lipcap and libnet design and the lack of certain ioctl().
(We will feature this method on <br>
these OSes if someone will request it...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The targets are: /10.0.0.1/
/10.0.0.15/ <br>
You will intercept and visualize traffic between 10.0.0.1
and 10.0.0.15, but you will receive all the traffic for
10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.15 too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target is: /10.0.0.1/ <br>
You will intercept and visualize all the traffic for
10.0.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ndp ([remote],[oneway]) <br>
NOTE: This MITM method is only supported if IPv6 support has
been enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method implements the NDP
poisoning attack which is used for MITM of IPv6 connections.
ND requests/replies are sent to the victims to poison their
neighbor <br>
cache. Once the cache has been poisoned the victims will
send all IPv6 packets to the attacker which, in turn, can
modify and forward them to the real destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In silent mode (-z option) only
the first target is selected, if you want to poison multiple
target in silent mode use the -j option to load a list from
a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can select empty targets and
they will be expanded as &rsquo;ANY&rsquo; (all the hosts in
the LAN). The target list is joined with the hosts list
(created by the arp scan) <br>
and the result is used to determine the victims of the
attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter &quot;remote&quot;
is optional and you have to specify it if you want to sniff
remote ip address poisoning a gateway. Indeed if you specify
a victim and the gw <br>
in the TARGETS, ettercap will sniff only connection between
them, but to enable ettercap to sniff connections that pass
thru the gw, you have to use this parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter &quot;oneway&quot;
will force ettercap to poison only from TARGET1 to TARGET2.
Useful if you want to poison only the client and not the
router (where an arp <br>
watcher can be in place).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Targets are:
//fe80::260d:afff:fe6e:f378/ //2001:db8::2:1/ <br>
Ranges of IPv6 addresses are not yet supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: if you manage to poison a
client, you have to set correct routing table in the kernel
specifying the GW. If your routing table is incorrect, the
poisoned <br>
clients will not be able to navigate the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: in IPv6 usually the
link-local address of the router is being used as the
gateway address. Therefor you need to set the link-local
address of the router as <br>
one target and the global-unicast address of the victim as
the other in order to set up a successfull IPv6 MITM attack
using NDP poisoning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --only-mitm <br>
This options disables the sniffing thread and enables only
the mitm attack. Useful if you want to use ettercap to
perform mitm attacks and another sniffer (such as
wire&acirc; <br>
shark) to sniff the traffic. Keep in mind that the packets
are not forwarded by ettercap. The kernel will be
responsible for the forwarding. Remember to activate the
&quot;ip <br>
forwarding&quot; feature in your kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --pcapfilter &lt;FILTER&gt;
<br>
Set a capturing filter in the pcap library. The format is
the same as tcpdump(1). Remember that this kind of filter
will not sniff packets out of the wire, so if you want <br>
to perform a mitm attack, ettercap will not be able to
forward hijacked packets. <br>
These filters are useful to decrease the network load impact
into ettercap decoding module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --bridge &lt;IFACE&gt; <br>
BRIDGED sniffing <br>
You need two network interfaces. ettercap will forward form
one to the other all the traffic it sees. It is useful for
man in the middle at the physical layer. It is <br>
totally stealthy since it is passive and there is no way for
an user to see the attacker. <br>
You can content filter all the traffic as you were a
transparent proxy for the &quot;cable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OFF LINE SNIFFING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --read &lt;FILE&gt; <br>
OFF LINE sniffing <br>
With this option enabled, ettercap will sniff packets from a
pcap compatible file instead of capturing from the wire.
<br>
This is useful if you have a file dumped from tcpdump or
wireshark and you want to make an analysis (search for
passwords or passive fingerprint) on it. <br>
Obviously you cannot use &quot;active&quot; sniffing (arp
poisoning or bridging) while sniffing from a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --write &lt;FILE&gt; <br>
WRITE packet to a pcap file <br>
This is useful if you have to use &quot;active&quot;
sniffing (arp poison) on a switched LAN but you want to
analyze the packets with tcpdump or wireshark. You can use
this option <br>
to dump the packets to a file and then load it into your
favourite application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: dump file collect ALL the
packets disregarding the TARGET. This is done because you
may want to log even protocols not supported by ettercap, so
you can analyze them <br>
with other tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIP: you can use the -w option
in conjunction with the -r one. This way you will be able to
filter the payload of the dumped packets or decrypt
WEP-encrypted WiFi traffic <br>
and dump them to another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER INTERFACES OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --text <br>
The text only interface, only printf ;) <br>
It is quite interactive, press &rsquo;h&rsquo; in every
moment to get help on what you can do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Quiet mode. It can be used only in conjunction with the
console interface. It does not print packet content. It is
useful if you want to convert pcap file to ettercap log <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -Tq -L dumpfile -r
pcapfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --script &lt;COMMANDS&gt;
<br>
With this option you can feed ettercap with command as they
were typed on the keyboard by the user. This way you can use
ettercap within your favourite scripts. There is a <br>
special command you can issue thru this command: s(x). this
command will sleep for x seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -T -s &rsquo;lq&rsquo;
will print the list of the hosts and exit <br>
ettercap -T -s &rsquo;s(300)olqq&rsquo; will collect the
infos for 5 minutes, print the list of the local profiles
and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --curses <br>
Ncurses based GUI. See ettercap_curses(8) for a full
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --gtk <br>
The nice GTK2 interface (thanks Daten...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --daemonize <br>
Daemonize ettercap. This option will detach ettercap from
the current controlling terminal and set it as a daemon. You
can combine this feature with the &quot;log&quot; option to
<br>
log all the traffic in the background. If the daemon fails
for any reason, it will create the file
&quot;./ettercap_daemonized.log&quot; in which the error
caught by ettercap will <br>
be reported. Furthermore, if you want to have a complete
debug of the daemon process, you are encouraged to recompile
ettercap in debug mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --broadcast <br>
Tells Ettercap to process packets coming from Broadcast
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --iface &lt;IFACE&gt; <br>
Use this &lt;IFACE&gt; instead of the default one. The
interface can be unconfigured (requires libnet &gt;= 1.1.2),
but in this case you cannot use MITM attacks and you should
set <br>
the unoffensive flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --iflist <br>
This option will print the list of all available network
interfaces that can be used within ettercap. The option is
particularly useful under windows where the name of the <br>
interface is not so obvious as under *nix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y, --secondary &lt;interface
list&gt; <br>
Specify a list of (or single) secondary interfaces to
capture packets from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --address &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
<br>
Use this &lt;ADDRESS&gt; instead of the one autodetected for
the current iface. This option is useful if you have an
interface with multiple ip addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --netmask &lt;NETMASK&gt;
<br>
Use this &lt;NETMASK&gt; instead of the one associated with
the current iface. This option is useful if you have the NIC
with an associated netmask of class B and you want to <br>
scan (with the arp scan) only a class C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --reversed <br>
Reverse the matching in the TARGET selection. It means
not(TARGET). All but the selected TARGET.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --proto &lt;PROTO&gt; <br>
Sniff only PROTO packets (default is TCP + UDP). <br>
This is useful if you want to select a port via the TARGET
specification but you want to differentiate between tcp or
udp. <br>
PROTO can be &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;udp&quot; or
&quot;all&quot; for both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ip6scan <br>
Send ICMPv6 probes to discover active IPv6 nodes on the
link. This options sends a ping request to the all-nodes
address to motivate active IPv6 hosts to respond. You <br>
should not use this option if you try to hide yourself.
Therefore this option is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option is only
available if IPv6 support has been enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --silent <br>
Do not perform the initial ARP scan of the LAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: you will not have the
hosts list, so you can&rsquo;t use the multipoison feature.
you can only select two hosts for an ARP poisoning attack,
specifying them through the <br>
TARGETs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --nopromisc <br>
Usually, ettercap will put the interface in promisc mode to
sniff all the traffic on the wire. If you want to sniff only
your connections, use this flag to NOT enable the <br>
promisc mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --nosslmitm <br>
Usually, ettercap forges SSL certificates in order to
intercept https traffic. This option disables that
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unoffensive <br>
Every time ettercap starts, it disables ip forwarding in the
kernel and begins to forward packets itself. This option
prevent to do that, so the responsibility of ip for&acirc;
<br>
warding is left to the kernel. <br>
This options is useful if you want to run multiple ettercap
instances. You will have one instance (the one without the
-u option) forwarding the packets, and all the other <br>
instances doing their work without forwarding them.
Otherwise you will get packet duplicates. <br>
It also disables the internal creation of the sessions for
each connection. It increases performances, but you will not
be able to modify packets on the fly. <br>
If you want to use a mitm attack you have to use a separate
instance. <br>
You have to use this option if the interface is unconfigured
(without an ip address.) <br>
This is also useful if you want to run ettercap on the
gateway. It will not disable the forwarding and the gateway
will correctly route the packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --load-hosts
&lt;FILENAME&gt; <br>
It can be used to load a hosts list from a file created by
the -k option. (see below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --save-hosts
&lt;FILENAME&gt; <br>
Saves the hosts list to a file. Useful when you have many
hosts and you don&rsquo;t want to do an ARP storm at startup
any time you use ettercap. Simply use this options and <br>
dump the list to a file, then to load the information from
it use the -j &lt;filename&gt; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --plugin &lt;PLUGIN&gt; <br>
Run the selected PLUGIN. Many plugins need target
specification, use TARGET as always. Use multiple occurances
of this parameter to select multiple plugins. <br>
In console mode (-C option), standalone plugins are executed
and then the application exits. Hook plugins are activated
and the normal sniffing is performed. <br>
To have a list of the available external plugins use
&quot;list&quot; (without quotes) as plugin name (e.g.
./ettercap -P list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: you can also activate
plugins directly from the interfaces (always press
&quot;h&quot; to get the inline help)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More detailed info about plugins
and about how to write your own are found in the man page
ettercap_plugin(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --filter &lt;FILE&gt; <br>
Load the filter from the file &lt;FILE&gt;. The filter must
be compiled with etterfilter(8). The utility will compile
the filter script and produce an ettercap-compliant binary
<br>
filter file. Read the etterfilter(8) man page for the list
of functions you can use inside a filter script. Any number
of filters can be loaded by specifying the option <br>
multiple times; packets are passed through each filter in
the order specified on the command line. You can also load a
script without enabling it by appending :0 to the <br>
filename. <br>
NOTE: these filters are different from those set with
--pcapfilter. An ettercap filter is a content filter and can
modify the payload of a packet before forwarding it. <br>
Pcap filter are used to capture only certain packets. <br>
NOTE: you can use filters on pcapfile to modify them and
save to another file, but in this case you have to pay
attention on what you are doing, since ettercap will not
<br>
recalculate checksums, nor split packets exceeding the mtu
(snaplen) nor anything like that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --wifi-key &lt;KEY&gt; <br>
You can specify a key to decrypt WiFi packets (WEP or WPA).
Only the packets decrypted successfully will be passed to
the decoders stack, the others will be skipped with a <br>
message. <br>
The parameter has the following syntax: type:bits:t:string.
Where &rsquo;type&rsquo; can be: wep, wpa-pws or wpa-psk,
&rsquo;bits&rsquo; is the bit length of the key (64, 128 or
256), &rsquo;t&rsquo; is the <br>
type of the string (&rsquo;s&rsquo; for string and
&rsquo;p&rsquo; for passphrase). &rsquo;string&rsquo; can be
a string or an escaped hex sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example: <br>
--wifi-key wep:128:p:secret <br>
--wifi-key wep:128:s:ettercapwep0 <br>
--wifi-key &rsquo;wep:64:s:12345&rsquo; <br>
--wifi-key wpa:pwd:ettercapwpa:ssid <br>
--wifi-key wpa:psk: <br>

663eb260e87cf389c6bd7331b28d82f5203b0cae4e315f9cbb7602f3236708a6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --config &lt;CONFIG&gt; <br>
Loads an alternative config file instead of the default in
/etc/etter.conf. This is useful if you have many
preconfigured files for different situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--certificate &lt;FILE&gt; <br>
Tells Ettercap to use the specified certificate file for the
SSL MiTM attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--private-key &lt;FILE&gt; <br>
Tells Ettercap to use the specified private key file for the
SSL MiTM attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VISUALIZATION OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --regex &lt;REGEX&gt; <br>
Handle only packets that match the regex. <br>
This option is useful in conjunction with -L. It logs only
packets that match the posix regex REGEX. <br>
It impacts even the visualization of the sniffed packets. If
it is set only packets matching the regex will be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --visual &lt;FORMAT&gt; <br>
Use this option to set the visualization method for the
packets to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMAT may be one of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hex Print the packets in hex
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the string &quot;HTTP/1.1 304
Not Modified&quot; becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0000: 4854 5450 2f31 2e31 2033
3034 204e 6f74 HTTP/1.1 304 Not <br>
0010: 204d 6f64 6966 6965 64 Modified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii Print only
&quot;printable&quot; characters, the others are displayed
as dots &rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text Print only the
&quot;printable&quot; characters and skip the others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ebcdic Convert an EBCDIC text to
ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">html Strip all the html tags
from the text. A tag is every string between &lt; and
&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;title&gt;This is the
title&lt;/title&gt;, but the following &lt;string&gt; will
not be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the title, but the
following will not be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8 Print the packets in UTF-8
format. The encoding used while performing the conversion is
declared in the etter.conf(5) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dns <br>
Resolve ip addresses into hostnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this may seriously slow
down ettercap while logging passive information. Every time
a new host is found, a query to the dns is performed.
Ettercap keeps a cache for <br>
already resolved host to increase the speed, but new hosts
need a new query and the dns may take up to 2 or 3 seconds
to respond for an unknown host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINT: ettercap collects the dns
replies it sniffs in the resolution table, so even if you
specify to not resolve the hostnames, some of them will be
resolved because the <br>
reply was previously sniffed. think about it as a passive
dns resolution for free... ;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --ext-headers <br>
Print extended headers for every displayed packet. (e.g. mac
addresses)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --superquiet <br>
Super quiet mode. Do not print users and passwords as they
are collected. Only store them in the profiles. It can be
useful to run ettercap in text only mode but you don&rsquo;t
<br>
want to be flooded with dissectors messages. Useful when
using plugins because the sniffing process is always active,
it will print all the collected infos, with this <br>
option you can suppress these messages. <br>
NOTE: this options automatically sets the -q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -TzQP finger
/192.168.0.1/22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --log &lt;LOGFILE&gt; <br>
Log all the packets to binary files. These files can be
parsed by etterlog(8) to extract human readable data. With
this option, all packets sniffed by ettercap will be <br>
logged, together with all the passive info (host info + user
&amp; pass) it can collect. Given a LOGFILE, ettercap will
create LOGFILE.ecp (for packets) and LOGFILE.eci (for <br>
the infos).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: if you specify this option
on command line you don&rsquo;t have to take care of
privileges since the log file is opened in the startup phase
(with high privs). But if you <br>
enable the log option while ettercap is already started, you
have to be in a directory where uid = 65535 or uid = EC_UID
can write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: the logfiles can be
compressed with the deflate algorithm using the -c
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --log-info &lt;LOGFILE&gt;
<br>
Very similar to -L but it logs only passive information +
users and passwords for each host. The file will be named
LOGFILE.eci</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --log-msg &lt;LOGFILE&gt;
<br>
It stores in &lt;LOGFILE&gt; all the user messages printed
by ettercap. This can be useful when you are using ettercap
in daemon mode or if you want to track down all the
mes&acirc; <br>
sages. Indeed, some dissectors print messages but their
information is not stored anywhere, so this is the only way
to keep track of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --compress <br>
Compress the logfile with the gzip algorithm while it is
dumped. etterlog(8) is capable of handling both compressed
and uncompressed log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --only-local <br>
Stores profiles information belonging only to the LAN
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this option is effective
only against the profiles collected in memory. While logging
to a file ALL the hosts are logged. If you want to split
them, use the related <br>
etterlog(8) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --only-remote <br>
Stores profiles information belonging only to remote
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
prints the help screen with a short summary of the available
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are some examples of using ettercap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -Tp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the console interface and do
not put the interface in promisc mode. You will see only
your traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -Tzq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the console interface, do
not ARP scan the net and be quiet. The packet content will
not be displayed, but user and passwords, as well as other
messages, will be dis&acirc; <br>
played.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -T -j /tmp/victims -M
arp /10.0.0.1-7/ /10.0.0.10-20/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will load the hosts list from
/tmp/victims and perform an ARP poisoning attack against the
two target. The list will be joined with the target and the
resulting list is <br>
used for ARP poisoning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -T -M arp // //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perform the ARP poisoning attack
against all the hosts in the LAN. BE CAREFUL !!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -T -M arp:remote

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perform the ARP poisoning
against the gateway and the host in the lan between 2 and
10. The &rsquo;remote&rsquo; option is needed to be able to
sniff the remote traffic the hosts make <br>
through the gateway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ettercap -Tzq //110</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sniff only the pop3 protocol

was chosen because it has an assonance with
&quot;ethercap&quot; which means &quot;ethernet
