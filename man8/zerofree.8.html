<p>ZEROFREE(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ZEROFREE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zerofree &acirc; zero free blocks from ext2, ext3 and ext4
file-systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
zerofree [-n] [-v] [-f fillval] filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
zerofree finds the unallocated, blocks with non-zero value
content in an ext2, ext3 or ext4 filesystem (e.g. /dev/hda1)
and fills them with zeroes (or another octet of your <br>
choice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filling unused areas with zeroes
is useful if the device on which this file-system resides is
a disk image. In this case, depending on the type of disk
image, a secondary utility <br>
may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
zerofree has been run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filling unused areas may also be
useful with solid-state drives (SSDs). On some SSDs, filling
blocks with ones (0xFF) is reported to trigger Flash block
erasure by the firmware, <br>
possibly giving a write performance increase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual way to achieve the
same result (zeroing the unallocated blocks) is to run dd
(1) to create a file full of zeroes that takes up the entire
free space on the drive, and <br>
then delete this file. This has many disadvantages, which
zerofree alleviates:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it is slow;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it makes the
disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it (temporarily)
uses all free space on the disk, so other concurrent write
actions may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filesystem has to be unmounted
or mounted read-only for zerofree to work. It will exit with
an error message if the filesystem is mounted writable. To
remount the root file-sys&acirc; <br>
tem readonly, you can first switch to single user runlevel
(telinit 1) then use mount -o remount,ro filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zerofree has been written to be
run from GNU/Linux systems installed as guest OSes inside a
virtual machine. In this case, it is typically run from
within the guest system, and a <br>
utility is then run from the host system to shrink disk
image (VBoxManage modifyhd --compact, provided with
virtualbox, is able to do that for some disk image
formats).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may however be useful in
other situations: for instance it can be used to make it
more difficult to retrieve deleted data. Beware that
securely deleting sensitive data is not <br>
in general an easy task and usually requires writing several
times on the deleted blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n Perform a dry run (do not modify the file-system);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose: show the number
of blocks modified by zerofree (or that would be modified,
in case the -n is used), the number of free blocks and the
total number of blocks <br>
on the filesystem;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f value Specify the octet value
to fill empty blocks with (defaults to 0). Argument must be
within the range 0 to 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
dd (1).</p>
