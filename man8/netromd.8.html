<p>NETROMD(8) Linux System Managers Manual NETROMD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
netromd - Send and receive NET/ROM routing messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
netromd [-c] [-d] [-i] [-l] [-p pause] [-q quality] [-t
interval] [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For a NET/ROM based network to operate correctly, a periodic
broadcast of routing information needs to occur. Typically
this occurs once every hour on every port which is <br>
expected to carry NET/ROM traffic. The purpose of netromd is
to send and receive NET/ROM routing broadcasts. To operate
correctly a set of parameters that corresponds to each <br>
AX.25 port needs to be passed to the program. This
information is encoded in a configuration file, by default
which is /etc/ax25/nrbroadcast with each line representing
one port, <br>
see the manual page for nrbroadcast(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To cut down the length of these
routing broadcasts, only the information about the highest
quality neighbour for a particular node is transmitted. The
transmission is also lim&acirc; <br>
ited to those node that have a certain minimum value in
their obsolesence count, this value is decremented every
time a routing broadcast is transmitted, and is refreshed by
<br>
receiving a routing broadcast which contains that particular
node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of the default quality
is traditionally assigned a value that represents the
quality of the radio links on that port. A higher number
representing better radio links <br>
with 255 (the maximum) reserved for wire connections. The
practise in the UK is to set the default quality to a low
value, typically 10, and manually set up the trusted
neigh&acirc; <br>
bouring nodes in the neighbour list manually. The worst
quality for auto-updates value is a way to filter out low
quality (ie distant) nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The verbose flag may be either 0
or 1, representing no and yes. By specifying no, the program
will only generate a routing message containing information
about the node on which <br>
it is running, by specifying the yes option, all the
information in the nodes routing tables will be transmitted.
The quality advertised for the other node callsigns on this
<br>
machine may be set using the -q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Between each transmission
netromd pauses for five seconds (default) in order to avoid
flooding the channels that it must broadcast on. The value
of this delay is settable with <br>
the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Forces strict compliance to Software 2000 specifications.
At present this only determines how node mnemonics with
lower case characters will be handled. With <br>
compliance enabled mixed case node mnemonics will be
ignored. The default is to accept node mnemonics of mixed
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Switches on debugging
messages, the default is off. Logging must be enabled for
them to be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Transmit a routing broadcast
immediately, the default is to wait for the time interval to
elapse before transmitting the first routing broadcast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enables logging of errors and
debug messages to the system log. The default is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pause Sets the delay between
transmissions of individual routing broadcast packets. The
default is five seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q quality Sets the quality of
the subsidiary nodes relative to the main node. The default
is 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t interval The time interval
between routing broadcasts, in minutes. The default is 60
minutes.</p>
