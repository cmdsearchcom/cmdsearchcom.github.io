[This man page is generated for the Linux version of smartmontools. It does not
  contain info specific to other platforms.]
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>smartctl</b> controls the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
  (SMART) system built into most ATA/SATA and SCSI/SAS hard drives and
  solid-state drives. The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the
  hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of
  drive self-tests. <b>smartctl</b> also supports some features not related to
  SMART. This version of <b>smartctl</b> is compatible with ACS-2, ATA8-ACS,
  ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier standards (see <b>REFERENCES</b> below).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>smartctl</b> also provides support for polling TapeAlert messages from SCSI
  tape drives and changers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The user must specify the device to be controlled or interrogated as the final
  argument to <b>smartctl</b>. The command set used by the device is often
  derived from the device path but may need help with the &#x00B4;-d&#x00B4;
  option (for more information see the section on &quot;ATA, SCSI command sets
  and SAT&quot; below). Device paths are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>LINUX</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the forms <b>&quot;/dev/hd[a-t]&quot;</b> for IDE/ATA
      devices, and <b>&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;</b> for SCSI devices. For SCSI
      Tape Drives and Changers with TapeAlert support use the devices
      <b>&quot;/dev/nst*&quot;</b> and <b>&quot;/dev/sg*&quot;</b>. For SATA
      disks accessed with libata, use <b>&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;</b> and append
      <b>&quot;-d ata&quot;</b>. For disks behind 3ware controllers you may need
      <b>&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;/dev/twe[0-9]&quot;</b>,
      <b>&quot;/dev/twa[0-9]&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;/dev/twl[0-9]&quot;</b>: see
      details below. For disks behind HighPoint RocketRAID controllers you may
      need <b>&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;</b>. For disks behind Areca SATA RAID
      controllers, you need <b>&quot;/dev/sg[2-9]&quot;</b> (note that
      smartmontools interacts with the Areca controllers via a SCSI generic
      device which is different than the SCSI device used for reading and
      writing data)! For HP Smart Array RAID controllers, there are three
      currently supported drivers: cciss, hpsa, and hpahcisr. For disks accessed
      via the cciss driver the device nodes are of the form
      <b>&quot;/dev/cciss/c[0-9]d0&quot;</b>. For disks accessed via the
      hpahcisr and hpsa drivers, the device nodes you need are
      <b>&quot;/dev/sg[0-9]*&quot;</b>. (&quot;lsscsi -g&quot; is helpful in
      determining which scsi generic device node corresponds to which device.)
      Use the nodes corresponding to the RAID controllers, not the nodes
      corresponding to logical drives. See the <b>-d</b> option below, as
    well.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
if &#x00B4;-&#x00B4; is specified as the device path, <b>smartctl</b> reads and
  interprets it's own debug output from standard input. See &#x00B4;-r
  ataioctl&#x00B4; below for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Based on the device path, <b>smartctl</b> will guess the device type (ATA or
  SCSI). If necessary, the &#x00B4;-d&#x00B4; option can be used to override
  this guess
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the printed output of <b>smartctl</b> displays most numerical values
  in base 10 (decimal), but some values are displayed in base 16 (hexadecimal).
  To distinguish them, the base 16 values are always displayed with a leading
  <b>&quot;0x&quot;</b>, for example: &quot;0xff&quot;. This man page follows
  the same convention.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The options are grouped below into several categories. <b>smartctl</b> will
  execute the corresponding commands in the order: INFORMATION, ENABLE/DISABLE,
  DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT TESTS.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d TYPE, --device=TYPE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the type of the device. The valid arguments to

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>auto</i> - attempt to guess the device type from the device name or from
      controller type info provided by the operating system or from a matching
      USB ID entry in the drive database. This is the default.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>test</i> - prints the guessed type, then opens the device and prints the
      (possibly changed) TYPE name and then exists without performing any
      further commands.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>ata</i> - the device type is ATA. This prevents <b>smartctl</b> from
      issuing SCSI commands to an ATA device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>scsi</i> - the device type is SCSI. This prevents <b>smartctl</b> from
      issuing ATA commands to a SCSI device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>sat[,auto][,N]</i> - the device type is SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT).
      This is for ATA disks that have a SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) Layer
      (SATL) between the disk and the operating system. SAT defines two ATA PASS
      THROUGH SCSI commands, one 12 bytes long and the other 16 bytes long. The
      default is the 16 byte variant which can be overridden with either
      &#x00B4;-d sat,12&#x00B4; or &#x00B4;-d sat,16&#x00B4;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If &#x00B4;-d sat,auto&#x00B4; is specified, device type SAT (for ATA/SATA
      disks) is only used if the SCSI INQUIRY data reports a SATL (VENDOR:
      &quot;ATA &quot;). Otherwise device type SCSI (for SCSI/SAS disks) is
      used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>usbcypress</i> - this device type is for ATA disks that are behind a
      Cypress USB to PATA bridge. This will use the ATACB proprietary scsi pass
      through command. The default SCSI operation code is 0x24, but although it
      can be overridden with &#x00B4;-d usbcypress,0xN&#x00B4;, where N is the
      scsi operation code, you're running the risk of damage to the device or
      filesystems on it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>usbjmicron[,p][,x][,PORT]</i> - this device type is for SATA disks that
      are behind a JMicron USB to PATA/SATA bridge. The 48-bit ATA commands
      (required e.g. for &#x00B4;-l xerror&#x00B4;, see below) do not work with
      all of these bridges and are therefore disabled by default. These commands
      can be enabled by &#x00B4;-d usbjmicron,x&#x00B4;. If two disks are
      connected to a bridge with two ports, an error message is printed if no
      PORT is specified. The port can be specified by &#x00B4;-d
      usbjmicron[,x],PORT&#x00B4; where PORT is 0 (master) or 1 (slave). This is
      not necessary if the device uses a port multiplier to connect multiple
      disks to one port. The disks appear under separate /dev/ice names then.
      CAUTION: Specifying &#x00B4;,x&#x00B4; for a device which does not support
      it results in I/O errors and may disconnect the drive. The same applies if
      the specified PORT does not exist or is not connected to a disk.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] The Prolific PL2507/3507 USB bridges
      with older firmware support a pass-through command similar to JMicron and
      work with &#x00B4;-d usbjmicron,0&#x00B4;. Newer Prolific firmware
      requires a modified command which can be selected by &#x00B4;-d
      usbjmicron,p&#x00B4;. Note that this does not yet support the SMART status
      command.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>usbsunplus</i> - this device type is for SATA disks that are behind a
      SunplusIT USB to SATA bridge.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>marvell</i> - [Linux only] interact with SATA disks behind Marvell
      chip-set controllers (using the Marvell rather than libata driver).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>megaraid,N</i> - [Linux only] the device consists of one or more SCSI/SAS
      disks connected to a MegaRAID controller. The non-negative integer N (in
      the range of 0 to 127 inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller is
      monitored. Use syntax such as:
    <pre>
<b>smartctl -a -d megaraid,2 /dev/sda</b>
<b>smartctl -a -d megaraid,0 /dev/sdb</b>
<b>smartctl -a -d megaraid,0 /dev/bus/0</b>
    </pre>
    This interface will also work for Dell PERC controllers. It is possible to
      set RAID device name as /dev/bus/N, where N is a SCSI bus number.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following entry in /proc/devices must exist:
    <br/>
    For PERC2/3/4 controllers: <b>megadevN</b>
    <br/>
    For PERC5/6 controllers: <b>megaraid_sas_ioctlN</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>3ware,N</i> - [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one or more
      ATA disks connected to a 3ware RAID controller. The non-negative integer N
      (in the range from 0 to 127 inclusive) denotes which disk on the
      controller is monitored. Use syntax such as:
    <pre>
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,2 /dev/sda</b>  [Linux only]
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0</b>
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0</b>
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twl0</b> [Linux only]
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/tws0</b> [FreeBSD only]
    </pre>
    The first two forms, which refer to devices /dev/sda-z and /dev/twe0-15, may
      be used with 3ware series 6000, 7000, and 8000 series controllers that use
      the 3x-xxxx driver. <b>Note that the /dev/sda-z form is deprecated</b>
      starting with the Linux 2.6 kernel series and may not be supported by the
      Linux kernel in the near future. The final form, which refers to devices
      /dev/twa0-15, must be used with 3ware 9000 series controllers, which use
      the 3w-9xxx driver.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The devices /dev/twl0-15 [Linux] or /dev/tws0-15 [FreeBSD] must be used with
      the 3ware/LSI 9750 series controllers which use the 3w-sas driver.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that if the special character device nodes /dev/tw[ls]?, /dev/twa? and
      /dev/twe? do not exist, or exist with the incorrect major or minor
      numbers, smartctl will recreate them on the fly. Typically /dev/twa0
      refers to the first 9000-series controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the second
      9000 series controller, and so on. The /dev/twl0 devices refers to the
      first 9750 series controller, /dev/twl1 resfers to the second 9750 series
      controller, and so on. Likewise /dev/twe0 refers to the first
      6/7/8000-series controller, /dev/twe1 refers to the second 6/7/8000 series
      controller, and so on.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that for the 6/7/8000 controllers, <b>any</b> of the physical disks can
      be queried or examined using <b>any</b> of the 3ware's SCSI logical device
      /dev/sd? entries. Thus, if logical device /dev/sda is made up of two
      physical disks (3ware ports zero and one) and logical device /dev/sdb is
      made up of two other physical disks (3ware ports two and three) then you
      can examine the SMART data on <b>any</b> of the four physical disks using
      <b>either</b> SCSI device /dev/sda <b>or</b> /dev/sdb. If you need to know
      which logical SCSI device a particular physical disk (3ware port) is
      associated with, use the dmesg or SYSLOG output to show which SCSI ID
      corresponds to a particular 3ware unit, and then use the 3ware CLI or 3dm
      tool to determine which ports (physical disks) correspond to particular
      3ware units.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the value of N corresponds to a port that does <b>not</b> exist on the
      3ware controller, or to a port that does not physically have a disk
      attached to it, the behavior of <b>smartctl</b> depends upon the specific
      controller model, firmware, Linux kernel and platform. In some cases you
      will get a warning message that the device does not exist. In other cases
      you will be presented with &#x00B4;void&#x00B4; data for a non-existent
      device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that if the /dev/sd? addressing form is used, then older 3w-xxxx
      drivers do not pass the &quot;Enable Autosave&quot; (&#x00B4; <b>-S
      on</b>&#x00B4;) and &quot;Enable Automatic Offline&quot; (&#x00B4; <b>-o
      on</b>&#x00B4;) commands to the disk, and produce these types of harmless
      syslog error messages instead: &quot; <b>3w-xxxx: tw_ioctl(): Passthru
      size (123392) too</b> <b>big</b>&quot;. This can be fixed by upgrading to
      version 1.02.00.037 or later of the 3w-xxxx driver, or by applying a patch
      to older versions. Alternatively, use the character device /dev/twe0-15
      interface.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The selective self-test functions (&#x00B4;-t select,A-B&#x00B4;) are only
      supported using the character device interface /dev/twl0-15, /dev/tws0-15,
      /dev/twa0-15 and /dev/twe0-15. The necessary WRITE LOG commands can not be
      passed through the SCSI interface.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>areca,N</i> - [FreeBSD, Linux, Windows and Cygwin only] the device
      consists of one or more SATA disks connected to an Areca SATA RAID
      controller. The positive integer N (in the range from 1 to 24 inclusive)
      denotes which disk on the controller is monitored. On Linux use syntax
      such as:
    <pre>
<b>smartctl -a -d areca,2 /dev/sg2</b>
<b>smartctl -a -d areca,3 /dev/sg3</b>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that the SMART automatic offline test command is listed as
      &quot;Obsolete&quot; in every version of the ATA and ATA/ATAPI
      Specifications. It was originally part of the SFF-8035i Revision 2.0
      specification, but was never part of any ATA specification. However it is
      implemented and used by many vendors. [Good documentation can be found in
      IBM&#x00B4;s Official Published Disk Specifications. For example the IBM
      Travelstar 40GNX Hard Disk Drive Specifications (Revision 1.1, 22 April
      2002, Publication # 1541, Document S07N-7715-02) page 164. You can also
      read the SFF-8035i Specification -- see REFERENCES below.] You can tell if
      automatic offline testing is supported by seeing if this command enables
      and disables it, as indicated by the &#x00B4;Auto Offline Data
      Collection&#x00B4; part of the SMART capabilities report (displayed with
      &#x00B4;-c&#x00B4;).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    SMART provides <b>three</b> basic categories of testing. The <b>first</b>
      category, called &quot;online&quot; testing, has no effect on the
      performance of the device. It is turned on by the &#x00B4;-s on&#x00B4;
      option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>second</b> category of testing is called &quot;offline&quot; testing.
      This type of test can, in principle, degrade the device performance. The
      &#x00B4;-o on&#x00B4; option causes this offline testing to be carried
      out, automatically, on a regular scheduled basis. Normally, the disk will
      suspend offline testing while disk accesses are taking place, and then
      automatically resume it when the disk would otherwise be idle, so in
      practice it has little effect. Note that a one-time offline test can also
      be carried out immediately upon receipt of a user command. See the
      &#x00B4;-t offline&#x00B4; option below, which causes a one-time offline
      test to be carried out immediately.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The choice (made by the SFF-8035i and ATA specification authors) of the word
      <i>testing</i> for these first two categories is unfortunate, and often
      leads to confusion. In fact these first two categories of online and
      offline testing could have been more accurately described as online and
      offline <b>data collection</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The results of this automatic or immediate offline testing (data collection)
      are reflected in the values of the SMART Attributes. Thus, if problems or
      errors are detected, the values of these Attributes will go below their
      failure thresholds; some types of errors may also appear in the SMART
      error log. These are visible with the &#x00B4;-A&#x00B4; and &#x00B4;-l
      error&#x00B4; options respectively.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Some SMART attribute values are updated only during off-line data collection
      activities; the rest are updated during normal operation of the device or
      during both normal operation and off-line testing. The Attribute value
      table produced by the &#x00B4;-A&#x00B4; option indicates this in the
      UPDATED column. Attributes of the first type are labeled
      &quot;Offline&quot; and Attributes of the second type are labeled
      &quot;Always&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>third</b> category of testing (and the <i>only</i> category for which
      the word &#x00B4;testing&#x00B4; is really an appropriate choice) is
      &quot;self&quot; testing. This third type of test is only performed
      (immediately) when a command to run it is issued. The &#x00B4;-t&#x00B4;
      and &#x00B4;-X&#x00B4; options can be used to carry out and abort such
      self-tests; please see below for further details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Any errors detected in the self testing will be shown in the SMART self-test
      log, which can be examined using the &#x00B4;-l selftest&#x00B4; option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Note:</b> in this manual page, the word <b>&quot;Test&quot;</b> is used
      in connection with the second category just described, e.g. for the
      &quot;offline&quot; testing. The words <b>&quot;Self-test&quot;</b> are

  <dd class="It-tag">[ATA only] Prints only the generic SMART capabilities.
      These show what SMART features are implemented and how the device will
      respond to some of the different SMART commands. For example it shows if
      the device logs errors, if it supports offline surface scanning, and so
      on. If the device can carry out self-tests, this option also shows the

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-A, --attributes</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[ATA] Prints only the vendor specific SMART Attributes. The
      Attributes are numbered from 1 to 253 and have specific names and ID
      numbers. For example Attribute 12 is &quot;power cycle count&quot;: how
      many times has the disk been powered up.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each Attribute has a &quot;Raw&quot; value, printed under the heading
      &quot;RAW_VALUE&quot;, and a &quot;Normalized&quot; value printed under
      the heading &quot;VALUE&quot;. [Note: <b>smartctl</b> prints these values
      in base-10.] In the example just given, the &quot;Raw Value&quot; for
      Attribute 12 would be the actual number of times that the disk has been
      power-cycled, for example 365 if the disk has been turned on once per day
      for exactly one year. Each vendor uses their own algorithm to convert this
      &quot;Raw&quot; value to a &quot;Normalized&quot; value in the range from
      1 to 254. Please keep in mind that <b>smartctl</b> only reports the
      different Attribute types, values, and thresholds as read from the device.
      It does <b>not</b> carry out the conversion between &quot;Raw&quot; and
      &quot;Normalized&quot; values: this is done by the disk&#x00B4;s firmware.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The conversion from Raw value to a quantity with physical units is not
      specified by the SMART standard. In most cases, the values printed by
      <b>smartctl</b> are sensible. For example the temperature Attribute
      generally has its raw value equal to the temperature in Celsius. However
      in some cases vendors use unusual conventions. For example the Hitachi
      disk on my laptop reports its power-on hours in minutes, not hours. Some
      IBM disks track three temperatures rather than one, in their raw values.
      And so on.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each Attribute also has a Threshold value (whose range is 0 to 255) which is
      printed under the heading &quot;THRESH&quot;. If the Normalized value is
      <b>less than or equal to</b> the Threshold value, then the Attribute is
      said to have failed. If the Attribute is a pre-failure Attribute, then
      disk failure is imminent.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each Attribute also has a &quot;Worst&quot; value shown under the heading
      &quot;WORST&quot;. This is the smallest (closest to failure) value that
      the disk has recorded at any time during its lifetime when SMART was
      enabled. [Note however that some vendors firmware may actually
      <b>increase</b> the &quot;Worst&quot; value for some &quot;rate-type&quot;
      Attributes.]
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The Attribute table printed out by <b>smartctl</b> also shows the
      &quot;TYPE&quot; of the Attribute. Attributes are one of two possible
      types: Pre-failure or Old age. Pre-failure Attributes are ones which, if
      less than or equal to their threshold values, indicate pending disk
      failure. Old age, or usage Attributes, are ones which indicate
      end-of-product life from old-age or normal aging and wearout, if the
      Attribute value is less than or equal to the threshold. <b>Please</b>
      <b>note</b>: the fact that an Attribute is of type 'Pre-fail' does
      <b>not</b> mean that your disk is about to fail! It only has this meaning
      if the Attribute&#x00B4;s current Normalized value is less than or equal
      to the threshold value.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the Attribute&#x00B4;s current Normalized value is less than or equal to
      the threshold value, then the &quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column will display
      &quot;FAILING_NOW&quot;. If not, but the worst recorded value is less than
      or equal to the threshold value, then this column will display
      &quot;In_the_past&quot;. If the &quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column has no
      entry (indicated by a dash: &#x00B4;-&#x00B4;) then this Attribute is OK
      now (not failing) and has also never failed in the past.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The table column labeled &quot;UPDATED&quot; shows if the SMART Attribute
      values are updated during both normal operation and off-line testing, or
      only during offline testing. The former are labeled &quot;Always&quot; and
      the latter are labeled &quot;Offline&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    So to summarize: the Raw Attribute values are the ones that might have a
      real physical interpretation, such as &quot;Temperature Celsius&quot;,
      &quot;Hours&quot;, or &quot;Start-Stop Cycles&quot;. Each manufacturer
      converts these, using their detailed knowledge of the disk&#x00B4;s
      operations and failure modes, to Normalized Attribute values in the range
      1-254. The current and worst (lowest measured) of these Normalized
      Attribute values are stored on the disk, along with a Threshold value that
      the manufacturer has determined will indicate that the disk is going to
      fail, or that it has exceeded its design age or aging limit.
      <b>smartctl</b> does <b>not</b> calculate any of the Attribute values,
      thresholds, or types, it merely reports them from the SMART data on the
      device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that starting with ATA/ATAPI-4, revision 4, the meaning of these
      Attribute fields has been made entirely vendor-specific. However most
      newer ATA/SATA disks seem to respect their meaning, so we have retained
      the option of printing the Attribute values.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Solid-state drives use different meanings for some of the attributes. In
      this case the attribute name printed by smartctl is incorrect unless the
      drive is already in the smartmontools drive database.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    [SCSI] For SCSI devices the &quot;attributes&quot; are obtained from the

    <i>error</i> - [ATA] prints the Summary SMART error log. SMART disks
      maintain a log of the most recent five non-trivial errors. For each of
      these errors, the disk power-on lifetime at which the error occurred is
      recorded, as is the device status (idle, standby, etc) at the time of the
      error. For some common types of errors, the Error Register (ER) and Status
      Register (SR) values are decoded and printed as text. The meanings of
      these are:
    <pre>

    </pre>
    In addition, up to the last five commands that preceded the error are
      listed, along with a timestamp measured from the start of the
      corresponding power cycle. This is displayed in the form Dd+HH:MM:SS.msec
      where D is the number of days, HH is hours, MM is minutes, SS is seconds
      and msec is milliseconds. [Note: this time stamp wraps after 2^32
      milliseconds, or 49 days 17 hours 2 minutes and 47.296 seconds.] The key
      ATA disk registers are also recorded in the log. The final column of the
      error log is a text-string description of the ATA command defined by the
      Command Register (CR) and Feature Register (FR) values. Commands that are
      obsolete in the most current spec are listed like this: <b>READ LONG (w/
      retry) [OBS-4]</b>, indicating that the command became obsolete with or in
      the ATA-4 specification. Similarly, the notation
      <b>[RET-</b><i>N</i><b>]</b> is used to indicate that a command was
      retired in the ATA- <i>N</i> specification. Some commands are not defined
      in any version of the ATA specification but are in common use nonetheless;
      these are marked <b>[NS]</b>, meaning non-standard.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The ATA Specification (ATA-5 Revision 1c, Section 8.41.6.8.2) says:
      <b>&quot;Error log structures shall include UNC errors, IDNF errors
      for</b> <b>which the address requested was valid, servo errors, write
      fault</b> <b>errors, etc. Error log data structures shall not include
      errors</b> <b>attributed to the receipt of faulty commands such as command
      codes not</b> <b>implemented by the device or requests with invalid
      parameters or</b> <b>invalid addresses.&quot;</b> The definitions of these
      terms are:
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>UNC</b> (<b>UNC</b>orrectable): data is uncorrectable. This refers to
      data which has been read from the disk, but for which the Error Checking
      and Correction (ECC) codes are inconsistent. In effect, this means that
      the data can not be read.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>IDNF</b> (<b>ID N</b>ot <b>F</b>ound): user-accessible address could not
      be found. For READ LOG type commands, <b>IDNF</b> can also indicate that a
      device data log structure checksum was incorrect.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the command that caused the error was a READ or WRITE command, then the
      Logical Block Address (LBA) at which the error occurred will be printed in
      base 10 and base 16. The LBA is a linear address, which counts 512-byte
      sectors on the disk, starting from zero. (Because of the limitations of
      the SMART error log, if the LBA is greater than 0xfffffff, then either no
      error log entry will be made, or the error log entry will have an
      incorrect LBA. This may happen for drives with a capacity greater than 128
      GiB or 137 GB.) On Linux systems the smartmontools web page has
      instructions about how to convert the LBA address to the name of the disk
      file containing the erroneous disk sector.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Please note that some manufacturers <b>ignore</b> the ATA specifications,
      and make entries in the error log if the device receives a command which
      is not implemented or is not valid.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>error</i> - [SCSI] prints the error counter log pages for reads, write
      and verifies. The verify row is only output if it has an element other
      than zero.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>xerror[,NUM][,error]</i> - [ATA only] prints the Extended Comprehensive
      SMART error log (General Purpose Log address 0x03). Unlike the Summary
      SMART error log (see &#x00B4;-l error&#x00B4; above), it provides
      sufficient space to log the contents of the 48-bit LBA register set
      introduced with ATA-6. It also supports logs with more than one sector.
      Each sector holds up to 4 log entries. The actual number of log sectors is
      vendor specific, typical values for HDD are 2 (Samsung), 5 (Seagate) or 6
      (WD).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Only the 8 most recent error log entries are printed by default. This number
      can be changed by the optional parameter NUM.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If ',error' is appended and the Extended Comprehensive SMART error log is
      not supported, the Summary SMART self-test log is printed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Please note that recent drives may report errors only in the Extended
      Comprehensive SMART error log. The Summary SMART error log may be reported
      as supported but is always empty then.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>selftest</i> - [ATA] prints the SMART self-test log. The disk maintains a
      self-test log showing the results of the self tests, which can be run
      using the &#x00B4;-t&#x00B4; option described below. For each of the most
      recent twenty-one self-tests, the log shows the type of test (short or
      extended, off-line or captive) and the final status of the test. If the
      test did not complete successfully, then the percentage of the test
      remaining is shown. The time at which the test took place, measured in
      hours of disk lifetime, is also printed. [Note: this time stamp wraps
      after 2^16 hours, or 2730 days and 16 hours, or about 7.5 years.] If any
      errors were detected, the Logical Block Address (LBA) of the first error
      is printed in decimal notation. On Linux systems the smartmontools web
      page has instructions about how to convert this LBA address to the name of
      the disk file containing the erroneous block.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>selftest</i> - [SCSI] the self-test log for a SCSI device has a slightly
      different format than for an ATA device. For each of the most recent
      twenty self-tests, it shows the type of test and the status (final or in
      progress) of the test. SCSI standards use the terms &quot;foreground&quot;
      and &quot;background&quot; (rather than ATA&#x00B4;s corresponding
      &quot;captive&quot; and &quot;off-line&quot;) and &quot;short&quot; and
      &quot;long&quot; (rather than ATA&#x00B4;s corresponding &quot;short&quot;
      and &quot;extended&quot;) to describe the type of the test. The printed
      segment number is only relevant when a test fails in the third or later
      test segment. It identifies the test that failed and consists of either
      the number of the segment that failed during the test, or the number of
      the test that failed and the number of the segment in which the test was
      run, using a vendor-specific method of putting both numbers into a single
      byte. The Logical Block Address (LBA) of the first error is printed in
      hexadecimal notation. On Linux systems the smartmontools web page has
      instructions about how to convert this LBA address to the name of the disk
      file containing the erroneous block. If provided, the SCSI Sense Key (SK),
      Additional Sense Code (ASC) and Additional Sense Code Qualifier (ASQ) are
      also printed. The self tests can be run using the &#x00B4;-t&#x00B4;
      option described below (using the ATA test terminology).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>xselftest[,NUM][,selftest]</i> - [ATA only] prints the Extended SMART
      self-test log (General Purpose Log address 0x07). Unlike the SMART
      self-test log (see &#x00B4;-l selftest&#x00B4; above), it supports 48-bit
      LBA and logs with more than one sector. Each sector holds up to 19 log
      entries. The actual number of log sectors is vendor specific, typical
      values are 1 (Seagate) or 2 (Samsung).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Only the 25 most recent log entries are printed by default. This number can
      be changed by the optional parameter NUM.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If ',selftest' is appended and the Extended SMART self-test log is not
      supported, the old SMART self-test log is printed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>selective</i> - [ATA only] Please see the &#x00B4;-t select&#x00B4;
      option below for a description of selective self-tests. The selective
      self-test log shows the start/end Logical Block Addresses (LBA) of each of
      the five test spans, and their current test status. If the span is being
      tested or the remainder of the disk is being read-scanned, the current
      65536-sector block of LBAs being tested is also displayed. The selective
      self-test log also shows if a read-scan of the remainder of the disk will
      be carried out after the selective self-test has completed (see &#x00B4;-t
      afterselect&#x00B4; option) and the time delay before restarting this
      read-scan if it is interrupted (see &#x00B4;-t pending&#x00B4; option).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>directory[,gs]</i> - [ATA only] if the device supports the General
      Purpose Logging feature set (ATA-6 and above) then this prints the Log
      Directory (the log at address 0). The Log Directory shows what logs are
      available and their length in sectors (512 bytes). The contents of the
      logs at address 1 [Summary SMART error log] and at address 6 [SMART
      self-test log] may be printed using the previously-described <i>error</i>
      and <i>selftest</i> arguments to this option. If your version of smartctl
      supports 48-bit ATA commands, both the General Purpose Log (GPL) and SMART
      Log (SL) directories are printed in one combined table. The output can be
      restricted to the GPL directory or SL directory by &#x00B4;-l
      directory,q&#x00B4; or &#x00B4;-l directory,s&#x00B4; respectively.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>background</i> - [SCSI only] the background scan results log outputs
      information derived from Background Media Scans (BMS) done after power up
      and/or periodically (e.g. every 24 hours) on recent SCSI disks. If
      supported, the BMS status is output first, indicating whether a background
      scan is currently underway (and if so a progress percentage), the amount
      of time the disk has been powered up and the number of scans already
      completed. Then there is a header and a line for each background scan
      &quot;event&quot;. These will typically be either recovered or
      unrecoverable errors. That latter group may need some attention. There is
      a description of the background scan mechanism in section 4.18 of SBC-3
      revision 6 (see www.t10.org ).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>scttemp, scttempsts, scttemphist</i> - [ATA only] prints the disk
      temperature information provided by the SMART Command Transport (SCT)
      commands. The option &#x00B4;scttempsts&#x00B4; prints current temperature
      and temperature ranges returned by the SCT Status command,
      &#x00B4;scttemphist&#x00B4; prints temperature limits and the temperature
      history table returned by the SCT Data Table command, and
      &#x00B4;scttemp&#x00B4; prints both. The temperature values are preserved
      across power cycles. The logging interval can be configured with the
      &#x00B4;-l scttempint,N[,p]&#x00B4; option, see below. The SCT commands
      were introduced in ATA8-ACS and were also supported by many ATA-7 disks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>scttempint,N[,p]</i> - [ATA only] clears the SCT temperature history
      table and sets the time interval for temperature logging to N minutes. If
      &#x00B4;,p&#x00B4; is specified, the setting is preserved across power
      cycles. Otherwise, the setting is volatile and will be reverted to the
      last non-volatile setting by the next hard reset. The default interval is
      vendor specific, typical values are 1, 2, or 5 minutes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>scterc[,READTIME,WRITETIME]</i> - [ATA only] prints values and
      descriptions of the SCT Error Recovery Control settings. These are
      equivalent to TLER (as used by Western Digital), CCTL (as used by Samsung
      and Hitachi) and ERC (as used by Seagate). READTIME and WRITETIME
      arguments (deciseconds) set the specified values. Values of 0 disable the
      feature, other values less than 65 are probably not supported. For RAID
      configurations, this is typically set to 70,70 deciseconds.

    <i>devstat[,PAGE]</i> - [ATA only] prints values and descriptions of the ATA
      Device Statistics log pages (General Purpose Log address 0x04). If no PAGE
      number is specified, entries from all supported pages are printed. If PAGE
      0 is specified, the list of supported pages is printed. Device Statistics
      was introduced in ACS-2 and is only supported by some recent devices (e.g.
      Hitachi 7K3000, Intel 320, 330, 520 and 710 Series SSDs, Crucial/Micron m4
      SSDs).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>sataphy[,reset]</i> - [SATA only] prints values and descriptions of the
      SATA Phy Event Counters (General Purpose Log address 0x11). If &#x00B4;-l
      sataphy,reset&#x00B4; is specified, all counters are reset after reading
      the values. This also works for SATA devices with Packet interface like
      CD/DVD drives.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>sasphy[,reset]</i> - [SAS (SCSI) only] prints values and descriptions of
      the SAS (SSP) Protocol Specific log page (log page 0x18). If &#x00B4;-l

      the values.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>gplog,ADDR[,FIRST[-LAST|+SIZE]]</i> - [ATA only] prints a hex dump of any
      log accessible via General Purpose Logging (GPL) feature. The log address
      ADDR is the hex address listed in the log directory (see &#x00B4;-l
      directory&#x00B4; above). The range of log sectors (pages) can be
      specified by decimal values FIRST-LAST or FIRST+SIZE. FIRST defaults to 0,
      SIZE defaults to 1. LAST can be set to &#x00B4;max&#x00B4; to specify the
      last page of the log.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>smartlog,ADDR[,FIRST[-LAST|+SIZE]]</i> - [ATA only] prints a hex dump of
      any log accessible via SMART Read Log command. See &#x00B4;-l
      gplog,...&#x00B4; above for parameter syntax.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, all these commands:
    <pre>
  smartctl -l gplog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda
  smartctl -l gplog,0x80,10+6 /dev/sda
  smartctl -l smartlog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda
    </pre>
    print pages 10-15 of log 0x80 (first host vendor specific log).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The hex dump format is compatible with the &#x00B4;xxd -r&#x00B4; command.
      This command:
    <pre>
  smartctl -l gplog,0x11 /dev/sda | grep ^0 | xxd -r &gt;log.bin
    </pre>
    writes a binary representation of the one sector log 0x11 (SATA Phy Event
      Counters) to file log.bin.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>ssd</i> - [ATA] prints the Solid State Device Statistics log page. This

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>raw24/raw24</i> - Raw Attribute contains two 24-bit values. The first is
      the number of load cycles. The second is the number of unload cycles. The
      difference between these two values is the number of times that the drive
      was unexpectedly powered off (also called an emergency unload). As a rule

    <i>none</i> - Assume that the device firmware obeys the ATA specifications.
      This is the default, unless the device has presets for &#x00B4;-F&#x00B4;

    <i>nologdir</i> - Suppresses read attempts of SMART or GP Log Directory.
      Support for all standard logs is assumed without an actual check. Some
      Intel SSDs may freeze if log address 0 is read.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>samsung</i> - In some Samsung disks (example: model SV4012H Firmware
      Version: RM100-08) some of the two- and four-byte quantities in the SMART
      data structures are byte-swapped (relative to the ATA specification).
      Enabling this option tells <b>smartctl</b> to evaluate these quantities in
      byte-reversed order. Some signs that your disk needs this option are (1)
      no self-test log printed, even though you have run self-tests; (2) very
      large numbers of ATA errors reported in the ATA error log; (3) strange and
      impossible values for the ATA error log timestamps.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>samsung2</i> - In some Samsung disks the number of ATA errors reported is
      byte swapped. Enabling this option tells <b>smartctl</b> to evaluate this
      quantity in byte-reversed order. An indication that your Samsung disk
      needs this option is that the self-test log is printed correctly, but
      there are a very large number of errors in the SMART error log. This is
      because the error count is byte swapped. Thus a disk with five errors
      (0x0005) will appear to have 20480 errors (0x5000).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>samsung3</i> - Some Samsung disks (at least SP2514N with Firmware
      VF100-37) report a self-test still in progress with 0% remaining when the
      test was already completed. Enabling this option modifies the output of
      the self-test execution status (see options &#x00B4;-c&#x00B4; or
      &#x00B4;-a&#x00B4; above) accordingly.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  <dd class="It-tag">Executes TEST immediately. The &#x00B4;-C&#x00B4; option
      can be used in conjunction with this option to run the short or long (and
      also for ATA devices, selective or conveyance) self-tests in captive mode
      (known as &quot;foreground mode&quot; for SCSI devices). Note that only
      one test type can be run at a time, so only one test type should be
      specified per command line. Note also that if a computer is shutdown or
      power cycled during a self-test, no harm should result. The self-test will
      either be aborted or will resume automatically.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All &#x00B4;-t TEST&#x00B4; commands can be given during normal system
      operation unless captive mode (&#x00B4;-C&#x00B4; option) is used. A
      running self-test can, however, degrade performance of the drive. Frequent
      I/O requests from the operating system increase the duration of a test.
      These impacts may vary from device to device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a test failure occurs then the device may discontinue the testing and
      report the result immediately.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The valid arguments to this option are:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>offline</i> - [ATA] runs SMART Immediate Offline Test. This immediately
      starts the test described above. This command can be given during normal
      system operation. The effects of this test are visible only in that it
      updates the SMART Attribute values, and if errors are found they will
      appear in the SMART error log, visible with the &#x00B4;-l error&#x00B4;
      option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the &#x00B4;-c&#x00B4; option to <b>smartctl</b> shows that the device
      has the &quot;Suspend Offline collection upon new command&quot; capability
      then you can track the progress of the Immediate Offline test using the
      &#x00B4;-c&#x00B4; option to <b>smartctl</b>. If the &#x00B4;-c&#x00B4;
      option show that the device has the &quot;Abort Offline collection upon
      new command&quot; capability then most commands will abort the Immediate
      Offline Test, so you should not try to track the progress of the test with
      &#x00B4;-c&#x00B4;, as it will abort the test.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>offline</i> - [SCSI] runs the default self test in foreground. No entry
      is placed in the self test log.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>short</i> - [ATA] runs SMART Short Self Test (usually under ten minutes).
      This command can be given during normal system operation (unless run in
      captive mode - see the &#x00B4;-C&#x00B4; option below). This is a test in
      a different category than the immediate or automatic offline tests. The
      &quot;Self&quot; tests check the electrical and mechanical performance as
      well as the read performance of the disk. Their results are reported in
      the Self Test Error Log, readable with the &#x00B4;-l selftest&#x00B4;
      option. Note that on some disks the progress of the self-test can be
      monitored by watching this log during the self-test; with other disks use
      the &#x00B4;-c&#x00B4; option to monitor progress.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>short</i> - [SCSI] runs the &quot;Background short&quot; self-test.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>long</i> - [ATA] runs SMART Extended Self Test (tens of minutes). This is
      a longer and more thorough version of the Short Self Test described above.
      Note that this command can be given during normal system operation (unless
      run in captive mode - see the &#x00B4;-C&#x00B4; option below).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>long</i> - [SCSI] runs the &quot;Background long&quot; self-test.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>conveyance</i> - [ATA only] runs a SMART Conveyance Self Test (minutes).
      This self-test routine is intended to identify damage incurred during
      transporting of the device. This self-test routine should take on the
      order of minutes to complete. Note that this command can be given during
      normal system operation (unless run in captive mode - see the
      &#x00B4;-C&#x00B4; option below).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>select,N-M, select,N+SIZE</i> - [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective Self
      Test, to test a <b>range</b> of disk Logical Block Addresses (LBAs),
      rather than the entire disk. Each range of LBAs that is checked is called
      a &quot;span&quot; and is specified by a starting LBA (N) and an ending
      LBA (M) with N less than or equal to M. The range can also be specified as
      N+SIZE. A span at the end of a disk can be specified by N- <b>max</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example the commands:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,10+11 /dev/hda
    </pre>
    both runs a self test on one span consisting of LBAs ten to twenty
      (inclusive). The command:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,100000000-max /dev/hda
    </pre>
    run a self test from LBA 100000000 up to the end of the disk. The
      &#x00B4;-t&#x00B4; option can be given up to five times, to test up to
      five spans. For example the command:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-100 -t select,1000-2000 /dev/hda
    </pre>
    runs a self test on two spans. The first span consists of 101 LBAs and the
      second span consists of 1001 LBAs. Note that the spans can overlap
      partially or completely, for example:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-10 -t select,5-15 -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
    </pre>
    The results of the selective self-test can be obtained (both during and
      after the test) by printing the SMART self-test log, using the &#x00B4;-l
      selftest&#x00B4; option to smartctl.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Selective self tests are particularly useful as disk capacities increase: an
      extended self test (smartctl -t long) can take several hours. Selective
      self-tests are helpful if (based on SYSLOG error messages, previous failed
      self-tests, or SMART error log entries) you suspect that a disk is having
      problems at a particular range of Logical Block Addresses (LBAs).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Selective self-tests can be run during normal system operation (unless done
      in captive mode - see the &#x00B4;-C&#x00B4; option below).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following variants of the selective self-test command use spans based on
      the ranges from past tests already stored on the disk:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>select,redo[+SIZE]</i> - [ATA only] redo the last SMART Selective Self
      Test using the same LBA range. The starting LBA is identical to the LBA
      used by last test, same for ending LBA unless a new span size is specified
      by optional +SIZE argument.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example the commands:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,redo /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,redo+20 /dev/hda
    </pre>
    have the same effect as:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,10-29 /dev/hda
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>select,next[+SIZE]</i> - [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective Self Test on
      the LBA range which follows the range of the last test. The starting LBA
      is set to (ending LBA +1) of the last test. A new span size may be
      specified by the optional +SIZE argument.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example the commands:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,next /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,next+2000 /dev/hda
    </pre>
    have the same effect as:
    <pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,1000-1999 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,2000-3999 /dev/hda
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the last test ended at the last LBA of the disk, the new range starts at
      LBA 0. The span size of the last span of a disk is adjusted such that the
      total number of spans to check the full disk will not be changed by future
      uses of &#x00B4;-t select,next&#x00B4;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>select,cont[+SIZE]</i> - [ATA only] performs a &#x00B4;redo&#x00B4;
      (above) if the self test status reports that the last test was aborted by
      the host. Otherwise it run the &#x00B4;next&#x00B4; (above) test.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>afterselect,on</i> - [ATA only] perform an offline read scan after a
      Selective self-test has completed. This option must be used together with
      one or more of the <i>select,N-M</i> options above. If the LBAs that have
      been specified in the Selective self-test pass the test with no errors
      found, then read scan the <b>remainder</b> of the disk. If the device is
      powered-cycled while this read scan is in progress, the read scan will be
      automatically resumed after a time specified by the pending timer (see
      below). The value of this option is preserved between selective
      self-tests.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>afterselect,off</i> - [ATA only] do not read scan the remainder of the
      disk after a Selective self-test has completed. This option must be use
      together with one or more of the <i>select,N-M</i> options above. The
      value of this option is preserved between selective self-tests.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>pending,N</i> - [ATA only] set the pending offline read scan timer to N
      minutes. Here N is an integer in the range from 0 to 65535 inclusive. If
      the device is powered off during a read scan after a Selective self-test,
      then resume the test automatically N minutes after power-up. This option
      must be use together with one or more of the <i>select,N-M</i> options
      above. The value of this option is preserved between selective self-tests.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>vendor,N</i> - [ATA only] issues the ATA command SMART EXECUTE OFF-LINE
      IMMEDIATE with subcommand N in LBA LOW register. The subcommand is
      specified as a hex value in the range 0x00 to 0xff. Subcommands 0x40-0x7e
      and 0x90-0xff are reserved for vendor specific use, see table 61 of
      T13/1699-D Revision 6a (ATA8-ACS). Note that the subcommands
      0x00-0x04,0x7f,0x81-0x84 are supported by other smartctl options (e.g.
      0x01: &#x00B4;-t short&#x00B4;, 0x7f: &#x00B4;-X&#x00B4;, 0x82: &#x00B4;-C
      -t long&#x00B4;).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>WARNING: Only run subcommands documented by the vendor of the</b>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ATA,_SCSI_command_sets_and_SAT"><a class="selflink" href="#ATA,_SCSI_command_sets_and_SAT">ATA,
  SCSI command sets and SAT</a></h1>
In the past there has been a clear distinction between storage devices that used
  the ATA and SCSI command sets. This distinction was often reflected in their
  device naming and hardware. Now various SCSI transports (e.g. SAS, FC and
  iSCSI) can interconnect to both SCSI disks (e.g. FC and SAS) and ATA disks
  (especially SATA). USB and IEEE 1394 storage devices use the SCSI command set
  externally but almost always contain ATA or SATA disks (or flash). The storage
  subsystems in some operating systems have started to remove the distinction
  between ATA and SCSI in their device naming policies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
99% of operations that an OS performs on a disk involve the SCSI INQUIRY, READ
  CAPACITY, READ and WRITE commands, or their ATA equivalents. Since the SCSI
  commands are slightly more general than their ATA equivalents, many OSes are
  generating SCSI commands (mainly READ and WRITE) and letting a lower level
  translate them to their ATA equivalents as the need arises. An important note
  here is that &quot;lower level&quot; may be in external equipment and hence
  outside the control of an OS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) is a standard (ANSI INCITS 431-2007) that
  specifies how this translation is done. For the other 1% of operations that an
  OS performs on a disk, SAT provides two options. First is an optional ATA
  PASS-THROUGH SCSI command (there are two variants). The second is a
  translation from the closest SCSI command. Most current interest is in the
  &quot;pass-through&quot; option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The relevance to smartmontools (and hence smartctl) is that its interactions
  with disks fall solidly into the &quot;1%&quot; category. So even if the OS
  can happily treat (and name) a disk as &quot;SCSI&quot;, smartmontools needs
  to detect the native command set and act accordingly. As more storage
  manufacturers (including external SATA drives) comply with SAT, smartmontools
  is able to automatically distinguish the native command set of the device. In
  some cases the '-d sat' option is needed on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also virtual disks which typically have no useful information to
  convey to smartmontools, but could conceivably in the future. An example of a
  virtual disk is the OS's view of a RAID 1 box. There are most likely two SATA
  disks inside a RAID 1 box. Addressing those SATA disks from a distant OS is a
  challenge for smartmontools. Another approach is running a tool like
  smartmontools inside the RAID 1 box (e.g. a Network Attached Storage (NAS)
  box) and fetching the logs via a browser.

To test within the shell for whether or not the different bits are turned on or
  off, you can use the following type of construction (this is bash syntax):
<pre>
<b>smartstat=$(($? &amp; 8))</b>
</pre>
This looks at only at bit 3 of the exit status <b>$?</b> (since 8=2^3). The
  shell variable $smartstat will be nonzero if SMART status check returned
  &quot;disk failing&quot; and zero otherwise.

This bash script prints all status bits:
<pre>
status=$?
for ((i=0; i&lt;8; i++)); do
  echo &quot;Bit $i: $((status &amp; 2**i &amp;&amp; 1))&quot;
done
</pre>

The TapeAlert log page flags are cleared for the initiator when the page is
  read. This means that each alert condition is reported only once by
  <b>smartctl</b> for each initiator for each activation of the condition.

This code was derived from the smartsuite package, written by Michael Cornwell,
  and from the previous UCSC smartsuite package. It extends these to cover ATA-5
  disks. This code was originally developed as a Senior Thesis by Michael
  Cornwell at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the Storage Systems
  Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of California,
  Santa Cruz. <b>http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/</b> .

An introductory article about smartmontools is <i>Monitoring Hard</i> <i>Disks
  with SMART</i>, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal, January 2004, pages 74-77. This
  is <b>http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6983</b> online.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you would like to understand better how SMART works, and what it does, a good
  place to start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first volume of the
  &#x00B4;AT Attachment with Packet Interface-7&#x00B4; (ATA/ATAPI-7)
  specification Revision 4b. This documents the SMART functionality which the
  <b>smartmontools</b> utilities provide access to.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
The functioning of SMART was originally defined by the SFF-8035i revision 2 and
  the SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications. These are publications of the Small
  Form Factors (SFF) Committee.
