<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smartctl - Control and Monitor Utility for SMART Disks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
smartctl [options] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FULL PATH <br>
/usr/sbin/smartctl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGE VERSION <br>
smartmontools-6.2 2013-07-26 r3841</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
[This man page is generated for the Linux version of
smartmontools. It does not contain info specific to other
platforms.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl controls the
Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART)
system built into most ATA/SATA and SCSI/SAS hard drives and
solid-state drives. The purpose of <br>
SMART is to monitor the reliability of the hard drive and
predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of
drive self-tests. smartctl also supports some features not
<br>
related to SMART. This version of smartctl is compatible
with ACS-2, ATA8-ACS, ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier standards (see
REFERENCES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl also provides support
for polling TapeAlert messages from SCSI tape drives and
changers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user must specify the device
to be controlled or interrogated as the final argument to
smartctl. The command set used by the device is often
derived from the device path but <br>
may need help with the &Acirc;&acute;-d&Acirc;&acute; option
(for more information see the section on &quot;ATA, SCSI
command sets and SAT&quot; below). Device paths are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINUX: Use the forms
&quot;/dev/hd[a-t]&quot; for IDE/ATA devices, and
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot; for SCSI devices. For SCSI Tape
Drives and Changers with TapeAlert support use the devices
<br>
&quot;/dev/nst*&quot; and &quot;/dev/sg*&quot;. For SATA
disks accessed with libata, use &quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot; and
append &quot;-d ata&quot;. For disks behind 3ware
controllers you may need &quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot; <br>
or &quot;/dev/twe[0-9]&quot;, &quot;/dev/twa[0-9]&quot; or
&quot;/dev/twl[0-9]&quot;: see details below. For disks
behind HighPoint RocketRAID controllers you may need
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;. For disks <br>
behind Areca SATA RAID controllers, you need
&quot;/dev/sg[2-9]&quot; (note that smartmontools interacts
with the Areca controllers via a SCSI generic device which
is different <br>
than the SCSI device used for reading and writing data)! For
HP Smart Array RAID controllers, there are three currently
supported drivers: cciss, hpsa, and hpahcisr. <br>
For disks accessed via the cciss driver the device nodes are
of the form &quot;/dev/cciss/c[0-9]d0&quot;. For disks
accessed via the hpahcisr and hpsa drivers, the device nodes
<br>
you need are &quot;/dev/sg[0-9]*&quot;. (&quot;lsscsi
-g&quot; is helpful in determining which scsi generic device
node corresponds to which device.) Use the nodes
corresponding to the <br>
RAID controllers, not the nodes corresponding to logical
drives. See the -d option below, as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if &Acirc;&acute;-&Acirc;&acute;
is specified as the device path, smartctl reads and
interprets it&rsquo;s own debug output from standard input.
See &Acirc;&acute;-r ataioctl&Acirc;&acute; below for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Based on the device path,
smartctl will guess the device type (ATA or SCSI). If
necessary, the &Acirc;&acute;-d&Acirc;&acute; option can be
used to override this guess</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the printed output of
smartctl displays most numerical values in base 10
(decimal), but some values are displayed in base 16
(hexadecimal). To distinguish them, the <br>
base 16 values are always displayed with a leading
&quot;0x&quot;, for example: &quot;0xff&quot;. This man page
follows the same convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options are grouped below into several categories.
smartctl will execute the corresponding commands in the
order: INFORMATION, ENABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT
TESTS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHOW INFORMATION OPTIONS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help, --usage <br>
Prints a usage message to STDOUT and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version, --copyright,
--license <br>
Prints version, copyright, license, home page and SVN
revision information for your copy of smartctl to STDOUT and
then exits. Please include this information if you are <br>
reporting bugs or problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
Prints the device model number, serial number, firmware
version, and ATA Standard version/revision information. Says
if the device supports SMART, and if so, whether <br>
SMART support is currently enabled or disabled. If the
device supports Logical Block Address mode (LBA mode) print
current user drive capacity in bytes. (If drive is has <br>
a user protected area reserved, or is &quot;clipped&quot;,
this may be smaller than the potential maximum drive
capacity.) Indicates if the drive is in the smartmontools
database <br>
(see &Acirc;&acute;-v&Acirc;&acute; options below). If so,
the drive model family may also be printed. If
&Acirc;&acute;-n&Acirc;&acute; (see below) is specified, the
power mode of the drive is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--identify[=[w][nvb]] <br>
[ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Prints an
annotated table of the IDENTIFY DEVICE data. By default,
only valid words (words not equal to 0x0000 or 0xffff) <br>
and nonzero bits and bit fields are printed. This can be
changed by the optional argument which consists of one or
two characters from the set
&Acirc;&acute;wnvb&Acirc;&acute;. The character
&Acirc;&acute;w&Acirc;&acute; <br>
enables printing of all 256 words. The character
&Acirc;&acute;n&Acirc;&acute; suppresses printing of bits,
&Acirc;&acute;v&Acirc;&acute; enables printing of all bits
from valid words, &Acirc;&acute;b&Acirc;&acute; enables
printing of all bits. For <br>
example &Acirc;&acute;--identify=n&Acirc;&acute; (valid
words, no bits) produces the shortest output and
&Acirc;&acute;--identify=wb&Acirc;&acute; (all words, all
bits) produces the longest output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
Prints all SMART information about the disk, or TapeAlert
information about the tape drive or changer. For ATA devices
this is equivalent to <br>
&Acirc;&acute;-H -i -c -A -l error -l selftest -l
selective&Acirc;&acute; <br>
and for SCSI, this is equivalent to <br>
&Acirc;&acute;-H -i -A -l error -l selftest&Acirc;&acute;.
<br>
Note that for ATA disks this does not enable the non-SMART
options and the SMART options which require support for
48-bit ATA commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --xall <br>
Prints all SMART and non-SMART information about the device.
For ATA devices this is equivalent to <br>
&Acirc;&acute;-H -i -g all -c -A -f brief -l xerror,error -l
xselftest,selftest <br>
-l selective -l directory -l scttemp -l scterc -l devstat -l
sataphy&Acirc;&acute;. <br>
and for SCSI, this is equivalent to <br>
&Acirc;&acute;-H -i -A -l error -l selftest -l background -l
sasphy&Acirc;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scan Scans for devices and
prints each device name, device type and protocol ([ATA] or
[SCSI]) info. May be used in conjunction with
&Acirc;&acute;-d TYPE&Acirc;&acute; to restrict the scan to
a spe&acirc; <br>
cific TYPE. See also info about platform specific device
scan and the DEVICESCAN directive on smartd(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scan-open <br>
Same as --scan, but also tries to open each device before
printing device info. The device open may change the device
type due to autodetection (see also &Acirc;&acute;-d
test&Acirc;&acute;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to
create a draft smartd.conf file. All options after
&Acirc;&acute;--&Acirc;&acute; are appended to each output
line. For example: <br>
smartctl --scan-open -- -a -W 4,45,50 -m admin@work &gt;
smartd.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g NAME, --get=NAME <br>
Get non-SMART device settings. See &Acirc;&acute;-s,
--set&Acirc;&acute; below for further info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN-TIME BEHAVIOR OPTIONS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q TYPE, --quietmode=TYPE <br>
Specifies that smartctl should run in one of the two quiet
modes described here. The valid arguments to this option
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errorsonly - only print: For the
&Acirc;&acute;-l error&Acirc;&acute; option, if nonzero, the
number of errors recorded in the SMART error log and the
power-on time when they occurred; For the &Acirc;&acute;-l
<br>
selftest&Acirc;&acute; option, errors recorded in the device
self-test log; For the &Acirc;&acute;-H&Acirc;&acute;
option, SMART &quot;disk failing&quot; status or device
Attributes (pre-failure or usage) which failed <br>
either now or in the past; For the
&Acirc;&acute;-A&Acirc;&acute; option, device Attributes
(pre-failure or usage) which failed either now or in the
past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">silent - print no output. The
only way to learn about what was found is to use the exit
status of smartctl (see RETURN VALUES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noserial - Do not print the
serial number of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d TYPE, --device=TYPE <br>
Specifies the type of the device. The valid arguments to
this option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto - attempt to guess the
device type from the device name or from controller type
info provided by the operating system or from a matching USB
ID entry in the drive <br>
database. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test - prints the guessed type,
then opens the device and prints the (possibly changed) TYPE
name and then exists without performing any further
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ata - the device type is ATA.
This prevents smartctl from issuing SCSI commands to an ATA
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scsi - the device type is SCSI.
This prevents smartctl from issuing ATA commands to a SCSI
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sat[,auto][,N] - the device type
is SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT). This is for ATA disks that
have a SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL) between
the disk and the <br>
operating system. SAT defines two ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI
commands, one 12 bytes long and the other 16 bytes long. The
default is the 16 byte variant which can be overrid&acirc;
<br>
den with either &Acirc;&acute;-d sat,12&Acirc;&acute; or
&Acirc;&acute;-d sat,16&Acirc;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &Acirc;&acute;-d
sat,auto&Acirc;&acute; is specified, device type SAT (for
ATA/SATA disks) is only used if the SCSI INQUIRY data
reports a SATL (VENDOR: &quot;ATA &quot;). Otherwise device
type SCSI <br>
(for SCSI/SAS disks) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usbcypress - this device type is
for ATA disks that are behind a Cypress USB to PATA bridge.
This will use the ATACB proprietary scsi pass through
command. The default <br>
SCSI operation code is 0x24, but although it can be
overridden with &Acirc;&acute;-d
usbcypress,0xN&Acirc;&acute;, where N is the scsi operation
code, you&rsquo;re running the risk of damage to the <br>
device or filesystems on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usbjmicron[,p][,x][,PORT] - this
device type is for SATA disks that are behind a JMicron USB
to PATA/SATA bridge. The 48-bit ATA commands (required e.g.
for &Acirc;&acute;-l xerror&Acirc;&acute;, <br>
see below) do not work with all of these bridges and are
therefore disabled by default. These commands can be enabled
by &Acirc;&acute;-d usbjmicron,x&Acirc;&acute;. If two disks
are connected to <br>
a bridge with two ports, an error message is printed if no
PORT is specified. The port can be specified by
&Acirc;&acute;-d usbjmicron[,x],PORT&Acirc;&acute; where
PORT is 0 (master) or 1 (slave). <br>
This is not necessary if the device uses a port multiplier
to connect multiple disks to one port. The disks appear
under separate /dev/ice names then. CAUTION: Specify&acirc;
<br>
ing &Acirc;&acute;,x&Acirc;&acute; for a device which does
not support it results in I/O errors and may disconnect the
drive. The same applies if the specified PORT does not exist
or is not con&acirc; <br>
nected to a disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL
FEATURE] The Prolific PL2507/3507 USB bridges with older
firmware support a pass-through command similar to JMicron
and work with &Acirc;&acute;-d usbjmi&acirc; <br>
cron,0&Acirc;&acute;. Newer Prolific firmware requires a
modified command which can be selected by &Acirc;&acute;-d
usbjmicron,p&Acirc;&acute;. Note that this does not yet
support the SMART status command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usbsunplus - this device type is
for SATA disks that are behind a SunplusIT USB to SATA
bridge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">marvell - [Linux only] interact
with SATA disks behind Marvell chip-set controllers (using
the Marvell rather than libata driver).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">megaraid,N - [Linux only] the
device consists of one or more SCSI/SAS disks connected to a
MegaRAID controller. The non-negative integer N (in the
range of 0 to 127 <br>
inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller is
monitored. Use syntax such as: <br>
smartctl -a -d megaraid,2 /dev/sda <br>
smartctl -a -d megaraid,0 /dev/sdb <br>
smartctl -a -d megaraid,0 /dev/bus/0 <br>
This interface will also work for Dell PERC controllers. It
is possible to set RAID device name as /dev/bus/N, where N
is a SCSI bus number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following entry in
/proc/devices must exist: <br>
For PERC2/3/4 controllers: megadevN <br>
For PERC5/6 controllers: megaraid_sas_ioctlN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3ware,N - [FreeBSD and Linux
only] the device consists of one or more ATA disks connected
to a 3ware RAID controller. The non-negative integer N (in
the range from 0 to <br>
127 inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller is
monitored. Use syntax such as: <br>
smartctl -a -d 3ware,2 /dev/sda [Linux only] <br>
smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0 <br>
smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0 <br>
smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twl0 [Linux only] <br>
smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/tws0 [FreeBSD only] <br>
The first two forms, which refer to devices /dev/sda-z and
/dev/twe0-15, may be used with 3ware series 6000, 7000, and
8000 series controllers that use the 3x-xxxx driver. <br>
Note that the /dev/sda-z form is deprecated starting with
the Linux 2.6 kernel series and may not be supported by the
Linux kernel in the near future. The final form, <br>
which refers to devices /dev/twa0-15, must be used with
3ware 9000 series controllers, which use the 3w-9xxx
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The devices /dev/twl0-15 [Linux]
or /dev/tws0-15 [FreeBSD] must be used with the 3ware/LSI
9750 series controllers which use the 3w-sas driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the special
character device nodes /dev/tw[ls]?, /dev/twa? and /dev/twe?
do not exist, or exist with the incorrect major or minor
numbers, smartctl will <br>
recreate them on the fly. Typically /dev/twa0 refers to the
first 9000-series controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the second
9000 series controller, and so on. The /dev/twl0 <br>
devices refers to the first 9750 series controller,
/dev/twl1 resfers to the second 9750 series controller, and
so on. Likewise /dev/twe0 refers to the first <br>
6/7/8000-series controller, /dev/twe1 refers to the second
6/7/8000 series controller, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that for the 6/7/8000
controllers, any of the physical disks can be queried or
examined using any of the 3ware&rsquo;s SCSI logical device
/dev/sd? entries. Thus, if log&acirc; <br>
ical device /dev/sda is made up of two physical disks (3ware
ports zero and one) and logical device /dev/sdb is made up
of two other physical disks (3ware ports two and <br>
three) then you can examine the SMART data on any of the
four physical disks using either SCSI device /dev/sda or
/dev/sdb. If you need to know which logical SCSI device <br>
a particular physical disk (3ware port) is associated with,
use the dmesg or SYSLOG output to show which SCSI ID
corresponds to a particular 3ware unit, and then use the
<br>
3ware CLI or 3dm tool to determine which ports (physical
disks) correspond to particular 3ware units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of N corresponds to
a port that does not exist on the 3ware controller, or to a
port that does not physically have a disk attached to it,
the behavior of <br>
smartctl depends upon the specific controller model,
firmware, Linux kernel and platform. In some cases you will
get a warning message that the device does not exist. In
<br>
other cases you will be presented with
&Acirc;&acute;void&Acirc;&acute; data for a non-existent
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the /dev/sd?
addressing form is used, then older 3w-xxxx drivers do not
pass the &quot;Enable Autosave&quot; (&Acirc;&acute;-S
on&Acirc;&acute;) and &quot;Enable Automatic Offline&quot;
(&Acirc;&acute;-o on&Acirc;&acute;) commands <br>
to the disk, and produce these types of harmless syslog
error messages instead: &quot;3w-xxxx: tw_ioctl(): Passthru
size (123392) too big&quot;. This can be fixed by upgrading
to <br>
version 1.02.00.037 or later of the 3w-xxxx driver, or by
applying a patch to older versions. Alternatively, use the
character device /dev/twe0-15 interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selective self-test
functions (&Acirc;&acute;-t select,A-B&Acirc;&acute;) are
only supported using the character device interface
/dev/twl0-15, /dev/tws0-15, /dev/twa0-15 and /dev/twe0-15.
The <br>
necessary WRITE LOG commands can not be passed through the
SCSI interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">areca,N - [FreeBSD, Linux,
Windows and Cygwin only] the device consists of one or more
SATA disks connected to an Areca SATA RAID controller. The
positive integer N (in <br>
the range from 1 to 24 inclusive) denotes which disk on the
controller is monitored. On Linux use syntax such as: <br>
smartctl -a -d areca,2 /dev/sg2 <br>
smartctl -a -d areca,3 /dev/sg3 <br>
The first line above addresses the second disk on the first
Areca RAID controller. The second line addresses the third
disk on the second Areca RAID controller. To help <br>
identify the correct device on Linux, use the command: <br>
cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices <br>
to show the SCSI generic devices (one per line, starting
with /dev/sg0). The correct SCSI generic devices to address
for smartmontools are the ones with the type field <br>
equal to 3. If the incorrect device is addressed, please
read the warning/error messages carefully. They should
provide hints about what devices to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important: the Areca controller
must have firmware version 1.46 or later. Lower-numbered
firmware versions will give (harmless) SCSI error messages
and no SMART informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">areca,N/E - [FreeBSD, Linux,
Windows and Cygwin only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE]
the device consists of one or more SATA or SAS disks
connected to an Areca SAS <br>
RAID controller. The integer N (range 1 to 128) denotes the
channel (slot) and E (range 1 to 8) denotes the enclosure.
Important: This requires Areca SAS controller <br>
firmware version 1.51 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cciss,N - [FreeBSD and Linux
only] the device consists of one or more SCSI/SAS or SATA
disks connected to a cciss RAID controller. The non-negative
integer N (in the <br>
range from 0 to 15 inclusive) denotes which disk on the
controller is monitored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To look at disks behind HP Smart
Array controllers, use syntax such as: <br>
smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/cciss/c0d0 (cciss driver under
Linux) <br>
smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/sg2 (hpsa or hpahcisr drivers
under Linux)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hpt,L/M/N - [FreeBSD and Linux
only] the device consists of one or more ATA disks connected
to a HighPoint RocketRAID controller. The integer L is the
controller id, the <br>
integer M is the channel number, and the integer N is the
PMPort number if it is available. The allowed values of L
are from 1 to 4 inclusive, M are from 1 to 128 inclu&acirc;
<br>
sive and N from 1 to 4 if PMPort available. And also these
values are limited by the model of the HighPoint RocketRAID
controller. Use syntax such as: <br>
smartctl -a -d hpt,1/3 /dev/sda (under Linux) <br>
smartctl -a -d hpt,1/2/3 /dev/sda (under Linux) <br>
Note that the /dev/sda-z form should be the device node
which stands for the disks derived from the HighPoint
RocketRAID controllers under Linux and under FreeBSD, it is
<br>
the character device which the driver registered (eg,
/dev/hptrr, /dev/hptmv6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T TYPE, --tolerance=TYPE <br>
[ATA only] Specifies how tolerant smartctl should be of ATA
and SMART command failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior of smartctl depends
upon whether the command is &quot;optional&quot; or
&quot;mandatory&quot;. Here &quot;mandatory&quot; means
&quot;required by the ATA Specification if the device
implements <br>
the SMART command set&quot; and &quot;optional&quot; means
&quot;not required by the ATA Specification even if the
device implements the SMART command set.&quot; The
&quot;mandatory&quot; ATA and SMART <br>
commands are: (1) ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE, (2) SMART
ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE, (3) SMART ENABLE/DISABLE,
and (4) SMART RETURN STATUS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid arguments to this
option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normal - exit on failure of any
mandatory SMART command, and ignore all failures of optional
SMART commands. This is the default. Note that on some
devices, issuing <br>
unimplemented optional SMART commands doesn&Acirc;&acute;t
cause an error. This can result in misleading smartctl
messages such as &quot;Feature X not implemented&quot;,
followed shortly by <br>
&quot;Feature X: enabled&quot;. In most such cases, contrary
to the final message, Feature X is not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conservative - exit on failure
of any optional SMART command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permissive - ignore failure(s)
of mandatory SMART commands. This option may be given more
than once. Each additional use of this option will cause one
more additional <br>
failure to be ignored. Note that the use of this option can
lead to messages like &quot;Feature X not supported&quot;,
followed shortly by &quot;Feature X enable failed&quot;. In
a few such <br>
cases, contrary to the final message, Feature X is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verypermissive - equivalent to
giving a large number of &Acirc;&acute;-T
permissive&Acirc;&acute; options: ignore failures of any
number of mandatory SMART commands. Please see the note
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b TYPE, --badsum=TYPE <br>
[ATA only] Specifies the action smartctl should take if a
checksum error is detected in the: (1) Device Identity
Structure, (2) SMART Self-Test Log Structure, (3) SMART <br>
Attribute Value Structure, (4) SMART Attribute Threshold
Structure, or (5) ATA Error Log Structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid arguments to this
option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warn - report the incorrect
checksum but carry on in spite of it. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit - exit smartctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore - continue silently
without issuing a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r TYPE, --report=TYPE <br>
Intended primarily to help smartmontools developers
understand the behavior of smartmontools on non-conforming
or poorly conforming hardware. This option reports details
<br>
of smartctl transactions with the device. The option can be
used multiple times. When used just once, it shows a record
of the ioctl() transactions with the device. <br>
When used more than once, the detail of these ioctl()
transactions are reported in greater detail. The valid
arguments to this option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ioctl - report all ioctl()
transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ataioctl - report only ioctl()
transactions with ATA devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scsiioctl - report only ioctl()
transactions with SCSI devices. Invoking this once shows the
SCSI commands in hex and the corresponding status. Invoking
it a second time <br>
adds a hex listing of the first 64 bytes of data send to, or
received from the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any argument may include a
positive integer to specify the level of detail that should
be reported. The argument should be followed by a comma then
the integer with no <br>
spaces. For example, ataioctl,2 The default level is 1, so
&Acirc;&acute;-r ataioctl,1&Acirc;&acute; and
&Acirc;&acute;-r ataioctl&Acirc;&acute; are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For testing purposes, the output
of &Acirc;&acute;-r ataioctl,2&Acirc;&acute; can later be
parsed by smartctl itself if &Acirc;&acute;-&Acirc;&acute;
is used as device path argument. The ATA command input
parameters, sec&acirc; <br>
tor data and return values are reconstructed from the debug
report read from stdin. Then smartctl internally simulates
an ATA device with the same behaviour. This is does <br>
not work for SCSI devices yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n POWERMODE,
--nocheck=POWERMODE <br>
[ATA only] Specifies if smartctl should exit before
performing any checks when the device is in a low-power
mode. It may be used to prevent a disk from being spun-up by
<br>
smartctl. The power mode is ignored by default. A nonzero
exit status is returned if the device is in one of the
specified low-power modes (see RETURN VALUES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If this option is used it
may also be necessary to specify the device type with the
&Acirc;&acute;-d&Acirc;&acute; option. Otherwise the device
may spin up due to commands issued during <br>
device type autodetection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid arguments to this
option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">never - check the device always,
but print the power mode if &Acirc;&acute;-i&Acirc;&acute;
is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sleep - check the device unless
it is in SLEEP mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standby - check the device
unless it is in SLEEP or STANDBY mode. In these modes most
disks are not spinning, so if you want to prevent a disk
from spinning up, this is <br>
probably what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle - check the device unless
it is in SLEEP, STANDBY or IDLE mode. In the IDLE state,
most disks are still spinning, so this is probably not what
you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMART FEATURE ENABLE/DISABLE
COMMANDS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if multiple options are
used to both enable and disable a feature, then both the
enable and disable commands will be issued. The enable
command will always be <br>
issued before the corresponding disable command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s VALUE, --smart=VALUE <br>
Enables or disables SMART on device. The valid arguments to
this option are on and off. Note that the command
&Acirc;&acute;-s on&Acirc;&acute; (perhaps used with with
the &Acirc;&acute;-o on&Acirc;&acute; and &Acirc;&acute;-S
on&Acirc;&acute; <br>
options) should be placed in a start-up script for your
machine, for example in rc.local or rc.sysinit. In principle
the SMART feature settings are preserved over power- <br>
cycling, but it doesn&Acirc;&acute;t hurt to be sure. It is
not necessary (or useful) to enable SMART to see the
TapeAlert messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o VALUE, --offlineauto=VALUE
<br>
[ATA only] Enables or disables SMART automatic offline test,
which scans the drive every four hours for disk defects.
This command can be given during normal system opera&acirc;
<br>
tion. The valid arguments to this option are on and off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the SMART automatic
offline test command is listed as &quot;Obsolete&quot; in
every version of the ATA and ATA/ATAPI Specifications. It
was originally part of the <br>
SFF-8035i Revision 2.0 specification, but was never part of
any ATA specification. However it is implemented and used by
many vendors. [Good documentation can be found in <br>
IBM&Acirc;&acute;s Official Published Disk Specifications.
For example the IBM Travelstar 40GNX Hard Disk Drive
Specifications (Revision 1.1, 22 April 2002, Publication #
1541, Docu&acirc; <br>
ment S07N-7715-02) page 164. You can also read the SFF-8035i
Specification -- see REFERENCES below.] You can tell if
automatic offline testing is supported by seeing if <br>
this command enables and disables it, as indicated by the
&Acirc;&acute;Auto Offline Data Collection&Acirc;&acute;
part of the SMART capabilities report (displayed with
&Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMART provides three basic
categories of testing. The first category, called
&quot;online&quot; testing, has no effect on the performance
of the device. It is turned on by the &Acirc;&acute;-s <br>
on&Acirc;&acute; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second category of testing
is called &quot;offline&quot; testing. This type of test
can, in principle, degrade the device performance. The
&Acirc;&acute;-o on&Acirc;&acute; option causes this offline
<br>
testing to be carried out, automatically, on a regular
scheduled basis. Normally, the disk will suspend offline
testing while disk accesses are taking place, and then <br>
automatically resume it when the disk would otherwise be
idle, so in practice it has little effect. Note that a
one-time offline test can also be carried out immediately
<br>
upon receipt of a user command. See the &Acirc;&acute;-t
offline&Acirc;&acute; option below, which causes a one-time
offline test to be carried out immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The choice (made by the
SFF-8035i and ATA specification authors) of the word testing
for these first two categories is unfortunate, and often
leads to confusion. In fact <br>
these first two categories of online and offline testing
could have been more accurately described as online and
offline data collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The results of this automatic or
immediate offline testing (data collection) are reflected in
the values of the SMART Attributes. Thus, if problems or
errors are <br>
detected, the values of these Attributes will go below their
failure thresholds; some types of errors may also appear in
the SMART error log. These are visible with the <br>
&Acirc;&acute;-A&Acirc;&acute; and &Acirc;&acute;-l
error&Acirc;&acute; options respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some SMART attribute values are
updated only during off-line data collection activities; the
rest are updated during normal operation of the device or
during both normal <br>
operation and off-line testing. The Attribute value table
produced by the &Acirc;&acute;-A&Acirc;&acute; option
indicates this in the UPDATED column. Attributes of the
first type are labeled <br>
&quot;Offline&quot; and Attributes of the second type are
labeled &quot;Always&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third category of testing
(and the only category for which the word
&Acirc;&acute;testing&Acirc;&acute; is really an appropriate
choice) is &quot;self&quot; testing. This third type of test
is only per&acirc; <br>
formed (immediately) when a command to run it is issued. The
&Acirc;&acute;-t&Acirc;&acute; and
&Acirc;&acute;-X&Acirc;&acute; options can be used to carry
out and abort such self-tests; please see below for further
<br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any errors detected in the self
testing will be shown in the SMART self-test log, which can
be examined using the &Acirc;&acute;-l
selftest&Acirc;&acute; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: in this manual page, the
word &quot;Test&quot; is used in connection with the second
category just described, e.g. for the &quot;offline&quot;
testing. The words &quot;Self-test&quot; are used <br>
in connection with the third category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S VALUE, --saveauto=VALUE <br>
[ATA] Enables or disables SMART autosave of device
vendor-specific Attributes. The valid arguments to this
option are on and off. Note that this feature is preserved
<br>
across disk power cycles, so you should only need to issue
it once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ATA standard does not
specify a method to check whether SMART autosave is enabled.
Unlike SCSI (below), smartctl is unable to print a warning
if autosave is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[SCSI] For SCSI devices this
toggles the value of the Global Logging Target Save Disabled
(GLTSD) bit in the Control Mode Page. Some disk
manufacturers set this bit by <br>
default. This prevents error counters, power-up hours and
other useful data from being placed in non-volatile storage,
so these values may be reset to zero the next time <br>
the device is power-cycled. If the GLTSD bit is set then
&Acirc;&acute;smartctl -a&Acirc;&acute; will issue a
warning. Use on to clear the GLTSD bit and thus enable
saving counters to non-volatile <br>
storage. For extreme streaming-video type applications you
might consider using off to set the GLTSD bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g NAME, --get=NAME, -s
NAME[,VALUE], --set=NAME[,VALUE] <br>
Gets/sets non-SMART device settings. Note that the
&Acirc;&acute;--set&Acirc;&acute; option shares its short
option &Acirc;&acute;-s&Acirc;&acute; with
&Acirc;&acute;--smart&Acirc;&acute;. Valid arguments
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all - Gets all values. This is
equivalent to <br>
&Acirc;&acute;-g aam -g apm -g lookahead -g security -g
wcache&Acirc;&acute;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aam[,N|off] - [ATA only]
Gets/sets the Automatic Acoustic Management (AAM) feature
(if supported). A value of 128 sets the most quiet (slowest)
mode and 254 the fastest <br>
(loudest) mode, &Acirc;&acute;off&Acirc;&acute; disables
AAM. Devices may support intermediate levels. Values below
128 are defined as vendor specific (0) or retired (1 to
127). Note that the <br>
AAM feature was declared obsolete in ATA ACS-2 Revision 4a
(Dec 2010).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apm[,N|off] - [ATA only]
Gets/sets the Advanced Power Management (APM) feature on
device (if supported). If a value between 1 and 254 is
provided, it will attempt to <br>
enable APM and set the specified value,
&Acirc;&acute;off&Acirc;&acute; disables APM. Note the
actual behavior depends on the drive, for example some
drives disable APM if their value is set above <br>
128. Values below 128 are supposed to allow drive spindown,
values 128 and above adjust only head-parking frequency,
although the actual behavior defined is also vendor- <br>
specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookahead[,on|off] - [ATA only]
Gets/sets the read look-ahead feature (if supported). Read
look-ahead is usually enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">security - [ATA only] Gets the
status of ATA Security feature (if supported). If ATA
Security is enabled an ATA user password is set. The drive
will be locked on next <br>
reset then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">security-freeze - [ATA only]
Sets ATA Security feature to frozen mode. This prevents that
the drive accepts any security commands until next reset.
Note that the frozen <br>
mode may already be set by BIOS or OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standby,[N|off] - [ATA only]
Sets the standby (spindown) timer and places the drive in
the IDLE mode. A value of 0 or
&Acirc;&acute;off&Acirc;&acute; disables the standby timer.
Values from 1 to <br>
240 specify timeouts from 5 seconds to 20 minutes in 5
second increments. Values from 241 to 251 specify timeouts
from 30 minutes to 330 minutes in 30 minute increments. <br>
Value 252 specifies 21 minutes. Value 253 specifies a vendor
specific time between 8 and 12 hours. Value 255 specifies 21
minutes and 15 seconds. Some drives may use a <br>
vendor specific interpretation for the values. Note that
there is no get option because ATA standards do not specify
a method to read the standby timer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standby,now - [ATA only] Places
the drive in the STANDBY mode. This usually spins down the
drive. The setting of the standby timer is not affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcache[,on|off] - [ATA]
Gets/sets the volatile write cache feature (if supported).
The write cache is usually enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcache[,on|off] - [SCSI] [NEW
EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Gets/sets the
&Acirc;&acute;Write Cache Enable&Acirc;&acute; (WCE) bit (if
supported). The write cache is usually enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcreorder[,on|off] - [ATA only]
[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Gets/sets Write Cache
Reordering. If it is disabled (off), disk write scheduling
is executed on a <br>
first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. If Write Cache Reordering
is enabled (on), then disk write scheduling may be reordered
by the drive. If write cache is disabled, the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent Write Cache Reordering state is remembered but has no
effect on non-cached writes, which are always written in the
order received. The state of Write Cache Reorder&acirc; <br>
ing has no effect on either NCQ or LCQ queued commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcache[,on|off] - [SCSI only]
[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Gets/sets the
&Acirc;&acute;Read Cache Disable&Acirc;&acute; (RCE) bit.
&Acirc;&acute;Off&Acirc;&acute; value disables read cache
(if supported). The read <br>
cache is usually enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMART READ AND DISPLAY DATA
OPTIONS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --health <br>
Check: Ask the device to report its SMART health status or
pending TapeAlert messages. SMART status is based on
information that it has gathered from online and offline
<br>
tests, which were used to determine/update its SMART
vendor-specific Attribute values. TapeAlert status is
obtained by reading the TapeAlert log page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the device reports failing
health status, this means either that the device has already
failed, or that it is predicting its own failure within the
next 24 hours. If <br>
this happens, use the &Acirc;&acute;-a&Acirc;&acute; option
to get more information, and get your data off the disk and
to someplace safe as soon as you can.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --capabilities <br>
[ATA only] Prints only the generic SMART capabilities. These
show what SMART features are implemented and how the device
will respond to some of the different SMART com&acirc; <br>
mands. For example it shows if the device logs errors, if it
supports offline surface scanning, and so on. If the device
can carry out self-tests, this option also shows <br>
the estimated time required to run those tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the time required to
run the Self-tests (listed in minutes) are fixed. However
the time required to run the Immediate Offline Test (listed
in seconds) is vari&acirc; <br>
able. This means that if you issue a command to perform an
Immediate Offline test with the &Acirc;&acute;-t
offline&Acirc;&acute; option, then the time may jump to a
larger value and then count <br>
down as the Immediate Offline Test is carried out. Please
see REFERENCES below for further information about the the
flags and capabilities described by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --attributes <br>
[ATA] Prints only the vendor specific SMART Attributes. The
Attributes are numbered from 1 to 253 and have specific
names and ID numbers. For example Attribute 12 is <br>
&quot;power cycle count&quot;: how many times has the disk
been powered up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each Attribute has a
&quot;Raw&quot; value, printed under the heading
&quot;RAW_VALUE&quot;, and a &quot;Normalized&quot; value
printed under the heading &quot;VALUE&quot;. [Note: smartctl
prints these values <br>
in base-10.] In the example just given, the &quot;Raw
Value&quot; for Attribute 12 would be the actual number of
times that the disk has been power-cycled, for example 365
if the <br>
disk has been turned on once per day for exactly one year.
Each vendor uses their own algorithm to convert this
&quot;Raw&quot; value to a &quot;Normalized&quot; value in
the range from 1 to <br>
254. Please keep in mind that smartctl only reports the
different Attribute types, values, and thresholds as read
from the device. It does not carry out the conversion <br>
between &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Normalized&quot; values:
this is done by the disk&Acirc;&acute;s firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conversion from Raw value to
a quantity with physical units is not specified by the SMART
standard. In most cases, the values printed by smartctl are
sensible. For <br>
example the temperature Attribute generally has its raw
value equal to the temperature in Celsius. However in some
cases vendors use unusual conventions. For example the <br>
Hitachi disk on my laptop reports its power-on hours in
minutes, not hours. Some IBM disks track three temperatures
rather than one, in their raw values. And so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each Attribute also has a
Threshold value (whose range is 0 to 255) which is printed
under the heading &quot;THRESH&quot;. If the Normalized
value is less than or equal to the <br>
Threshold value, then the Attribute is said to have failed.
If the Attribute is a pre-failure Attribute, then disk
failure is imminent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each Attribute also has a
&quot;Worst&quot; value shown under the heading
&quot;WORST&quot;. This is the smallest (closest to failure)
value that the disk has recorded at any time during its <br>
lifetime when SMART was enabled. [Note however that some
vendors firmware may actually increase the &quot;Worst&quot;
value for some &quot;rate-type&quot; Attributes.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Attribute table printed out
by smartctl also shows the &quot;TYPE&quot; of the
Attribute. Attributes are one of two possible types:
Pre-failure or Old age. Pre-failure <br>
Attributes are ones which, if less than or equal to their
threshold values, indicate pending disk failure. Old age, or
usage Attributes, are ones which indicate end-of- <br>
product life from old-age or normal aging and wearout, if
the Attribute value is less than or equal to the threshold.
Please note: the fact that an Attribute is of type <br>
&rsquo;Pre-fail&rsquo; does not mean that your disk is about
to fail! It only has this meaning if the
Attribute&Acirc;&acute;s current Normalized value is less
than or equal to the threshold <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Attribute&Acirc;&acute;s
current Normalized value is less than or equal to the
threshold value, then the &quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column
will display &quot;FAILING_NOW&quot;. If not, but the worst
<br>
recorded value is less than or equal to the threshold value,
then this column will display &quot;In_the_past&quot;. If
the &quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column has no entry (indicated
by a dash: <br>
&Acirc;&acute;-&Acirc;&acute;) then this Attribute is OK now
(not failing) and has also never failed in the past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table column labeled
&quot;UPDATED&quot; shows if the SMART Attribute values are
updated during both normal operation and off-line testing,
or only during offline testing. The <br>
former are labeled &quot;Always&quot; and the latter are
labeled &quot;Offline&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So to summarize: the Raw
Attribute values are the ones that might have a real
physical interpretation, such as &quot;Temperature
Celsius&quot;, &quot;Hours&quot;, or &quot;Start-Stop
Cycles&quot;. <br>
Each manufacturer converts these, using their detailed
knowledge of the disk&Acirc;&acute;s operations and failure
modes, to Normalized Attribute values in the range 1-254.
The cur&acirc; <br>
rent and worst (lowest measured) of these Normalized
Attribute values are stored on the disk, along with a
Threshold value that the manufacturer has determined will
indi&acirc; <br>
cate that the disk is going to fail, or that it has exceeded
its design age or aging limit. smartctl does not calculate
any of the Attribute values, thresholds, or types, <br>
it merely reports them from the SMART data on the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that starting with
ATA/ATAPI-4, revision 4, the meaning of these Attribute
fields has been made entirely vendor-specific. However most
newer ATA/SATA disks seem to <br>
respect their meaning, so we have retained the option of
printing the Attribute values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solid-state drives use different
meanings for some of the attributes. In this case the
attribute name printed by smartctl is incorrect unless the
drive is already in the <br>
smartmontools drive database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[SCSI] For SCSI devices the
&quot;attributes&quot; are obtained from the temperature and
start-stop cycle counter log pages. Certain vendor specific
attributes are listed if recog&acirc; <br>
nised. The attributes are output in a relatively free format
(compared with ATA disk attributes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT <br>
[ATA only] Selects the output format of the attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old - Old smartctl format. This
is the default unless the &Acirc;&acute;-x&Acirc;&acute;
option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brief - New format which fits
into 80 colums (except in some rare cases). This format also
decodes four additional attribute flags. This is the default
if the &rsquo;-x&Acirc;&acute; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hex,id - Print all attribute IDs
as hexadecimal numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hex,val - Print all normalized

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l TYPE, --log=TYPE <br>
Prints either the SMART Error Log, the SMART Self-Test Log,
the SMART Selective Self-Test Log [ATA only], the Log
Directory [ATA only], or the Background Scan Results Log
<br>
[SCSI only]. The valid arguments to this option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error - [ATA] prints the Summary
SMART error log. SMART disks maintain a log of the most
recent five non-trivial errors. For each of these errors,
the disk power-on life&acirc; <br>
time at which the error occurred is recorded, as is the
device status (idle, standby, etc) at the time of the error.
For some common types of errors, the Error Register <br>
(ER) and Status Register (SR) values are decoded and printed
as text. The meanings of these are: <br>
ABRT: Command ABoRTed <br>
AMNF: Address Mark Not Found <br>
CCTO: Command Completion Timed Out <br>
EOM: End Of Media <br>
ICRC: Interface Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) error <br>
IDNF: IDentity Not Found <br>
ILI: (packet command-set specific) <br>
MC: Media Changed <br>
MCR: Media Change Request <br>
NM: No Media <br>
obs: obsolete <br>
TK0NF: TracK 0 Not Found <br>
UNC: UNCorrectable Error in Data <br>
WP: Media is Write Protected <br>
In addition, up to the last five commands that preceded the
error are listed, along with a timestamp measured from the
start of the corresponding power cycle. This is dis&acirc;
<br>
played in the form Dd+HH:MM:SS.msec where D is the number of
days, HH is hours, MM is minutes, SS is seconds and msec is
milliseconds. [Note: this time stamp wraps after <br>
2^32 milliseconds, or 49 days 17 hours 2 minutes and 47.296
seconds.] The key ATA disk registers are also recorded in
the log. The final column of the error log is a <br>
text-string description of the ATA command defined by the
Command Register (CR) and Feature Register (FR) values.
Commands that are obsolete in the most current spec are <br>
listed like this: READ LONG (w/ retry) [OBS-4], indicating
that the command became obsolete with or in the ATA-4
specification. Similarly, the notation [RET-N] is used to
<br>
indicate that a command was retired in the ATA-N
specification. Some commands are not defined in any version
of the ATA specification but are in common use nonetheless;
<br>
these are marked [NS], meaning non-standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ATA Specification (ATA-5
Revision 1c, Section 8.41.6.8.2) says: &quot;Error log
structures shall include UNC errors, IDNF errors for which
the address requested was valid, <br>
servo errors, write fault errors, etc. Error log data
structures shall not include errors attributed to the
receipt of faulty commands such as command codes not
imple&acirc; <br>
mented by the device or requests with invalid parameters or
invalid addresses.&quot; The definitions of these terms are:
<br>
UNC (UNCorrectable): data is uncorrectable. This refers to
data which has been read from the disk, but for which the
Error Checking and Correction (ECC) codes are incon&acirc;
<br>
sistent. In effect, this means that the data can not be
read. <br>
IDNF (ID Not Found): user-accessible address could not be
found. For READ LOG type commands, IDNF can also indicate
that a device data log structure checksum was incor&acirc;
<br>
rect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command that caused the
error was a READ or WRITE command, then the Logical Block
Address (LBA) at which the error occurred will be printed in
base 10 and base 16. <br>
The LBA is a linear address, which counts 512-byte sectors
on the disk, starting from zero. (Because of the limitations
of the SMART error log, if the LBA is greater than <br>
0xfffffff, then either no error log entry will be made, or
the error log entry will have an incorrect LBA. This may
happen for drives with a capacity greater than 128 GiB <br>
or 137 GB.) On Linux systems the smartmontools web page has
instructions about how to convert the LBA address to the
name of the disk file containing the erroneous disk <br>
sector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that some
manufacturers ignore the ATA specifications, and make
entries in the error log if the device receives a command
which is not implemented or is not <br>
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error - [SCSI] prints the error

error log (see &Acirc;&acute;-l error&Acirc;&acute; <br>
above), it provides sufficient space to log the contents of
the 48-bit LBA register set introduced with ATA-6. It also
supports logs with more than one sector. Each sec&acirc;
<br>
tor holds up to 4 log entries. The actual number of log
sectors is vendor specific, typical values for HDD are 2
(Samsung), 5 (Seagate) or 6 (WD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the 8 most recent error log
entries are printed by default. This number can be changed
by the optional parameter NUM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &rsquo;,error&rsquo; is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selftest - [ATA] prints the
SMART self-test log. The disk maintains a self-test log
showing the results of the self tests, which can be run
using the &Acirc;&acute;-t&Acirc;&acute; option <br>
described below. For each of the most recent twenty-one
self-tests, the log shows the type of test (short or
extended, off-line or captive) and the final status of the
<br>
test. If the test did not complete successfully, then the
percentage of the test remaining is shown. The time at which
the test took place, measured in hours of disk <br>
lifetime, is also printed. [Note: this time stamp wraps
after 2^16 hours, or 2730 days and 16 hours, or about 7.5
years.] If any errors were detected, the Logical Block <br>
Address (LBA) of the first error is printed in decimal

instructions about how to convert this LBA address to the
<br>
name of the disk file containing the erroneous block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selftest - [SCSI] the self-test
log for a SCSI device has a slightly different format than
for an ATA device. For each of the most recent twenty
self-tests, it shows the <br>
type of test and the status (final or in progress) of the
test. SCSI standards use the terms &quot;foreground&quot;
and &quot;background&quot; (rather than ATA&Acirc;&acute;s
corresponding &quot;captive&quot; and <br>
&quot;off-line&quot;) and &quot;short&quot; and
&quot;long&quot; (rather than ATA&Acirc;&acute;s
corresponding &quot;short&quot; and &quot;extended&quot;) to
describe the type of the test. The printed segment number is
only relevant <br>
when a test fails in the third or later test segment. It
identifies the test that failed and consists of either the
number of the segment that failed during the test, or <br>
the number of the test that failed and the number of the
segment in which the test was run, using a vendor-specific
method of putting both numbers into a single byte. The <br>
Logical Block Address (LBA) of the first error is printed in
hexadecimal notation. On Linux systems the smartmontools web
page has instructions about how to convert this <br>
LBA address to the name of the disk file containing the
erroneous block. If provided, the SCSI Sense Key (SK),
Additional Sense Code (ASC) and Additional Sense Code

prints current temperature and temperature ranges returned
by the SCT Status command,
&Acirc;&acute;scttemphist&Acirc;&acute; prints temperature

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F TYPE, --firmwarebug=TYPE <br>
[ATA only] Modifies the behavior of smartctl to compensate
for some known and understood device firmware or driver bug.
This option may be used multiple times. The valid <br>
arguments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none - Assume that the device
firmware obeys the ATA specifications. This is the default,
unless the device has presets for
&Acirc;&acute;-F&Acirc;&acute; in the drive database. Using
this option <br>
on the command line will over-ride any preset values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nologdir - Suppresses read
attempts of SMART or GP Log Directory. Support for all
standard logs is assumed without an actual check. Some Intel
SSDs may freeze if log <br>
address 0 is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">samsung - In some Samsung disks
(example: model SV4012H Firmware Version: RM100-08) some of
the two- and four-byte quantities in the SMART data
structures are byte-swapped <br>
(relative to the ATA specification). Enabling this option
tells smartctl to evaluate these quantities in byte-reversed
order. Some signs that your disk needs this option <br>
are (1) no self-test log printed, even though you have run
self-tests; (2) very large numbers of ATA errors reported in
the ATA error log; (3) strange and impossible val&acirc;
<br>
ues for the ATA error log timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">samsung2 - In some Samsung disks
the number of ATA errors reported is byte swapped. Enabling
this option tells smartctl to evaluate this quantity in
byte-reversed order. <br>
An indication that your Samsung disk needs this option is
that the self-test log is printed correctly, but there are a
very large number of errors in the SMART error log. <br>
This is because the error count is byte swapped. Thus a disk
with five errors (0x0005) will appear to have 20480 errors
(0x5000).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">samsung3 - Some Samsung disks
(at least SP2514N with Firmware VF100-37) report a self-test
still in progress with 0% remaining when the test was
already completed. <br>
Enabling this option modifies the output of the self-test
execution status (see options &Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute;
or &Acirc;&acute;-a&Acirc;&acute; above) accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl can automatically set
appropriate options for known drives. For example, the
Maxtor 4D080H4 uses Attribute 9 to stores power-on time in
minutes whereas most <br>
drives use that Attribute to store the power-on time in
hours. The command-line option &Acirc;&acute;-v
9,minutes&Acirc;&acute; ensures that smartctl correctly
interprets Attribute 9 in this case, <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMART RUN/ABORT OFFLINE TEST AND
self-test OPTIONS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t TEST, --test=TEST <br>
Executes TEST immediately. The
&Acirc;&acute;-C&Acirc;&acute; option can be used in
conjunction with this option to run the short or long (and
also for ATA devices, selective or conveyance) self- <br>
tests in captive mode (known as &quot;foreground mode&quot;
for SCSI devices). Note that only one test type can be run
at a time, so only one test type should be specified per
com&acirc; <br>
mand line. Note also that if a computer is shutdown or power
cycled during a self-test, no harm should result. The
self-test will either be aborted or will resume auto&acirc;
<br>
matically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All &Acirc;&acute;-t
TEST&Acirc;&acute; commands can be given during normal
system operation unless captive mode
(&Acirc;&acute;-C&Acirc;&acute; option) is used. A running
self-test can, however, degrade performance of the <br>
drive. Frequent I/O requests from the operating system
increase the duration of a test. These impacts may vary from
device to device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a test failure occurs then
the device may discontinue the testing and report the result
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid arguments to this
option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offline - [ATA] runs SMART
Immediate Offline Test. This immediately starts the test
described above. This command can be given during normal
system operation. The <br>
effects of this test are visible only in that it updates the
SMART Attribute values, and if errors are found they will
appear in the SMART error log, visible with the
&Acirc;&acute;-l <br>
error&Acirc;&acute; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the
&Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute; option to smartctl shows that
the device has the &quot;Suspend Offline collection upon new
command&quot; capability then you can track the progress of
the Immediate Off&acirc; <br>
line test using the &Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute; option to
smartctl. If the &Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute; option show
that the device has the &quot;Abort Offline collection upon
new command&quot; capability then most commands <br>
will abort the Immediate Offline Test, so you should not try
to track the progress of the test with
&Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute;, as it will abort the
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offline - [SCSI] runs the
default self test in foreground. No entry is placed in the
self test log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">short - [ATA] runs SMART Short
Self Test (usually under ten minutes). This command can be
given during normal system operation (unless run in captive
mode - see the &Acirc;&acute;-C&Acirc;&acute; <br>
option below). This is a test in a different category than
the immediate or automatic offline tests. The
&quot;Self&quot; tests check the electrical and mechanical
performance as <br>
well as the read performance of the disk. Their results are
reported in the Self Test Error Log, readable with the
&Acirc;&acute;-l selftest&Acirc;&acute; option. Note that on
some disks the <br>
progress of the self-test can be monitored by watching this
log during the self-test; with other disks use the
&Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute; option to monitor
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">short - [SCSI] runs the
&quot;Background short&quot; self-test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long - [ATA] runs SMART Extended
Self Test (tens of minutes). This is a longer and more
thorough version of the Short Self Test described above.
Note that this command <br>
can be given during normal system operation (unless run in
captive mode - see the &Acirc;&acute;-C&Acirc;&acute; option
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long - [SCSI] runs the
&quot;Background long&quot; self-test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conveyance - [ATA only] runs a
SMART Conveyance Self Test (minutes). This self-test routine
is intended to identify damage incurred during transporting
of the device. <br>
This self-test routine should take on the order of minutes
to complete. Note that this command can be given during
normal system operation (unless run in captive mode - <br>
see the &Acirc;&acute;-C&Acirc;&acute; option below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select,N-M, select,N+SIZE - [ATA
only] runs a SMART Selective Self Test, to test a range of
disk Logical Block Addresses (LBAs), rather than the entire
disk. Each range <br>
of LBAs that is checked is called a &quot;span&quot; and is
specified by a starting LBA (N) and an ending LBA (M) with N
less than or equal to M. The range can also be specified as
<br>
N+SIZE. A span at the end of a disk can be specified by
N-max.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example the commands: <br>
smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,10+11 /dev/hda <br>
both runs a self test on one span consisting of LBAs ten to
twenty (inclusive). The command: <br>
smartctl -t select,100000000-max /dev/hda <br>
run a self test from LBA 100000000 up to the end of the
disk. The &Acirc;&acute;-t&Acirc;&acute; option can be given
up to five times, to test up to five spans. For example the
command: <br>
smartctl -t select,0-100 -t select,1000-2000 /dev/hda <br>
runs a self test on two spans. The first span consists of
101 LBAs and the second span consists of 1001 LBAs. Note
that the spans can overlap partially or completely, <br>
for example: <br>
smartctl -t select,0-10 -t select,5-15 -t select,10-20
/dev/hda <br>
The results of the selective self-test can be obtained (both
during and after the test) by printing the SMART self-test
log, using the &Acirc;&acute;-l selftest&Acirc;&acute;
option to smartctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selective self tests are
particularly useful as disk capacities increase: an extended
self test (smartctl -t long) can take several hours.
Selective self-tests are help&acirc; <br>
ful if (based on SYSLOG error messages, previous failed
self-tests, or SMART error log entries) you suspect that a
disk is having problems at a particular range of Logical
<br>
Block Addresses (LBAs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selective self-tests can be run
during normal system operation (unless done in captive mode
- see the &Acirc;&acute;-C&Acirc;&acute; option below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variants of the
selective self-test command use spans based on the ranges
from past tests already stored on the disk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select,redo[+SIZE] - [ATA only]
redo the last SMART Selective Self Test using the same LBA
range. The starting LBA is identical to the LBA used by last
test, same for end&acirc; <br>
ing LBA unless a new span size is specified by optional
+SIZE argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example the commands: <br>
smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,redo /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,redo+20 /dev/hda <br>
have the same effect as: <br>
smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,10-29 /dev/hda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select,next[+SIZE] - [ATA only]
runs a SMART Selective Self Test on the LBA range which
follows the range of the last test. The starting LBA is set
to (ending LBA +1) of <br>
the last test. A new span size may be specified by the
optional +SIZE argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example the commands: <br>
smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,next /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,next+2000 /dev/hda <br>
have the same effect as: <br>
smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,1000-1999 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl -t select,2000-3999 /dev/hda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the last test ended at the
last LBA of the disk, the new range starts at LBA 0. The
span size of the last span of a disk is adjusted such that
the total number of spans <br>
to check the full disk will not be changed by future uses of
&Acirc;&acute;-t select,next&Acirc;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select,cont[+SIZE] - [ATA only]
performs a &Acirc;&acute;redo&Acirc;&acute; (above) if the
self test status reports that the last test was aborted by
the host. Otherwise it run the
&Acirc;&acute;next&Acirc;&acute; (above) <br>
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afterselect,on - [ATA only]
perform an offline read scan after a Selective self-test has
completed. This option must be used together with one or
more of the select,N-M <br>
options above. If the LBAs that have been specified in the
Selective self-test pass the test with no errors found, then
read scan the remainder of the disk. If the device <br>
is powered-cycled while this read scan is in progress, the
read scan will be automatically resumed after a time
specified by the pending timer (see below). The value of
<br>
this option is preserved between selective self-tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afterselect,off - [ATA only] do
not read scan the remainder of the disk after a Selective
self-test has completed. This option must be use together
with one or more of <br>
the select,N-M options above. The value of this option is
preserved between selective self-tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pending,N - [ATA only] set the
pending offline read scan timer to N minutes. Here N is an
integer in the range from 0 to 65535 inclusive. If the
device is powered off <br>
during a read scan after a Selective self-test, then resume
the test automatically N minutes after power-up. This option
must be use together with one or more of the <br>
select,N-M options above. The value of this option is
preserved between selective self-tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vendor,N - [ATA only] issues the
ATA command SMART EXECUTE OFF-LINE IMMEDIATE with subcommand
N in LBA LOW register. The subcommand is specified as a hex
value in the <br>
range 0x00 to 0xff. Subcommands 0x40-0x7e and 0x90-0xff are
reserved for vendor specific use, see table 61 of T13/1699-D
Revision 6a (ATA8-ACS). Note that the subcom&acirc; <br>
mands 0x00-0x04,0x7f,0x81-0x84 are supported by other
smartctl options (e.g. 0x01: &Acirc;&acute;-t
short&Acirc;&acute;, 0x7f: &Acirc;&acute;-X&Acirc;&acute;,
0x82: &Acirc;&acute;-C -t long&Acirc;&acute;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Only run subcommands
documented by the vendor of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example for Intel (X18/X25-M G2,
320, 520 and 710 Series) SSDs only: The subcommand 0x40

timed workload related SMART attributes (226, 227, <br>
228). Note that the raw values of these attributes are held
at 65535 (0xffff) until the workload timer reaches 60
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force - start new self-test even
if another test is already running. By default a running
self-test will not be interrupted to begin another test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --captive <br>
[ATA] Runs self-tests in captive mode. This has no effect
with &Acirc;&acute;-t offline&Acirc;&acute; or if the
&Acirc;&acute;-t&Acirc;&acute; option is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Tests run in captive

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[SCSI] Runs the self-test in
&quot;Foreground&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --abort <br>
Aborts non-captive SMART Self Tests. Note that this command
will abort the Offline Immediate Test routine only if your
disk has the &quot;Abort Offline collection upon new <br>
command&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATA, SCSI command sets and SAT
<br>
In the past there has been a clear distinction between
storage devices that used the ATA and SCSI command sets.
This distinction was often reflected in their device naming
and <br>
hardware. Now various SCSI transports (e.g. SAS, FC and
iSCSI) can interconnect to both SCSI disks (e.g. FC and SAS)
and ATA disks (especially SATA). USB and IEEE 1394 storage
<br>
devices use the SCSI command set externally but almost
always contain ATA or SATA disks (or flash). The storage
subsystems in some operating systems have started to remove
the <br>
distinction between ATA and SCSI in their device naming
policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">99% of operations that an OS
performs on a disk involve the SCSI INQUIRY, READ CAPACITY,
READ and WRITE commands, or their ATA equivalents. Since the
SCSI commands are slightly <br>
more general than their ATA equivalents, many OSes are
generating SCSI commands (mainly READ and WRITE) and letting
a lower level translate them to their ATA equivalents as the
<br>
need arises. An important note here is that &quot;lower
level&quot; may be in external equipment and hence outside
the control of an OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) is
a standard (ANSI INCITS 431-2007) that specifies how this
translation is done. For the other 1% of operations that an
OS performs on a disk, SAT <br>
provides two options. First is an optional ATA PASS-THROUGH
SCSI command (there are two variants). The second is a
translation from the closest SCSI command. Most current
inter&acirc; <br>
est is in the &quot;pass-through&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The relevance to smartmontools
(and hence smartctl) is that its interactions with disks
fall solidly into the &quot;1%&quot; category. So even if
the OS can happily treat (and name) a disk <br>
as &quot;SCSI&quot;, smartmontools needs to detect the
native command set and act accordingly. As more storage
manufacturers (including external SATA drives) comply with
SAT, smartmon&acirc; <br>
tools is able to automatically distinguish the native
command set of the device. In some cases the &rsquo;-d
sat&rsquo; option is needed on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also virtual disks
which typically have no useful information to convey to
smartmontools, but could conceivably in the future. An
example of a virtual disk is the OS&rsquo;s <br>
view of a RAID 1 box. There are most likely two SATA disks
inside a RAID 1 box. Addressing those SATA disks from a
distant OS is a challenge for smartmontools. Another
approach <br>
is running a tool like smartmontools inside the RAID 1 box
(e.g. a Network Attached Storage (NAS) box) and fetching the
logs via a browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
smartctl -a /dev/hda <br>
Print a large amount of SMART information for drive /dev/hda
which is typically an ATA (IDE) or SATA disk in Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -a /dev/sdb <br>
Print a large amount of SMART information for drive /dev/sdb
. This may be a SCSI disk or an ATA (SATA) disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -s off /dev/hdd <br>
Disable SMART monitoring and data log collection on drive
/dev/hdd .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl --smart=on
--offlineauto=on --saveauto=on /dev/hda <br>
Enable SMART on drive /dev/hda, enable automatic offline
testing every four hours, and enable autosaving of SMART
Attributes. This is a good start-up line for your
system&Acirc;&acute;s init <br>
files. You can issue this command on a running system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -t long /dev/hdc <br>
Begin an extended self-test of drive /dev/hdc. You can issue
this command on a running system. The results can be seen in
the self-test log visible with the &Acirc;&acute;-l
selftest&Acirc;&acute; <br>
option after it has completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -s on -t offline
/dev/hda <br>
Enable SMART on the disk, and begin an immediate offline
test of drive /dev/hda. You can issue this command on a
running system. The results are only used to update the
SMART <br>
Attributes, visible with the &Acirc;&acute;-A&Acirc;&acute;
option. If any device errors occur, they are logged to the
SMART error log, which can be seen with the &Acirc;&acute;-l
error&Acirc;&acute; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -A -v 9,minutes
/dev/hda <br>
Shows the vendor Attributes, when the disk stores its
power-on time internally in minutes rather than hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -q errorsonly -H -l
selftest /dev/hda <br>
Produces output only if the device returns failing SMART
status, or if some of the logged self-tests ended with
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -q silent -a /dev/hda
<br>
Examine all SMART data for device /dev/hda, but produce no
printed output. You must use the exit status (the $? shell
variable) to learn if any Attributes are out of bound, if
<br>
the SMART status is failing, if there are errors recorded in
the self-test log, or if there are errors recorded in the
disk error log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/sda
<br>
Examine all SMART data for the first ATA disk connected to a

Run a selective self-test on LBAs 10 to 100 and 30 to 300.
After the these LBAs have been tested, read-scan the
remainder of the disk. If the disk is power-cycled during
the <br>
read-scan, resume the scan 45 minutes after power to the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartctl -a -d cciss,0
/dev/cciss/c0d0 <br>
Examine all SMART data for the first SCSI disk connected to
a cciss RAID controller card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
The return values of smartctl are defined by a bitmask. If
all is well with the disk, the return value (exit status) of
smartctl is 0 (all bits turned off). If a problem <br>
occurs, or an error, potential error, or fault is detected,
then a non-zero status is returned. In this case, the eight
different bits in the return value have the following <br>
meanings for ATA disks; some of these values may also be
returned for SCSI disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 0: Command line did not
parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 1: Device open failed,
device did not return an IDENTIFY DEVICE structure, or
device is in a low-power mode (see
&Acirc;&acute;-n&Acirc;&acute; option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 2: Some SMART or other ATA
command to the disk failed, or there was a checksum error in
a SMART data structure (see &Acirc;&acute;-b&Acirc;&acute;
option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 3: SMART status check
returned &quot;DISK FAILING&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 4: We found prefail
Attributes &lt;= threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 5: SMART status check
returned &quot;DISK OK&quot; but we found that some (usage
or prefail) Attributes have been &lt;= threshold at some
time in the past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 6: The device error log
contains records of errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit 7: The device self-test log
contains records of errors. [ATA only] Failed self-tests
outdated by a newer successful extended self-test are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To test within the shell for
whether or not the different bits are turned on or off, you
can use the following type of construction (this is bash
syntax): <br>
smartstat=$(($? &amp; 8)) <br>
This looks at only at bit 3 of the exit status $? (since
8=2^3). The shell variable $smartstat will be nonzero if
SMART status check returned &quot;disk failing&quot; and
zero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This bash script prints all
status bits: <br>
status=$? <br>

echo &quot;Bit $i: $((status &amp; 2**i &amp;&amp; 1))&quot;
<br>
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The TapeAlert log page flags are cleared for the initiator

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFERENCES FOR SMART <br>
An introductory article about smartmontools is Monitoring
Hard Disks with SMART, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal,
January 2004, pages 74-77. This is
http://www.linuxjour&acirc; <br>
nal.com/article/6983 online.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to understand
better how SMART works, and what it does, a good place to
start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first volume of
the &Acirc;&acute;AT Attachment with <br>
Packet Interface-7&Acirc;&acute; (ATA/ATAPI-7) specification
Revision 4b. This documents the SMART functionality which
the smartmontools utilities provide access to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functioning of SMART was
originally defined by the SFF-8035i revision 2 and the
SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications. These are
publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) <br>
Committee.</p>
