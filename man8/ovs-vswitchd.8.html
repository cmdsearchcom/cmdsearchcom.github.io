<p>ovs-vswitchd(8) Open vSwitch Manual ovs-vswitchd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ovs-vswitchd - Open vSwitch daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ovs-vswitchd [database]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A daemon that manages and controls any number of Open
vSwitch switches on the local machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The database argument specifies
how ovs-vswitchd connects to ovsdb-server. The default is
unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock. The following forms are
accepted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl:ip:port <br>
The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4
or IPv6 address format. If ip is an IPv6 address, <br>
then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.: ssl:[::1]:6640. The
--private-key, --certificate, and --ca-cert options are
mandatory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp:ip:port <br>
Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4 or
IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with
square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:file <br>
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a local
named pipe that is represented by a file created in the path
file to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssl:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given SSL port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but specifying ip limits connections to those
from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If ip is an
IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brackets, <br>
e.g.: pssl:6640:[::1]. The --private-key, --certificate, and
--ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptcp:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given TCP port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but ip may be specified to listen only for
connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If
ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack&acirc;
<br>
ets, e.g.: ptcp:6640:[::1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punix:file <br>
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named file
for a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, listen on a local
named pipe. A file is created in the path file to mimic the
behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-vswitchd retrieves its
configuration from database at startup. It sets up Open
vSwitch datapaths and then operates switching across each
bridge described in its configura&acirc; <br>
tion files. As the database changes, ovs-vswitchd
automatically updates its configuration to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-vswitchd switches may be
configured with any of the following features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; L2 switching
with MAC learning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NIC bonding with
automatic fail-over and source MAC-based TX load balancing
(&quot;SLB&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 802.1Q VLAN
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Port mirroring,
with optional VLAN tagging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NetFlow v5 flow
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sFlow(R)
monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Connectivity to
an external OpenFlow controller, such as NOX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only a single instance of
ovs-vswitchd is intended to run at a time. A single
ovs-vswitchd can manage any number of switch instances, up
to the maximum number of supported Open <br>
vSwitch datapaths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-vswitchd does all the
necessary management of Open vSwitch datapaths itself. Thus,
external tools, such ovs-dpctl(8), are not needed for
managing datapaths in conjunction <br>
with ovs-vswitchd, and their use to modify datapaths when
ovs-vswitchd is running can interfere with its operation.
(ovs-dpctl may still be useful for diagnostics.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An Open vSwitch datapath kernel
module must be loaded for ovs-vswitchd to be useful. Refer
to the documentation for instructions on how to build and
load the Open vSwitch kernel <br>
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--mlockall <br>
Causes ovs-vswitchd to call the mlockall() function, to
attempt to lock all of its process memory into physical RAM,
preventing the kernel from paging any of its memory to <br>
disk. This helps to avoid networking interruptions due to
system memory pressure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some systems do not support
mlockall() at all, and other systems only allow privileged
users, such as the superuser, to use it. ovs-vswitchd emits
a log message if mlock&acirc; <br>
all() is unavailable or unsuccessful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DPDK Options <br>
For details on initializing the ovs-vswitchd DPDK datapath,
refer to the documentation or ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daemon Options <br>
The following options are valid on POSIX based
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile[=pidfile] <br>
Causes a file (by default, ovs-vswitchd.pid) to be created
indicating the PID of the running process. If the pidfile
argument is not specified, or if it does not begin <br>
with /, then it is created in /var/run/openvswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --pidfile is not specified,
no pidfile is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overwrite-pidfile <br>
By default, when --pidfile is specified and the specified
pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process,
ovs-vswitchd refuses to start. Specify --over&acirc; <br>
write-pidfile to cause it to instead overwrite the
pidfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --pidfile is not specified,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach <br>
Runs ovs-vswitchd as a background process. The process
forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes the
standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of <br>
disabling logging to the console), and changes its current
directory to the root (unless --no-chdir is specified).
After the child completes its initialization, the par&acirc;
<br>
ent exits. ovs-vswitchd detaches only after it has connected
to the database, retrieved the initial configuration, and
set up that configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--monitor <br>
Creates an additional process to monitor the ovs-vswitchd
daemon. If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a
programming error (SIGABRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, <br>
SIGILL, SIGPIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ) then the
monitor process starts a new copy of it. If the daemon dies
or exits for another reason, the monitor process <br>
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is normally used
with --detach, but it also functions without it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-chdir <br>
By default, when --detach is specified, ovs-vswitchd changes
its current working directory to the root directory after it
detaches. Otherwise, invoking ovs-vswitchd from <br>
a carelessly chosen directory would prevent the
administrator from unmounting the file system that holds
that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying --no-chdir suppresses
this behavior, preventing ovs-vswitchd from changing its
current working directory. This may be useful for collecting
core files, since <br>
it is common behavior to write core dumps into the current
working directory and the root directory is not a good
directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect when
--detach is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-self-confinement <br>
By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to work
with files under well-know, at build-time whitelisted
directories. It is better to stick with this default <br>
behavior and not to use this flag unless some other Access
Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
other access control implementations that are typi&acirc;
<br>
cally enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC),
self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
itself and hence should not be considered as a full
confinement <br>
strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional
layer of security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user Causes ovs-vswitchd to
run as a different user specified in &quot;user:group&quot;,
thus dropping most of the root privileges. Short forms
&quot;user&quot; and &quot;:group&quot; are also allowed,
with <br>
current user or group are assumed respectively. Only daemons
started by the root user accepts this argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, daemons will be
granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before
dropping root privileges. Daemons that interact with a
datapath, such as ovs-vswitchd, will <br>
be granted two additional capabilities, namely CAP_NET_ADMIN
and CAP_NET_RAW. The capability change will apply even if
new user is &quot;root&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, this option is not
currently supported. For security reasons, specifying this
option will cause the daemon process not to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Service Options <br>
The following options are valid only on Windows
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--service <br>
Causes ovs-vswitchd to run as a service in the background.
The service should already have been created through
external tools like SC.exe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--service-monitor <br>
Causes the ovs-vswitchd service to be automatically
restarted by the Windows services manager if the service
dies or exits for unexpected reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --service is not specified,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public Key Infrastructure
Options <br>
-p privkey.pem <br>
--private-key=privkey.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
ovs-vswitchd&rsquo;s identity for outgoing SSL
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cert.pem <br>
--certificate=cert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies
the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the <br>
certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections
will use to verify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cacert.pem <br>
--ca-cert=cacert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
ovs-vswitchd should use to verify certificates presented to
it by SSL peers. (This may be the same certificate <br>
that SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on -c
or --certificate, or it may be a different one, depending on
the PKI design in use.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C none <br>
--ca-cert=none <br>
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
peers. This introduces a security risk, because it means
that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
<br>
trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
<br>
When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as
-C or --ca-cert. If it does not exist, then ovs-vswitchd
will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL <br>
peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named
PEM file. If it is successful, it will immediately drop the
connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL <br>
connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by
the CA certificate thus obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option exposes the SSL
connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the
initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for
bootstrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only useful if
the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as part of the SSL
certificate chain. The SSL protocol does not require the
server to send the CA cer&acirc; <br>
tificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mutually
exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging Options <br>
-v[spec] <br>
--verbose=[spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively. (If
--detach is specified, <br>
ovs-vswitchd closes its standard file descriptors, so
logging to the console will have no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be fil&acirc; <br>
tered out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8)
for a definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
--log-file is also specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
--verbose=dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vPATTERN:destination:pattern
<br>
--verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vFACILITY:facility <br>
--verbose=FACILITY:facility <br>
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can
be one of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, <br>
local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
local7. If this option is not specified, daemon is used as
the default for the local system syslog and local0 is <br>
used while sending a message to the target provided via the
--syslog-target option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file[=file] <br>
Enables logging to a file. If file is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
file name used if file is omitted is /var/log/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/ovs-vswitchd.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-target=host:port <br>
Send syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the
system syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-method=method <br>
Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog
daemon. Following forms are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libc, use libc
syslog() function. This is the default behavior. Downside of
using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actu&acirc; <br>
ally sent to the syslog daemon over /dev/log UNIX domain
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file, use
UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify
arbitrary message format with this option. However, rsyslogd
8.9 and older versions use hard <br>
coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket
use. If you want to use arbitrary message format with older
rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to <br>
localhost IP address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; udp:ip:port, use
UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary
message format also with older rsyslogd. When sending syslog
messages over UDP <br>
socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for
example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
the specified UDP port, accidental iptables <br>
rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and
there are some security considerations that apply to UDP
sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Options <br>
--unixctl=socket <br>
Sets the name of the control socket on which ovs-vswitchd
listens for runtime management commands (see RUNTIME
MANAGEMENT COMMANDS, below). If socket does not begin with
<br>
/, it is interpreted as relative to /var/run/openvswitch. If
--unixctl is not used at all, the default socket is
/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.pid.ctl, where pid is <br>
ovs-vswitchd&rsquo;s process ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows a local named pipe is
used to listen for runtime management commands. A file is
created in the absolute path as pointed by socket or if
--unixctl is not used <br>
at all, a file is created as ovs-vswitchd.ctl in the
configured OVS_RUNDIR directory. The file exists just to
mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying none for socket
disables the control socket feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints version information to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS <br>
ovs-appctl(8) can send commands to a running ovs-vswitchd
process. The currently supported commands are described
below. The command descriptions assume an understanding of
how <br>
to configure Open vSwitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL COMMANDS <br>
exit Causes ovs-vswitchd to gracefully terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qos/show-types interface <br>
Queries the interface for a list of Quality of Service types
that are configurable via Open vSwitch for the given
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qos/show interface <br>
Queries the kernel for Quality of Service configuration and
statistics associated with the given interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bfd/show [interface] <br>
Displays detailed information about Bidirectional Forwarding
Detection configured on interface. If interface is not
specified, then displays detailed information about <br>
all interfaces with BFD enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bfd/set-forwarding [interface]
status <br>
Force the fault status of the BFD module on interface (or
all interfaces if none is given) to be status. status can be
&quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, or &quot;normal&quot;
which reverts to the <br>
standard behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cfm/show [interface] <br>
Displays detailed information about Connectivity Fault
Management configured on interface. If interface is not
specified, then displays detailed information about all <br>
interfaces with CFM enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cfm/set-fault [interface] status
<br>
Force the fault status of the CFM module on interface (or
all interfaces if none is given) to be status. status can be
&quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, or &quot;normal&quot;
which reverts to the <br>
standard behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stp/tcn [bridge] <br>
Forces a topology change event on bridge if it&rsquo;s
running STP. This may cause it to send Topology Change
Notifications to its peers and flush its MAC table.. If no
bridge <br>
is given, forces a topology change event on all bridges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRIDGE COMMANDS <br>
These commands manage bridges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fdb/flush [bridge] <br>
Flushes bridge MAC address learning table, or all learning
tables if no bridge is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fdb/show bridge <br>
Lists each MAC address/VLAN pair learned by the specified
bridge, along with the port on which it was learned and the
age of the entry, in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdb/flush [bridge] <br>
Flushes bridge multicast snooping table, or all snooping
tables if no bridge is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdb/show bridge <br>
Lists each multicast group/VLAN pair learned by the
specified bridge, along with the port on which it was
learned and the age of the entry, in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bridge/reconnect [bridge] <br>
Makes bridge drop all of its OpenFlow controller connections
and reconnect. If bridge is not specified, then all bridges
drop their controller connections and reconnect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command might be useful for
debugging OpenFlow controller issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bridge/dump-flows bridge <br>
Lists all flows in bridge, including those normally hidden
to commands such as ovs-ofctl dump-flows. Flows set up by
mechanisms such as in-band control and fail-open are <br>
hidden from the controller since it is not allowed to modify
or override them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOND COMMANDS <br>
These commands manage bonded ports on an Open
vSwitch&rsquo;s bridges. To understand some of these
commands, it is important to understand a detail of the
bonding implementation <br>
called &lsquo;&lsquo;source load balancing&rsquo;&rsquo;
(SLB). Instead of directly assigning Ethernet source
addresses to slaves, the bonding implementation computes a
function that maps an 48-bit <br>
Ethernet source addresses into an 8-bit value (a
&lsquo;&lsquo;MAC hash&rsquo;&rsquo; value). All of the
Ethernet addresses that map to a single 8-bit value are then
assigned to a single slave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond/list <br>
Lists all of the bonds, and their slaves, on each
bridge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond/show [port] <br>
Lists all of the bond-specific information (updelay,
downdelay, time until the next rebalance) about the given
bonded port, or all bonded ports if no port is given. Also
<br>
lists information about each slave: whether it is enabled or
disabled, the time to completion of an updelay or downdelay
if one is in progress, whether it is the active <br>
slave, the hashes assigned to the slave. Any LACP
information related to this bond may be found using the
lacp/show command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond/migrate port hash slave
<br>
Only valid for SLB bonds. Assigns a given MAC hash to a new
slave. port specifies the bond port, hash the MAC hash to be
migrated (as a decimal number between 0 and <br>
255), and slave the new slave to be assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reassignment is not
permanent: rebalancing or fail-over will cause the MAC hash
to be shifted to a new slave in the usual manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A MAC hash cannot be migrated to
a disabled slave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond/set-active-slave port slave
<br>
Sets slave as the active slave on port. slave must currently
be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The setting is not permanent: a
new active slave will be selected if slave becomes
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond/enable-slave port slave
<br>
bond/disable-slave port slave <br>
Enables (or disables) slave on the given bond port, skipping
any updelay (or downdelay).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting is not permanent:
it persists only until the carrier status of slave
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond/hash mac [vlan] [basis]
<br>
Returns the hash value which would be used for mac with vlan
and basis if specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lacp/show [port] <br>
Lists all of the LACP related information about the given
port: active or passive, aggregation key, system id, and
system priority. Also lists information about each <br>
slave: whether it is enabled or disabled, whether it is
attached or detached, port id and priority, actor
information, and partner information. If port is not
specified, <br>
then displays detailed information about all interfaces with
CFM enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DPCTL DATAPATH DEBUGGING
COMMANDS <br>
The primary way to configure ovs-vswitchd is through the
Open vSwitch database, e.g. using ovs-vsctl(8). These
commands provide a debugging interface for managing
datapaths. <br>
They implement the same features (and syntax) as
ovs-dpctl(8). Unlike ovs-dpctl(8), these commands work with
datapaths that are integrated into ovs-vswitchd (e.g. the
netdev <br>
datapath type).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/add-dp dp
[netdev[,option]...] <br>
Creates datapath dp, with a local port also named dp. This
will fail if a network device dp already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If netdevs are specified,
ovs-vswitchd adds them to the new datapath, just as if
add-if was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/del-dp dp <br>
Deletes datapath dp. If dp is associated with any network
devices, they are automatically removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/add-if dp
netdev[,option]... <br>
Adds each netdev to the set of network devices datapath dp
monitors, where dp is the name of an existing datapath, and
netdev is the name of one of the host&rsquo;s network <br>
devices, e.g. eth0. Once a network device has been added to
a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the
network device&rsquo;s traffic and the network device
appears <br>
silent to the rest of the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A netdev may be followed by a
comma-separated list of options. The following options are
currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type=type <br>
Specifies the type of port to add. The default type is
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port_no=port <br>
Requests a specific port number within the datapath. If this
option is not specified then one will be automatically
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key=value <br>
Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port&rsquo;s
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)
documents the available port types and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/set-if dp port[,option]...
<br>
Reconfigures each port in dp as specified. An option of the
form key=value adds the specified key-value option to the
port or overrides an existing key&rsquo;s value. An <br>
option of the form key=, that is, without a value, deletes
the key-value named key. The type and port number of a port
cannot be changed, so type and port_no are only <br>
allowed if they match the existing configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/del-if dp netdev... <br>
Removes each netdev from the list of network devices
datapath dp monitors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/dump-dps <br>
Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/show [-s | --statistics]
[dp...] <br>
Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their
datapath numbers and a list of ports connected to each
datapath. (The local port is identified as port 0.) If <br>
-s or --statistics is specified, then packet and byte
counters are also printed for each port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The datapath numbers consists of
flow stats and mega flow mask stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;lookups&quot; row
displays three stats related to flow lookup triggered by
processing incoming packets in the datapath. &quot;hit&quot;
displays number of packets matches existing <br>
flows. &quot;missed&quot; displays the number of packets not
matching any existing flow and require user space
processing. &quot;lost&quot; displays number of packets
destined for user space <br>
process but subsequently dropped before reaching userspace.
The sum of &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;miss&quot; equals to
the total number of packets datapath processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;flows&quot; row
displays the number of flows in datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;masks&quot; row
displays the mega flow mask stats. This row is omitted for
datapath not implementing mega flow. &quot;hit&quot;
displays the total number of masks visited for match&acirc;
<br>
ing incoming packets. &quot;total&quot; displays number of
masks in the datapath. &quot;hit/pkt&quot; displays the
average number of masks visited per packet; the ratio
between &quot;hit&quot; and <br>
total number of packets processed by the datapath&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more datapaths are
specified, information on only those datapaths are
displayed. Otherwise, ovs-vswitchd displays information
about all configured datapaths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING
COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are primarily useful for debugging
Open vSwitch. The flow table entries (both matches and
actions) that they work with are not OpenFlow flow entries.
<br>
Instead, they are different and considerably simpler flows
maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel module. Use
ovs-ofctl(8), instead, to work with OpenFlow flow
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dp argument to each of these
commands is optional when exactly one datapath exists, in
which case that datapath is the default. When multiple
datapaths exist, then a data&acirc; <br>
path name is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/dump-flows [-m | --more]
[dp] [filter=filter] <br>
Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath
dp&rsquo;s flow table. Without -m or --more, output omits
match fields that a flow wildcards entirely; with -m or
--more, <br>
output includes all wildcarded fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filter=filter is specified,
only displays the flows that match the filter. filter is a
flow in the form similiar to that accepted by
ovs-ofctl(8)&rsquo;s add-flow command. <br>
(This is not an OpenFlow flow: besides other differences, it
never contains wildcards.) The filter is also useful to
match wildcarded fields in the datapath flow. As an <br>
example, filter=&rsquo;tcp,tp_src=100&rsquo; will match the
datapath flow containing
&rsquo;tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/add-flow [dp] flow
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/mod-flow [--clear]
[--may-create] [-s | --statistics] [dp] flow actions <br>
Adds or modifies a flow in dp&rsquo;s flow table that, when
a packet matching flow arrives, causes actions to be
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The add-flow command succeeds
only if flow does not already exist in dp. Contrariwise,
mod-flow without --may-create only modifies the actions for
an existing flow. With <br>
--may-create, mod-flow will add a new flow or modify an
existing one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -s or --statistics is
specified, then mod-flow prints the modified flow&rsquo;s
statistics. A flow&rsquo;s statistics are the number of
packets and bytes that have passed through <br>
the flow, the elapsed time since the flow last processed a
packet (if ever), and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP
flags processed through the flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --clear, mod-flow zeros out
the flow&rsquo;s statistics. The statistics printed if -s or
--statistics is also specified are those from just before
clearing the statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/del-flow [-s |
--statistics] [dp] flow <br>
Deletes the flow from dp&rsquo;s flow table that matches
flow. If -s or --statistics is specified, then del-flow
prints the deleted flow&rsquo;s statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/get-flow [dp] ufid:ufid
<br>
Fetches the flow from dp&rsquo;s flow table with unique
identifier ufid. ufid must be specified as a string of 32
hexadecimal characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/del-flows [dp] <br>
Deletes all flow entries from datapath dp&rsquo;s flow
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION TRACKING TABLE
DEBUGGING COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are primarily useful for debugging
the connection tracking entries in the datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dp argument to each of these
commands is optional when exactly one datapath exists, in
which case that datapath is the default. When multiple
datapaths exist, then a data&acirc; <br>
path name is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N.B.(Linux specific): the system
datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel module Open vSwitch
datapaths) share a single connection tracking table (which
is also used by other kernel sub&acirc; <br>
systems, such as iptables, nftables and the regular host
stack). Therefore, the following commands do not apply
specifically to one datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/dump-conntrack [-m |
--more] [-s | --statistics] [dp] [zone=zone] <br>
Prints to the console all the connection entries in the
tracker used by dp. If zone=zone is specified, only shows
the connections in zone. With --more, some implementa&acirc;
<br>
tion specific details are included. With --statistics
timeouts and timestamps are added to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpctl/flush-conntrack [dp]
[zone=zone] <br>
Flushes all the connection entries in the tracker used by
dp. If zone=zone is specified, only flushes the connections
in zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DPIF-NETDEV COMMANDS <br>
These commands are used to expose internal information
(mostly statistics) about the
&lsquo;&lsquo;dpif-netdev&rsquo;&rsquo; userspace datapath.
If there is only one datapath (as is often the case, <br>
unless dpctl/ commands are used), the dp argument can be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show [dp]
<br>
Shows performance statistics for each pmd thread of the
datapath dp. The special thread
&lsquo;&lsquo;main&rsquo;&rsquo; sums up the statistics of
every non pmd thread. The sum of &lsquo;&lsquo;emc
hits&rsquo;&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;masked hits&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;miss&rsquo;&rsquo; is the number of packets
received by the datapath. Cycles are counted using the TSC
or similar facilities (when available on the platform). <br>
To reset these counters use dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear. The
duration of one cycle depends on the measuring
infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear [dp]
<br>
Resets to zero the per pmd thread performance numbers shown
by the dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show command. It will NOT reset
datapath or bridge statistics, only the values <br>
shown by the above command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-show [dp]
<br>
For each pmd thread of the datapath dp shows list of
queue-ids with port names, which this thread polls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATAPATH DEBUGGING COMMANDS <br>
These commands query and modify datapaths. They are are
similar to ovs-dpctl(8) commands. dpif/show has the
additional functionality, beyond dpctl/show of printing
OpenFlow <br>
port numbers. The other commands are redundant and will be
removed in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpif/dump-dps <br>
Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpif/show <br>
Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including
statistics and a list of connected ports. The port
information includes the OpenFlow port number, datapath port
num&acirc; <br>
ber, and the type. (The local port is identified as OpenFlow
port 65534.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpif/dump-flows [-m] dp <br>
Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath
dp&rsquo;s flow table. Without -m, output omits match fields
that a flow wildcards entirely; with -m output includes all
wild&acirc; <br>
carded fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is primarily useful
for debugging Open vSwitch. The flow table entries that it
displays are not OpenFlow flow entries. Instead, they are
different and con&acirc; <br>
siderably simpler flows maintained by the datapath module.
If you wish to see the OpenFlow flow entries, use ovs-ofctl
dump-flows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpif/del-flows dp <br>
Deletes all flow entries from datapath dp&rsquo;s flow table
and underlying datapath implementation (e.g., kernel
datapath module).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is primarily useful
for debugging Open vSwitch. As discussed in dpif/dump-flows,
these entries are not OpenFlow flow entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OFPROTO COMMANDS <br>
These commands manage the core OpenFlow switch
implementation (called ofproto).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ofproto/list <br>
Lists the names of the running ofproto instances. These are
the names that may be used on ofproto/trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ofproto/trace [dpname] odp_flow
[-generate | packet] <br>
ofproto/trace bridge br_flow [-generate | packet] <br>
ofproto/trace-packet-out [-consistent] [dpname] odp_flow
[-generate | packet] actions <br>
ofproto/trace-packet-out [-consistent] bridge br_flow
[-generate | packet] actions <br>
Traces the path of an imaginary packet through switch and
reports the path that it took. The initial treatment of the
packet varies based on the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ofproto/trace
looks the packet up in the OpenFlow flow table, as if the
packet had arrived on an OpenFlow port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ofproto/trace-packet-out applies the specified OpenFlow
actions, as if the packet, flow, and actions had been
specified in an OpenFlow
&lsquo;&lsquo;packet-out&rsquo;&rsquo; request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packet&rsquo;s headers (e.g.
source and destination) and metadata (e.g. input port),
together called its &lsquo;&lsquo;flow,&rsquo;&rsquo; are
usually all that matter for the purpose of tracing a <br>
packet. You can specify the flow in the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpname odp_flow <br>
odp_flow is a flow in the form printed by
ovs-dpctl(8)&rsquo;s dump-flows command. If all of your
bridges have the same type, which is the common case, then
you can omit <br>
dpname, but if you have bridges of different types (say,
both ovs-netdev and ovs-system), then you need to specify a
dpname to disambiguate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bridge br_flow <br>
br_flow is a flow in the form similar to that accepted by
ovs-ofctl(8)&rsquo;s add-flow command. (This is not an
OpenFlow flow: besides other differences, it never
con&acirc; <br>
tains wildcards.) bridge names of the bridge through which
br_flow should be traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most commonly, one specifies
only a flow, using one of the forms above, but sometimes one
might need to specify an actual packet instead of just a
flow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Side effects. <br>
Some actions have side effects. For example, the normal
action can update the MAC learning table, and the learn
action can change OpenFlow tables. The trace com&acirc; <br>
mands only perform side effects when a packet is specified.
If you want side effects to take place, then you must supply
a packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Output actions are obviously
side effects too, but the trace commands never execute them,
even when one specifies a packet.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incomplete information. <br>
Most of the time, Open vSwitch can figure out everything
about the path of a packet using just the flow, but in some
special circumstances it needs to look at parts <br>
of the packet that are not included in the flow. When this
is the case, and you do not supply a packet, then a trace
command will tell you it needs a packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to include a packet
as part of a trace operation, there are two ways to do
it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-generate <br>
This option, added to one of the ways to specify a flow
already described, causes Open vSwitch to internally
generate a packet with the flow described and then to <br>
use that packet. If your goal is to execute side effects,
then -generate is the easiest way to do it, but -generate is
not a good way to fill in incomplete infor&acirc; <br>
mation, because it generates packets based on only the flow
information, which means that the packets really do not have
any more information than the flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">packet This form supplies an
explicit packet as a sequence of hex digits. An Ethernet
frame is at least 14 bytes long, so there must be at least
28 hex digits. Obvi&acirc; <br>
ously, it is inconvenient to type in the hex digits by hand,
so the ovs-pcap(1) and ovs-tcpundump(1) utilities provide
easier ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this form, packet headers
are extracted directly from packet, so the odp_flow or
br_flow should specify only metadata. The metadata can
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skb_priority <br>
Packet QoS priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkt_mark <br>
Mark of the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ct_state <br>
Connection state of the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ct_zone <br>
Connection tracking zone for packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ct_mark <br>
Connection mark of the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ct_label <br>
Connection label of the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tun_id The tunnel ID on which
the packet arrived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in_port <br>
The port on which the packet arrived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The in_port value is kernel
datapath port number for the first format and OpenFlow port
number for the second format. The numbering of these two
types of port usually dif&acirc; <br>
fers and there is no relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ofproto-trace-packet-out accepts
an additional -consistent option. With this option
specified, the command rejects actions that are inconsistent
with the specified <br>
packet. (An example of an inconsistency is attempting to
strip the VLAN tag from a packet that does not have a VLAN
tag.) Open vSwitch ignores most forms of inconsis&acirc;
<br>
tency in OpenFlow 1.0 and rejects inconsistencies in later
versions of OpenFlow. The option is necessary because the
command does not ordinarily imply a particular Open&acirc;
<br>
Flow version. One exception is that, when actions includes
an action that only OpenFlow 1.1 and later supports (such as
push_vlan), -consistent is automatically enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VLOG COMMANDS <br>
These commands manage ovs-vswitchd&rsquo;s logging
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlog/set [spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be fil&acirc; <br>
tered out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8)
for a definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
ovs-vswitchd was invoked with the --log-file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlog/set
PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlog/list <br>
Lists the supported logging modules and their current
levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlog/list-pattern <br>
Lists logging patterns used for each destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlog/close <br>
Causes ovs-vswitchd to close its log file, if it is open.
(Use vlog/reopen to reopen it later.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlog/reopen <br>
Causes ovs-vswitchd to close its log file, if it is open,
and then reopen it. (This is useful after rotating log
files, to cause a new log file to be used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has no effect unless
ovs-vswitchd was invoked with the --log-file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlog/disable-rate-limit
[module]... <br>
vlog/enable-rate-limit [module]... <br>
By default, ovs-vswitchd limits the rate at which certain
messages can be logged. When a message would appear more
frequently than the limit, it is suppressed. This <br>
saves disk space, makes logs easier to read, and speeds up
execution, but occasionally troubleshooting requires more
detail. Therefore, vlog/disable-rate-limit allows <br>
rate limits to be disabled at the level of an individual log
module. Specify one or more module names, as displayed by
the vlog/list command. Specifying either no module <br>
names at all or the keyword any disables rate limits for
every log module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vlog/enable-rate-limit
command, whose syntax is the same as
vlog/disable-rate-limit, can be used to re-enable a rate
limit that was previously disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMORY COMMANDS <br>
These commands report memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory/show <br>
Displays some basic statistics about ovs-vswitchd&rsquo;s
memory usage. ovs-vswitchd also logs this information soon
after startup and periodically as its memory consumption
<br>
grows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COVERAGE COMMANDS <br>
These commands manage ovs-vswitchd&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;coverage counters,&rsquo;&rsquo; which count
the number of times particular events occur during a
daemon&rsquo;s runtime. In addition to these commands, <br>
ovs-vswitchd automatically logs coverage counter values, at
INFO level, when it detects that the daemon&rsquo;s main
loop takes unusually long to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coverage counters are useful
mainly for performance analysis and debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">coverage/show <br>
Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few
seconds, the last minute and the last hour, and the total
counts of all of the coverage counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPENVSWITCH TUNNELING COMMANDS
<br>
These commands query and modify OVS tunnel components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs/route/add ipv4_address/plen
output_bridge [GW] <br>
Adds ipv4_address/plen route to vswitchd routing table.
output_bridge needs to be OVS bridge name. This command is
useful if OVS cached routes does not look right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs/route/show <br>
Print all routes in OVS routing table, This includes routes
cached from system routing table and user configured
routes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs/route/del ipv4_address/plen
<br>
Delete ipv4_address/plen route from OVS routing table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tnl/neigh/show</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tnl/arp/show <br>
OVS builds ARP cache by snooping are messages. This command
shows ARP cache table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tnl/neigh/set bridge ip mac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tnl/arp/set bridge ip mac <br>
Adds or modifies an ARP cache entry in bridge, mapping ip to
mac.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tnl/neigh/flush</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tnl/arp/flush <br>
Flush ARP table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tnl/egress_port_range [num1]
[num2] <br>
Set range for UDP source port used for UDP based Tunnels.
For example VxLAN. If case of zero arguments this command
prints current range in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPENFLOW IMPLEMENTATION <br>
This section documents aspects of OpenFlow for which the
OpenFlow specification requires documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packet buffering. <br>
The OpenFlow specification, version 1.2, says:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches that implement
buffering are expected to expose, through documentation,
both the amount of available buffering, and the length of
time before buffers may be <br>
reused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open vSwitch does not maintains
any packet buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bundle lifetime <br>
The OpenFlow specification, version 1.4, says:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the switch does not receive
any OFPT_BUNDLE_CONTROL or OFPT_BUNDLE_ADD_MESSAGE message
for an opened bundle_id for a switch defined time greater
than 1s, it may send an <br>
ofp_error_msg with OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED type and
OFPBFC_TIMEOUT code. If the switch does not receive any new
message in a bundle apart from echo request and replies for
a <br>
switch defined time greater than 1s, it may send an
ofp_error_msg with OFPET_BUNDLE_FAILED type and
OFPBFC_TIMEOUT code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open vSwitch implements idle
bundle lifetime of 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITS <br>
We believe these limits to be accurate as of this writing.
These limits assume the use of the Linux kernel
datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ovs-vswitchd
started through ovs-ctl(8) provides a limit of 65535 file
descriptors. The limits on the number of bridges and ports
is decided by the availability of file <br>
descriptors. With the Linux kernel datapath, creation of a
single bridge consumes three file descriptors and adding a
port consumes &quot;n-handler-threads&quot; file descriptors
<br>
per bridge port. Performance will degrade beyond 1,024 ports
per bridge due to fixed hash table sizing. Other platforms
may have different limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 2,048 MAC
learning entries per bridge, by default. (This is
configurable via other-config:mac-table-size in the Bridge
table. See ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for details.)</p>

limited only by memory available to the kernel. Performance
will degrade beyond 1,048,576 kernel flows per bridge with a
32-bit kernel, beyond 262,144 <br>

anywhere near that many flows.)</p>

are limited only by available memory. Performance is linear
in the number of unique wildcard patterns. That is, an
OpenFlow table that contains many flows <br>
that all match on the same fields in the same way has a
constant-time lookup, but a table that contains many flows
that match on different fields requires lookup time
