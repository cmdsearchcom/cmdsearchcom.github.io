<p>RNDC(8) BIND9 RNDC(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rndc - name server control utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rndc [-b source-address] [-c config-file] [-k key-file] [-s
server] [-p port] [-V] [-y key_id] {command}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rndc controls the operation of a name server. It supersedes
the ndc utility that was provided in old BIND releases. If
rndc is invoked with no command line options or arguments,
<br>
it prints a short summary of the supported commands and the
available options and their arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rndc communicates with the name
server over a TCP connection, sending commands authenticated
with digital signatures. In the current versions of rndc and
named, the only <br>
supported authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5, which uses a
shared secret on each end of the connection. This provides
TSIG-style authentication for the command request and the
<br>
name server&rsquo;s response. All commands sent over the
channel must be signed by a key_id known to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rndc reads a configuration file
to determine how to contact the name server and decide what
algorithm and key it should use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b source-address <br>
Use source-address as the source address for the connection
to the server. Multiple instances are permitted to allow
setting of both the IPv4 and IPv6 source addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-file <br>
Use config-file as the configuration file instead of the
default, /etc/rndc.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k key-file <br>
Use key-file as the key file instead of the default,
/etc/rndc.key. The key in /etc/rndc.key will be used to
authenticate commands sent to the server if the config-file
does <br>
not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s server <br>
server is the name or address of the server which matches a
server statement in the configuration file for rndc. If no
server is supplied on the command line, the host named <br>
by the default-server clause in the options statement of the
rndc configuration file will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Send commands to TCP port port instead of BIND 9&rsquo;s
default control channel port, 953.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Enable verbose logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y key_id <br>
Use the key key_id from the configuration file. key_id must
be known by named with the same algorithm and secret string
in order for control message validation to succeed. <br>
If no key_id is specified, rndc will first look for a key
clause in the server statement of the server being used, or
if no server statement is present for that host, then <br>
the default-key clause of the options statement. Note that
the configuration file contains shared secrets which are
used to send authenticated control commands to name <br>
servers. It should therefore not have general read or write
access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
A list of commands supported by rndc can be seen by running
rndc without arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently supported commands
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload <br>
Reload configuration file and zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload zone [class [view]] <br>
Reload the given zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh zone [class [view]] <br>
Schedule zone maintenance for the given zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retransfer zone [class [view]]
<br>
Retransfer the given zone from the master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sign zone [class [view]] <br>
Fetch all DNSSEC keys for the given zone from the key
directory (see the key-directory option in the BIND 9
Administrator Reference Manual). If they are within their
<br>
publication period, merge them into the zone&rsquo;s DNSKEY
RRset. If the DNSKEY RRset is changed, then the zone is
automatically re-signed with the new key set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command requires that the
auto-dnssec zone option be set to allow or maintain, and
also requires the zone to be configured to allow dynamic
DNS. (See &quot;Dynamic Update <br>
Policies&quot; in the Administrator Reference Manual for
more details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadkeys zone [class [view]]
<br>
Fetch all DNSSEC keys for the given zone from the key
directory. If they are within their publication period,
merge them into the zone&rsquo;s DNSKEY RRset. Unlike rndc
sign, <br>
however, the zone is not immediately re-signed by the new
keys, but is allowed to incrementally re-sign over time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command requires that the
auto-dnssec zone option be set to maintain, and also
requires the zone to be configured to allow dynamic DNS.
(See &quot;Dynamic Update Policies&quot; in <br>
the Administrator Reference Manual for more details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freeze [zone [class [view]]]
<br>
Suspend updates to a dynamic zone. If no zone is specified,
then all zones are suspended. This allows manual edits to be
made to a zone normally updated by dynamic update. It <br>
also causes changes in the journal file to be synced into
the master file. All dynamic update attempts will be refused
while the zone is frozen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thaw [zone [class [view]]] <br>
Enable updates to a frozen dynamic zone. If no zone is
specified, then all frozen zones are enabled. This causes
the server to reload the zone from disk, and re-enables <br>
dynamic updates after the load has completed. After a zone
is thawed, dynamic updates will no longer be refused. If the
zone has changed and the ixfr-from-differences option <br>
is in use, then the journal file will be updated to reflect
changes in the zone. Otherwise, if the zone has changed, any
existing journal file will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync [-clean] [zone [class
[view]]] <br>
Sync changes in the journal file for a dynamic zone to the
master file. If the &quot;-clean&quot; option is specified,
the journal file is also removed. If no zone is specified,
then <br>
all zones are synced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify zone [class [view]] <br>
Resend NOTIFY messages for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reconfig <br>
Reload the configuration file and load new zones, but do not
reload existing zone files even if they have changed. This
is faster than a full reload when there is a large <br>
number of zones because it avoids the need to examine the
modification times of the zones files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stats <br>
Write server statistics to the statistics file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">querylog [on|off] <br>
Enable or disable query logging. (For backward
compatibility, this command can also be used without an
argument to toggle query logging on and off.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Query logging can also be
enabled by explicitly directing the queries category to a
channel in the logging section of named.conf or by
specifying querylog yes; in the options <br>
section of named.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpdb [-all|-cache|-zone] [view
...] <br>
Dump the server&rsquo;s caches (default) and/or zones to the
dump file for the specified views. If no view is specified,
all views are dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">secroots [view ...] <br>
Dump the server&rsquo;s security roots to the secroots file
for the specified views. If no view is specified, security
roots for all views are dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop [-p] <br>
Stop the server, making sure any recent changes made through
dynamic update or IXFR are first saved to the master files
of the updated zones. If -p is specified named&rsquo;s <br>
process id is returned. This allows an external process to
determine when named had completed stopping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">halt [-p] <br>
Stop the server immediately. Recent changes made through
dynamic update or IXFR are not saved to the master files,
but will be rolled forward from the journal files when the
<br>
server is restarted. If -p is specified named&rsquo;s
process id is returned. This allows an external process to
determine when named had completed halting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace <br>
Increment the servers debugging level by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace level <br>
Sets the server&rsquo;s debugging level to an explicit
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notrace <br>
Sets the server&rsquo;s debugging level to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush <br>
Flushes the server&rsquo;s cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flushname name [view] <br>
Flushes the given name from the server&rsquo;s DNS cache
and, if applicable, from the server&rsquo;s nameserver
address database or bad-server cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flushtree name [view] <br>
Flushes the given name, and all of its subdomains, from the
server&rsquo;s DNS cache. Note that this does not affect he
server&rsquo;s address database or bad-server cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
Display status of the server. Note that the number of zones
includes the internal bind/CH zone and the default ./IN hint
zone if there is not an explicit root zone <br>
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursing <br>
Dump the list of queries named is currently recursing
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">validation ( on | off | check )
[view ...] <br>
Enable, disable, or check the current status of DNSSEC
validation. Note dnssec-enable also needs to be set to yes
or auto to be effective. It defaults to enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsig-list <br>
List the names of all TSIG keys currently configured for use
by named in each view. The list both statically configured
keys and dynamic TKEY-negotiated keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsig-delete keyname [view] <br>
Delete a given TKEY-negotiated key from the server. (This
does not apply to statically configured TSIG keys.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addzone zone [class [view]]
configuration <br>
Add a zone while the server is running. This command
requires the allow-new-zones option to be set to yes. The
configuration string specified on the command line is the
zone <br>
configuration text that would ordinarily be placed in
named.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration is saved in a
file called hash.nzf, where hash is a cryptographic hash
generated from the name of the view. When named is
restarted, the file will be loaded <br>
into the view configuration, so that zones that were added
can persist after a restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sample addzone command
would add the zone example.com to the default view:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$rndc addzone example.com
&rsquo;{ type master; file &quot;example.com.db&quot;;
};&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note the brackets and
semi-colon around the zone configuration text.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delzone zone [class [view]] <br>
Delete a zone while the server is running. Only zones that
were originally added via rndc addzone can be deleted in
this manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signing [( -list | -clear
keyid/algorithm | -clear all | -nsec3param ( parameters |
none ) ) ] zone [class [view]] <br>
List, edit, or remove the DNSSEC signing state for the
specified zone. The status of ongoing DNSSEC operations
(such as signing or generating NSEC3 chains) is stored in
the <br>
zone in the form of DNS resource records of type
sig-signing-type. rndc signing -list converts these records
into a human-readable form, indicating which keys are
currently <br>
signing or have finished signing the zone, and which NSEC3
chains are being created or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rndc signing -clear can remove a
single key (specified in the same format that rndc signing
-list uses to display it), or all keys. In either case, only
completed keys are <br>
removed; any record indicating that a key has not yet
finished signing the zone will be retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rndc signing -nsec3param sets
the NSEC3 parameters for a zone. This is the only supported
mechanism for using NSEC3 with inline-signing zones.
Parameters are specified in the <br>
same format as an NSEC3PARAM resource record: hash
algorithm, flags, iterations, and salt, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the only defined
value for hash algorithm is 1, representing SHA-1. The flags
may be set to 0 or 1, depending on whether you wish to set
the opt-out bit in the <br>
NSEC3 chain. iterations defines the number of additional
times to apply the algorithm when generating an NSEC3 hash.
The salt is a string of data expressed in hexidecimal, <br>
or a hyphen (&lsquo;-&rsquo;) if no salt is to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, for example, to create an
NSEC3 chain using the SHA-1 hash algorithm, no opt-out flag,
10 iterations, and a salt value of &quot;FFFF&quot;, use:
rndc signing -nsec3param 1 0 10 <br>
FFFF zone. To set the opt-out flag, 15 iterations, and no
salt, use: rndc signing -nsec3param 1 1 15 - zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rndc signing -nsec3param none
removes an existing NSEC3 chain and replaces it with
NSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
There is currently no way to provide the shared secret for a
key_id without using the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several error messages could be
clearer.</p>
