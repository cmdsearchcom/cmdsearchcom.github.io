<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ocserv - OpenConnect VPN server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Openconnect VPN server (ocserv) is a VPN server compatible
with the openconnect VPN client. It follows the AnyConnect
VPN protocol which is used by several CISCO routers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This a standalone server that reads a configuration file
(see below for more details), and waits for client
connections. Log messages are redirected to daemon
facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server maintains two
connections/channels with the client. The main VPN channel
is established over TCP, HTTP and TLS. This is the control
channel as well as the backup data <br>
channel. After its establishment a UDP channel using DTLS is
initiated which serves as the main data channel. If the UDP
channel fails to establish or is temporarily unavailable
<br>
the backup channel over TCP/TLS is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This server supports multiple
authentication methods, including PAM and certificate
authentication. Authenticated users are assigned an
unprivileged worker process and obtain a <br>
networking (tun) device and an IP from a configurable pool
of addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once authenticated, the server
provides the client with an IP address and a list of routes
that it may access. In order to allow high-speed transfers
the server does not process <br>
or filter packets. It is expected that the server has or
will set up any required routes or firewall rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to separate users
into groups, which are either present on their certificate,
or presented on login for the user to choose. That way a
user may take advantage of <br>
the different settings that may apply per group. See the
comments on the configuration file for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f, --foreground <br>
Do not fork into background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d number, --debug=number <br>
Enable verbose network debugging information. This option
takes an integer number as its argument. The value of number
is constrained to being: <br>
in the range 0 through 9999</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file, --config=file <br>
Configuration file for the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --test-config <br>
Test the provided configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file, --pid-file=file <br>
Specify pid file for the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-!, --more-help <br>
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [{v|c|n --version [{v|c|n}]}]
<br>
Output version of program and exit. The default mode is
&lsquo;v&rsquo;, a simple version. The &lsquo;c&rsquo; mode
will print copyright information and &lsquo;n&rsquo; will
print the full copyright <br>
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
Users can be authenticated in multiple ways, which are
explained in the following paragraphs. Connected users can
be managed using the &rsquo;occtl&rsquo; tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password authentication <br>
If your system supports Pluggable Authentication Modules
(PAM), then ocserv will take advantage of it to password
authenticate its users. Otherwise a plain password file
similar <br>
to the UNIX password file is also supported. In that case
the &rsquo;ocpasswd&rsquo; tool can be used for its
management. Note that password authentication can be used in
conjunction with <br>
certificate authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GSSAPI authentication <br>
ocserv will take advantage of the MIT Kerberos project
GSSAPI libraries, and allow authentication using any method
GSSAPI supports. That is, mainly, Kerberos authentication.
That <br>
is often more useful to be combined with PAM or other
password authentication methods so that a fallback mechanism
can be used when GSSAPI fails (e.g., when the user
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
already have a Kerberos ticket). The GSSAPI authentication
is implemented using SPNEGO over HTTP (RFC4559).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public key (certificate)
authentication <br>
Public key authentication allows the user to be
authenticated by the possession of the private key that
corresponds to a known to the server public key. That allows
the usage of <br>
common smart cards for user authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ocserv, a certificate
authority (CA) is used to sign the client certificates. That
certificate authority can be local, used only by the server
to sign its user&rsquo;s known public <br>
keys which are then given to users in a form of
certificates. That authority need also provide a CRL to
allow the server to reject the revoked clients (see ca-cert,
crl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In certificate authentication
each client presents a certificate and signs data provided
by the server, as part of TLS authentication, to prove his
possession of the correspond&acirc; <br>
ing private key. The certificate need also contain user
identifying information, for example, the user ID of the
client must be embedded in the certificate&rsquo;s
Distinguished Name <br>
(DN), i.e., in the Common Name, or UID fields. For the
server to read the name, the cert-user-oid configuration
option must be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples
demonstrate how to use certtool from GnuTLS to generate such
CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generating the CA <br>
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem <br>
$ cat &lt;&lt; _EOF_ &gt;ca.tmpl <br>
cn = &quot;VPN CA&quot; <br>
organization = &quot;Big Corp&quot; <br>
serial = 1 <br>
expiration_days = -1 <br>
ca <br>
signing_key <br>
cert_signing_key <br>
crl_signing_key <br>
_EOF_ <br>
$ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem
--template ca.tmpl --outfile ca-cert.pem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generating a local server
certificate <br>
The following example generates the server key and
certificate pair. The key generated is an RSA one, but
different types can be used by specifying the
&rsquo;ecdsa&rsquo; or &rsquo;dsa&rsquo; options <br>
to certtool. <br>
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile server-key.pem <br>
$ cat &lt;&lt; _EOF_ &gt;server.tmpl <br>
cn = &quot;VPN server&quot; <br>
dns_name = &quot;www.example.com&quot; <br>
dns_name = &quot;vpn1.example.com&quot; <br>
#ip_address = &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; <br>
organization = &quot;MyCompany&quot; <br>
expiration_days = -1 <br>
signing_key <br>
encryption_key #only if the generated key is an RSA one <br>
tls_www_server <br>
_EOF_ <br>
$ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey
server-key.pem --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem
--load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem --template server.tmpl
--outfile server-cert.pem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From this point the clients need
ca-cert.pem to be able to securely connect to the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it is a better
practice to use two separate RSA keys, one with the
signing_key option and another with the encryption_key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generating an external CA-signed
server certificate <br>
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile server-key.pem <br>
$ cat &lt;&lt; _EOF_ &gt;server.tmpl <br>
cn = &quot;My server&quot; <br>
dns_name = &quot;www.example.com&quot; <br>
organization = &quot;MyCompany&quot; <br>
expiration_days = -1 <br>
signing_key <br>
encryption_key #only if the generated key is an RSA one <br>
tls_www_server <br>
_EOF_ <br>
$ certtool --generate-request --load-privkey server-key.pem
--template server.tmpl --outfile server-cert.csr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point you need to
provide the server-cert.csr to your CA, and they will send
you the server certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generating the client
certificates <br>
Note that it is recommended to leave detailed personal
information out of the certificate as it is sent in clear
during TLS authentication. The following process generates a
cer&acirc; <br>
tificate and converts it to PKCS #12 that is protected by a
PIN and most clients are able to import (the 3DES cipher is
used in the example because it is supported by far more <br>
devices than AES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ certtool --generate-privkey
--outfile user-key.pem <br>
$ cat &lt;&lt; _EOF_ &gt;user.tmpl <br>
cn = &quot;user&quot; <br>
unit = &quot;admins&quot; <br>
expiration_days = 365 <br>
signing_key <br>
tls_www_client <br>
_EOF_ <br>
$ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey
user-key.pem --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem
--load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem --template user.tmpl --outfile
user-cert.pem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ certtool --to-p12
--load-privkey user-key.pem --pkcs-cipher 3des-pkcs12
--load-certificate user-cert.pem --outfile user.p12
--outder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revoking a client certificate
<br>
To revoke the previous client certificate, i.e., preventing
the user from accessing the VPN resources prior to its
certificate expiration, use: <br>
$ cat &lt;&lt; _EOF_ &gt;crl.tmpl <br>
crl_next_update = 365 <br>
crl_number = 1 <br>
_EOF_ <br>
$ cat user-cert.pem &gt;&gt;revoked.pem <br>
$ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem
--load-ca-certificate ca.pem --load-certificate revoked.pem
--template crl.tmpl --outfile crl.pem <br>
After that you may want to notify ocserv of the new CRL by
using the HUP signal, or wait for it to reload it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there are no revoked
certificates an empty revocation list should be generated as
follows. <br>
$ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem
--load-ca-certificate ca.pem --template crl.tmpl --outfile
crl.pem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETWORKING CONSIDERATIONS <br>
In certain setups, where a firewall may be blocking ICMP
responses, setting the MSS of TCP connections to MTU will
eliminate the &quot;black hole&quot; connection issues. See
<br>
http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.cookbook.mtu-mss.html for
instructions to enable it on a Linux system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION NOTES <br>
Note that while this server utilizes privilege separation
and all authentication occurs on the security module, this
does not apply for TLS client certificate authentication.
<br>
That is due to TLS protocol limitation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
ocserv&rsquo;s configuration file format <br>
By default, if no other file is specified, ocserv looks for
its configuration file at /etc/ocserv/ocserv.conf. An
example configuration file follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># User authentication method.
Could be set multiple times and in <br>
# that case all should succeed. To enable multiple methods
use <br>
# multiple auth directives. Available options: certificate,
<br>
# plain, pam, radius, gssapi. <br>
# <br>
# Note that authentication methods cannot be changed with
reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># certificate: <br>
# This indicates that all connecting users must present a
certificate. <br>
# The username and user group will be then extracted from it
(see <br>
# cert-user-oid and cert-group-oid). The certificate to be
accepted <br>
# it must be signed by the CA certificate as specified in
&rsquo;ca-cert&rsquo; and <br>
# it must not be listed in the CRL, as specified by the
&rsquo;crl&rsquo; option. <br>
# <br>
# pam[gid-min=1000]: <br>
# This enabled PAM authentication of the user. The gid-min
option is used <br>
# by auto-select-group option, in order to select the
minimum valid group ID. <br>
# <br>
#
plain[passwd=/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd,otp=/etc/ocserv/users.otp]
<br>
# The plain option requires specifying a password file which
contains <br>
# entries of the following format. <br>
#
&quot;username:groupname1,groupname2:encoded-password&quot;
<br>
# One entry must be listed per line, and
&rsquo;ocpasswd&rsquo; should be used <br>
# to generate password entries. The &rsquo;otp&rsquo;
suboption allows one to specify <br>
# an oath password file to be used for one time passwords;
the format of <br>
# the file is described in
https://code.google.com/p/mod-authn-otp/wiki/UsersFile <br>
# <br>
#
radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true,nas-identifier=name]:
<br>
# The radius option requires specifying freeradius-client
configuration <br>
# file. If the groupconfig option is set, then
config-per-user/group will be overridden, <br>
# and all configuration will be read from radius. That also
includes the <br>
# Acct-Interim-Interval, and Session-Timeout values. <br>
# <br>
# See doc/README-radius.md for the supported radius
configuration atributes. <br>
# <br>
#
gssapi[keytab=/etc/key.tab,require-local-user-map=false,tgt-freshness-time=900,gid-min=1000]
<br>
# The gssapi option allows one to use authentication methods
supported by GSSAPI, <br>
# such as Kerberos tickets with ocserv. It should be best
used as an alternative <br>
# to PAM (i.e., have pam in auth and gssapi in enable-auth),
to allow users with <br>
# tickets and without tickets to login. The default value
for require-local-user-map <br>
# is true. The &rsquo;tgt-freshness-time&rsquo; if set, it
would require the TGT tickets presented <br>
# to have been issued within the provided number of seconds.
That option is used to <br>
# restrict logins even if the KDC provides long time TGT
tickets. <br>
# The gid-min option is used by auto-select-group option, in
order to select the minimum <br>
# valid group ID.</p>

to deprecate <br>
# the pre-draft-DTLS negotiation inherited from AnyConnect.
It allows the <br>
# DTLS channel to negotiate its ciphers and the DTLS
protocol version. <br>
#dtls-psk = false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This option allows one to
disable the legacy DTLS negotiation (enabled by default,
<br>
# but that may change in the future). <br>
# The legacy DTLS uses a pre-draft version of the DTLS
protocol and was <br>
# from AnyConnect protocol. It has several limitations, that
are addressed <br>
# by the dtls-psk protocol supported by openconnect 7.08+.
<br>
dtls-legacy = true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The server has been tested to be compatible with the
openconnect VPN client. However, it is also known to be
compatible with certain CISCO AnyConnect clients. To enable
compati&acirc; <br>
bility with CISCO&rsquo;s AnyConnect the cisco-client-compat
and user-profile options must be set in ocserv&rsquo;s
configuration.</p>
