<p>MOSQUITTO(8) System management commands MOSQUITTO(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mosquitto - an MQTT broker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mosquitto [-c config file] [-d | --daemon] [-p port number]
[-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mosquitto is a broker for the MQTT protocol version 3.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --config-file <br>
Load configuration from a file. If not given, the default
values as described in mosquitto.conf(5) are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --daemon <br>
Run mosquitto in the background as a daemon. All other
behaviour remains the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --port <br>
Listen on the port specified instead of the default 1883.
This acts in addition to the port setting in the config
file. May be specified multiple times to open multiple <br>
sockets listening on different ports. This socket will be
bound to all network interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Use verbose logging. This is equivalent to setting log_type
to all in the configuration file. This overrides and logging
options given in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The broker can be configured using a configuration file as
described in mosquitto.conf(5) and this is the main point of
information for mosquitto. The files required for SSL/TLS
<br>
support are described in mosquitto-tls(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BROKER STATUS <br>
Clients can find information about the broker by subscribing
to topics in the $SYS hierarchy as follows. Topics marked as
static are only sent once per client on subscription. <br>
All other topics are updated every sys_interval seconds. If
sys_interval is 0, then updates are not sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you are using a
command line client to interact with the $SYS topics and
your shell interprets $ as an environment variable, you need
to place the topic in single <br>
quotes &rsquo;$SYS/...&rsquo; or to escape the dollar
symbol: YS/... otherwise the $SYS will be treated as an
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/bytes/received <br>
The total number of bytes received since the broker
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/bytes/sent <br>
The total number of bytes sent since the broker started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/clients/connected,
$SYS/broker/clients/active (deprecated) <br>
The number of currently connected clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/clients/expired <br>
The number of disconnected persistent clients that have been
expired and removed through the persistent_client_expiration
option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/clients/disconnected,
$SYS/broker/clients/inactive (deprecated) <br>
The total number of persistent clients (with clean session
disabled) that are registered at the broker but are
currently disconnected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/clients/maximum <br>
The maximum number of clients that have been connected to
the broker at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/clients/total <br>
The total number of active and inactive clients currently
connected and registered on the broker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/connection/# <br>
When bridges are configured to/from the broker, common
practice is to provide a status topic that indicates the
state of the connection. This is provided within <br>
$SYS/broker/connection/ by default. If the value of the
topic is 1 the connection is active, if 0 then it is not
active. See the Bridges section below for more information
on <br>
bridges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/heap/current size
<br>
The current size of the heap memory in use by mosquitto.
Note that this topic may be unavailable depending on compile
time options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/heap/maximum size
<br>
The largest amount of heap memory used by mosquitto. Note
that this topic may be unavailable depending on compile time
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/load/connections/+
<br>
The moving average of the number of CONNECT packets received
by the broker over different time intervals. The final
&quot;+&quot; of the hierarchy can be 1min, 5min or 15min.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYS/broker/version <br>
The version of the broker. Static.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WILDCARD TOPIC SUBSCRIPTIONS
<br>
In addition to allowing clients to subscribe to specific
topics, mosquitto also allows the use of two wildcards in
subscriptions. + is the wildcard used to match a single
level <br>
of hierarchy. For example, for a topic of
&quot;a/b/c/d&quot;, the following example subscriptions
will match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/b/c/d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; +/b/c/d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/+/c/d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/+/+/d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; +/+/+/+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following subscriptions will
not match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/b/c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; b/+/c/d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; +/+/+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second wildcard is # and is
used to match all subsequent levels of hierarchy. With a
topic of &quot;a/b/c/d&quot;, the following example
subscriptions will match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/b/c/d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; #</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/b/#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a/b/c/#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; +/b/c/#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The $SYS hierarchy does not
match a subscription of &quot;#&quot;. If you want to
observe the entire $SYS hierarchy, subscribe to $SYS/#.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the wildcards must be
only ever used on their own, so a subscription of
&quot;a/b+/c&quot; is not valid use of a wildcard. The #
wildcard must only ever be used as the final <br>
character of a subscription.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRIDGES <br>
Multiple brokers can be connected together with the bridging
functionality. This is useful where it is desirable to share
information between locations, but where not all of the <br>
information needs to be shared. An example could be where a
number of users are running a broker to help record power
usage and for a number of other reasons. The power usage
<br>
could be shared through bridging all of the user brokers to
a common broker, allowing the power usage of all users to be
collected and compared. The other information would <br>
remain local to each broker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information on configuring
bridges, see mosquitto.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGHUP <br>
Upon receiving the SIGHUP signal, mosquitto will attempt to
reload configuration file data, assuming that the -c
argument was provided when mosquitto was started. Not all
<br>
configuration parameters can be reloaded without restarting.
See mosquitto.conf(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Upon receiving the SIGUSR1 signal, mosquitto will write the
persistence database to disk. This signal is only acted upon
if persistence is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
The SIGUSR2 signal causes mosquitto to print out the current
subscription tree, along with information about where
retained messages exist. This is intended as a testing <br>
feature only and may be removed at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf <br>
Configuration file. See mosquitto.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/mosquitto/mosquitto.db
<br>
Persistent message data storage location if persist
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/hosts.allow,
/etc/hosts.deny <br>
Host access control via tcp-wrappers as described in
hosts_access(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THANKS <br>
Thanks to Andy Stanford-Clark for being one of the people
who came up with MQTT in the first place. Thanks to Andy and
Nicholas O&rsquo;Leary for providing clarifications of the
<br>
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thanks also to everybody at the
Ubuntu UK Podcast and Linux Outlaws for organising OggCamp,
where Andy gave a talk that inspired mosquitto.</p>
