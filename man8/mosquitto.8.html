<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>mosquitto</b> is a broker for the MQTT protocol version 3.1.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-c</b>, <b>--config-file</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Load configuration from a file. If not given,
  the default values as described in <b>mosquitto.conf</b>(5) are used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-d</b>, <b>--daemon</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Run <b>mosquitto</b> in the background as a
  daemon. All other behaviour remains the same.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p</b>, <b>--port</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Listen on the port specified instead of the
  default 1883. This acts in addition to the port setting in the config file.
  May be specified multiple times to open multiple sockets listening on
  different ports. This socket will be bound to all network interfaces.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use verbose logging. This is equivalent to
  setting <b>log_type</b> to <b>all</b> in the configuration file. This
  overrides and logging options given in the configuration file.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The broker can be configured using a configuration file as described in
  <b>mosquitto.conf</b>(5) and this is the main point of information for
  mosquitto. The files required for SSL/TLS support are described in
  <b>mosquitto-tls</b>(7).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BROKER_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#BROKER_STATUS">BROKER
  STATUS</a></h1>
Clients can find information about the broker by subscribing to topics in the
  $SYS hierarchy as follows. Topics marked as static are only sent once per
  client on subscription. All other topics are updated every <b>sys_interval</b>
  seconds. If <b>sys_interval</b> is 0, then updates are not sent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you are using a command line client to interact with the $SYS
  topics and your shell interprets $ as an environment variable, you need to
  place the topic in single quotes '$SYS/...' or to escape the dollar symbol:
  \$SYS/... otherwise the $SYS will be treated as an environment variable.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WILDCARD_TOPIC_SUBSCRIPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#WILDCARD_TOPIC_SUBSCRIPTIONS">WILDCARD
  TOPIC SUBSCRIPTIONS</a></h1>
In addition to allowing clients to subscribe to specific topics, mosquitto also
  allows the use of two wildcards in subscriptions. <b>+</b> is the wildcard
  used to match a single level of hierarchy. For example, for a topic of
  &quot;a/b/c/d&quot;, the following example subscriptions will match:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/b/c/d</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;+/b/c/d</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/+/c/d</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/+/+/d</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;+/+/+/+</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following subscriptions will not match:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/b/c</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;b/+/c/d</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;+/+/+</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second wildcard is <b>#</b> and is used to match all subsequent levels of
  hierarchy. With a topic of &quot;a/b/c/d&quot;, the following example
  subscriptions will match:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/b/c/d</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;#</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/#</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/b/#</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;a/b/c/#</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;+/b/c/#</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The $SYS hierarchy does not match a subscription of &quot;#&quot;. If you want
  to observe the entire $SYS hierarchy, subscribe to $SYS/#.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the wildcards must be only ever used on their own, so a subscription
  of &quot;a/b+/c&quot; is not valid use of a wildcard. The <b>#</b> wildcard
  must only ever be used as the final character of a subscription.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BRIDGES"><a class="selflink" href="#BRIDGES">BRIDGES</a></h1>
Multiple brokers can be connected together with the bridging functionality. This
  is useful where it is desirable to share information between locations, but
  where not all of the information needs to be shared. An example could be where
  a number of users are running a broker to help record power usage and for a
  number of other reasons. The power usage could be shared through bridging all
  of the user brokers to a common broker, allowing the power usage of all users
  to be collected and compared. The other information would remain local to each
  broker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For information on configuring bridges, see <b>mosquitto.conf</b>(5).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
SIGHUP
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Upon receiving the SIGHUP signal, mosquitto
  will attempt to reload configuration file data, assuming that the <b>-c</b>
  argument was provided when mosquitto was started. Not all configuration
  parameters can be reloaded without restarting. See <b>mosquitto.conf</b>(5)
  for details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
SIGUSR1
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Upon receiving the SIGUSR1 signal, mosquitto
  will write the persistence database to disk. This signal is only acted upon if
  persistence is enabled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
SIGUSR2
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The SIGUSR2 signal causes mosquitto to print
  out the current subscription tree, along with information about where retained
  messages exist. This is intended as a testing feature only and may be removed
  at any time.</div>

Thanks to Andy Stanford-Clark for being one of the people who came up with MQTT
  in the first place. Thanks to Andy and Nicholas O'Leary for providing
  clarifications of the protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thanks also to everybody at the Ubuntu UK Podcast and Linux Outlaws for
  organising OggCamp, where Andy gave a talk that inspired mosquitto.
