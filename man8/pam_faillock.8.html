<p>PAM_FAILLOCK(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_FAILLOCK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_faillock - Module counting authentication failures
during a specified interval</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
auth ... pam_faillock.so {preauth|authfail|authsucc}
[dir=/path/to/tally-directory] [even_deny_root] [deny=n]
[fail_interval=n] [unlock_time=n] [root_unlock_time=n]
[audit] <br>
[silent] [no_log_info]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account ... pam_faillock.so
[dir=/path/to/tally-directory] [no_log_info]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This module maintains a list of failed authentication
attempts per user during a specified interval and locks the
account in case there were more than deny consecutive failed
<br>
authentications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, failed attempts to
authenticate root will not cause the root account to become
blocked, to prevent denial-of-service: if your users
aren&rsquo;t given shell accounts and root <br>
may only login via su or at the machine console (not
telnet/rsh, etc), this is safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
{preauth|authfail|authsucc} <br>
This argument must be set accordingly to the position of
this module instance in the PAM stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preauth argument must be
used when the module is called before the modules which ask
for the user credentials such as the password. The module
just examines whether the <br>
user should be blocked from accessing the service in case
there were anomalous number of failed consecutive
authentication attempts recently. This call is optional if
<br>
authsucc is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authfail argument must be
used when the module is called after the modules which
determine the authentication outcome, failed. Unless the
user is already blocked due to <br>
previous authentication failures, the module will record the
failure into the appropriate user tally file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authsucc argument must be
used when the module is called after the modules which
determine the authentication outcome, succeded. Unless the
user is already blocked due to <br>
previous authentication failures, the module will then clear
the record of the failures in the respective user tally
file. Otherwise it will return authentication error. If <br>
this call is not done, the pam_faillock will not distinguish
between consecutive and non-consecutive failed
authentication attempts. The preauth call must be used in
such <br>
case. Due to complications in the way the PAM stack can be
configured it is also possible to call pam_faillock as an
account module. In such configuration the module must be
<br>
also called in the preauth stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir=/path/to/tally-directory
<br>
The directory where the user files with the failure records
are kept. The default is /var/run/faillock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audit <br>
Will log the user name into the system log if the user is
not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">silent <br>
Don&rsquo;t print informative messages. This option is
implicite in the authfail and authsucc functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_log_info <br>
Don&rsquo;t log informative messages via syslog(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deny=n <br>
Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication
failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds n.
The default is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fail_interval=n <br>
The length of the interval during which the consecutive
authentication failures must happen for the user account
lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlock_time=n <br>
The access will be reenabled after n seconds after the lock
out. The default is 600 (10 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the n is set to never or 0
the access will not be reenabled at all until administrator
explicitly reenables it with the faillock command. Note
though that the default <br>
directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on
system boot so the access will be also reenabled after
system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally <br>
directory must be set with the dir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that it is usually
undesirable to permanently lock out the users as they can
become easily a target of denial of service attack unless
the usernames are random and <br>
kept secret to potential attackers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even_deny_root <br>
Root account can become locked as well as regular
accounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root_unlock_time=n <br>
This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access
after n seconds to root account after the account is locked.
In case the option is not specified the value is the same
<br>
as of the unlock_time option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULE TYPES PROVIDED <br>
The auth and account module types are provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
PAM_AUTH_ERR <br>
A invalid option was given, the module was not able to
retrieve the user name, no valid counter file was found, or
too many failed logins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_SUCCESS <br>
Everything was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_IGNORE <br>
User not present in passwd database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
pam_faillock setup in the PAM stack is different from the
pam_tally2 module setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The individual files with the
failure records are created as owned by the user. This
allows pam_faillock.so module to work correctly when it is
called from a screensaver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that using the module in
preauth without the silent option or with requisite control
field leaks an information about existence or non-existence
of an user account in the <br>
system because the failures are not recorded for the unknown
users. The message about the user account being locked is
never displayed for nonexisting user accounts allowing the
<br>
adversary to infer that a particular account is not existing
on a system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are two possible configuration examples for
/etc/pam.d/login. They make pam_faillock to lock the account
after 4 consecutive failed logins during the default
interval of 15 <br>
minutes. Root account will be locked as well. The accounts
will be automatically unlocked after 20 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first example the module
is called only in the auth phase and the module does not
print any information about the account blocking by
pam_faillock. The preauth call can be <br>
added to tell the user that his login is blocked by the
module and also to abort the authentication without even
asking for password in such case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth required pam_securetty.so
<br>
auth required pam_env.so <br>
auth required pam_nologin.so <br>
# optionally call: auth requisite pam_faillock.so preauth
deny=4 even_deny_root unlock_time=1200 <br>
# to display the message about account being locked <br>
auth [success=1 default=bad] pam_unix.so <br>

session required pam_selinux.so close <br>
session required pam_loginuid.so <br>
session required pam_unix.so <br>
session required pam_selinux.so open</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second example the module
is called both in the auth and account phases and the module
gives the authenticating user message when the account is
locked</p>
