<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>apmd</b> is an monitoring daemon for the Advanced Power Management (APM)
  subsystem. The APM subsystem consists of power-management hardware, firmware
  usually referred to as the APM BIOS and a driver in the operating system
  kernel. The daemon can execute a program (usually a shell script) when events
  are reported by the APM subsystem, and will log, via <b>syslogd</b>(8),
  certain changes in power status. When the available battery power becomes very
  low it can alert the user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the APM subsystem notifies the daemon of a pending suspend or standby
  request, <b>apmd</b> will run a proxy program, log the event, <b>sync</b>(2)
  data to the disk and then tell the APM subsystem to continue its operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Preparations for power management events are made mainly by the proxy
  <i>program</i> specified using the -P option. The proxy program is invoked
  with one or two arguments:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>start</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the daemon starts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>stop</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the daemon stops.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>standby ( system | user )</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that standby has
      been initiated. The second parameter indicates whether firmware
      (&quot;system&quot;) or software (&quot;user&quot;) was the originator of
      the event.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;standby&quot; mode conserves power but leaves the machine able to
      respond almost immediately to user activity. Most laptops can't stay in
      standby mode on battery power for more than a few hours or a day.
      Normally, nothing special needs to be done to prepare for &quot;standing
      by&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>suspend ( system | user )</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that suspension has
      been initiated. The second parameter indicates whether firmware
      (&quot;system&quot;) or software (&quot;user&quot;) was the originator of
      the event.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;suspend&quot; mode aggressively conserves power. Usually this
      involves shutting off power to all devices except the CPU core and memory,
      which are put into a very low power mode. Most laptops can stay suspended,
      using battery power alone, for several days. (&quot;Hibernation&quot; is a
      kind of super-suspend, where all that state is written to disk and the
      machine uses no power. Hibernation is treated like suspension by the APM
      subsystem.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Before suspending, PCMCIA devices may need to be disabled using
      <b>cardctl</b>(8), and some modular device drivers may need to be unloaded
      if they have not been designed to support power management.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>resume ( suspend | standby | critical )</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that computer has
      resumed normal operation. The second parameter indicates the kind of event
      from which the system is resuming. (A &quot;critical&quot; suspend is a
      suspension that the APM subsystem performs in an emergency. Some kernels
      do not pass this event to user space. If <b>apmd</b> receives the event,
      it acknowledges the event and exits immediately without logging or running
      the proxy program.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When resuming, PCMCIA devices may need to be re-enabled using
      <b>cardctl</b>(8), and some modular drivers may need to be reloaded. Note
      that in the case of a critical suspend, the system state may not have been
      completely saved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>change power</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the APM subsystem reports a change in power
      status, such as a switch from mains to battery power.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>change battery</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that the charge of
      one or more batteries is low. A few minutes of battery power may
    remain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>change capability</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invoked when the APM subsystem reports some change in power
      management capabilities. It may have been caused by operation of a setup
      utility, or by the installation or removal of devices.</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>apmd</b> emits various messages, most of which are self-explanatory. Battery
  status log entries contain three fields, separated by commas. The first field
  indicates how full the battery is as a percentage of its capacity. The second
  field indicates whether the battery is charging, not charging, or discharging.
  When possible, <b>apmd</b> adds in parentheses its estimate of the rate of
  charging or discharging. The third field indicates how much time the battery
  can or could be used to power the computer. This information is provided by
  the APM subsystem. When possible, <b>apmd</b> adds in parentheses its own
  estimate of the battery life (if discharging) or of the time required to
  charge the battery fully (if charging).

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-P </b>program,<b> --proxy </b>program</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the proxy program to execute when events are
      received. See above for information about the arguments supplied to this
      program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-T [</b>seconds<b>] , --proxy-timeout
    [</b>seconds<b>]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets a time-out for the proxy. Without this option (or with
      this option and a negative argument) <b>apmd</b> waits indefinitely for
      the proxy to finish. If the proxy enters an infinite loop or wait then the
      machine may appear to have crashed. If this option is given a positive
      integer argument then <b>apmd</b> will wait only that many seconds for the
      proxy to finish, after which it will log a warning, kill the proxy, and
      continue processing the event. The default is 30 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-V, --version</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prints the version of the <b>apmd</b> program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-W, --wall</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In addition to logging low battery status (as determined
      either by the <b>-w</b> level or by the firmware) using <b>syslog</b>(2),
      <b>apmd</b> will, given this option, also use <b>wall</b>(1) to alert all
      users. This is most useful if <b>syslogd</b>(8) is not set up to write
      ALERT messages to all users. If both methods are used, more warnings will
      be made during the critical time period.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c [</b>seconds<b>] , --check [</b>seconds<b>]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Controls how many seconds to wait for an event. Without
      this option (or with this option and a negative argument) apmd waits
      indefinitely for an event. If this option is given a positive integer
      argument then <b>apmd</b> will wait only that many seconds before checking
      the battery level and possibly sending out a warning, calling the proxy or
      making an entry in the log. The default is 30 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i, --ignore-bios-battery-low</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>apmd</b> to ignore a LOW BATTERY signal sent by
      the APM subsystem. Some firmware signals a low battery at the wrong time.
      Note that LOW BATTERY events may still be generated by <b>apmd</b> itself
      based on the warning level.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p </b>percent,<b> --percentage </b>percent</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Controls how often the battery status is logged. A new line
      is printed each time the battery content changes by <i>percent_change</i>
      if logging is enabled. The default is 5. Use a value greater than 100 to
      disable periodic logging of the battery level.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q, --quiet-bios-battery-low</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>apmd</b> not to generate a warning when a LOW
      BATTERY signal is received from the APM subsystem. The firmware on some
      machines produces an audible warning when power is about to be used up, so
      an extra warning may not be needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v [</b>level<b>] , --verbose [</b>level<b>]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The daemon can generate messages of varying degrees of
      unimportance. Each message is assigned one of the priority levels defined
      for the <b>syslogd</b>(8) subsystem, ranging from 0 (EMERG, least
      unimportant) to 7 (DEBUG, most unimportant). This option sets the
      threshold level above which messages are suppressed. Without an argument
      it increments the threshold by 1, thus making <b>apmd</b> more verbose.
      The default is 5 (NOTICE).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w </b>percent,<b> --warn </b>percent</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When the battery is not being charged and the battery
      content falls below the specified percent of capacity, and no such event
      has yet occurred in the current discharge cycle, <b>apmd</b> will log a
      warning at the ALERT log level to <b>syslog</b>(2) and generate a LOW
      BATTERY event. If the <b>-W</b> or <b>--wall</b> option was given, the
      daemon will also use <b>wall</b>(1) to alert all users of impending doom.
      The default warning level is 10. Use a negative value to disable this
      feature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h, --help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>apmd</b> to print a brief command summary and

This daemon supports all APM events described in the APM BIOS specification
  version 1.2; however it fails to support some of the advanced features of APM
  1.2, such as reporting the conditions of multiple batteries. (Multiple
  batteries are currently treated as if they were just one large one.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Estimates of charge and discharge rates and times can be very inaccurate.

There is no interaction yet with ACPI support as found in newer PC hardware.
