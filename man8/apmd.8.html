<p>APMD(8) APMD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apmd - Advanced Power Management (APM) daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apmd [ -TVWciqv ] [ -P program ] [ -T seconds ] [ -c seconds
] [ -p percent ] [ -v level ] [ -w percent ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apmd is an monitoring daemon for the Advanced Power
Management (APM) subsystem. The APM subsystem consists of
power-management hardware, firmware usually referred to as
the APM <br>
BIOS and a driver in the operating system kernel. The daemon
can execute a program (usually a shell script) when events
are reported by the APM subsystem, and will log, via
sys&acirc; <br>
logd(8), certain changes in power status. When the available
battery power becomes very low it can alert the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the APM subsystem notifies
the daemon of a pending suspend or standby request, apmd
will run a proxy program, log the event, sync(2) data to the
disk and then tell the APM <br>
subsystem to continue its operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preparations for power
management events are made mainly by the proxy program
specified using the -P option. The proxy program is invoked
with one or two arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start Invoked when the daemon
starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop Invoked when the daemon
stops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standby ( system | user ) <br>
Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that standby has been
initiated. The second parameter indicates whether firmware
(&quot;system&quot;) or software (&quot;user&quot;) was the
originator <br>
of the event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;standby&quot; mode
conserves power but leaves the machine able to respond
almost immediately to user activity. Most laptops
can&rsquo;t stay in standby mode on battery power <br>
for more than a few hours or a day. Normally, nothing
special needs to be done to prepare for &quot;standing
by&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend ( system | user ) <br>
Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that suspension has
been initiated. The second parameter indicates whether
firmware (&quot;system&quot;) or software (&quot;user&quot;)
was the origi&acirc; <br>
nator of the event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;suspend&quot; mode
aggressively conserves power. Usually this involves shutting
off power to all devices except the CPU core and memory,
which are put into a very low <br>
power mode. Most laptops can stay suspended, using battery
power alone, for several days. (&quot;Hibernation&quot; is a
kind of super-suspend, where all that state is written to
<br>
disk and the machine uses no power. Hibernation is treated
like suspension by the APM subsystem.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before suspending, PCMCIA
devices may need to be disabled using cardctl(8), and some
modular device drivers may need to be unloaded if they have
not been designed to sup&acirc; <br>
port power management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resume ( suspend | standby |
critical ) <br>
Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that computer has
resumed normal operation. The second parameter indicates the
kind of event from which the system is resuming. (A <br>
&quot;critical&quot; suspend is a suspension that the APM
subsystem performs in an emergency. Some kernels do not pass
this event to user space. If apmd receives the event, it
<br>
acknowledges the event and exits immediately without logging
or running the proxy program.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When resuming, PCMCIA devices
may need to be re-enabled using cardctl(8), and some modular
drivers may need to be reloaded. Note that in the case of a
critical suspend, <br>
the system state may not have been completely saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change power <br>
Invoked when the APM subsystem reports a change in power
status, such as a switch from mains to battery power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change battery <br>
Invoked when the APM subsystem reports that the charge of
one or more batteries is low. A few minutes of battery power
may remain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change capability <br>
Invoked when the APM subsystem reports some change in power
management capabilities. It may have been caused by
operation of a setup utility, or by the installation or <br>
removal of devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apmd emits various messages,
most of which are self-explanatory. Battery status log
entries contain three fields, separated by commas. The first
field indicates how full the <br>
battery is as a percentage of its capacity. The second field
indicates whether the battery is charging, not charging, or
discharging. When possible, apmd adds in parentheses <br>
its estimate of the rate of charging or discharging. The
third field indicates how much time the battery can or could
be used to power the computer. This information is
pro&acirc; <br>
vided by the APM subsystem. When possible, apmd adds in
parentheses its own estimate of the battery life (if
discharging) or of the time required to charge the battery
fully (if <br>
charging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-P program, --proxy program <br>
Specifies the proxy program to execute when events are
received. See above for information about the arguments
supplied to this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T [seconds] , --proxy-timeout
[seconds] <br>
Sets a time-out for the proxy. Without this option (or with
this option and a negative argument) apmd waits indefinitely
for the proxy to finish. If the proxy enters an <br>
infinite loop or wait then the machine may appear to have
crashed. If this option is given a positive integer argument
then apmd will wait only that many seconds for the <br>
proxy to finish, after which it will log a warning, kill the
proxy, and continue processing the event. The default is 30
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Prints the version of the apmd program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --wall <br>
In addition to logging low battery status (as determined
either by the -w level or by the firmware) using syslog(2),
apmd will, given this option, also use wall(1) to <br>
alert all users. This is most useful if syslogd(8) is not
set up to write ALERT messages to all users. If both methods
are used, more warnings will be made during the <br>
critical time period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c [seconds] , --check [seconds]
<br>
Controls how many seconds to wait for an event. Without this
option (or with this option and a negative argument) apmd
waits indefinitely for an event. If this option is <br>
given a positive integer argument then apmd will wait only
that many seconds before checking the battery level and
possibly sending out a warning, calling the proxy or <br>
making an entry in the log. The default is 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-bios-battery-low
<br>
Causes apmd to ignore a LOW BATTERY signal sent by the APM
subsystem. Some firmware signals a low battery at the wrong
time. Note that LOW BATTERY events may still be <br>
generated by apmd itself based on the warning level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p percent, --percentage percent
<br>
Controls how often the battery status is logged. A new line
is printed each time the battery content changes by
percent_change if logging is enabled. The default is 5. <br>
Use a value greater than 100 to disable periodic logging of
the battery level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet-bios-battery-low
<br>
Causes apmd not to generate a warning when a LOW BATTERY
signal is received from the APM subsystem. The firmware on
some machines produces an audible warning when power <br>
is about to be used up, so an extra warning may not be
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [level] , --verbose [level]
<br>
The daemon can generate messages of varying degrees of
unimportance. Each message is assigned one of the priority
levels defined for the syslogd(8) subsystem, ranging <br>
from 0 (EMERG, least unimportant) to 7 (DEBUG, most
unimportant). This option sets the threshold level above
which messages are suppressed. Without an argument it
incre&acirc; <br>
ments the threshold by 1, thus making apmd more verbose. The
default is 5 (NOTICE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w percent, --warn percent <br>
When the battery is not being charged and the battery
content falls below the specified percent of capacity, and
no such event has yet occurred in the current discharge <br>
cycle, apmd will log a warning at the ALERT log level to
syslog(2) and generate a LOW BATTERY event. If the -W or
--wall option was given, the daemon will also use <br>
wall(1) to alert all users of impending doom. The default
warning level is 10. Use a negative value to disable this
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Causes apmd to print a brief command summary and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This daemon supports all APM events described in the APM
BIOS specification version 1.2; however it fails to support
some of the advanced features of APM 1.2, such as reporting
<br>
the conditions of multiple batteries. (Multiple batteries
are currently treated as if they were just one large
one.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Estimates of charge and
discharge rates and times can be very inaccurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no interaction yet with
ACPI support as found in newer PC hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/apm_bios <br>

driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/apm <br>
