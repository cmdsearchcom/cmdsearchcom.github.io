<p>LDE(8) LDE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lde - a curses based file system viewer/editor for Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lde [options] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lde supports the three most popular file systems under Linux
at the time of its inception: ext2fs, minix, and xiafs. It
also has minimal support for msdos FAT file systems and a
<br>
nofs system in which case lde will function as a binary
editor. lde will attempt to automatically detect the file
system present on the device or file when it is started, if
it <br>
does not recognize the file system present on the device, it
will default to nofs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lde allows you to view and edit
disk blocks in hex or ASCII mode, view a block that contains
directory entries in a readable fashion, and view and edit
formatted inodes. lde is <br>
a great help when recovering deleted files (see doc/UNERASE
included with the lde distribution for more info).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device parameter is a
required option for lde. If omitted, it will print a warning
and refuse to start. The default mode for lde is to use a
curses interface; this can be <br>
overriden by some of the options listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --all <br>
Indicates that searches should be performed on the entire
disk. If -a is not specified, only data zones which are
marked not in use will be searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append <br>
Always append data to existing recovery file. If file does
not exist, create new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b (--block) block_number <br>
Format a single block as hex and dump it to standard output.
Specify -N to dump more than one block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B block_number <br>
Format all blocks after specifed block_number as hex and
dump to standard output. You can use -N to specify the
number of blocks to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--blanked-indirects <br>
Linux &lt;= 2.0.33 blanks all the indirect blocks when
truncating an inode. The inode still knows where the
1x/2x/3x indirect blocks are, but they&rsquo;re full of
zeros. This <br>
was a quick hack that works to restore small (&gt;12k
&lt;~500k) unfragmented files. It can be toggled via the
flags menu in the curses interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d block_number <br>
Dump a block&rsquo;s data to standard out as unformatted
binary data, ( like cat and faster than dd ). Specify -N to
dump more than one block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D block_number <br>
Dump all blocks after block_number to standard out as
unformatted binary data. You can use -N to specify the
number of blocks to dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --file recovery_file_name
<br>
Signal lde that we want to recover an inode to a file and
specify its name. You should specify the inode number to be
recovered with the -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --grep <br>
This option was designed to work with grep output. Grep a
file for lost data, pipe it through awk to yield just byte
offsets where the desired string lies. lde will then <br>
find the block corresponding to the desired offset and try
to find an inode which references this block. A sample
script is included with the lde distribution <br>
(crash_recovery/grep-inode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display extended help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i (--inode) inode_number <br>
Format and dump a single inode to standard output. Specify
-N to dump more than one inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I inode_number <br>
Format and dump all inodes after inode_number to standard
output. You can use -N to specify the number of inodes to
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--indirects <br>
Search the filesystem for blocks that looks like indirect
blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ilookup <br>
When searching, if we find a match, activate this flag to
lookup the inode which contains the matched block. It might
be easier and faster to do this with paper and use <br>
lde to interactively lookup only the blocks which have a
high probability of being the one you want. --ilookup can
also be used if the -B or -b option is specified to try <br>
to find an inode reference for the specifed blocks. When
using -B you may want to specify -N also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logtofile <br>
Debugging option. All of lde&rsquo;s messages will be dumped
to /tmp/ldeerrors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L --length <br>
Sets search string length (when using -T with a
filename).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N --limit <br>
Sets the number of blocks to display when using inode or
block dumps. If unspecified, default is to the end of the
filesystem ( -I -B -D ) or a single block ( -i -b -d ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N can also be used to specify a
block to begin/resume searching at. If unspecified in this
usage, it defaults to the first data zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O --offset <br>
Sets search string offset (when using -T with a filename).
The first byte in the template file is 0. When searching for
matches, the block will be examined starting at <br>
this offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, -r, --paranoid, --safe,
--read-only <br>
Open the device read only. Once set, this cannot be toggled
from within the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Turn off bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recoverable <br>
When searching, check that any inodes found contain a
deleted file that may be recovered. --ilookup must also be
activated for this option to have any effect. If no <br>
blocks are marked used by another inode, &quot;recovery
possible&quot; will be printed. If blocks are used by
another file &quot;recovery NOT possible&quot; will be
printed to the screen. <br>
You may still be able to get some data back even when it
reports that recovery is not possible. To get an idea of how
many blocks are in use, you will have to check its <br>
recoverablilty from lde via its curses interface (see
Recover mode below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --recoverable is used with -I
1 , it will check all the deleted inodes to see if they can
be recovered. The deletion time of the inode will be printed
to the screen if <br>
it is recoverable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s (--bs or --blocksize)
block_size <br>
Override blocksize which lde has detected. The blocksize may
have been read from the information (superblock) stored on
the disk or is what lde would consider the default <br>
blocksize for that type of filesystem (generally 1024
bytes). With this option, you can force lde to use a
different blocksize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--superscan <br>
Try to find ext2 signature on device. Supersedes functionaly
previously provided by find_ext2_fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S string <br>
Search disk for data (of questionable usefulness). This was
more for searching for a specific type of file (which is now
easier with -T ) rather than file data. To <br>
search for data or strings, use the --grep option. If you
insist on using -S which might be prudent occasionally, The
offset of the string must be specified with -O , and <br>
each block will only be inspected at that offset. If -O is
not specified, then 0 is assumed and the string must lie at
the start of a block. You can also specify the <br>
block to begin/resume searching from with -N which defaults
to the first data zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t fstype <br>
Override the auto-detect. fstype = {no, minix, xiafs,
ext2fs, msdos}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T type <br>
Search disk for data. This will search the start of each
block for numbers found in /etc/magic for certain types of
files, currently supported types are {gz, tgz, script}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: type tgz only finds tar
files that were created with gnu tar using its cfz options.
Use gz to find tar files that were compressed after creation
(or through a <br>
pipe?).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify a filename after
the -T option, it will read in the first block of the file
and search the filesystem for something which matches it
exactly. This may be <br>
useful for finding deleted copies of files (i.e.
you&rsquo;ve found version 1.0, but deleted version 1.5 and
now want to recover it) or with the -L and -O options, you
can pick <br>
off a few bytes and search for magic numbers in a certain
file type. When using the filename option, you really should
specify -L and -O or they will default to BLOCKSIZE <br>
and 0. You can also specify the block to begin/resume
searching from with -N which defaults to the first data
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --write <br>
Allow writes to the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CURSES INTERFACE <br>
The lde main screen displays the file system&rsquo;s
superblock in the workspace window. The header window will
be the same for all modes and indicates the program name and
version, <br>
the device, the current selected inode, and the current
selected block. There are also nine digits (and some extra
characters shifted-12456 on an American keyboard, sorry I
skip <br>
&rsquo;#&rsquo; which is reserved for another function)
&quot;0123456789!@$%^&quot; which indicate the status of a
bogus inode which can be used for file recovery. A digit
means the inode block entry <br>
has not been filled yet, a minus sign indicates that it has
been filled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While displaying the superblock,
you can use the following keys which are valid in most
modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b to enter block mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d display the directory contents
of the current inode or block</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f menu of runtime flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i to enter inode mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r to enter recover mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s return to super block mode (
only valid from other modes )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q to quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v view the error/warning log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^L to repaint the screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^O display menu of valid choices
( also F2 )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F1 display help screen ( also
M-h or ? )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I have tried to implement cursor
motion modes similar to both vi and emacs (M = meta key, ^ =
control key, ESC is recognized as the meta key, M-ESC is
recognized occasionally as <br>
ESC -- to exit menus).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vi emacs <br>
UP k ^P <br>
DOWN j ^N <br>
LEFT h ^B <br>
RIGHT l ^F <br>
PG_UP ^U M-v <br>
PG_DN ^D ^V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inode mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once in inode mode, the current
inode will be displayed in the workspace window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PG_DOWN <br>
Make next inode the current inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PG_UP Make previous inode the
current inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arrows Move cursor to different
fields of inode. Up and left go back one field, down or
right will go to the next field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0123456789!@#$%^ <br>
Add corresponding block entry from this inode to the
recovery list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B Switch to block mode,
examining block under cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Switch to block mode,
examining current block (displayed in status line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Copy inode to inode copy
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Edit inode information. Use
the cursor to select the field you want to edit, then hit
RET ^M ^J or e and a line will pop up at the bottom of the
screen, enter the <br>
new value here. Entering a blank line will leave the value
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dates can be entered in any
format other than the one displayed on the screen. The year
must be kept near the month and day. Use formats like
&quot;24SEP96 10:00:01&quot; <br>
or &quot;10:00:01 Sep 24, 1996&quot;. &quot;12/24/96&quot;
will probably default to the American interpretation
MM/DD/YY. I did not write the date parser, so I don&rsquo;t
want to hear any <br>
complaints about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Paste inode from inode copy
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Switch to recover mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Switch to recover mode, copy
current inode block information into recovery inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This will prompt the user to
enter a number and it will then make that the current inode.
The number may be entered as hexadecimal (leading
&rsquo;x&rsquo;, &rsquo;0x&rsquo;, or &rsquo;$&rsquo;), <br>
octal (leading &rsquo;&Acirc;&acute;), or decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M-b View inode in its raw block
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Block Mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In block mode, the current block
will be displayed in hexadecimal and ASCII. The numbers
along the left hand side of the screen are hexadecimal
offsets from the beginning of the <br>
block. As much of the block as possible will be displayed.
If the block is marked unused, the central row of
&rsquo;:&rsquo; will spell out NOT USED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PG_DOWN <br>
Display next chunk of this block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PG_UP Display previous chunk of
this block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Make next block the current
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Make previous block the
current block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arrow Move cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b View block under cursor. lde
will interpret the byte under the cursor as the start of a
block pointer (as if it were part of an indirect block).
This will be a <br>
two byte pointer for the minix file system, four bytes for
ext2fs and xiafs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B Interpret blocks under cursor
as a block pointer and make it the current block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Copy block to copy buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Dump block as a directory (see
directory popup description below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Edit the data in hex or ascii
mode. TAB ( ^I) switches between hex and ascii editing.
While in hex edit, the keys A-F and 0123456789 will not
perform their lde <br>
functions, but are used to enter new data. In ascii edit,
most keys (chars 32-126) are used to enter new data.
Characters outside this range must be entered in <br>
hex mode, they will be displayed on the ASCII display as a
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing will exit on write block
( ^W ) or a command which goes to another block or leaves
block mode. To discard your changes and re-read the block
use ^A or view <br>
another block and come back. You will always be prompted
[Yes/Discard changes/Continue edit] before a write occurs.
Select y to save the block to disk, d to dis&acirc; <br>
card your changes and re-read the data from disk, or c if
you made a mistake and want to go back and make some more
changes before saving this block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is probably a good idea to
unmount the file system before you do any writes to it. My
guess is that bad things will happen if you try to write the
inode/block <br>
tables while someone else is using the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I View inode under cursor. lde
will interpret the byte under the cursor as the start of an
inode pointer (as if it were part of an directory entry).
This will be a <br>
two byte pointer for the minix file system, four bytes for
ext2fs and xiafs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n, p Next/previous block in
file. If the displayed file is indexed by the current inode,
you can step to the next or previous block in the chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Paste block from copy
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Write the current block to the
recovery file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0123456789!@#$%^ <br>
tag this block to be recovered. Under Minix, this will
display nine blocks which represent the block pointers in an
inode. 0-6 are direct blocks, 7 is the indi&acirc; <br>
rect block, and 8 is the double indirect block. One day
there may be an option for more direct blocks to make
recovery easier. When a block is tagged, the status <br>
line will reflect this. To untag a block, go to recover mode
and set the block&rsquo;s pointer to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This will prompt the user to
enter a block number. The numbers may be entered in the same
format described in inode mode (decimal, hex, or octal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^R Look up inode which
references this block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ Search for a string. You will
be prompted for a case-sensative search string. The search
will proceede from the current block, if a match is found,
the block <br>
pointer will be advanced and the matching block will be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recover Mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In recover mode, the tagged
blocks are displayed and may be edited by hand. When they
are correct the user can dump the file. The user is prompted
for a filename which can be <br>
80 chars, the default file is
&quot;./RECOVER.file&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0123456789!@#$%^ <br>
Will prompt the user to enter a numeric value for the
specified block index. The format of the input should be the
same as that described in inode mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Check that all the blocks
marked for recovery are unused. Complete recovery will be
impossible if any blocks are reported in use, but you might
be able to salvage <br>
a large chunk of your file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Write out the recovered
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Unmark all blocks. The
recovery inode will be filled with zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory View</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accessable from inode and block
mode. In block mode, it formats the current block as a
directory entry with no syntax checking (i.e. it might not
really be a directory block). <br>
In inode mode, it uses the block pointers to determine what
to display. You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll
the display if there are too many entries to display at <br>
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d If the cursor is on a
directory, it will follow the link and display that
directory. Use D to do the same and set the current inode to
the new directory inode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Set the current inode to the
inode under the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Set the current inode and
immediately view it in inode mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n, p Next/previous block in
directory. If the directory being viewed is indexed by the
current inode, you can step to the next or previous block in
the chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES (command line) <br>
