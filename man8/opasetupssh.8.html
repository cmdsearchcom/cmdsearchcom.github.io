<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
opasetupssh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Linux or Switch) Creates SSH
keys and configures them on all hosts or chassis so the
system can use SSH and SCP into all other hosts or chassis
without a password prompt. Typi&acirc; <br>
cally, during cluster setup this tool enables the root user
on the Management Node to log into the other hosts (as root)
or chassis (as admin) using password-less SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax <br>
opasetupssh [-C|p|U] [-f hostfile] [-F chassisfile] [-h
&rsquo;hosts&rsquo;] [-H &rsquo;chassis&rsquo;] [-i
ipoib_suffix] [-u user] [-S] [-R|P]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF_CHASSIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
The Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset
provides additional flexibility in the translation between
IPoIB and management network hostnames. Refer to
&quot;Configuration <br>
of IPoIB Name Mapping&quot; section in the Intel(R)
Omni-Path Fabric Suite FastFabric User Guide</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opasetupssh provides an easy way
to create SSH keys and distribute them to the hosts or
chassis in the cluster. Many of the FastFabric tools (as
well as many versions of MPI) <br>
require that SSH is set up for password-less operation.
Therefore, opasetupssh is an important setup step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool also sets up SSH to
the local host and the local host&rsquo;s IPoIB name. This
capability is required by selected FastFabric Toolset
commands and may be used by some applica&acirc; <br>
tions (such as MPI).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opasetupssh has two modes of
operation. The mode is selected by the presence or absence
of the -U option. Typically, opasetupssh is first run
without the -U option, then it may <br>
later be run with the -U option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host Initial Key Exchange <br>
When run without the -U option, opasetupssh performs the
initial key exchange and enables password-less SSH and SCP.
The preferred way to use opasetupssh for initial key
exchange <br>
is with the -S option. This requires that all hosts are
configured with the same password for the specified
#8217#8220;user&rsquo;&rsquo; (typically root). In this
mode, the password is <br>
prompted for once and then SSH and SCP are used in
conjunction with that password to complete the setup for the
hosts. This mode also avoids the need to set up
rsh/rcp/rlogin <br>
(which can be a security risk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opasetupssh configures
password-less SSH/SCP for both the management network and
IPoIB. Typically, the management network is used for
FastFabric Toolset operations while IPoIB is <br>
used for MPI and other applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During initial cluster
installation, where the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric software
is not yet installed on all the hosts, IPoIB is not yet
running. In this situation, use the -i <br>
option with an empty string as follows:opasetupssh -i
&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This causes the last part of the
setup of SSH for IPoIB to be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refreshing Local Systems Known
Hosts <br>
If aspects of the host have changed, such as IP addresses,
MAC addresses, software installation, or server OS
reinstallation, you can refresh the local host&rsquo;s SSH
known_hosts <br>
file by running opasetupssh with the -U option. This option
does not transfer the keys, but instead connects to each
host (management network and IPoIB) to refresh the SSH keys.
<br>
Existing entries for the specified hosts are replaced within
the local known_hosts file. When run in this mode, the -S
option is ignored. This mode assumes SSH has previously <br>
been set up for the hosts, as such no files are transferred
to the specified hosts and no passwords should be
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically after completing the
installation and booting of Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric
software, opasetupssh must be rerun with the -U option to
update the known_hosts file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chassis Initial Key Exchange
<br>
When run without the -U option, opasetupssh performs the
initial key exchange and enables password-less SSH and SCP.
For chassis, the key exchange uses SCP and the chassis CLI.
<br>
During this command you log into the chassis using the
configured mechanism for chassis login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preferred way to use
opasetupssh for initial key exchange is with the -S option.
This requires that all chassis are configured with the same
password for admin. In this mode, <br>
you are prompted for the password once and then the
FF_CHASSIS_LOGIN_METHOD and SCP are used in conjunction with
that password to complete the setup for the chassis. This
method <br>
also avoids the need to setup the chassis password in
/etc/sysconfig/opa/opafastfabric.conf (which can be a
security risk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For chassis, the -i option is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chassis Refreshing Local Systems
Known Hosts <br>
If aspects of the chassis have changed, such as IP addresses
or MAC addresses, you can refresh the local host&rsquo;s SSH
known_hosts file by running opasetupssh with the -U option.
<br>
This option does not transfer the keys, but instead connects
to each chassis to refresh the SSH keys. Existing entries
for the specified chassis are replaced within the local <br>
known_hosts file. When run in this mode, the -S option is
ignored. This mode assumes SSH has previously been set up
for the chassis, because no files are transferred to the
spec&acirc; <br>
ified hosts and no passwords are required.</p>
