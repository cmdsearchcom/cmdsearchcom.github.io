<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hugectl - Control policy for backing text, data and malloc()
with hugepages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hugectl [options] command {arguments}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hugectl runs processes with a specific policy for backing
memory regions with hugepages. The use of hugepages benefit
applications that use large amounts of address space and
<br>
suffer a performance hit due to TLB misses. Policy is
enforced by libhugetlbfs and hugectl configures the
environment based on the options provided. Wall-clock time
or oprofile <br>
can be used to determine if there is a performance benefit
from using hugepages or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To effectively back text/data,
the target process must be relinked to align the ELF
segments on a hugepage boundary. The library also supports
more options for the control of <br>
memory regions than are exposed by the hugectl utility. See
the libhugetlbfs manual page for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect
what memory regions are backed by hugepages.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--text[=&lt;size&gt;],--data[=&lt;size&gt;],--bss[=&lt;size&gt;]
<br>
Back the text, data or BSS segments with hugepages,
optionally with pages of the specified size. To be
effective, the process must be relinked as described in the
HOWTO <br>
to align the ELF segments. It is possible to partially back
segments using the HUGETLB_FORCE_ELMAP environment variable
as described in the libhugetlbfs manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--heap[=&lt;size&gt;] <br>
Use the glibc morecore hook to back malloc() with hugepages,
optionally with pages of the specified size. Note that this
does not affect brk() segments and applications <br>
that use custom allocators potentially do not use hugepages
for their heap even with this option specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shm This option overrides
shmget() to back shared memory regions with hugepages if
possible. Segment size requests will be aligned to fit to
the default hugepage size region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--share-text <br>
Request that multiple application instances share text
segments that are backed with huge pages. This option sets
the environment variable HUGETLB_SHARE to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--thp Align heap regions to huge
page size for promotion by khugepaged. For more information
on transparent huge pages see
linux-2.6/Documentation/transhuge.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect how
hugectl behaves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-preload <br>
Disable any pre-loading of the libhugetlbfs library. This
may be necessary if only the heap is being backed by
hugepages and the application is already linked against the
<br>
library. hugectl may pre-load the library by mistake and
this option prevents that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-preload <br>
Force pre-loading of the libhugetlbfs library. This option
is used when the segments of the binary are aligned to the
hugepage boundary of interest but the binary is not <br>
linked against libhugetlbfs. This is useful on PPC64 where
binaries are aligned to 64K as required by the ABI and the
kernel is using a 4K base pagesize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-reserve <br>
By default, huge pages are reserved at mmap() time so future
faults will succeed. This avoids unexpected application but
some applications depend on memory overcommit to <br>
create large sparse mappings. For this type of application,
this switch will create huge page backed mappings without a
reservation if the kernel is recent enough to make <br>
this operation safe. Use this option with extreme care as in
the event huge pages are not available when the mapping is
faulted, the application will be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run <br>
Instead of running the process, the hugectl utility will
describe what environment variables it set for libhugetlbfs.
This is useful if additional environment variables <br>
are to be set and a launcher shell script is being
developed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--library-use-path <br>
By default, hugectl will use the version of libhugetlbfs it
was installed with, even if this is not in the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment. Using this option forces
hugectl to <br>
use the version of libhugetlbfs installed in the library
system path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--library-path &lt;path&gt; <br>
This option forces hugectl to use the libhugetlbfs libraries
within the given prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect the
verbosity of libhugetlbfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose &lt;level&gt;, -v <br>
The default value for the verbosity level is 1 and the range
of the value can be set with --verbose from 0 to 99. The
higher the value, the more verbose the library will <br>
be. 0 is quiet and 3 will output much debugging information.
The verbosity level is increased by one each time -v is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q The -q option will drecease
the verbosity level by 1 each time it is specified to a
minimum of 0.</p>
