<p>LOGROTATE(8) System Administrator&rsquo;s Manual
LOGROTATE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
logrotate &acirc; rotates, compresses, and mails system
logs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
logrotate [-dv] [-f|--force] [-s|--state file] config_file
..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that
generate large numbers of log files. It allows automatic
rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log files.
<br>
Each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when
it grows too large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, logrotate is run as a
daily cron job. It will not modify a log multiple times in
one day unless the criterion for that log is based on the
log&rsquo;s size and logrotate is <br>
being run multiple times each day, or unless the -f or
--force option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any number of config files may
be given on the command line. Later config files may
override the options given in earlier files, so the order in
which the logrotate config files <br>
are listed is important. Normally, a single config file
which includes any other config files which are needed
should be used. See below for more information on how to use
the <br>
include directive to accomplish this. If a directory is
given on the command line, every file in that directory is
used as a config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no command line arguments are
given, logrotate will print version and copyright
information, along with a short usage summary. If any errors
occur while rotating logs, logro&acirc; <br>
tate will exit with non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-?, --help <br>
Prints help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Turns on debug mode and implies -v. In debug mode, no
changes will be made to the logs or to the logrotate state
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Tells logrotate to force the rotation, even if it
doesn&rsquo;t think this is necessary. Sometimes this is
useful after adding new entries to a logrotate config file,
or if old <br>
log files have been removed by hand, as the new files will
be created, and logging will continue correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mail &lt;command&gt; <br>
Tells logrotate which command to use when mailing logs. This
command should accept two arguments: 1) the subject of the
message, and 2) the recipient. The command must <br>
then read a message on standard input and mail it to the
recipient. The default mail command is /bin/mail -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --state &lt;statefile&gt;
<br>
Tells logrotate to use an alternate state file. This is
useful if logrotate is being run as a different user for
various sets of log files. The default state file is <br>
/var/lib/logrotate.status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Prints a short usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+-v, --verbose <br>
Turns on verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
logrotate reads everything about the log files it should be
handling from the series of configuration files specified on
the command line. Each configuration file can set global
<br>
options (local definitions override global ones, and later
definitions override earlier ones) and specify logfiles to
rotate. A simple configuration file looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sample logrotate configuration
file <br>
compress</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/messages { <br>
rotate 5 <br>
weekly <br>
postrotate <br>
/usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd <br>
endscript <br>
}</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;/var/log/httpd/access.log&quot;
/var/log/httpd/error.log { <br>
rotate 5 <br>
mail www@my.org <br>
size 100k <br>
sharedscripts <br>
postrotate <br>
/usr/bin/killall -HUP httpd <br>
endscript <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/news/* { <br>
monthly <br>
rotate 2 <br>
olddir /var/log/news/old <br>
missingok <br>
postrotate <br>
kill -HUP &lsquo;cat /var/run/inn.pid&lsquo; <br>
endscript <br>
nocompress <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/log/*.log {}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first few lines set global
options; in the example, logs are compressed after they are
rotated. Note that comments may appear anywhere in the
config file as long as the <br>
first non-whitespace character on the line is a #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next section of the config
files defined how to handle the log file /var/log/messages.
The log will go through five weekly rotations before being
removed. After the log file <br>
has been rotated (but before the old version of the log has
been compressed), the command /sbin/killall -HUP syslogd
will be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next section defines the
parameters for both /var/log/httpd/access.log and
/var/log/httpd/error.log. They are rotated whenever it grows
over 100k in size, and the old logs <br>
files are mailed (uncompressed) to www@my.org after going
through 5 rotations, rather than being removed. The
sharedscripts means that the postrotate script will only be
run once <br>
(after the old logs have been compressed), not once for each
log which is rotated. Note that the double quotes around the
first filename at the beginning of this section allows <br>
logrotate to rotate logs with spaces in the name. Normal
shell quoting rules apply, with &rsquo;, &quot;, and
&nbsp;characters supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next section defines the
parameters for all of the files in /var/log/news. Each file
is rotated on a monthly basis. This is considered a single
rotation directive and if <br>
errors occur for more than one file, the log files are not
compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last section uses tilde
expansion to rotate log files in the home directory of the
current user. This is only available, if your glob library
supports tilde expansion. GNU <br>
glob does support this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please use wildcards with
caution. If you specify *, logrotate will rotate all files,
including previously rotated ones. A way around this is to
use the olddir directive or a <br>
more exact wildcard (such as *.log).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is more information on the
directives which may be included in a logrotate
configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compress <br>
Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip(1) by
default. See also nocompress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compresscmd <br>
Specifies which command to use to compress log files. The
default is gzip. See also compress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uncompresscmd <br>
Specifies which command to use to uncompress log files. The
default is gunzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compressext <br>
Specifies which extension to use on compressed logfiles, if
compression is enabled. The default follows that of the
configured compression command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compressoptions <br>
Command line options may be passed to the compression
program, if one is in use. The default, for gzip(1), is
&quot;-6&quot; (biased towards high compression at the
expense of <br>
speed). If you use a different compression command, you may
need to change the compressoptions to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy Make a copy of the log
file, but don&rsquo;t change the original at all. This
option can be used, for instance, to make a snapshot of the
current log file, or when some other <br>
utility needs to truncate or parse the file. When this
option is used, the create option will have no effect, as
the old log file stays in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copytruncate <br>
Truncate the original log file in place after creating a
copy, instead of moving the old log file and optionally
creating a new one. It can be used when some program
can&acirc; <br>
not be told to close its logfile and thus might continue
writing (appending) to the previous log file forever. Note
that there is a very small time slice between copying <br>
the file and truncating it, so some logging data might be
lost. When this option is used, the create option will have
no effect, as the old log file stays in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create mode owner group, create
owner group <br>
Immediately after rotation (before the postrotate script is
run) the log file is created (with the same name as the log
file just rotated). mode specifies the mode for <br>
the log file in octal (the same as chmod(2)), owner
specifies the user name who will own the log file, and group
specifies the group the log file will belong to. Any of <br>
the log file attributes may be omitted, in which case those
attributes for the new file will use the same values as the
original log file for the omitted attributes. This <br>
option can be disabled using the nocreate option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">createolddir mode owner group
<br>
If the directory specified by olddir directive does not
exist, it is created. mode specifies the mode for the olddir
directory in octal (the same as chmod(2)), owner spec&acirc;
<br>
ifies the user name who will own the olddir directory, and
group specifies the group the olddir directory will belong
to. This option can be disabled using the nocreate&acirc;
<br>
olddir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daily Log files are rotated
every day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dateext <br>
Archive old versions of log files adding a date extension
like YYYYMMDD instead of simply adding a number. The
extension may be configured using the dateformat and <br>
dateyesterday options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dateformat format_string <br>
Specify the extension for dateext using the notation similar
to strftime(3) function. Only %Y %m %d %H and %s specifiers
are allowed. The default value is -%Y%m%d except <br>
hourly, which uses -%Y%m%d%H as default value. Note that
also the character separating log name from the extension is
part of the dateformat string. The system clock must <br>
be set past Sep 9th 2001 for %s to work correctly. Note that
the datestamps generated by this format must be lexically
sortable (i.e., first the year, then the month then <br>
the day. e.g., 2001/12/01 is ok, but 01/12/2001 is not,
since 01/11/2002 would sort lower while it is later). This
is because when using the rotate option, logrotate <br>
sorts all rotated filenames to find out which logfiles are
older and should be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dateyesterday <br>
Use yesterday&rsquo;s instead of today&rsquo;s date to
create the dateext extension, so that the rotated log file
has a date in its name that is the same as the timestamps
within it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delaycompress <br>
Postpone compression of the previous log file to the next
rotation cycle. This only has effect when used in
combination with compress. It can be used when some program
<br>
cannot be told to close its logfile and thus might continue
writing to the previous log file for some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extension ext <br>
Log files with ext extension can keep it after the rotation.
If compression is used, the compression extension (normally
.gz) appears after ext. For example you have a <br>
logfile named mylog.foo and want to rotate it to
mylog.1.foo.gz instead of mylog.foo.1.gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hourly Log files are rotated
every hour. Note that usually logrotate is configured to be
run by cron daily. You have to change this configuration and
run logrotate hourly to be <br>
able to really rotate logs hourly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifempty <br>
Rotate the log file even if it is empty, overriding the
notifempty option (ifempty is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include file_or_directory <br>
Reads the file given as an argument as if it was included
inline where the include directive appears. If a directory
is given, most of the files in that directory are read <br>
in alphabetic order before processing of the including file
continues. The only files which are ignored are files which
are not regular files (such as directories and <br>
named pipes) and files whose names end with one of the taboo
extensions, as specified by the tabooext directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail address <br>
When a log is rotated out-of-existence, it is mailed to
address. If no mail should be generated by a particular log,
the nomail directive may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailfirst <br>
When using the mail command, mail the just-rotated file,
instead of the about-to-expire file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maillast <br>
When using the mail command, mail the about-to-expire file,
instead of the just-rotated file (this is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxage count <br>
Remove rotated logs older than &lt;count&gt; days. The age
is only checked if the logfile is to be rotated. The files
are mailed to the configured address if maillast and mail
<br>
are configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxsize size <br>
Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than size bytes
even before the additionally specified time interval (daily,
weekly, monthly, or yearly). The related size <br>
option is similar except that it is mutually exclusive with
the time interval options, and it causes log files to be
rotated without regard for the last rotation time. <br>
When maxsize is used, both the size and timestamp of a log
file are considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minsize size <br>
Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than size bytes,
but not before the additionally specified time interval
(daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). The related size <br>
option is similar except that it is mutually exclusive with
the time interval options, and it causes log files to be
rotated without regard for the last rotation time. <br>
When minsize is used, both the size and timestamp of a log
file are considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missingok <br>
If the log file is missing, go on to the next one without
issuing an error message. See also nomissingok.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monthly <br>
Log files are rotated the first time logrotate is run in a
month (this is normally on the first day of the month).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocompress <br>
Old versions of log files are not compressed. See also
compress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocopy Do not copy the original
log file and leave it in place. (this overrides the copy
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocopytruncate <br>
Do not truncate the original log file in place after
creating a copy (this overrides the copytruncate
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocreate <br>
New log files are not created (this overrides the create
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocreateolddir <br>
olddir directory is not created by logrotate when it does
not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodelaycompress <br>
Do not postpone compression of the previous log file to the
next rotation cycle (this overrides the delaycompress
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodateext <br>
Do not archive old versions of log files with date extension
(this overrides the dateext option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomail Don&rsquo;t mail old log
files to any address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomissingok <br>
If a log file does not exist, issue an error. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noolddir <br>
Logs are rotated in the same directory the log normally
resides in (this overrides the olddir option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nosharedscripts <br>
Run prerotate and postrotate scripts for every log file
which is rotated (this is the default, and overrides the
sharedscripts option). The absolute path to the log file
<br>
is passed as first argument to the script. If the scripts
exit with error, the remaining actions will not be executed
for the affected log only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noshred <br>
Do not use shred when deleting old log files. See also
shred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notifempty <br>
Do not rotate the log if it is empty (this overrides the
ifempty option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">olddir directory <br>
Logs are moved into directory for rotation. The directory
must be on the same physical device as the log file being
rotated, unless copy, copytruncate or renamecopy option <br>
is used. The directory is assumed to be relative to the
directory holding the log file unless an absolute path name
is specified. When this option is used all old versions <br>
of the log end up in directory. This option may be
overridden by the noolddir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postrotate/endscript <br>
The lines between postrotate and endscript (both of which
must appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
/bin/sh) after the log file is rotated. These directives
<br>
may only appear inside a log file definition. Normally, the
absolute path to the log file is passed as first argument to
the script. If sharedscripts is specified, whole <br>
pattern is passed to the script. See also prerotate. See
sharedscripts and nosharedscripts for error handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prerotate/endscript <br>
The lines between prerotate and endscript (both of which
must appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
/bin/sh) before the log file is rotated and only if the <br>
log will actually be rotated. These directives may only
appear inside a log file definition. Normally, the absolute
path to the log file is passed as first argument to the <br>
script. If sharedscripts is specified, whole pattern is
passed to the script. See also postrotate. See sharedscripts
and nosharedscripts for error handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">firstaction/endscript <br>
The lines between firstaction and endscript (both of which
must appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
/bin/sh) once before all log files that match the
wild&acirc; <br>
carded pattern are rotated, before prerotate script is run
and only if at least one log will actually be rotated. These
directives may only appear inside a log file defi&acirc;
<br>
nition. Whole pattern is passed to the script as first
argument. If the script exits with error, no further
processing is done. See also lastaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lastaction/endscript <br>
The lines between lastaction and endscript (both of which
must appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
/bin/sh) once after all log files that match the wild&acirc;
<br>
carded pattern are rotated, after postrotate script is run
and only if at least one log is rotated. These directives
may only appear inside a log file definition. Whole <br>
pattern is passed to the script as first argument. If the
script exits with error, just an error message is shown (as
this is the last action). See also firstaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preremove/endscript <br>
The lines between preremove and endscript (both of which
must appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
/bin/sh) once just before removal of a log file. The <br>
logrotate will pass the name of file which is soon to be
removed. See also firstaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotate count <br>
Log files are rotated count times before being removed or
mailed to the address specified in a mail directive. If
count is 0, old versions are removed rather than
rotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size size <br>
Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger then size
bytes. If size is followed by k, the size is assumed to be
in kilobytes. If the M is used, the size is in <br>
megabytes, and if G is used, the size is in gigabytes. So
size 100, size 100k, size 100M and size 100G are all
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sharedscripts <br>
Normally, prerotate and postrotate scripts are run for each
log which is rotated and the absolute path to the log file
is passed as first argument to the script. That <br>
means a single script may be run multiple times for log file
entries which match multiple files (such as the
/var/log/news/* example). If sharedscripts is specified, the
<br>
scripts are only run once, no matter how many logs match the
wildcarded pattern, and whole pattern is passed to them.
However, if none of the logs in the pattern require <br>
rotating, the scripts will not be run at all. If the scripts
exit with error, the remaining actions will not be executed
for any logs. This option overrides the noshared&acirc; <br>
scripts option and implies create option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shred Delete log files using
shred -u instead of unlink(). This should ensure that logs
are not readable after their scheduled deletion; this is off
by default. See also <br>
noshred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shredcycles count <br>
Asks GNU shred(1) to overwrite log files count times before
deletion. Without this option, shred&rsquo;s default will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start count <br>
This is the number to use as the base for rotation. For
example, if you specify 0, the logs will be created with a
.0 extension as they are rotated from the original log <br>
files. If you specify 9, log files will be created with a
.9, skipping 0-8. Files will still be rotated the number of
times specified with the rotate directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su user group <br>
Rotate log files set under this user and group instead of
using default user/group (usually root). user specifies the
user name used for rotation and group specifies the <br>
group used for rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tabooext [+] list <br>
The current taboo extension list is changed (see the include
directive for information on the taboo extensions). If a +
precedes the list of extensions, the current taboo <br>
extension list is augmented, otherwise it is replaced. At
startup, the taboo extension list contains .rpmsave,
.rpmorig, ~, .disabled, .dpkg-old, .dpkg-dist, .dpkg-new,
<br>
.cfsaved, .ucf-old, .ucf-dist, .ucf-new, .rpmnew, .swp,
.cfsaved, .rhn-cfg-tmp-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weekly Log files are rotated if
the current weekday is less than the weekday of the last
rotation or if more than a week has passed since the last
rotation. This is normally the <br>
same as rotating logs on the first day of the week, but it
works better if logrotate is not run every night.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yearly Log files are rotated if
the current year is not the same as the last rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/logrotate.status Default state file. <br>
/etc/logrotate.conf Configuration options.</p>
