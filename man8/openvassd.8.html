<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
openvassd - The Scanner of the Open Vulnerability Assessment
System (OpenVAS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
openvassd [-v] [-h] [-c config-file] [-D] [-R] [-P] [-q]
[-f]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
OpenVAS is a security auditing framework made up of several
modules. The Scanner, openvassd is in charge of executing
many security tests against many target hosts in a highly
<br>
optimized way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openvassd inspects the remote
hosts and attempts to list all the vulnerabilities and
common misconfigurations that affects them. Note that
openvassd will run in daemon mode by <br>
default (unless you specify -f as an option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c &lt;config-file&gt;, --config-file=&lt;config-file&gt;
<br>
Use the alternate configuration file instead of
/etc/openvas/openvassd.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
Make the scanner stay in foreground (non-daemon mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Writes the version number and exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show a summary of the commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The default openvassd configuration file,
/etc/openvas/openvassd.conf contains these options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plugins_folder <br>
Contains the location of the plugins folder. This is usually
/var/lib/openvas/plugins, but you may change this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logfile <br>
path to the logfile. You can enter syslog if you want the
openvassd messages to be logged via syslogd You may also
enter stderr if you want the openvassd logs to be
writ&acirc; <br>
ten on stderr. Because openvassd is a sensitive program, you
should keep your logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_hosts <br>
is maximum number of hosts to test at the same time which
should be given to the client (which can override it). This
value must be computed given your bandwidth, the num&acirc;
<br>
ber of hosts you want to test, your amount of memory and the
horsepower of your processor(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_checks <br>
is the number of plugins that will run against each host
being tested. Note that the total number of process will be
max_checks x max_hosts so you need to find a balance <br>
between these two options. Note that launching too many
plugins at the same time may disable the remote host, either
temporarily (ie: inetd closes its ports) or definitely <br>
(the remote host crash because it is asked to do too many
things at the same time), so be careful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">be_nice <br>
If this option is set to &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, then each child
forked by openvassd will nice(2) itself to a very low
priority. This may speed up your scan as the main openvassd
process <br>
will be able to continue to spew processes, and this
guarantees that openvassd does not deprives other important
processes from their resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_whole_attack <br>
If this option is set to &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, openvassd will
store the name, pid, date and target of each plugin
launched. This is helpful for monitoring and debugging
purpose, however <br>
this option might make openvassd fill your disk rather
quickly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_plugins_name_at_load <br>
If this option is set to &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, openvassd will
log the name of each plugin being loaded at startup, or each
time it receives the HUP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpfile <br>
Some plugins might issue messages, most of the time to
inform you that something went wrong. If you want to read
these messages, set this value to a given file name. If <br>
you want to save space, set this option value to
/dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi_path <br>
By default, openvassd looks for default CGIs in /cgi-bin and
/scripts. You may change these to something else to reflect
the policy of your site. The syntax of this option <br>
is the same as the shell $PATH variable: path1:path2:...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port_range <br>
This is the default range of ports that the scanner plugins
will probe. The syntax of this option is flexible, it can be
a single range (&quot;1-1500&quot;), several ports <br>
(&quot;21,23,80&quot;), several ranges of ports
(&quot;1-1500,32000-33000&quot;). Note that you can specify
UDP and TCP ports by prefixing each range by T or U. For
instance, the following <br>
range will make openvassd scan UDP ports 1 to 1024 and TCP
ports 1 to 65535 : &quot;T:1-65535,U:1-1024&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optimize_test <br>
By default, openvassd does not trust the remote host
banners. It means that it will check a webserver claiming to
be IIS for Apache flaws, and so on. This behavior might <br>
generate false positive and will slow the scan down somehow.
If you are sure the banners of the remote host have not been
tampered with, you can safely enable this option, <br>
which will force the plugins to perform their job only
against the services they have been designed to check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checks_read_timeout <br>
Number of seconds that the security checks will wait for
when doing a recv(). You should increase this value if you
are running openvassd across a slow network slink <br>
(testing a host via a dialup connection for instance)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_retry <br>
Number of retries when a socket connection attempt
timesout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">non_simult_ports <br>
Some services (in particular SMB) do not appreciate multiple
connections at the same time coming from the same host. This
option allows you to prevent openvassd to make <br>
two connections on the same given ports at the same time.
The syntax of this option is &quot;port1[, port2....]&quot;.
Note that you can use the KB notation of openvassd to
desig&acirc; <br>
nate a service formally. Ex: &quot;139, Services/www&quot;,
will prevent openvassd from making two connections at the
same time on port 139 and on every port which hosts a web
<br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plugins_timeout <br>
This is the maximum lifetime, in seconds of a plugin. It may
happen that some plugins are slow because of the way they
are written or the way the remote server behaves. <br>
This option allows you to make sure your scan is never
caught in an endless loop because of a non-finishing plugin.
Doesn&rsquo;t affect ACT_SCANNER plugins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanner_plugins_timeout <br>
Like plugins_timeout, but for ACT_SCANNER plugins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safe_checks <br>
Most of the time, openvassd attempts to reproduce an
exceptional condition to determine if the remote services
are vulnerable to certain flaws. This includes the
reproduc&acirc; <br>
tion of buffer overflows or format strings, which may make
the remote server crash. If you set this option to
&rsquo;yes&rsquo;, openvassd will disable the plugins which
have the <br>
potential to crash the remote services, and will at the same
time make several checks rely on the banner of the service
tested instead of its behavior towards a certain <br>
input. This reduces false positives and makes openvassd
nicer towards your network, however this may make you miss
important vulnerabilities (as a vulnerability affecting <br>
a given service may also affect another one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_enable_dependencies <br>
OpenVAS plugins use the result of each other to execute
their job. For instance, a plugin which logs into the remote
SMB registry will need the results of the plugin which <br>
finds the SMB name of the remote host and the results of the
plugin which attempts to log into the remote host. If you
want to only select a subset of the plugins avail&acirc;
<br>
able, tracking the dependencies can quickly become tiresome.
If you set this option to &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, openvassd will
automatically enable the plugins that are depended on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_mac_addr <br>
Set this option to &rsquo;yes&rsquo; if you are testing your
local network and each local host has a dynamic IP address
(affected by DHCP or BOOTP), and all the tested hosts will
be <br>
referred to by their MAC address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_iface <br>
Name of the network interface that will be used as the
source of connections established by OpenVAS. The scan
won&rsquo;t be launched if the value isn&rsquo;t authorized
according to <br>
(sys_)ifaces_allow / (sys_)ifaces_deny if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifaces_allow <br>
Comma-separated list of interfaces names that are authorized
as source_iface values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifaces_deny <br>
Comma-separated list of interfaces names that are not
authorized as source_iface values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sys_ifaces_allow <br>
Like ifaces_allow. Can&rsquo;t be overridden by the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sys_ifaces_deny <br>
Like ifaces_deny. Can&rsquo;t be overridden by the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hosts_allow <br>
Comma-separated list of the only targets that are authorized
to be scanned. Supports the same syntax as the list targets.
Both target hostnames and the address to which <br>
they resolve are checked. Hostnames in hosts_allow list are
not resolved however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hosts_deny <br>
Comma-separated list of targets that are not authorized to
be scanned. Supports the same syntax as the list targets.
Both target hostnames and the address to which they <br>
resolve are checked. Hostnames in hosts_deny list are not
resolved however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sys_hosts_allow <br>
Like hosts_allow. Can&rsquo;t be overridden by the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sys_hosts_deny <br>
Like hosts_deny. Can&rsquo;t be overridden by the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other options in this file
can usually be redefined by the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At log in attempt, openvassd
checks that the certificate has been signed by a recognized
authority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETWORK USAGE <br>
Bear in mind that OpenVAS can be quite network intensive.
Even if the OpenVAS developers have taken every effort to
avoid packet loss (including transparently resending UDP
pack&acirc; <br>
ets, waiting for data to be received in TCP connections,
etc.) so bandwidth use should always be closely monitored,
with current server hardware, bandwidth is usually the
bottle&acirc; <br>
neck in a OpenVAS scan. It might not became too apparent in
the final reports, scanners will still run, holes might be
detected, but you will risk to run into false negatives <br>
(i.e. OpenVAS will not report a security hole that is
present in a remote host)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users might need to tune OpenVAS
configuration if running the scanner in low bandwidth
conditions (low being &rsquo;less bandwidth that the one
your hardware system can produce) or <br>
otherwise will get erratic results. There are several
parameters that can be modified to reduce network load:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checks_read_timeout <br>
(Introduced in OpenVAS 0.99.4) The default value is set to 5
seconds, that can (should) be increased if network bandwidth
is low in the openvassd.conf or openvasrc config&acirc; <br>
uration files. Notice that it is recommended to increase
this this value, if you are running a test outside your LAN
(i.e. to Internet hosts through an Internet connec&acirc;
<br>
tion), to over 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_hosts <br>
Number of hosts to test at the same time (this value is set
by the OpenVAS GUI client or by .openvasrc) it can be as low
as you want it to be (obviously 1 is the minimum)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_checks <br>
Number of checks to test at the same time (this value is
also set by the OpenVAS GUI client or by .openvasrc ) it can
be as low as you want it to be and it will also <br>
reduce network load and improve performance (obviously 1 is
the minimum) Notice that the OpenVAS scanner will spawn
max_hosts * max_checks processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options might be using the
QoS features offered by your server operating system or your
network to improve the bandwidth use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not easy to give a
bandwidth estimate for a OpenVAS run, you will probably need
to make your own counts. However, assuming you test 65536
TCP ports. This will <br>
require at least a single packet per port that is at least
40 bytes large. Add 14 bytes for the ethernet header and you
will send 65536 * (40 + 14) = 3670016 bytes. So for <br>
just probing all TCP ports we may need a multitude of this
as nmap will try to resend the packets twice if no response
is received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A very rough estimate is that a
full scan for UDP, TCP and RPC as well as all NASL scripts
may result in 8 to 32 MB worth of traffic per scanned host.
Reducing the amount <br>
of tested part and such will reduce the amount of data to be
transferred significantly.</p>
