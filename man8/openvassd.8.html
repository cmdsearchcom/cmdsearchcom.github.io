<b>OpenVAS</b> is a security auditing framework made up of several modules. The
  Scanner, <b>openvassd</b> is in charge of executing many security tests
  against many target hosts in a highly optimized way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>openvassd</b> inspects the remote hosts and attempts to list all the
  vulnerabilities and common misconfigurations that affects them. Note that
  openvassd will run in daemon mode by default (unless you specify -f as an
  option).

      potential to crash the remote services, and will at the same time make
      several checks rely on the banner of the service tested instead of its
      behavior towards a certain input. This reduces false positives and makes
      openvassd nicer towards your network, however this may make you miss
      important vulnerabilities (as a vulnerability affecting a given service

      host. If you want to only select a subset of the plugins available,

  USAGE</a></h1>
Bear in mind that OpenVAS can be quite network intensive. Even if the OpenVAS
  developers have taken every effort to avoid packet loss (including
  transparently resending UDP packets, waiting for data to be received in TCP
  connections, etc.) so bandwidth use should always be closely monitored, with
  current server hardware, bandwidth is usually the bottleneck in a OpenVAS
  scan. It might not became too apparent in the final reports, scanners will
  still run, holes might be detected, but you will risk to run into <i>false
  negatives</i> (i.e. OpenVAS will not report a security hole that is present in
  a remote host)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Users might need to tune OpenVAS configuration if running the scanner in low
  bandwidth conditions ( <i>low</i> being 'less bandwidth that the one your
  hardware system can produce) or otherwise will get erratic results. There are
  several parameters that can be modified to reduce network load:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">checks_read_timeout</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(Introduced in OpenVAS 0.99.4) The default value is set to
      5 seconds, that can (should) be increased if network bandwidth is low in
      the openvassd.conf or openvasrc configuration files. Notice that it is
      recommended to increase this this value, if you are running a test outside
      your LAN (i.e. to Internet hosts through an Internet connection), to over
      10 seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">max_hosts</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Number of hosts to test at the same time (this value is set
      by the OpenVAS GUI client or by .openvasrc) it can be as low as you want
      it to be (obviously 1 is the minimum)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">max_checks</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Number of checks to test at the same time (this value is
      also set by the OpenVAS GUI client or by .openvasrc ) it can be as low as
      you want it to be and it will also reduce network load and improve
      performance (obviously 1 is the minimum) Notice that the OpenVAS scanner
      will spawn max_hosts * max_checks processes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Other options might be using the QoS features offered by your server
      operating system or your network to improve the bandwidth use.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is not easy to give a bandwidth estimate for a OpenVAS run, you will
      probably need to make your own counts. However, assuming you test 65536
      TCP ports. This will require at least a single packet per port that is at
      least 40 bytes large. Add 14 bytes for the ethernet header and you will
      send 65536 * (40 + 14) = 3670016 bytes. So for just probing all TCP ports
      we may need a multitude of this as nmap will try to resend the packets
      twice if no response is received.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A very rough estimate is that a full scan for UDP, TCP and RPC as well as
      all NASL scripts may result in 8 to 32 MB worth of traffic per scanned
      host. Reducing the amount of tested part and such will reduce the amount
      of data to be transferred significantly.
