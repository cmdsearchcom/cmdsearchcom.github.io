<p>LOCALEPURGE(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
LOCALEPURGE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
localepurge - reclaim disk space removing unneeded
localizations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
localepurge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
localepurge is a small script to recover disk space wasted
for unneeded locale files and localized man pages. It will
be automagically invoked by dpkg upon completion of any apt
<br>
installation run. You have to define the locale directory
names you want to keep from removal after each apt
installation run in the /etc/locale.nopurge configuration
file. <br>
Unless localepurge has been adequately configured, the
system&rsquo;s localization files won&rsquo;t be touched at
all. <br>
The contents of following directories will be affected from
removals: <br>
- /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML <br>
- /usr/share/gnome/help <br>
- /usr/share/locale <br>
- /usr/share/man <br>
- /usr/share/omf <br>
The localization files you actually need and which you want
to be preserved on your system can be easily configured by
running the following command: <br>
dpkg-reconfigure localepurge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The configurable options consist of toggling verbose output,
reporting a summary of freed space, and deletion of
localized manual pages in addition to locale files. All
actions <br>
are specified in the /etc/locale.nopurge configuration file.
<br>
For detailed debugging the commandline switch -debug or just
a short -d instead are available for usage. For verbose
output the commandline switch -verbose or just a short -v
<br>
can be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Word of CAUTION <br>
Please note, that this tool is a hack which is not
integrated with Debian&rsquo;s package management system and
therefore is not meant for the faint of heart.
Responsibility for its <br>
usage and possible breakage of your system therefore lies in
the sysadmin&rsquo;s (your) hands. <br>
Please definitely do abstain from reporting any bugs blaming
localepurge if you break your system by using it. If you
don&rsquo;t know what you are doing and can&rsquo;t handle
any resulting <br>
breakage on your own then please simply don&rsquo;t use it.
<br>
All locale directories containing a subdirectory named
LC_MESSAGES which are either commented out or not even
listed at all in /etc/locale.nopurge will be irreversibly
deleted. <br>
The only way to reinstall any lost locales is a complete
reinstallation of all the Debian packages containing them.
See /usr/share/doc/localepurge/reinstall_debs.sh for a
recipe. <br>
Alternatively you can reconfigure it with
dpkg-reconfigure(8) to prevent locale files from being
purged during subsequent runs of apt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOLVING PROBLEMS caused by
localepurge <br>
This program does interfere with the Debian package
management and does provoke strange, but usually harmless,
behaviour of programs related with apt/dpkg like
dpkg-repack(1), <br>
debsums(1), reportbug(1), etc. If you need to have any
package in its full integrity so that e.g. the formerly
mentioned programs work as designed by its author and as
expected <br>
by you, simply deinstall localepurge temporarily without
purging its configuration and reinstall the packages you
need in their fully integral state. When you are done with
what <br>
you needed the integral packages for simply reinstall
localepurge again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
Administrators of systems with short disk space should have
a look at both the deborphan and debfoster packages.
Especially debfoster can work wonders for your scarce disk
space!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
localepurge and its accompanying manual page was written for
the Debian GNU/Linux system by Paul Seelig
&lt;pseelig@debian.org&gt; with major contributions from
Gustavo Noronha Silva <br>
&lt;kov@debian.org&gt; and Francesco Potort&Atilde;&not;.
The author sincerely hopes that some day further development
of Debian&rsquo;s great package management system will make
localepurge fully <br>
obsolete.</p>
