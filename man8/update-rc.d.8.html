<p>UPDATE-RC.D(8) sysv-rc UPDATE-RC.D(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
update-rc.d - install and remove System-V style init script
links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
update-rc.d [-n] [-f] name remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-rc.d [-n] name
defaults</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-rc.d [-n] name
disable|enable [ S|2|3|4|5 ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
update-rc.d updates the System V style init script links
/etc/rcrunlevel.d/NNname whose target is the script
/etc/init.d/name. These links are run by init when it
changes run&acirc; <br>
levels; they are generally used to start and stop system
services such as daemons. runlevel is one of the runlevels
supported by init, namely, 0123456789S, and NN is the <br>
two-digit sequence number that determines where in the
sequence init will run the scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manpage documents only the
usage and behaviour of update-rc.d. For a discussion of the
System V style init script arrangements please see init(8)
and the Debian Policy Man&acirc; <br>
ual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLING INIT SCRIPT LINKS
<br>
update-rc.d requires dependency and runlevel information to
be provided in the init.d script LSB comment header of all
init.d scripts. See the insserv(8) manual page for details
<br>
about the LSB header format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run with the defaults
option, update-rc.d makes links named
/etc/rcrunlevel.d/[SK]NNname that point to the script
/etc/init.d/name, using runlevel and dependency information
<br>
from the init.d script LSB comment header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any files named
/etc/rcrunlevel.d/[SK]??name already exist then update-rc.d
does nothing. The program was written this way so that it
will never change an existing configura&acirc; <br>
tion, which may have been customized by the system
administrator. The program will only install links if none
are present, i.e., if it appears that the service has never
been <br>
installed before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Older versions of update-rc.d
also supported start and stop options. These options are no
longer supported, and are now equivalent to the defaults
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common system administration
error is to delete the links with the thought that this will
&quot;disable&quot; the service, i.e., that this will
prevent the service from being started. <br>
However, if all links have been deleted then the next time
the package is upgraded, the package&rsquo;s postinst script
will run update-rc.d again and this will reinstall links at
<br>
their factory default locations. The correct way to disable
services is to configure the service as stopped in all
runlevels in which it is started by default. In the System V
<br>
init system this means renaming the service&rsquo;s symbolic
links from S to K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script /etc/init.d/name must
exist before update-rc.d is run to create the links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOVING SCRIPTS <br>
When invoked with the remove option, update-rc.d removes any
links in the /etc/rcrunlevel.d directories to the script
/etc/init.d/name. The script must have been deleted <br>
already. If the script is still present then update-rc.d
aborts with an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-rc.d is usually called
from a package&rsquo;s post-removal script when that script
is given the purge argument. Any files in the
/etc/rcrunlevel.d directories that are not sym&acirc; <br>
bolic links to the script /etc/init.d/name will be left
untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISABLING INIT SCRIPT START
LINKS <br>
When run with the disable [ S|2|3|4|5 ] options, update-rc.d
modifies existing runlevel links for the script
/etc/init.d/name by renaming start links to stop links with
a <br>
sequence number equal to the difference of 100 minus the
original sequence number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run with the enable [
S|2|3|4|5 ] options, update-rc.d modifies existing runlevel
links for the script /etc/init.d/name by renaming stop links
to start links with a sequence <br>
number equal to the positive difference of current sequence
number minus 100, thus returning to the original sequence
number that the script had been installed with before
dis&acirc; <br>
abling it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both of these options only
operate on start runlevel links of S, 2, 3, 4 or 5. If no
start runlevel is specified after the disable or enable
keywords, the script will attempt to <br>
modify links in all start runlevels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n Don&rsquo;t do anything, just show what we would do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force removal of symlinks
even if /etc/init.d/name still exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Insert links using the defaults: <br>
update-rc.d foobar defaults <br>
The equivalent dependency header would have start and stop
<br>
dependencies on $remote_fs and $syslog, and start in <br>
runlevels 2-5 and stop in runlevels 0, 1 and 6. <br>
Remove all links for a script (assuming foobar has been
deleted already): <br>
update-rc.d foobar remove <br>
Example of disabling a service: <br>
update-rc.d foobar disable <br>
Example of a command for installing a system
initialization-and-shutdown script: <br>
update-rc.d foobar defaults <br>
Example of a command for disabling a system
initialization-and-shutdown script: <br>
update-rc.d foobar disable</p>
