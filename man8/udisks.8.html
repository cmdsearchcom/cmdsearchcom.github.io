<p>UDISKS(8) System Administration UDISKS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
udisks - Disk Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
udisks provides interfaces to enumerate and perform
operations on disks and storage devices. Any application
(including unprivileged ones) can access the udisksd(8)
daemon via <br>
the name org.freedesktop.UDisks2 on the system message
bus[1]. In addition to the D-Bus API, a library, libudisks2
is also provided. This library can be used from C/C++ and
any <br>
high-level language with GObjectIntrospection[2] support
such as Javascript and Python. udisks is only indirectly
involved in what devices and objects are shown in the user
<br>
interface. See these notes[3] for what is shown in GNOME
3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL <br>
By default, logged-in users in active log-in sessions are
permitted to perform operations (for example, mounting,
unlocking or modifying) on devices attached to the seat
their <br>
session is on. Access-control is fine-grained and based on
polkit(8), see the &acirc;Authorization Checks&acirc;
chapter in the udisks documentation for more information.
Note that the <br>
x-udisks-auth option can be used in the /etc/fstab and
/etc/crypttab files to specify that additional authorization
is required to mount resp. unlock the device (typically <br>
requiring the user to authenticate as an administrator).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRIVE CONFIGURATION <br>
At start-up and when a drive is connected, udisksd(8) will
apply configuration stored in the file
/etc/udisks2/IDENTIFIER.conf where IDENTIFIER is the value
of the Drive:Id <br>
property for the drive. If the file changes on disk its new
contents will also be applied to the drive. Typically, users
or administrators will never need to edit drive <br>
configuration files as they are effectively managed through
graphical applications such as gnome-disks(1). Manually
editing configuration files is however supported &acirc; the
file <br>
format is a simple .ini-like format (see the Desktop Entry
Specification[4] for the exact syntax). New groups and keys
may be added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATA group <br>
The ATA group is for settings that apply to drives using the
ATA command-set. The following keys are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StandbyTimeout <br>
The standby timeout. A value of zero means &quot;timeouts
are disabled&quot;: the device will not automatically enter
standby mode. Values from 1 to 240 specify multiples of 5
seconds, <br>
yielding timeouts from 5 seconds to 20 minutes. Values from
241 to 251 specify from 1 to 11 units of 30 minutes,
yielding timeouts from 30 minutes to 5.5 hours. A value of
<br>
252 signifies a timeout of 21 minutes. A value of 253 sets a
vendor-defined timeout period between 8 and 12 hours, and
the value 254 is reserved. 255 is interpreted as 21 <br>
minutes plus 15 seconds. Note that some older drives may
have very different interpretations of these values. This is
similar to the -S option in hdparm(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APMLevel <br>
The Advanced Power Management level. A low value means
aggressive power management and a high value means better
performance. Possible settings range from values 1 through
<br>
127 (which permit spin-down), and values 128 through 254
(which do not permit spin-down). The highest degree of power
management is attained with a setting of 1, and the <br>
highest I/O performance with a setting of 254. A value of
255 can be used to disable Advanced Power Management
altogether on the drive (not all drives support disabling
it, <br>
but most do). This is similar to the -B option in
hdparm(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AAMLevel <br>
The Automatic Acoustic Management level. Most modern
harddisk drives have the ability to speed down the head
movements to reduce their noise output. The possible values
are <br>
between 0 and 254. 128 is the most quiet (and therefore
slowest) setting and 254 the fastest (and loudest). Some
drives have only two levels (quiet / fast), while others may
<br>
have different levels between 128 and 254. At the moment,
most drives only support 3 options, off, quiet, and fast.
These have been assigned the values 0, 128, and 254 at <br>
present, respectively, but integer space has been
incorporated for future expansion, should this change. This
is similar to the -M option in hdparm(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WriteCacheEnabled <br>
A boolean specifying whether to enable or disable the Write
Cache. Valid values for this key are &acirc;true&acirc; and
&acirc;false&acirc;. This is similar to the -W option in
hdparm(8). This key <br>
was added in 2.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE INFORMATION <br>
udisks relies on recent versions of udev(7) and the Linux
kernel. Influential device properties in the udev database
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_SYSTEM <br>
If set, this overrides the value of the HintSystem
property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_IGNORE <br>
If set, this overrides the value of the HintIgnore
property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_AUTO <br>
If set, this overrides the value of the HintAuto
property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_CAN_POWER_OFF <br>
If set, this overrides the value of the CanPowerOff
property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_NAME <br>
The name to use for the device when presenting it in an user
interface. This corresponds to the HintName property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_ICON_NAME <br>
The icon to use for the device when presenting it in an user
interface. If set, the name must adhere to the
freedesktop.org icon theme specification[5]. This
corresponds to <br>
the HintIconName property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_SYMBOLIC_ICON_NAME <br>
The icon to use for the device when presenting it in an user
interface using a symbolic icon. If set, the name must
adhere to the freedesktop.org icon theme specification[5].
<br>
This corresponds to the HintSymbolicIconName property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDISKS_FILESYSTEM_SHARED <br>
If set to 1, the filesystem on the device will be mounted in
a shared directory (e.g. /media/VolumeName) instead of a
private directory (e.g. /run/media/$USER/VolumeName) <br>
when the Filesystem.Mount() method is handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID_SEAT <br>
The physical seat the device is attached to. If unset or set
to the empty string, &acirc;seat0&acirc; (the first seat) is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">API STABILITY <br>
udisks guarantees a stable D-Bus API within the same major
version and this guarantee also extends to the client-side
library libudisks2. Additionally, several major versions of
<br>
udisks can be installed and operate at the same time
although interoperability may be limited - for example, a
device mounted using the udisks N.x API may require
additional <br>
authorization if attempting to unmount it through the the
(N-1).x API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The udisks developers do not
anticipate breaking API but does reserve the right to do so
and if it happens, promises to bump the major version and
ensure the new major version of <br>
udisks is parallel-installable with any older major version.
However, note that programs, man pages and other artifacts
may change name (for example, adopt a &acirc;2&acirc;
suffix) to make <br>
room for the next major version. Therefore, applications can
not rely on tools like e.g. udisksctl(1) to be available.
Additionally, there is no guarantee that the options, <br>
command-line switches etc. of command-line tools or similar
will remain stable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, applications should
only use the D-Bus API, the libudisks2 library or tools such
as dbus-send(1) or gdbus(1) to interact with udisksd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDIENCE <br>
The intended audience of udisks include operating system
developers working on the higher-level parts of the
operating system, for example the desktop shell (such as
GNOME[6]) <br>
and disk management applications (e.g. GNOME&rsquo;s
Disks[7] application). Software on this level typically
depend on a specific (major) version of udisks and may even
have support <br>
for previous versions of udisks or alternative interfaces
performing the same role as udisks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While udisks indeed provides a
stable API and a clear upgrade path, it may not be an
appropriate dependency for third party applications. For
example, if the operating system <br>
switches to udisks version N.x and an application is still
using the udisks (N-1).x API, the application will not work
unless udisks (N-1).x is installed. While this situation is
<br>
still workable (since both udisks N.x and udisks (N-1).x can
be installed) it may not be desirable to ask the user to
install the old version - in fact, the operating system <br>
vendor may not even provide a packaged version of the old
version. Hence, if an application does not want to tie
itself to a specific version of the operating system, it
should <br>
not use udisks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Viable alternatives to udisks
are APIs that are guaranteed to be around for longer
time-frames, including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Low-level APIs
and commands such as e.g. sysfs[8], libudev[9],
/proc/self/mountinfo[10] and util-linux[11].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; High-level APIs
such as GVolumeMonitor[12].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, for desktop
applications it is a much better idea to use something like
GVolumeMonitor since it will make the application show the
same devices as the desktop <br>
shell (e.g. file manager, file chooser and so on) is
showing.</p>
