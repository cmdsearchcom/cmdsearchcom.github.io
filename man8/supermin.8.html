<p>SUPERMIN(8) Virtualization Support SUPERMIN(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
supermin - Tool for creating supermin appliances</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
supermin [-o OUTPUTDIR] --names LIST OF PKGS ... <br>
supermin [-o OUTPUTDIR] PKG FILE NAMES ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Supermin is a tool for building supermin appliances. These
are tiny appliances (similar to virtual machines), usually
around 100KB in size, which get fully instantiated on-the-
<br>
fly in a fraction of a second when you need to boot one of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Originally &quot;fe&quot; in
&quot;febootstrap&quot; stood for &quot;Fedora&quot;, but
this tool is now distro-independent and can build supermin
appliances for several popular Linux distros, and adding
<br>
support for others is reasonably easy. For this reason,
starting with version 4, we have renamed the tool
&quot;supermin&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this manual page
documents supermin 4.x which is a complete rewrite and quite
different from febootstrap 2.x. If you are looking for the
febootstrap 2.x tools, then <br>
this is not the right place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC OPERATION <br>
There are two modes for using supermin. With the --names
parameter, supermin takes a list of package names and
creates a supermin appliance containing those packages and
all <br>
dependencies that those packages require. In this mode
supermin usually needs network access because it may need to
consult package repositories in order to work out <br>
dependencies and download packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --names, supermin takes
a list of packages (ie. filenames of locally available
packages). This package set must be complete and consistent
with no dependencies outside <br>
the set of packages you provide. In this mode supermin does
not require any network access. It works by looking at the
package files themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By &quot;package&quot; we mean
the RPM, DEB, (etc.) package. A package name might be the
fully qualified name (eg.
&quot;coreutils-8.5-7.fc14.x86_64&quot;) or some
abbreviation (eg. &quot;coreutils&quot;). <br>
The precise format of the name and what abbreviations are
allowed depends on the package manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The supermin appliance that
supermin writes consists of two files called
&quot;hostfiles&quot; and &quot;base.img&quot; (see
&quot;SUPERMIN APPLIANCES&quot; below). By default these are
written to the <br>
current directory. If you specify the -o OUTPUTDIR option
then these files are written to the named directory instead
(traditionally this directory is named
&quot;supermin.d&quot; but you <br>
can call it whatever you want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases supermin can only
build a supermin appliance which is identical in distro,
version and architecture to the host. It does not do
cross-builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help <br>
Display brief command line usage, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude REGEXP <br>
After doing dependency resolution, exclude packages which
match the regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only used with
--names, and it can be given multiple times on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--names <br>
Provide a list of package names, instead of providing
packages directly. In this mode supermin may require network
access. See &quot;BASIC OPERATION&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warnings <br>
Don&rsquo;t print warnings about packaging problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outputdir <br>
Select the output directory where the two supermin appliance
files are written (&quot;hostfiles&quot; and
&quot;base.img&quot;). The default directory is the current
directory. Note that if <br>
this files exist already in the output directory then they
will be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--packager-config CONFIGFILE
<br>
Set the configuration file for the package manager. This
allows you to specify alternate software repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ArchLinux, this sets the
pacman configuration file (default
&quot;/etc/pacman.conf&quot;). See pacman.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Yum/RPM distributions, this
sets the yum configuration file (default
&quot;/etc/yum.conf&quot;). See yum.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save-temps <br>
Don&rsquo;t remove temporary files and directories on exit.
This is useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-installed <br>
If packages are already installed, use the contents (from
the local filesystem) instead of downloading them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this can cause
malformed appliances if local files have been changed from
what was originally in the package. This is particularly a
problem for configuration <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However this option is useful in
some controlled situations: for example when using supermin
inside a freshly installed chroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Enable verbose messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Print the package name and version number, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yum-config CONFIGFILE <br>
This is a deprecated alias for --packager-config
CONFIGFILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPERMIN APPLIANCES <br>
Supermin appliances consist of just enough information to be
able to build an appliance containing the same operating
system (Linux version, distro, release etc) as the host OS.
<br>
Since the host and appliance share many common files such as
&quot;/bin/bash&quot; and &quot;/lib/libc.so&quot; there is
no reason to ship these files in the appliance. They can
simply be read from <br>
the host on demand when the appliance is launched. Therefore
to save space we just store the names of the host files that
we want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some files which
cannot just be copied from the host in this way. These
include configuration files which the host admin might have
edited. So along with the list of <br>
host files, we also store a skeleton base image which
contains these files and the outline directory
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore the supermin appliance
normally consists of at least two control files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostfiles <br>
The list of files that are to be copied from the host. This
is a plain text file with one pathname per line. Directories
are included in this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paths can contain wildcards,
which are expanded when the appliance is created, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would copy all of the
&quot;*.repo&quot; files into the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each pathname in the file should
start with a &quot;/&quot; character. (In older versions of
febootstrap, paths started with &quot;./&quot; and were
relative to the root directory, but you <br>
should not do that in new files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base.img <br>
This uncompressed cpio file contains the skeleton
filesystem. Mostly it contains directories and a few
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All paths in the cpio file
should be relative to the root directory of the
appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that unlike
&quot;hostfiles&quot;, paths and directories in the base
image don&rsquo;t need to have any relationship to the host
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base.img.gz <br>
Since supermin &acirc;&yen; 4.1.4, any cpio image files may
be gzip-compressed to save disk space. &quot;hostfiles&quot;
cannot be compressed. The supermin program won&rsquo;t
create these files. <br>
You need to compress the output yourself, eg by doing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gzip -9 supermin.d/*.img</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECONSTRUCTING THE APPLIANCE
<br>
The separate tool supermin-helper(8) is used to reconstruct
an appliance from the hostfiles and base image files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program in fact iterates
recursively over the files and directories passed to it. A
common layout is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin.d/ <br>
supermin.d/base.img <br>
supermin.d/extra.img <br>
supermin.d/hostfiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then invoking
supermin-helper with just the &quot;supermin.d&quot;
directory path as an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this way extra files can be
added to the appliance just by creating another cpio file
(&quot;extra.img&quot; in the example above) and dropping it
into the directory. When the <br>
appliance is constructed, the extra files will appear in the
appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORIES BEFORE FILES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for supermin-helper to
run quickly, it does not know how to create directories
automatically. Inside hostfiles and the cpio files,
directories must be specified before <br>
any files that they contain. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr <br>
/usr/sbin <br>
/usr/sbin/serviced</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is fine to list the same
directory name multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEXICOGRAPHICAL ORDER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin-helper visits the
supermin control files in lexicographical order. Thus in the
example above, in the order &quot;base.img&quot; -&gt;
&quot;extra.img&quot; -&gt; &quot;hostfiles&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has an important effect:
files contained in later cpio files overwrite earlier files,
and directories do not need to be specified if they have
already been created in <br>
earlier control files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE OF CREATING EXTRA CPIO
FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can create a file like
&quot;extra.img&quot; very easily using a shell snippet
similar to this one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd $tmpdir <br>
mkdir -p usr/sbin <br>
cp /path/to/serviced usr/sbin/ <br>
echo -e &quot;usr0sr/sbin0sr/sbin/serviced&quot; | <br>
cpio --quiet -o -H newc &gt; extra.img <br>
rm -rf usr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice how we instruct cpio to
create intermediate directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINIMIZING THE SUPERMIN
APPLIANCE <br>
You may want to &quot;minimize&quot; the supermin appliance
in order to save time and space when it is instantiated.
Typically you might want to remove documentation, info
files, man <br>
pages and locales. We used to provide a separate tool called
&quot;febootstrap-minimize&quot; for this purpose, but it is
no longer provided. Instead you can post-process
&quot;hostfiles&quot; <br>
yourself to remove any files or directories that you
don&rsquo;t want (by removing lines from the file). Be
careful what you remove because files may be necessary for
correct <br>
operation of the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; supermin.d/hostfiles grep
-v &rsquo;^/usr/share/man/&rsquo; | <br>
grep -v &rsquo;^/usr/share/doc/&rsquo; | <br>
grep -v &rsquo;^/usr/share/info/&rsquo; &gt;
supermin.d/hostfiles-t <br>
mv supermin.d/hostfiles-t supermin.d/hostfiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KERNEL AND KERNEL MODULES <br>
Usually the kernel and kernel modules are not included in
the supermin appliance. When the appliance is instantiated,
the kernel modules from the host kernel are copied in, and
<br>
it is booted using the host kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin-helper is able to
choose the best host kernel available to boot the appliance.
Users can override this by setting environment variables
(see supermin-helper(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTING AND CACHING THE SUPERMIN
APPLIANCE <br>
For fastest boot times you should cache the output of
supermin-helper. See the libguestfs source file
&quot;src/appliance.c&quot; for an example of how this is
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENFORCING AVAILABILITY OF
HOSTFILES <br>
supermin-helper builds the appliance by copying in host
files as listed in &quot;hostfiles&quot;. For this to work
those host files must be available. We usually enforce this
by adding <br>
requirements (eg. RPM &quot;Requires:&quot; lines) on the
package that uses the supermin appliance, so that package
cannot be installed without pulling in the dependent
packages and thus <br>
making sure the host files are available.</p>
