Supermin is a tool for building supermin appliances. These are tiny appliances
  (similar to virtual machines), usually around 100KB in size, which get fully
  instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a second when you need to boot one of
  them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Originally &quot;fe&quot; in &quot;febootstrap&quot; stood for
  &quot;Fedora&quot;, but this tool is now distro-independent and can build
  supermin appliances for several popular Linux distros, and adding support for
  others is reasonably easy. For this reason, starting with version 4, we have
  renamed the tool &quot;supermin&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this manual page documents supermin 4.x which is a complete rewrite
  and quite different from febootstrap 2.x. If you are looking for the
  febootstrap 2.x tools, then this is not the right place.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BASIC_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#BASIC_OPERATION">BASIC
  OPERATION</a></h2>
There are two modes for using supermin. With the <i>--names</i> parameter,
  supermin takes a list of package names and creates a supermin appliance
  containing those packages and all dependencies that those packages require. In
  this mode supermin usually needs network access because it may need to consult
  package repositories in order to work out dependencies and download packages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Without <i>--names</i>, supermin takes a list of packages (ie. filenames of
  locally available packages). This package set must be complete and consistent
  with no dependencies outside the set of packages you provide. In this mode
  supermin does not require any network access. It works by looking at the
  package files themselves.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By &quot;package&quot; we mean the RPM, DEB, (etc.) package. A package name
  might be the fully qualified name (eg.
  &quot;coreutils-8.5-7.fc14.x86_64&quot;) or some abbreviation (eg.
  &quot;coreutils&quot;). The precise format of the name and what abbreviations
  are allowed depends on the package manager.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The supermin appliance that supermin writes consists of two files called
  &quot;hostfiles&quot; and &quot;base.img&quot; (see &quot;SUPERMIN
  APPLIANCES&quot; below). By default these are written to the current
  directory. If you specify the <i>-o OUTPUTDIR</i> option then these files are
  written to the named directory instead (traditionally this directory is named
  &quot;supermin.d&quot; but you can call it whatever you want).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In all cases supermin can only build a supermin appliance which is identical in
  distro, version and architecture to the host. It does <i>not</i> do
  cross-builds.

  APPLIANCES</a></h1>
Supermin appliances consist of just enough information to be able to build an
  appliance containing the same operating system (Linux version, distro, release
  etc) as the host OS. Since the host and appliance share many common files such
  as &quot;/bin/bash&quot; and &quot;/lib/libc.so&quot; there is no reason to
  ship these files in the appliance. They can simply be read from the host on
  demand when the appliance is launched. Therefore to save space we just store
  the names of the host files that we want.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some files which cannot just be copied from the host in this way.
  These include configuration files which the host admin might have edited. So
  along with the list of host files, we also store a skeleton base image which
  contains these files and the outline directory structure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Therefore the supermin appliance normally consists of at least two control
  files:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>hostfiles</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The list of files that are to be copied from the host. This
      is a plain text file with one pathname per line. Directories are included
      in this file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Paths can contain wildcards, which are expanded when the appliance is
      created, eg:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    would copy all of the &quot;*.repo&quot; files into the appliance.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each pathname in the file should start with a &quot;/&quot; character. (In
      older versions of febootstrap, paths started with &quot;./&quot; and were
      relative to the root directory, but you should not do that in new
    files).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>base.img</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This uncompressed cpio file contains the skeleton
      filesystem. Mostly it contains directories and a few configuration files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All paths in the cpio file should be relative to the root directory of the
      appliance.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that unlike &quot;hostfiles&quot;, paths and directories in the base
      image don't need to have any relationship to the host filesystem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>base.img.gz</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Since supermin &#x2265; 4.1.4, any cpio image files may be
      gzip-compressed to save disk space. &quot;hostfiles&quot; cannot be
      compressed. The supermin program won't create these files. You need to
      compress the output yourself, eg by doing:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 gzip -9 supermin.d/*.img
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="RECONSTRUCTING_THE_APPLIANCE"><a class="selflink" href="#RECONSTRUCTING_THE_APPLIANCE">RECONSTRUCTING
  THE APPLIANCE</a></h2>
The separate tool <i>supermin-helper</i>(8) is used to reconstruct an appliance
  from the hostfiles and base image files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program in fact iterates recursively over the files and directories passed
  to it. A common layout is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 supermin.d/
 supermin.d/base.img
 supermin.d/extra.img
 supermin.d/hostfiles
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then invoking supermin-helper with just the &quot;supermin.d&quot; directory
  path as an argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this way extra files can be added to the appliance just by creating another
  cpio file (&quot;extra.img&quot; in the example above) and dropping it into
  the directory. When the appliance is constructed, the extra files will appear
  in the appliance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DIRECTORIES BEFORE FILES</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order for supermin-helper to run quickly, it does not know how to create
  directories automatically. Inside hostfiles and the cpio files, directories
  must be specified before any files that they contain. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 /usr
 /usr/sbin
 /usr/sbin/serviced
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is fine to list the same directory name multiple times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>LEXICOGRAPHICAL ORDER</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
supermin-helper visits the supermin control files in lexicographical order. Thus
  in the example above, in the order &quot;base.img&quot; -&gt;
  &quot;extra.img&quot; -&gt; &quot;hostfiles&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This has an important effect: files contained in later cpio files overwrite
  earlier files, and directories do not need to be specified if they have
  already been created in earlier control files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>EXAMPLE OF CREATING EXTRA CPIO FILE</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can create a file like &quot;extra.img&quot; very easily using a shell
  snippet similar to this one:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 cd $tmpdir
 mkdir -p usr/sbin
 cp /path/to/serviced usr/sbin/
 echo -e &quot;usr\nusr/sbin\nusr/sbin/serviced&quot; |
   cpio --quiet -o -H newc &gt; extra.img
 rm -rf usr
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice how we instruct cpio to create intermediate directories.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MINIMIZING_THE_SUPERMIN_APPLIANCE"><a class="selflink" href="#MINIMIZING_THE_SUPERMIN_APPLIANCE">MINIMIZING
  THE SUPERMIN APPLIANCE</a></h2>
You may want to &quot;minimize&quot; the supermin appliance in order to save
  time and space when it is instantiated. Typically you might want to remove
  documentation, info files, man pages and locales. We used to provide a
  separate tool called &quot;febootstrap-minimize&quot; for this purpose, but it
  is no longer provided. Instead you can post-process &quot;hostfiles&quot;
  yourself to remove any files or directories that you don't want (by removing
  lines from the file). Be careful what you remove because files may be
  necessary for correct operation of the appliance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt; supermin.d/hostfiles \
 grep -v '^/usr/share/man/' |
 grep -v '^/usr/share/doc/' |
 grep -v '^/usr/share/info/' &gt; supermin.d/hostfiles-t
 mv supermin.d/hostfiles-t supermin.d/hostfiles
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="KERNEL_AND_KERNEL_MODULES"><a class="selflink" href="#KERNEL_AND_KERNEL_MODULES">KERNEL
  AND KERNEL MODULES</a></h2>
Usually the kernel and kernel modules are <i>not</i> included in the supermin
  appliance. When the appliance is instantiated, the kernel modules from the
  host kernel are copied in, and it is booted using the host kernel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
supermin-helper is able to choose the best host kernel available to boot the
  appliance. Users can override this by setting environment variables (see
  <i>supermin-helper</i>(8)).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BOOTING_AND_CACHING_THE_SUPERMIN_APPLIANCE"><a class="selflink" href="#BOOTING_AND_CACHING_THE_SUPERMIN_APPLIANCE">BOOTING
  AND CACHING THE SUPERMIN APPLIANCE</a></h2>
For fastest boot times you should cache the output of supermin-helper. See the
  libguestfs source file &quot;src/appliance.c&quot; for an example of how this
  is done.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ENFORCING_AVAILABILITY_OF_HOSTFILES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENFORCING_AVAILABILITY_OF_HOSTFILES">ENFORCING
  AVAILABILITY OF HOSTFILES</a></h2>
supermin-helper builds the appliance by copying in host files as listed in
  &quot;hostfiles&quot;. For this to work those host files must be available. We
  usually enforce this by adding requirements (eg. RPM &quot;Requires:&quot;
  lines) on the package that uses the supermin appliance, so that package cannot
  be installed without pulling in the dependent packages and thus making sure
  the host files are available.
