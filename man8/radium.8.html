<p>RADIUM(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual RADIUM(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
radium - argus record multiplexor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
radium [ options ] [ raoptions ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Radium is a real-time Argus Record multiplexor that
processes Argus records and Netflow records and outputs them
to any number of client programs and files. Radium is a
combina&acirc; <br>
tion of the features of ra.1 and argus.8, supporting access
for upto 128 client programs to argus records originating
from remote data sources and/or local managed argus data
<br>
files. Using radium you can construct complex distribution
networks for collecting and processing argus data, and
providing a single point of access to archived argus
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Designed to run as a daemon,
radium generally reads argus records directly from a remote
argus, and writes the transaction status information to a
log file or open socket con&acirc; <br>
nected to an argus client (such as ra(1)). Radium provides
the same data access controls as argus.8, including remote
filtering, source address based access control, indivual
<br>
oriented strong authentication and confidentiality
protection for the distributed data, using SASL and
tcp_wrapper technology. Please refer to the INSTALL and
README files for <br>
each distribution for a complete description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radium is normally configured
from a system /etc/radium.conf configuration file, or from a
configuration file either in the $RADIUMHOME directory, or
specified on the command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RADIUM SPECIFIC OPTIONS <br>
Radium, like all ra based clients, supports a number of ra
options including remote data access, reading from multiple
files and filtering of input argus records through a
termi&acirc; <br>
nating filter expression. radium(8) specific options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-B &lt;addr&gt; <br>
Specify the bind interface address for remote access.
Acceptable values are IP version 4 addresses. The default is
to bind to INADDR_ANY address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Run radium as a daemon. This
will cause radium to do the things that Unix daemons do and
return, if there were no errors, with radium running as a
detached process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;value&gt; <br>
Specify the source identifier for this radium. Acceptable
values are numbers, hostnames or ip address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;radium.conf&gt; <br>
Use radium.conf as a source of configuration information.
Options set in this file override any other specification,
and so this is the last word on option values. This <br>
file is read after the system /etc/radium.conf file is
processed. See radium.conf.5 for the configuration file
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Turn off Berkeley Packet
Filter optimizer. No reason to do this unless you think the
optimizer generates bad code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Override the persistent
connection facility. Radium provides a fault tolerant
feature for its remote argus data access facility. If the
remote argus data source closes, <br>
radium will maintain its client connections, and attempt to
reestablish its connection with remote source. This option
overrides this behavior, causing radium to terminate <br>
if any of its remote sources closes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;portnum&gt; <br>
Specifies the &lt;portnum&gt; for remote client connection.
The default is to not support remote access. Setting the
value to zero (0) will forceably turn off the facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S
&lt;host[:port][//full/path/to/argus.data.file]&gt; Attach
to a specific remote host to receive argus records. Append
an optional port specifier to attach to a port value other
<br>
than the default 561. Without the optional full pathname,
radium will continuously transmit a stream of real-time flow
records as they are received. With the optional <br>
filename, radium will open the argus datafile specified, and
stream the contents, closing the connection with the file
EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T threshold[smh] (secs) <br>
Indicate that radium should correct the timestamps of
received argus records, if they are out of sync by threshold
secconds. Threshold can be specified with the extensions
<br>
s, m, or h for seconds, minutes or hours. -X Clear existing
radium configuration. This removes any initialization done
prior to encountering this flag. Allows you to <br>
eliminate the effects of the /etc/radium.conf file, or any
radium.conf files that may have been loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Radium catches a number of signal(3) events. The three
signals SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM cause radium to exit,
writing TIMEDOUT status records for all currently active
trans&acirc; <br>
actions. The signal SIGUSR1 will turn on debug reporting,
and subsequent SIGUSR1 signals, will increment the
debug-level. The signal SIGUSR2 will cause radium to turn
off all <br>
debug reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
$RADIUMHOME - Radium Root directory <br>
$RADIUMPATH - Radium.conf search path
(/etc:$RADIUMHOME:$HOME)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/radium.conf - radium daemon configuration file <br>
/var/run/radium.#.#.pid - PID file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Run radium as a daemon, reading records from a remote host,
using port 561, and writing all its transaction status
reports to output-file. This is a typical mode. <br>
radium -S remotehost:561 -d -e &lsquo;hostname&lsquo; -w
output-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Collect records from multiple
argi, using port 561 on one and port 430 on the other, and
make all of these records available to other programs on
port 562. <br>
radium -S host1:561 -S host2:430 -de &lsquo;hostname&lsquo;
-P 562</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Collect records from multiple
Cisco Netflow sources, using the default port, and make the
resulting argus records available on port 562. <br>
radium -C -S host1 -S host2 -de &lsquo;hostname&lsquo; -P
562</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radium supports both input
filtering and output filtering, and radium supports multiple
output streams, each with their own independant filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are interested in
distributing IP traffic only (input filter) and want to
separate traffic into differing files based on traffic type,
this simple example separates ICMP <br>
traffic from other traffic. <br>
radium -w file1 &quot;icmp&quot; -w file2 &quot;not
icmp&quot; - ip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audit the network activity that
is flowing between the two gateway routers, whose ethernet
addresses are 00:08:03:2D:42:01 and 00:00:0C:18:29:F1. Make
records available to other <br>
programs through port 430/tcp. <br>
radium -S source -P 430 - ether host (0:8:3:2d:42:1 and
0:0:c:18:29:f1) &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process argus records from a
remote source only between 9am and 5pm every day and provide
access to this stream on port 562. <br>
radium -S remotehost -t 9-17 -P 562</p>
