<p>AVR-EVTD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
AVR-EVTD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
avr-evtd - Linkstation AVR Event daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
avr-evtd [ -d /dev/tty ] [i | c | v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
avr-evtd is a simple and small user space interface to the
Linkstation AVR micro-controller. It doesn&rsquo;t have a
lot of special features, but it&rsquo;s main task is to
provide &rsquo;keep- <br>
alive&rsquo; messages to the Linkstation&rsquo;s on-board
AVR device. This device controls/monitors the fan, various
LEDs, timed power up and two buttons. This daemon provides
the neces&acirc; <br>
sary initialization to the device and also stimulates the
LEDs depending on various fault conditions. It also monitors
a power button (located at the front) and a reset button
<br>
(located at the rear).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avr-evtd searches for a
configuration file located within /etc/melco at start-up
time. If this file does not exist, then avr-evtd reverts to
reading the file located at <br>
/etc/default/avr-evtd. Additionally, avr-evtd may, if
requested, periodically check the root (Under user control
and could be /dev/hda1) partition and the user working
partition <br>
(For example, /dev/hda3) to ensure they are mounted. Also,
if requested, it will determine if sufficient space remains
and if not then the AVR is requested to illuminate the <br>
DISK LED. This periodic checking also takes place on the
configuration files. If they are deemed to have been
updated, then the daemon will respond accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any failures are normally routed
through the log files. With timed shutdown/power up, a
warning will be broadcast to all users (console message)
when within 5 or less minutes of <br>
power off. Also, fan failure alerts will be broadcast in
this fashion. Failure to determine mounted working partition
will result in the DIAG LED flashing three times,
repeat&acirc; <br>
edly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new feature of this daemon is
the ability to code events for single or groups of days.
This allows the user to add any number of power-on/off
events as required. This also <br>
has the added benefit of being able to shut down the device
for longer periods. The internal AVR timer has a 12-bit
resolution timer which can power up the Linkstation from a
<br>
maximum of a sixty eight hour sleep: from time of
invocation. The AVR is updated again at time of power
down/shutdown to re-validate the timer, in case of time
updates (either <br>
by user or NTP). This will also preserve the 68 hour sleep
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d /dev/tty Specifies the UART device used to communicate
with the AVR. This is normally taken care of by the scripts
but can be specified in the configuration file. See below
<br>
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Don&rsquo;t fork, i.e. run in
the foreground (debug use only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Returns the port memory
location for the device specified by -d /dev/tty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display daemon version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The avr-evtd configuration file is the fallback file in the
event that the stock melco files do not exist. The file is
read at initial start-up in order to determine if timed <br>
shutdown is required and if the disk usage is to be
monitored. The file should be always located within the
/etc/default directory and a sample file is provided. The
file for&acirc; <br>
mat is similar to other Unix configuration files - comments
begin with a # character and extend to the end of the line;
blank lines are ignored. Configuration commands consist <br>
of an initial keyword followed by an argument. Arguments may
be strings or times written in HH:MM (UTC) format. Optional
arguments are delimited by [ ] in the following <br>
descriptions, while alternatives are separated by |.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG <br>
[ON | OFF]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is reserved for admin only.
Allows logging of certain information. A log file will be
maintained in /etc/avr-evtd logging events and when run from
command line, the <br>
process will log data to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMER <br>
[YES | NO]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timer command informs the
daemon if it has to provide time controlled shutdown and
power up. If TIMER is set to NO then this function is not
available and the commands <br>
SHUTDOWN and POWERON are ignored and have no effect. The
same applies if any day events are specified and the TIMER
is set to NO then these events will also be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE <br>
[/dev/tty]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This informs the AVR which UART
to use when communicating with the AVR. The communication
path between the micro-controller and this daemon is via a
serial link. This key&acirc; <br>
word is not for general use and is provided to allow
advanced users the option of overriding automatic
configuration. This would normally be set to /dev/ttyS1 but
on some <br>
systems it is /dev/ttyS0. The selection of the correct port
is performed by the daemon start script and is not normally
required to be altered.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[&lt;day&gt;|&lt;day&gt;-&lt;day&gt;]
<br>
[ON=HH:MM | ON= | OFF=HH:MM | OFF=]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This defines events for either a
single day or group of days, &rsquo;-&rsquo; separator. Any
number of ON and OFF events can be specified and can be
extended over additional lines. <br>
&lt;day&gt; can be any number of days of the week specified
as either SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THR, FRI, and SAT. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MON-WED=ON=09:00,OFF=23:00 <br>
THR=ON=09:00 <br>
FRI=OFF=01:00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the first power
on event is Monday at 09:00. At 23:00 the Linkstation will
power down. This is repeated for Tuesday and Wednesday. On
Thursday, the <br>
Linkstation will power on at 09:00 and will power off on
Friday at 01:00. The unit will then remain off for Saturday
and Sunday and not power up again till 09:00 on Monday. <br>
The unit is capable of sleeping for no more than 68 hours
(due to the resolution of the internal timer). Again, this
time MUST be specified in UTC format and follow HH:MM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Five minutes before power off is
required, a message is broadcast to all console users. At
shutdown, an event message is sent to the event script. See
below for more <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHUTDOWN <br>
[HH:MM]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the time that the
Linkstation will be powered down. This time MUST be
specified in UTC and must follow the format HH:MM. If the
user alters this configura&acirc; <br>
tion file whilst the daemon is running, then the change will
be seen and the new settings will be implemented. If the new
time entered is passed the current time, then the <br>
shutdown time will be for the following day. If single or
multiple day events are specified, then this becomes the
default power down time for any undefined days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POWERON <br>
[HH:MM]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the time that the
Linkstation will be automatically powered up; as long as now
unexpected power outage occurs. Again, if this time is less
than the SHUTDOWN <br>
time then it is for the following day. Both the TIMER set to
ON and the SHUTDOWN and the POWERON times are valid will
timed shutdown/power up be enabled. This will be <br>
reported in the message log along with any errors in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If single or multiple day events
are specified, then this becomes the default power on time
for any undefined days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISKCHECK <br>
[OFF | 0..100]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is set to OFF or 0
(zero) then disk usage/monitoring is disabled. Set to a
value between 0 and 100% to monitor disk usage. If disk
usage is above this specified <br>
value, then the DISK LED will be illuminated. At the same
time, a disk full event message will be sent to the event
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROOT [hda1..9]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No default. This allows the root
partition to be defined by the user. No syntax checking is
performed on this entry or validation of the partition
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORK [hda1..9]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No default. This allows the
working partition to be defined by the user. Again, no
syntax checking is performed on this entry or validation of
the partition ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFRESH <br>
[1..300]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This defaults to 40. This
provides control over the rate (in seconds) that the daemon
checks the system for changes and refreshes the AVR. Any
number between 1 and 300 can <br>
be entered. Anything less than the default will result in
higher impact on the system: more CPU usage. Higher times
will result with slower response to configuration file <br>
changes but this may not be an issue with most users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOLD [1..9]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This defaults to 3. This
provides control over the time (in seconds) that the user
needs to hold either the reset of the power button in for a
reset event (reset button) or <br>
power off event (power button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISKNAG <br>
[ON | OFF]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default if off. This provides
the user control over the disk full event. The default is
that once detected, just a single event is triggered. If
required, setting this to <br>
on will generate repeated events, at the frequency of
REFRESH until the disk is no longer deemed full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FANSTOP <br>
[OFF | 0..60]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 30 seconds. This is
the time, from report of fan failure in which the daemon
will generate a fan failure event call to the event script.
This allows the user to <br>
act accordingly. At present, the script is setup to power
down. This can be changed to an e-mail event prior to
shutdown if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if a user has decided
to remove the fan then this can be set to OFF to prevent
shutdown from occuring. It must be stressed that alternative
cooling must be <br>
sourced if this option is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUTTON OPERATION <br>
All events, whether mechanical button operation, or software
reset/shutdown actions are routed through an event script
located at /etc/avr-evtd/EventSCript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POWER <br>
On press, a button event message is sent. On release,
another event message is sent. If the button is held in for
more than HOLD seconds, then a shutdown event request is
<br>
sent. If the button is pressed twice within a period of one
second, then a reset request event is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the power button is pressed
during the five minute timed shutdown warning, then the
shutdown time is increased by five minutes. Multiple presses
will keep increasing the <br>
time by five minutes (to a maximum pause of fifty minutes).
This provides the user with the ability to carry on working
before timed shutdown is finally activated; careful <br>
here as repeated presses maybe seen as a reboot request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESET <br>
On press, a button event message is sent. On release,
another event message is sent. If the button is held in for
more than twenty seconds, then a EM-Mode event request is
<br>
sent. If the button is pressed twice within a period of one
second, then a special event is sent which in the default
state will launch the telnet daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MESSAGE EVENTS <br>
The event system has been modified such that 99% of the
daemon event system is pushed through the event script. A
third parameter is supplied by the daemon out to the script
<br>
detailing information relevant to the generated message. For
example, for a disk full message, the third parameter would
detail the percentage disk space used (worst of the two <br>
monitored partitions) and when this is cleared, then this
parameter would be cleared to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 User has requested (by double
press of reset button) to, with the first press, launch the
telnet daemon, or other client as specified in the
EventScript. The script also <br>
establishes a static IP to an alias Ethernet device :EM at
192.168.11.150. If this IP is already in-use, then it will
not be created. If the Ethernet is not running, then <br>
an alternative Ethernet configuration file is loaded
providing a static IP at 192.168.11.150. and also a DHCP
provided IP. On the THIRD double press, then a known set of
<br>
group and user password files are copied to /etc. Prior to
the transfer, the relevant original files are copied to .em.
A file, recovery.tar, is extracted and the LEDs are <br>
flashed to indicate this new mode. A user can now gain root
access using the password emergency and gain access via the
telnet port 1234 to their box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 AVR micro-controller has
requested a reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Shutdown request from the
shutdown timer event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Power button has been released
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Power button has been pressed
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Reset button (rear of unit)
has been released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Reset button has been
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 User has requested (by holding
power button for more than HOLD seconds) to shutdown the
unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 User has requested (by double
press of the power button) to reset the unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 Disk usage greater than
DISKCHECK. Parameter 3 set to percentage used or zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F Fan has been stationary for
FANSTOP seconds. Parameter 3 is set to 4 when cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E EM-Mode has been selected. The
EM-Mode sequence is written to the desired flash location
and the system is issued a reboot request. EM-Mode is an
emergency boot mode that <br>
for the Linkstation it boots from an image in flash and
rebuilds files on the disk. This should only be used by
those who know what will happen to their disks when this
<br>
Mode is selected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S The system will shutdown in
less than five minutes warning. Parameter 3 indicates
shutdown delay on power press.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D Error message handler.
Parameter 3 indicates error number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR CODES <br>
The following error messages maybe displayed in the log
files during operation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 No stock or avr-evtd
configuration files were located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Power off time greater than
that supported by the AVR. As this is calculated at the time
the timer is established, this fault may clear at shutdown
as timers are re-vali&acirc; <br>
dated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Timer declaration error in
/etc/default/avr-evtd configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Error in stock configuration
file</p>
