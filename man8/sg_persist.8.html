<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_persist - use SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE command to access
registrations and reservations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_persist [OPTIONS] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist [OPTIONS]
--device=DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist --help |
--version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility allows Persistent reservations and
registrations to be queried and changed. Persistent
reservations and registrations are queried by sub-commands
(called &quot;service <br>
actions&quot; in SPC-4) of the SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE IN
(PRIN) command. Persistent reservations and registrations
are changed by sub-commands of the SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE
OUT <br>
(PROUT) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a two stage process to
obtain a persistent reservation. First an application (an
I_T nexus in standard&rsquo;s jargon) must register a
reservation key. If that is accepted <br>
(and it should be unless some other I_T nexus has registered
that key) then the application can try and reserve the
device. The reserve operation must specify the reservation
<br>
key and a &quot;type&quot; (see the --prout-type=TYPE
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is relatively safe to query
the state of Persistent reservations and registrations. With
no options this utility defaults to the READ KEYS
sub-command of the PRIN command. <br>
Other PRIN sub-commands are READ RESERVATION, REPORT
CAPABILITIES and READ FULL STATUS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before trying to change
Persistent reservations and registrations users should be
aware of what they are doing. The relevant sections of the
SCSI Primary Commands document (i.e. <br>
SPC-4 whose most recent draft is revision 20 dated 22 May
2009) are sections 5.7 (titled &quot;Reservations&quot;),
6.13 (for the PRIN command) and 6.14 (for the PROUT
command). To safe&acirc; <br>
guard against accidental use, the --out option must be given
when a PROUT sub-command (e.g. --register) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The older SCSI RESERVE and
RELEASE commands (both 6 and 10 byte variants) are not
supported by this utility. In SPC-3, RESERVE and RELEASE are
deprecated, replaced by Persistent <br>
Reservations. RESERVE and RELEASE have been removed from
SPC-4 and Annex B is provided showing how to convert to
persistent reservation commands. See a utility called
&rsquo;scsires&rsquo; <br>
for support of the SCSI RESERVE and RELEASE commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DEVICE is required by all
variants of this utility apart from --help. The DEVICE can
be given either as an argument (typically but not
necessarily the last one) or via the <br>
--device=DEVICE option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPC-4 does not use the term
&quot;sub-command&quot;. It uses the term &quot;service
action&quot; for this and for part of a field&rsquo;s name
in the parameter block associated with the PROUT command
<br>
(i.e. &quot;service action reservation key&quot;). To lessen
the potential confusion the term &quot;sub-command&quot; has
been introduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. The following options are sorted in alphabetical
order, based on their long option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --alloc-length=LEN <br>
specify the allocation length of the PRIN command. LEN is a
hex value. By default this value is set to the size of the
data-in buffer (8192). This parameter is of use <br>
for verification that response to PRIN commands with various
allocation lengths is per section 4.3.5.6 of SPC-4 revision
18. Valid LEN values are 0-8192.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --clear <br>
Clear is a sub-command of the PROUT command. It releases the
persistent reservation (if any) and clears all registrations
from the device. It is required to supply a <br>
reservation key that is registered for this I_T_L nexus
(identified by --param-rk=RK).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --device=DEVICE <br>
DEVICE to send SCSI commands to. The DEVICE can either be
provided via this option or via a freestanding argument. For
example, these two: &rsquo;sg_persist
--device=/dev/sg2&rsquo; <br>
and &rsquo;sg_persist /dev/sg2&rsquo; are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
the response to a valid PRIN sub-command will be output in
hexadecimal. By default (i.e. without this option) if the
PRIN sub-command is recognised then the response will <br>
be decoded as per SPC-4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --in <br>
specify that a SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE IN command is
required. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-inquiry <br>
the default action is to do a standard SCSI INQUIRY command
and output make, product and revision strings plus the
peripheral device type prior to executing a PRIN or <br>
PROUT command. With this option the INQUIRY command is
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --out <br>
specify that a SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT command is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y, --param-alltgpt <br>
set the &rsquo;all target ports&rsquo; (ALL_TG_PT) flag in
the parameter block of the PROUT command. Only relevant for
&rsquo;register&rsquo; and &rsquo;register and ignore
existing key&rsquo; sub-commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --param-aptpl <br>
set the &rsquo;activate persist through power loss&rsquo;
(APTPL) flag in the parameter block of the PROUT command.
Relevant for &rsquo;register&rsquo;, &rsquo;register and
ignore existing key&rsquo; and <br>
&rsquo;register and move&rsquo; sub-commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --param-rk=RK <br>
specify the reservation key found in the parameter block of
the PROUT command. RK is assumed to be hex (up to 8 bytes
long). Default value is 0. This option is needed by <br>
most PROUT sub-commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --param-sark=SARK <br>
specify the service action reservation key found in the
parameter block of the PROUT command. SARK is assumed to be
hex (up to 8 bytes long). Default value is 0. This <br>
option is needed by some PROUT sub-commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --preempt <br>
Preempt is a sub-command of the PROUT command. Preempts the
existing persistent reservation (identified by
--param-sark=SARK) with the registration key that is
registered <br>
for this I_T_L nexus (identified by --param-rk=RK). If a new
reservation is establised as a result of the preemption then
the supplied --prout-type=TYPE is used as the <br>
type for this new reservation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --preempt-abort <br>
Preempt and Abort is a sub-command of the PROUT command.
Preempts the existing persistent reservation (identified by
--param-sark=SARK) with the registration key that is <br>
registered for this I_T_L nexus (identified by
--param-rk=RK). If a new reservation is establised as a
result of the preemption then the supplied --prout-type=TYPE
is used <br>
as the type for this new reservation. ACA and other pending
tasks are aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --prout-type=TYPE <br>
specify the PROUT command&rsquo;s &rsquo;type&rsquo;
argument. Required by the &rsquo;register-move&rsquo;,
&rsquo;reserve&rsquo;, &rsquo;release&rsquo; and
&rsquo;preempt (and abort)&rsquo; sub-commands. Valid TYPE
values: 1-&gt; write <br>
exclusive, 3-&gt; exclusive access, 5-&gt; write exclusive -
registrants only, 6-&gt; exclusive access - registrants
only, 7-&gt; write exclusive - all registrants, 8-&gt;
exclusive <br>
access - all registrants. Default value is 0 (which is an
invalid type). Each &quot;persistent reservation type&quot;
is explained in more detail in a subsection of that name in
the <br>
read reservation section of the PRIN command (section
6.13.3.4 of SPC-4 revision 9).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --read-full-status <br>
Read Full Status is a sub-command of the PRIN command. For
each registration with the given SCSI device, it lists the
reservation key and associated information. Trans&acirc;
<br>
portIDs, if supplied in the response, are decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --read-keys <br>
Read Keys is a sub-command of the PRIN command. Lists all
the reservation keys registered (i.e. registrations) with
the given SCSI device. This is the default sub-command <br>
for the SCSI PRIN command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --read-reservation <br>
Read Reservation is a sub-command of the PRIN command. List
information about the current holder of the reservation on
the DEVICE. If there is no current reservation this <br>
will be noted. Information about the current holder of the
reservation includes its reservation key, scope and
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --read-status <br>
same as --read-full-status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --register <br>
Register is a sub-command of the PROUT command. It has 3
different actions depending on associated parameters. a) add
a new registration with &rsquo;--param-rk=0&rsquo; and <br>
&rsquo;--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;&rsquo;; b) Change an
existing registration with
&rsquo;--param-rk=&lt;old_rk&gt;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;&rsquo;; or c) Delete an
existing registration with <br>
&rsquo;--param-rk=&lt;old_rk&gt;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;--param-sark=0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --register-ignore <br>
Register and Ignore Existing Key is a sub-command of the
PROUT command. Similar to --register except that when
changing a reservation key the old key is not specified.
<br>
The &rsquo;--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;&rsquo; option should
also be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --register-move <br>
register (another initiator) and move (the reservation held
by the current initiator to that other initiator) is a
sub-command of the PROUT command. It requires the <br>
transportID of the other initiator. [The standard uses the
term I_T nexus but the point to stress is that there are two
initiators (the one sending this command and <br>
another one) but only one logical unit.] The
--prout-type=TYPE and --param-rk=RK options need to match
that of the existing reservation while --param-sark=SARK
option <br>
specifies the reservation key of the new (i.e. destination)
registration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --relative-target-port=RTPI
<br>
relative target port identifier that reservation is to be
moved to by PROUT &rsquo;register and move&rsquo;
sub-command. RTPI is assumed to be hex in the range 0 to
ffff inclusive. <br>
Defaults to 0 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --release <br>
Release is a sub-command of the PROUT command. It releases
the current persistent reservation. The --prout-type=TYPE
and --param-rk=RK options, matching the reservation, <br>
must also be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --report-capabilities <br>
Report Capabilities is a sub-command of the PRIN command. It
lists information about the aspects of persistent
reservations that the DEVICE supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --reserve <br>
Reserve is a sub-command of the PROUT command. It creates a
new persistent reservation (if permitted). The
--prout-type=TYPE and --param-rk=RK options must also be
speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --transport-id=TIDS <br>
The TIDS argument can take one of several forms. It can be a
comma (or single space) separated list of ASCII hex bytes
representing a single TransportID as defined in <br>
SPC-4. They are usually 24 bytes long apart from in iSCSI.
The TIDS argument may be a transport specific form (e.g.
&quot;sas,5000c50005b32001&quot;). The TIDS argument may be
&quot;-&quot; <br>
in which case one or more TransportIDs can be read from
stdin. The TIDS argument may be of the form
&quot;file=&lt;name&gt;&quot; in which case one or more
TransportIDs can be read from <br>
a file called &lt;name&gt;. See the &quot;TRANSPORT
IDs&quot; section below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --unreg <br>
optional when the PROUT register and move sub-command is
invoked. If given it will unregister the current initiator
(I_T nexus) after the other initiator has been regis&acirc;
<br>
tered and the reservation moved to it. When not given the
initiator (I_T nexus) that sent the PROUT command remains
registered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
print out cdb of issued commands prior to execution. If used
twice prints out the parameter block associated with the
PROUT command prior to its execution as well. If used <br>
thrice decodes given transportID(s) as well. To see the
response to a PRIN command in low level form use the --hex
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print out version string. Ignore all other parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? output usage message. Ignore
all other parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSPORT IDs <br>
TransportIDs are used in persistent reservations to identify
initiators. The format of a TransportID differs depending on
the type of transport being used. Their format is <br>
described in SPC-4 (in draft revision 20 see section
7.5.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A TransportID is required for
the PROUT &rsquo;register and move&rsquo; sub-command and
the PROUT &rsquo;register&rsquo; sub-command can have zero,
one or more TransportIDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --transport-id=TIDS
option is given then the TIDS argument may be a comma (or
single space) separated list of ASCII hex bytes that
represent a single TransportID as <br>
defined in SPC-4. Alternatively the TIDS argument may be a
transport specific string starting with either
&quot;fcp,&quot;, &quot;spi,&quot;, &quot;sbp,&quot;,
&quot;srp,&quot;, &quot;iqn&quot;, or &quot;sas,&quot;. The
&quot;iqn&quot; form is an <br>
iSCSI qualified name. Apart from &quot;iqn&quot; the other
transport specific leadin string may be given in upper case
(e.g. &quot;FCP,&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;fcp,&quot; form should
be followed by 16 ASCII hex digits that represent an
initiator&rsquo;s N_PORT_NAME. The &quot;spi,&quot; form
should be followed by
&quot;&lt;scsi_address&gt;,&lt;relative_tar&acirc; <br>
get_port_identifier&gt;&quot; (both decimal numbers). The
&quot;sbp,&quot; form should be followed by 16 ASCII hex
digits that represent an initiator&rsquo;s EUI-64 name. The
&quot;srp,&quot; form should be fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by 32 ASCII hex digits that represent an initiator
port identifier. The &quot;sas,&quot; form should be
followed by 16 ASCII hex digits that represent an
initiator&rsquo;s port SAS <br>
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two iSCSI qualified
name forms. The shorter form contains the iSCSI name of the
initiator port (e.g.
&quot;iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays-sn-a8675309&quot;). The
longer form adds <br>
the initiator session id (ISID in hex) separated by
&quot;,i,0x&quot;. For example
&quot;iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays-sn-a8675309,i,0x1234567890ab&quot;.
On the command line to stop punctuation in <br>
an iSCSI name being (mis)-interpreted by the shell, putting
the option argument containing the iSCSI name in double
quotes is advised. iSCSI names are encoded in UTF-8 so if
non <br>
(7 bit) ASCII characters appear in the iSCSI name on the
command line, there will be difficulties if they are not
encoded in UTF-8. The locale can be changed temporarily by
pre&acirc; <br>
fixing the command line invocation of sg_persist with
&quot;LANG=en_US.utf-8&quot; for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively the TIDS argument
may specify a file (or pipe) from which one or more
TransportIDs may be read. If the TIDS argument is
&quot;-&quot; then stdin (standard input) is read. If <br>
the TIDS argument is of the form
&quot;file=&lt;name&gt;&quot; than a file called
&lt;name&gt; is read. A valid SPC-4 TransportID is built
from the transport specific string outlined in the previous
<br>
paragraphs. The parsing of the data read is realtively
simple. Empty lines are ignored. Everything from and
including a &quot;#&quot; on a line is ignored. Leading
spaces and tabs are <br>
ignored. There can be one transportID per line. The
transportID can either be a comma, space or tab separated
list of ASCII hex bytes that represent a TransportID as
defined in <br>
SPC-4. Padding with zero bytes to a minimum length of 24
bytes is performed if necessary. The transportID may also be
transport specific string type discussed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In SPC-3 the SPEC_I_PT bit set
to one and TransportIDs were allowed for the PROUT register
and ignore existing key sub-command. In SPC-4 that is
disallowed yielding a CHECK CON&acirc; <br>
DITION status with and ILLEGAL REQUEST sense key and an
additional sense code set to INVALID FIELD IN PARAMETER
LIST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a SCSI
generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series any SCSI device name
(e.g. /dev/sdc, /dev/st1m or /dev/sg3) can be specified.
<br>
For example &quot;sg_persist --read-keys /dev/sdb&quot; will
work in the 2.6 series kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only scope for PROUT
commands supported in the current draft of SPC-4 is
&quot;LU_SCOPE&quot;. Hence there seems to be no point in
offering an option to set scope to another value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most errors with the PROUT
sub-commands (e.g. missing or mismatched --prout-type=TYPE)
will result in a RESERVATION CONFLICT status. This can be a
bit confusing when you know <br>
there is only one (active) initiator: the
&quot;conflict&quot; is with the SPC standard, not another
initiator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some recent disks accept some
PRIN and PROUT sub-commands when the media is stopped. One
exception was setting the APTPL flag (with the --param-aptpl
option) during a key regis&acirc; <br>
ter operation, it complained if the disk one stopped. The
error indicated it wanted the disk spun up and when that
happened, the registration was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device
names in other supported Operating Systems see the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the various option
defaults the simplest example executes the &rsquo;read
keys&rsquo; sub-command of the PRIN command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the same as the
following (long-winded) command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist --in --read-keys
--device=/dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To read the current reservation
either the &rsquo;--read-reservation&rsquo; form or the
shorter &rsquo;-r&rsquo; can be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist -r /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To register the new reservation
key 0x123abc the following could be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist --out --register
--param-sark=123abc /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given the above registration
succeeds, to reserve the DEVICE (with type &rsquo;write
exclusive&rsquo;) the following could be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist --out --reserve
--param-rk=123abc <br>
--prout-type=1 /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To release the reservation the
following can be given (note that the --param-rk and
--prout-type arguments must match those of the
reservation):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist --out --release
--param-rk=123abc <br>
--prout-type=1 /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally to unregister a
reservation key (and not effect other registrations which is
what &rsquo;--clear&rsquo; would do) the command is a little
surprising:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_persist --out --register
--param-rk=123abc /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now have a close look at the
difference between the register and unregister examples
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example file that is suitably
formatted to pass transportIDs via a
&rsquo;--transport-id=file=transport_ids.txt&rsquo; option
can be found in the examples sub-directory of the sg3_utils
<br>
package. There is also a simple test script called
sg_persist_tst.sh in the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above sequence of commands
was tested successfully on a Seagate Savvio 10K.3 disk which
has a SAS interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_persist is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
