<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This utility allows Persistent reservations and registrations to be queried and
  changed. Persistent reservations and registrations are queried by sub-commands
  (called &quot;service actions&quot; in SPC-4) of the SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE
  IN (PRIN) command. Persistent reservations and registrations are changed by
  sub-commands of the SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT (PROUT) command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a two stage process to obtain a persistent reservation. First an
  application (an I_T nexus in standard's jargon) must register a reservation
  key. If that is accepted (and it should be unless some other I_T nexus has
  registered that key) then the application can try and reserve the device. The
  reserve operation must specify the reservation key and a &quot;type&quot; (see
  the <i>--prout-type=TYPE</i> option).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is relatively safe to query the state of Persistent reservations and
  registrations. With no options this utility defaults to the READ KEYS
  sub-command of the PRIN command. Other PRIN sub-commands are READ RESERVATION,
  REPORT CAPABILITIES and READ FULL STATUS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before trying to change Persistent reservations and registrations users should
  be aware of what they are doing. The relevant sections of the SCSI Primary
  Commands document (i.e. SPC-4 whose most recent draft is revision 20 dated 22
  May 2009) are sections 5.7 (titled &quot;Reservations&quot;), 6.13 (for the
  PRIN command) and 6.14 (for the PROUT command). To safeguard against
  accidental use, the <i>--out</i> option must be given when a PROUT sub-command
  (e.g. <i>--register</i>) is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The older SCSI RESERVE and RELEASE commands (both 6 and 10 byte variants) are
  not supported by this utility. In SPC-3, RESERVE and RELEASE are deprecated,
  replaced by Persistent Reservations. RESERVE and RELEASE have been removed
  from SPC-4 and Annex B is provided showing how to convert to persistent
  reservation commands. See a utility called 'scsires' for support of the SCSI
  RESERVE and RELEASE commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>DEVICE</i> is required by all variants of this utility apart from
  <i>--help</i>. The <i>DEVICE</i> can be given either as an argument (typically
  but not necessarily the last one) or via the <i>--device=DEVICE</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SPC-4 does not use the term &quot;sub-command&quot;. It uses the term
  &quot;service action&quot; for this and for part of a field's name in the
  parameter block associated with the PROUT command (i.e. &quot;service action
  reservation key&quot;). To lessen the potential confusion the term
  &quot;sub-command&quot; has been introduced.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TRANSPORT_IDs"><a class="selflink" href="#TRANSPORT_IDs">TRANSPORT
  IDs</a></h1>
TransportIDs are used in persistent reservations to identify initiators. The
  format of a TransportID differs depending on the type of transport being used.
  Their format is described in SPC-4 (in draft revision 20 see section 7.5.4).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A TransportID is required for the PROUT 'register and move' sub-command and the
  PROUT 'register' sub-command can have zero, one or more TransportIDs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the <i>--transport-id=TIDS</i> option is given then the <i>TIDS</i>
  argument may be a comma (or single space) separated list of ASCII hex bytes
  that represent a single TransportID as defined in SPC-4. Alternatively the
  <i>TIDS</i> argument may be a transport specific string starting with either
  &quot;fcp,&quot;, &quot;spi,&quot;, &quot;sbp,&quot;, &quot;srp,&quot;,
  &quot;iqn&quot;, or &quot;sas,&quot;. The &quot;iqn&quot; form is an iSCSI
  qualified name. Apart from &quot;iqn&quot; the other transport specific leadin
  string may be given in upper case (e.g. &quot;FCP,&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;fcp,&quot; form should be followed by 16 ASCII hex digits that
  represent an initiator's N_PORT_NAME. The &quot;spi,&quot; form should be
  followed by
  &quot;&lt;scsi_address&gt;,&lt;relative_target_port_identifier&gt;&quot; (both
  decimal numbers). The &quot;sbp,&quot; form should be followed by 16 ASCII hex
  digits that represent an initiator's EUI-64 name. The &quot;srp,&quot; form
  should be followed by 32 ASCII hex digits that represent an initiator port
  identifier. The &quot;sas,&quot; form should be followed by 16 ASCII hex
  digits that represent an initiator's port SAS address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two iSCSI qualified name forms. The shorter form contains the iSCSI
  name of the initiator port (e.g.
  &quot;iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays-sn-a8675309&quot;). The longer form adds
  the initiator session id (ISID in hex) separated by &quot;,i,0x&quot;. For
  example &quot;iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays-sn-a8675309,i,0x1234567890ab&quot;.
  On the command line to stop punctuation in an iSCSI name being
  (mis)-interpreted by the shell, putting the option argument containing the
  iSCSI name in double quotes is advised. iSCSI names are encoded in UTF-8 so if
  non (7 bit) ASCII characters appear in the iSCSI name on the command line,
  there will be difficulties if they are not encoded in UTF-8. The locale can be
  changed temporarily by prefixing the command line invocation of sg_persist
  with &quot;LANG=en_US.utf-8&quot; for example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively the <i>TIDS</i> argument may specify a file (or pipe) from which
  one or more TransportIDs may be read. If the <i>TIDS</i> argument is
  &quot;-&quot; then stdin (standard input) is read. If the <i>TIDS</i> argument
  is of the form &quot;file=&lt;name&gt;&quot; than a file called &lt;name&gt;
  is read. A valid SPC-4 TransportID is built from the transport specific string
  outlined in the previous paragraphs. The parsing of the data read is
  realtively simple. Empty lines are ignored. Everything from and including a
  &quot;#&quot; on a line is ignored. Leading spaces and tabs are ignored. There
  can be one transportID per line. The transportID can either be a comma, space
  or tab separated list of ASCII hex bytes that represent a TransportID as
  defined in SPC-4. Padding with zero bytes to a minimum length of 24 bytes is
  performed if necessary. The transportID may also be transport specific string
  type discussed above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In SPC-3 the SPEC_I_PT bit set to one and TransportIDs were allowed for the
  PROUT register and ignore existing key sub-command. In SPC-4 that is
  disallowed yielding a CHECK CONDITION status with and ILLEGAL REQUEST sense
  key and an additional sense code set to INVALID FIELD IN PARAMETER LIST.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the <i>DEVICE</i> must be a SCSI generic (sg)
  device. In the 2.6 series any SCSI device name (e.g. /dev/sdc, /dev/st1m or
  /dev/sg3) can be specified. For example &quot;sg_persist --read-keys
  /dev/sdb&quot; will work in the 2.6 series kernels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only scope for PROUT commands supported in the current draft of SPC-4 is
  &quot;LU_SCOPE&quot;. Hence there seems to be no point in offering an option
  to set scope to another value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most errors with the PROUT sub-commands (e.g. missing or mismatched
  <i>--prout-type=TYPE</i>) will result in a RESERVATION CONFLICT status. This
  can be a bit confusing when you know there is only one (active) initiator: the
  &quot;conflict&quot; is with the SPC standard, not another initiator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some recent disks accept some PRIN and PROUT sub-commands when the media is
  stopped. One exception was setting the APTPL flag (with the
  <i>--param-aptpl</i> option) during a key register operation, it complained if
  the disk one stopped. The error indicated it wanted the disk spun up and when
  that happened, the registration was successful.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device names in other
  supported Operating Systems see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to the various option defaults the simplest example executes the 'read keys'
  sub-command of the PRIN command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_persist /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the same as the following (long-winded) command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_persist --in --read-keys --device=/dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
To read the current reservation either the '--read-reservation' form or the
  shorter '-r' can be used:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_persist -r /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
To <b>register</b> the new reservation key 0x123abc the following could be used:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_persist --out --register --param-sark=123abc /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
Given the above registration succeeds, to <b>reserve</b> the <i>DEVICE</i> (with
  type 'write exclusive') the following could be used:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_persist --out --reserve --param-rk=123abc
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 --prout-type=1 /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
To <b>release</b> the reservation the following can be given (note that the
  --param-rk and --prout-type arguments must match those of the reservation):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_persist --out --release --param-rk=123abc
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 --prout-type=1 /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally to <b>unregister</b> a reservation key (and not effect other
  registrations which is what '--clear' would do) the command is a little
  surprising:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_persist --out --register --param-rk=123abc /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now have a close look at the difference between the register and unregister
  examples above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example file that is suitably formatted to pass transportIDs via a
  '--transport-id=file=transport_ids.txt' option can be found in the examples
  sub-directory of the sg3_utils package. There is also a simple test script
  called sg_persist_tst.sh in the same directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above sequence of commands was tested successfully on a Seagate Savvio 10K.3
  disk which has a SAS interface.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
The exit status of sg_persist is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
  sg3_utils(8) man page.
