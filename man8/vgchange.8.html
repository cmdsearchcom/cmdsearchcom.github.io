<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
vgchange allows you to change the attributes of one or more
volume groups. Its main purpose is to activate and
deactivate VolumeGroupName, or all volume groups if none is
speci&acirc; <br>
fied. Only active volume groups are subject to changes and
allow access to their logical volumes. [Not yet implemented:
During volume group activation, if vgchange recognizes <br>
snapshot logical volumes which were dropped because they ran
out of space, it displays a message informing the
administrator that such snapshots should be removed (see
lvre&acirc; <br>
move(8)). ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --autobackup {y|n} <br>
Controls automatic backup of metadata after the change. See
vgcfgbackup(8). Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --activate [a|e|s|l]{y|n}
<br>
Controls the availability of the logical volumes in the
volume group for input/output. In other words, makes the
logical volumes known/unknown to the kernel. If
autoac&acirc; <br>
tivation option is used (-aay), each logical volume in the
volume group is activated only if it matches an item in the
activation/auto_activation_volume_list set in <br>
lvm.conf. If this list is not set, then all volumes are
considered for activation. The -aay option should be also
used during system boot so it&rsquo;s possible to select
which <br>
volumes to activate using the
activation/auto_activation_volume_list settting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Activation of a logical volume
creates a symbolic link
/dev/VolumeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName pointing to the
device node. This link is removed on deactivation. All <br>
software and scripts should access the device through this
symbolic link and present this as the name of the device.
The location and name of the underlying device node <br>
may depend on the distribution and configuration (e.g. udev)
and might change from release to release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a clustered VG, clvmd is used
for activation, and the following options are possible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -aey, clvmd activates the
LV in exclusive mode (with an exclusive lock), allowing a
single node to activate the LV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -asy, clvmd activates the
LV in shared mode (with a shared lock), allowing multiple
nodes to activate the LV concurrently. If the LV type
prohibits shared access, <br>
such as an LV with a snapshot, the &rsquo;s&rsquo; option is
ignored and an exclusive lock is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -ay (no mode specified),
clvmd activates the LV in shared mode if the LV type allows
concurrent access, such as a linear LV. Otherwise, clvmd
activates the LV in <br>
exclusive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -aey, -asy, and -ay, clvmd
attempts to activate the LV on all nodes. If exclusive mode
is used, then only one of the nodes will be successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -an, clvmd attempts to
deactivate the LV on all nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -aly, clvmd activates the
LV only on the local node, and -aln deactivates only on the
local node. If the LV type allows concurrent access, then
shared mode is used, <br>
otherwise exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LVs with snapshots are always
activated exclusively because they can only be used on one
node at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For local VGs, -ay, -aey, and
-asy are all equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a shared VG, lvmlockd is used
for locking if LVM is compiled with lockd support, and the
following options are possible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -aey, the command activates
the LV in exclusive mode, allowing a single host to activate
the LV (the host running the command). Before activating the
LV, the command <br>
uses lvmlockd to acquire an exclusive lock on the LV. If the
lock cannot be acquired, the LV is not activated and an
error is reported. This would happen if the LV is <br>
active on another host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -asy, the command activates
the LV in shared mode, allowing multiple hosts to activate
the LV concurrently. Before activating the LV, the command
uses lvmlockd to <br>
acquire a shared lock on the LV. If the lock cannot be
acquired, the LV is not activated and an error is reported.
This would happen if the LV is active exclusively on <br>
another host. If the LV type prohibits shared access, such
as a snapshot, the command will report an error and
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -an, the command
deactivates the LV on the host running the command. After
deactivating the LV, the command uses lvmlockd to release
the current lock on the LV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With lvmlockd, an unspecified
mode is always exclusive, -ay defaults to -aey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--activationmode
{complete|degraded|partial} <br>
The activation mode determines whether logical volumes are
allowed to activate when there are physical volumes missing
(e.g. due to a device failure). complete is the <br>
most restrictive; allowing only those logical volumes to be
activated that are not affected by the missing PVs. degraded
allows RAID logical volumes to be activated even <br>
if they have PVs missing. (Note that the &quot;mirror&quot;
segment type is not considered a RAID logical volume. The
&quot;raid1&quot; segment type should be used instead.)
Finally, par&acirc; <br>
tial allows any logical volume to be activated even if
portions are missing due to a missing or failed PV. This
last option should only be used when performing recovery
<br>
or repair operations. degraded is the default mode. To
change it, modify activation_mode in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --ignoreactivationskip <br>
Ignore the flag to skip Logical Volumes during
activation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --clustered {y|n} <br>
If clustered locking is enabled, this indicates whether this
Volume Group is shared with other nodes in the cluster or
whether it contains only local disks that are not <br>
visible on the other nodes. If the cluster infrastructure is
unavailable on a particular node at a particular time, you
may still be able to use Volume Groups that are <br>
not marked as clustered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detachprofile <br>
Detach any metadata configuration profiles attached to given
Volume Groups. See lvm.conf(5) for more information about
metadata profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --uuid <br>
Generate new random UUID for specified Volume Groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--monitor {y|n} <br>
Start or stop monitoring a mirrored or snapshot logical
volume with dmeventd, if it is installed. If a device used
by a monitored mirror reports an I/O error, the failure <br>
is handled according to mirror_image_fault_policy and
mirror_log_fault_policy set in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--poll {y|n} <br>
Without polling a logical volume&rsquo;s backgrounded
transformation process will never complete. If there is an
incomplete pvmove or lvconvert (for example, on rebooting
after <br>
a crash), use --poll y to restart the process from its last
checkpoint. However, it may not be appropriate to
immediately poll a logical volume when it is activated, use
<br>
--poll n to defer and then --poll y to restart the
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sysinit <br>
Indicates that vgchange(8) is being invoked from early
system initialisation scripts (e.g. rc.sysinit or an
initrd), before writeable filesystems are available. As
such, <br>
some functionality needs to be disabled and this option acts
as a shortcut which selects an appropriate set of options.
Currently this is equivalent to using --ignorelock&acirc;
<br>
ingfailure, --ignoremonitoring, --poll n and setting
LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --sysinit is used in
conjunction with lvmetad(8) enabled and running,
autoactivation is preferred over manual activation via
direct vgchange call. Logical volumes are <br>
autoactivated according to auto_activation_volume_list set
in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noudevsync <br>
Disable udev synchronisation. The process will not wait for
notification from udev. It will continue irrespective of any
possible udev processing in the background. You <br>
should only use this if udev is not running or has rules
that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignoremonitoring <br>
Make no attempt to interact with dmeventd unless --monitor
is specified. Do not use this if dmeventd is already
monitoring a device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-start <br>
Start the lockspace of a shared VG in lvmlockd. lvmlockd
locks becomes available for the VG, allowing LVM to use the
VG. See lvmlockd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-stop <br>
Stop the lockspace of a shared VG in lvmlockd. lvmlockd
locks become unavailable for the VG, preventing LVM from
using the VG. See lvmlockd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-type LockType <br>
Change the VG lock type to or from a shared lock type used
with lvmlockd. See lvmlockd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --logicalvolume
MaxLogicalVolumes <br>
Changes the maximum logical volume number of an existing
inactive volume group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --maxphysicalvolumes
MaxPhysicalVolumes <br>
Changes the maximum number of physical volumes that can
belong to this volume group. For volume groups with metadata
in lvm1 format, the limit is 255. If the metadata <br>
uses lvm2 format, the value 0 removes this restriction:
there is then no limit. If you have a large number of
physical volumes in a volume group with metadata in lvm2
<br>
format, for tool performance reasons, you should consider
some use of --pvmetadatacopies 0 as described in
pvcreate(8), and/or use --vgmetadatacopies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--metadataprofile ProfileName
<br>
Uses and attaches ProfileName configuration profile to the
volume group metadata. Whenever the volume group is
processed next time, the profile is automatically applied.
<br>
The profile is inherited by all logical volumes in the
volume group unless the logical volume itself has its own
profile attached. See lvm.conf(5) for more information <br>
about metadata profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[vg]metadatacopies
NumberOfCopies|unmanaged|all <br>
Sets the desired number of metadata copies in the volume
group. If set to a non-zero value, LVM will automatically
manage the &rsquo;metadataignore&rsquo; flags on the
physical vol&acirc; <br>
umes (see pvchange or pvcreate --metadataignore) in order to
achieve NumberOfCopies copies of metadata. If set to
unmanaged, LVM will not automatically manage the
&rsquo;meta&acirc; <br>
dataignore&rsquo; flags. If set to all, LVM will first clear
all of the &rsquo;metadataignore&rsquo; flags on all
metadata areas in the volume group, then set the value to
unmanaged. The <br>
vgmetadatacopies option is useful for volume groups
containing large numbers of physical volumes with metadata
as it may be used to minimize metadata read and write
over&acirc; <br>
head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --physicalextentsize
PhysicalExtentSize[BbBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] <br>
Changes the physical extent size on physical volumes of this
volume group. A size suffix (k for kilobytes up to t for
terabytes) is optional, megabytes is the default if <br>
no suffix is present. For LVM2 format, the value must be a
power of 2 of at least 1 sector (where the sector size is
the largest sector size of the PVs currently used in <br>
the VG) or, if not a power of 2, at least 128KiB. For the
older LVM1 format, it must be a power of 2 of at least 8KiB.
The default is 4 MiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before increasing the physical
extent size, you might need to use lvresize, pvresize and/or
pvmove so that everything fits. For example, every
contiguous range of extents <br>
used in a logical volume must start and end on an extent
boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the volume group metadata
uses lvm1 format, extents can vary in size from 8KiB to
16GiB and there is a limit of 65534 extents in each logical
volume. The default of 4 <br>
MiB leads to a maximum logical volume size of around
256GiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the volume group metadata
uses lvm2 format those restrictions do not apply, but having
a large number of extents will slow down the tools but have
no impact on I/O per&acirc; <br>
formance to the logical volume. The smallest PE is 1KiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 2.4 kernel has a limitation
of 2TiB per block device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--systemid SystemID <br>
Changes the system ID of the VG. Using this option requires
caution because the VG may become foreign to the host
running the command, leaving the host unable to access <br>
it. See lvmsystemid(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh <br>
If any logical volume in the volume group is active, reload
its metadata. This is not necessary in normal operation, but
may be useful if something has gone wrong or if <br>
you&rsquo;re doing clustering manually without a clustered
lock manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --resizeable {y|n} <br>
Enables or disables the extension/reduction of this volume
group with/by physical volumes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
To activate all known volume groups in the system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vgchange -a y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To change the maximum number of
logical volumes of inactive volume group vg00 to 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vgchange -l 128 /dev/vg00</p>
