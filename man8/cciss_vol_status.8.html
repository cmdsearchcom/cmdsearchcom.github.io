<p>CCISS_VOL_STATUS(8) CCISS_VOL_STATUS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cciss_vol_status - show status of logical drives attached to
HP Smartarray controllers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cciss_vol_status [OPTION] [DEVICE]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Shows the status of logical drives configured on HP
Smartarray controllers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p, --persnickety <br>
Without this option, device nodes which can&rsquo;t be
opened, or which are not found to be of the correct device
type are silently ignored. This lets you use wildcards,
e.g.: <br>
cciss_vol_status /dev/sg* /dev/cciss/c*d0, and the program
will not complain as long as all devices which are found to
be of the correct type are found to be ok. However, <br>
you may wish to explicitly list the devices you expect to be
there, and be notified if they are not there (e.g. perhaps a
PCI slot has died, and the system has rebooted, <br>
so that what was once /dev/cciss/c1d0 is no longer there at
all). This option will cause the program to complain about
any device node listed which does not appear to be <br>
the right device type, or is not openable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --copyright <br>
If stderr is a terminal, Print out a copyright message, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
This option doesn&rsquo;t do anything. Previously, without
this option and if stderr is a terminal, a copyright message
precedes the normal program output. Now, the copyright <br>
message is only printed via the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Query each physical drive for
S.M.A.R.T data and report any drives in &quot;predictive
failure&quot; state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --try-unknown-devices <br>
If a device has an unrecognized board ID, normally the
program will not attempt to communicate with it. In case you
have some Smart Array controller which is newer than <br>
this program, the program may not recognize it. This option
permits the program to attempt to interrogate the board even
if it is unrecognized on the assumption that it <br>
is in fact a Smart Array of some kind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Print out more information about the controllers and
physical drives. For each controller, the board ID, number
of logical drives, currently running firmware revision and
<br>
ROM firmware revision are printed. For each physical drive,
the location, vendor, model, serial number, and firmware
revision are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exhaustive <br>
Deprecated. Previously, it &quot;exhaustively&quot; searched
for logical drives, as, under some circumstances some
logical drives might otherwise be missed. This option no
longer <br>
does anything, as the algorithm for finding logical drives
was changed to obviate the need for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE <br>
The DEVICE argument indicates which RAID controller is to be
queried. Note, that it indicates which RAID controller, not
which logical drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the cciss driver, the
&quot;d0&quot; nodes matching &quot;/dev/cciss/c*d0&quot;
are the nodes which correspond to the RAID controllers. (See
note 1, below.) It is not necessary to invoke <br>
cciss_vol_status on each logical drive individually, though
if you do this, each time it will report the status of ALL
logical drives on the controller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the hpsa driver, or for
fibre attached MSA1000 family devices, or for the hpahcisr
sotware RAID driver which emulates Smart Arrays, the RAID
controller is accessed via the <br>
scsi generic driver, and the device nodes will match
&quot;/dev/sg*&quot; Some variants of the &quot;lsscsi&quot;
tool will easily identify which device node corresponds to
the RAID controller. <br>
Some variants may only report the SCSI nexus
(controller/bus/target/lun tuple.) Some distros may not have
the lsscsi tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Executing the following query to
the /sys filesystem and correlating this with the contents
of /proc/scsi/scsi or output of lsscsi can help in finding
the right /dev/sg node to <br>
use with cciss_vol_status:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Normally, a logical drive in good working order should
report a status of &quot;OK.&quot; Possible status values
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;OK.&quot; (0) - The
logical drive is in good working order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;FAILED.&quot; (1) - The
logical drive has failed, and no i/o to it is poosible. <br>
Additionally, failed drives will be identified by connector,
box and bay, as well as vendor, model, serial number, and
firmware revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Using interim recovery
mode.&quot; (3) - One or more drives has failed, <br>
but not so many that the logical drive can no longer
operate. The failed drives should be replaced as soon as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Ready for recovery
operation.&quot; (4) - Failed drive(s) have been <br>
replaced, and the controller is about to begin rebuilding
redundant parity data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Currently
recovering.&quot; (5) - Failed drive(s) have been replaced,
<br>
and the controller is currently rebuilding redundant parity
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Wrong physical drive was
replaced.&quot; (6) - A drive has failed, and <br>
another (working) drive was replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;A physical drive is not
properly connected.&quot; (7) - There is some <br>
cabling or backplane problem in the drive enclosure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(From fwspecwww.doc, see
cpqarray project on sourceforge.net): <br>
Note: If the unit_status value is 6 (Wrong physical drive
was replaced) or 7 (A physical drive is not properly
connected), the unit_status of all other configured logical
<br>
drives will be marked as 1 (Logical drive failed). This is
to force the user to correct the problem and to insure that
once the problem is corrected, the data will not <br>
have been corrupted by any user action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Hardware is
overheating.&quot; (8) - Hardware is too hot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Hardware was
overheated.&quot; (9) - At some point in the past, <br>
the hardware got too hot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Currently
expannding.&quot; (10) - The controller is currently in the
<br>
process of expanding a logical drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Not yet available.&quot;
(11) - The logical drive is not yet finished <br>
being configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Queued for
expansion.&quot; (12) - The logical drive will be expended
<br>
when the controller is able to begin working on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the following
messages may appear regarding spare drive status:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;At least one spare drive
designated&quot; <br>
&quot;At least one spare drive activated and currently
rebuilding&quot; <br>
&quot;At least one activated on-line spare drive is
completely rebuilt on this logical drive&quot; <br>
&quot;At least one spare drive has failed&quot; <br>
&quot;At least one spare drive activated&quot; <br>
&quot;At least one spare drive remains available&quot; <br>
Active spares will be identified by connector, box and bay,
as well <br>
as by vendor, model, serial number, and firmware
revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each logical drive, the
total number of failed physical drives, if more than zero,
will be reported as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Total of n failed physical
drives detected on this logical drive.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with &quot;n&quot; replaced by
the actual number, of course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Replacement&quot; drives
-- newly inserted drives that replace a previously failed
drive but are not yet finished rebuilding -- are also
identified by connector, box and bay, as well <br>
as by vendor, model, serial number, and firmware
revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s option is specified,
each physical drive will be queried for S.M.A.R.T data, any
any drives in predictive failure state will be reported,
identified by connector, box <br>
and bay, as well as vendor, model, serial number, and
firmware revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally failure conditions
of disk enclosure fans, power supplies, and temperature are
reported as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Fan failed&quot; <br>
&quot;Temperature problem&quot; <br>
&quot;Door alert&quot; <br>
&quot;Power Supply Unit failed&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE 1 <br>
The /dev/cciss/c*d0 device nodes of the cciss driver do
double duty. They serve as an access point to both the RAID
controllers, and to the first logical drive of each RAID
con&acirc; <br>
troller. Notice that a /dev/cciss/c*d0 node will be present
for each controller even if no logical drives are configured
on that controller. It might be cleaner if the driver <br>
had a special device node just for the controller, instead
of making these device nodes do double duty. It has been
like that since the 2.2 linux kernel timeframe. At that <br>
time, device major and minor nodes were statically allocated
at compile time, and were in short supply. Changing this
behavior at this point would break lots of userland
pro&acirc; <br>
grams.</p>
