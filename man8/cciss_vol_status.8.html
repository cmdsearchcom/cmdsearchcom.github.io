      This lets you use wildcards, e.g.: cciss_vol_status /dev/sg*
      /dev/cciss/c*d0, and the program will not complain as long as all devices
      which are found to be of the correct type are found to be ok. However, you
      may wish to explicitly list the devices you expect to be there, and be
      notified if they are not there (e.g. perhaps a PCI slot has died, and the
      system has rebooted, so that what was once /dev/cciss/c1d0 is no longer
      there at all). This option will cause the program to complain about any
      device node listed which does not appear to be the right device type, or

The DEVICE argument indicates which RAID controller is to be queried. Note, that
  it indicates which RAID controller, not which logical drive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the cciss driver, the &quot;d0&quot; nodes matching
  &quot;/dev/cciss/c*d0&quot; are the nodes which correspond to the RAID
  controllers. (See note 1, below.) It is not necessary to invoke
  cciss_vol_status on each logical drive individually, though if you do this,
  each time it will report the status of ALL logical drives on the controller.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the hpsa driver, or for fibre attached MSA1000 family devices, or for the
  hpahcisr sotware RAID driver which emulates Smart Arrays, the RAID controller
  is accessed via the scsi generic driver, and the device nodes will match
  &quot;/dev/sg*&quot; Some variants of the &quot;lsscsi&quot; tool will easily
  identify which device node corresponds to the RAID controller. Some variants
  may only report the SCSI nexus (controller/bus/target/lun tuple.) Some distros
  may not have the lsscsi tool.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Executing the following query to the /sys filesystem and correlating this with
  the contents of /proc/scsi/scsi or output of lsscsi can help in finding the
  right /dev/sg node to use with cciss_vol_status:

  1</a></h1>
The /dev/cciss/c*d0 device nodes of the cciss driver do double duty. They serve
  as an access point to both the RAID controllers, and to the first logical
  drive of each RAID controller. Notice that a /dev/cciss/c*d0 node will be
  present for each controller even if no logical drives are configured on that
  controller. It might be cleaner if the driver had a special device node just
  for the controller, instead of making these device nodes do double duty. It
  has been like that since the 2.2 linux kernel timeframe. At that time, device
  major and minor nodes were statically allocated at compile time, and were in
  short supply. Changing this behavior at this point would break lots of
  userland programs.</div>
