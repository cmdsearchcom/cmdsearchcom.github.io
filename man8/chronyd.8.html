<p>CHRONYD(8) System Administration CHRONYD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chronyd - chrony background daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chronyd [OPTIONS] [configuration commands]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
chrony is a pair of programs for maintaining the accuracy of
computer clocks. chronyd is a background daemon program that
can be started at boot time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chronyd is a daemon which runs
in background on the system. It obtains measurements (e.g.
via the network) of the system&rsquo;s offset relative to
other systems, and adjusts the sys&acirc; <br>
tem time accordingly. For isolated systems, the user can
periodically enter the correct time by hand (using chronyc).
In either case, chronyd determines the rate at which the
<br>
computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
chronyd is usually started at boot-time and requires
superuser privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If chronyd has been installed to
its default location /usr/sbin/chronyd, starting it is
simply a matter of entering the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/sbin/chronyd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information messages and
warnings will be logged to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no configuration commands are
specified on the command line, chronyd will read the
commands from the configuration file (default
/etc/chrony.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A summary of the options supported by chronyd is included
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P priority <br>
This option will select the SCHED_FIFO real-time scheduler
at the specified priority (which must be between 0 and 100).
This mode is supported only on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m This option will lock chronyd
into RAM so that it will never be paged out. This mode is
only supported on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n When run in this mode, the
program will not detach itself from the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d When run in this mode, the
program will not detach itself from the terminal, and all
messages will be sent to the terminal instead of to syslog.
When chronyd was compiled <br>
with debugging support, this option can be used twice to
print also debugging messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f conf-file <br>
This option can be used to specify an alternate location for
the configuration file (default /etc/chrony.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r This option will reload
sample histories for each of the servers being used. These
histories are created by using the dump command in chronyc,
or by setting the <br>
dumponexit directive in the configuration file. This option
is useful if you want to stop and restart chronyd briefly
for any reason, e.g. to install a new version. How&acirc;
<br>
ever, it only makes sense on systems where the kernel can
maintain clock compensation whilst not under chronyd&rsquo;s
control. The only version where this happens so far is <br>
Linux. On other systems this option should not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R When this option is used, the
initstepslew directive and the makestep directive used with
a positive limit will be ignored. This option is useful when
restarting chronyd <br>
and can be used in conjunction with the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s This option will set the
system clock from the computer&rsquo;s real-time clock. This
is analogous to supplying the -s flag to the /sbin/hwclock
program during the Linux boot <br>
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for real-time clocks is
limited at present - the criteria are described in the
section on the rtcfile directive in the documentation
supplied with the distribu&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used in conjunction with the
-r flag, chronyd will attempt to preserve the old samples
after setting the system clock from the real time clock
(RTC). This can be used <br>
to allow chronyd to perform long term averaging of the gain
or loss rate across system reboots, and is useful for
dial-up systems that are shut down when not in use. For <br>
this to work well, it relies on chronyd having been able to
determine accurate statistics for the difference between the
RTC and system clock last time the computer was <br>
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If chronyd doesn&rsquo;t support
the RTC on your computer or there is no RTC installed, the
system clock will be set with this option forward to the
time of the last modifica&acirc; <br>
tion of the drift file (specified by the driftfile
directive) to restore the system time at which chronyd was
previously stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
This option sets the name of the user to which will chronyd
switch to drop root privileges if compiled with Linux
capabilities support (default chrony).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q When run in this mode,
chronyd will set the system clock once and exit. It will not
detach from the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q This option is similar to -q,
but it will only print the offset and not correct the
clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option displays
chronyd&rsquo;s version number to the terminal and exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Resolve hostnames only to
IPv4 addresses and create only IPv4 sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Resolve hostnames only to
IPv6 addresses and create only IPv6 sockets.</p>
