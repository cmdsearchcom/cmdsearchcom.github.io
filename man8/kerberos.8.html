<p>KERBEROS(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
KERBEROS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kerberos &acirc; introduction to the Kerberos system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Kerberos is a network authentication system. Its purpose is
to securely authenticate users and services in an insecure
network environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done with a Kerberos
server acting as a trusted third party, keeping a database
with secret keys for all users and services (collectively
called principals).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each principal belongs to
exactly one realm, which is the administrative domain in
Kerberos. A realm usually corresponds to an organisation,
and the realm should normally be <br>
derived from that organisation&rsquo;s domain name. A realm
is served by one or more Kerberos servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authentication process
involves exchange of &acirc;tickets&acirc; and
&acirc;authenticators&acirc; which together prove the
principal&rsquo;s identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you login to the Kerberos
system, either through the normal system login or with the
kinit(1) program, you acquire a ticket granting ticket which
allows you to get new tickets <br>
for other services, such as telnet or ftp, without giving
your password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on how
Kerberos works, and other general Kerberos questions see the
Kerberos FAQ at <br>
http://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/krb/kerberos-faq.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For setup instructions see the
Heimdal Texinfo manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late
1980&rsquo;s as part of the Athena Project at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Versions one through
three never <br>
reached outside MIT, but version 4 was (and still is) quite
popular, especially in the academic community, but is also
used in commercial products like the AFS filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problems with version 4 are
that it has many limitations, the code was not too well
written (since it had been developed over a long time), and
it has a number of known secu&acirc; <br>
rity problems. To resolve many of these issues work on
version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC 1510 in 1993.
IETF RFC 1510 was obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120, also
<br>
known as Kerberos clarifications. With the arrival of IETF
RFC 4120, the work on adding extensibility and
internationalization have started (Kerberos extensions), and
a new RFC <br>
will hopefully appear soon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page is part of the
Heimdal Kerberos 5 distribution, which has been in
development at the Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm, Sweden, since about 1997.</p>
