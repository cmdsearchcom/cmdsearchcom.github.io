Kerberos is a network authentication system. Its purpose is to securely
  authenticate users and services in an insecure network environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a trusted third party, keeping a
  database with secret keys for all users and services (collectively called
  <i class="Em" title="Em">principals</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each principal belongs to exactly one <i class="Em" title="Em">realm</i>, which
  is the administrative domain in Kerberos. A realm usually corresponds to an
  organisation, and the realm should normally be derived from that
  organisation's domain name. A realm is served by one or more Kerberos servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The authentication process involves exchange of &#x2018;tickets&#x2019; and
  &#x2018;authenticators&#x2019; which together prove the principal's identity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you login to the Kerberos system, either through the normal system login or
  with the <a class="Xr" title="Xr">kinit(1)</a> program, you acquire a
  <i class="Em" title="Em">ticket granting ticket</i> which allows you to get
  new tickets for other services, such as <b class="Ic" title="Ic">telnet</b> or
  <b class="Ic" title="Ic">ftp</b>, without giving your password.

The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late 1980's as part of
  the Athena Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Versions one
  through three never reached outside MIT, but version 4 was (and still is)
  quite popular, especially in the academic community, but is also used in
  commercial products like the AFS filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the code was not
  too well written (since it had been developed over a long time), and it has a
  number of known security problems. To resolve many of these issues work on
  version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC 1510 in 1993. IETF RFC 1510 was
  obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120, also known as Kerberos clarifications.
  With the arrival of IETF RFC 4120, the work on adding extensibility and
  internationalization have started (Kerberos extensions), and a new RFC will
  hopefully appear soon.
