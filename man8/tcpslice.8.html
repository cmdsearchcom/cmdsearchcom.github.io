<i>Tcpslice</i> is a program for extracting portions of packet-trace files
  generated using <i>tcpdump(l)</i>'s <b>-w</b> flag. It can also be used to
  merge together several such files, as discussed below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The basic operation of <i>tcpslice</i> is to copy to <i>stdout</i> all packets
  from its input file(s) whose timestamps fall within a given range. The
  starting and ending times of the range may be specified on the command line.
  All ranges are inclusive. The starting time defaults to the earliest time of
  the first packet in any of the input files; we call this the <i>first
  time.</i> The ending time defaults to ten years after the starting time. Thus,
  the command <i>tcpslice trace-file</i> simply copies <i>trace-file</i> to
  <i>stdout</i> (assuming the file does not include more than ten years' worth
  of data).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are a number of ways to specify times. The first is using Unix timestamps
  of the form <i>sssssssss.uuuuuu</i> (this is the format specified by
  <i>tcpdump</i>'s <b>-tt</b> flag). For example, <b>654321098.7654</b>
  specifies 38 seconds and 765,400 microseconds after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25,
  1990.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All examples in this manual are given for PDT times, but when displaying times
  and interpreting times symbolically as discussed below, <i>tcpslice</i> uses
  the local timezone, regardless of the timezone in which the <i>tcpdump</i>
  file was generated. The daylight-savings setting used is that which is
  appropriate for the local timezone at the date in question. For example, times
  associated with summer months will usually include daylight-savings effects,
  and those with winter months will not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Times may also be specified relative to either the <i>first time</i> (when
  specifying a starting time) or the starting time (when specifying an ending
  time) by preceding a numeric value in seconds with a `+'. For example, a
  starting time of <b>+200</b> indicates 200 seconds after the <i>first
  time,</i> and the two arguments <b>+200 +300</b> indicate from 200 seconds
  after the <i>first time</i> through 500 seconds after the <i>first time.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Times may also be specified in terms of years (y), months (m), days (d), hours
  (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), and microseconds(u). For example, the Unix
  timestamp 654321098.7654 discussed above could also be expressed as
  <b>1990y9m25d20h51m38s765400u.</b> 2 or 4 digit years may be used; 2 digits
  can specify years from 1970 to 2069.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When specifying times using this style, fields that are omitted default as
  follows. If the omitted field is a unit <i>greater</i> than that of the first
  specified field, then its value defaults to the corresponding value taken from
  either <i>first time</i> (if the starting time is being specified) or the
  starting time (if the ending time is being specified). If the omitted field is
  a unit <i>less</i> than that of the first specified field, then it defaults to
  zero. For example, suppose that the input file has a <i>first time</i> of the
  Unix timestamp mentioned above, i.e., 38 seconds and 765,400 microseconds
  after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25, 1990. To specify 9:36PM PDT (exactly) on the same
  date we could use <b>21h36m.</b> To specify a range from 9:36PM PDT through
  1:54AM PDT the next day we could use <b>21h36m 26d1h54m.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Relative times can also be specified when using the <i>ymdhmsu</i> format.
  Omitted fields then default to 0 if the unit of the field is <i>greater</i>
  than that of the first specified field, and to the corresponding value taken
  from either the <i>first time</i> or the starting time if the omitted field's
  unit is <i>less</i> than that of the first specified field. Given a <i>first
  time</i> of the Unix timestamp mentioned above, <b>22h +1h10m</b> specifies a
  range from 10:00PM PDT on that date through 11:10PM PDT, and <b>+1h +1h10m</b>
  specifies a range from 38.7654 seconds after 9:51PM PDT through 38.7654
  seconds after 11:01PM PDT. The first hour of the file could be extracted using
  <b>+0 +1h.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that with the <i>ymdhmsu</i> format there is an ambiguity between using
  <i>m</i> for `month' or for `minute'. The ambiguity is resolved as follows: if
  an <i>m</i> field is followed by a <i>d</i> field then it is interpreted as
  specifying months; otherwise it specifies minutes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If more than one input file is specified then <i>tcpslice</i> merges the packets
  from the various input files into the single output file. Normally, this merge
  is done based on the value of the timestamps in the packets in the individual
  files. (Tcpslice assumes that <i>within</i> each input file, packets are in
  timestamp order.) If the <b>-l</b> option is used, the value used for ordering
  is the timestamp of a given packet minus the timestamp of the first packet in
  the input file in which the given packet occurs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When merging files, by default <i>tcpslice</i> will discard any <i>duplicate</i>
  packet it finds in more than one file. A duplicate is a packet that has an
  identical timestamp (either relative or absolute) and identical packet
  contents (for as much as was captured) as another packet previously seen in a
  different file. Note that it is possible for the network to generate true
  replicates of packets, and for systems that can return the same timestamp for
  multiple packets, these can be mistaken for duplicates and discarded.
  Accordingly, <i>tcpslice</i> will not discard duplicates in the same trace
  file. In addition, you can use the <b>-D</b> option to suppress any discarding
  of duplicates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A different issue arises if a file contains timestamps that skip backwards.
  <i>tcpslice</i> will include these in the output, even if they precede the
  minimum time requested. There should probably be an option to suppress these.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another problem relating to backwards timestamps is that <i>tcpslice</i> uses
  random access to seek through a file looking for packets corresponding to the
  desired range of time. While doing so leads to a major performance benefit for
  very large trace files, it also means that in the presence of backwards
  timestamps <i>tcpslice</i> can fail to find the true earliest occurrence of a
  packet matching the time interval criteria. There should probably be an option
  to specify not to use random access but just read the file linearly.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
If any of <b>-R,</b> <b>-r</b> or <b>-t</b> are specified then <i>tcpslice</i>
  reports the timestamps of the first and last packets in each input file and
  exits. Only one of these three options may be specified.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not discard duplicate packets seen when merging multiple
      trace files.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Dump the start and end times specified by the given range
      and exit. This option is useful for checking that the given range actually
      specifies the times you think it does. If one of <b>-R,</b> <b>-r</b> or
      <b>-t</b> has been specified then the times are dumped in the
      corresponding format; otherwise, raw format ( <b> -R</b>) is used.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      file in which the packet is found and the timestamp of the packet itself.

<div class="Pp"></div>
An input filename that beings with a digit or a `+' can be confused with a
  start/end time. Such filenames can be specified with a leading `./'; for
  example, specify the file `04Jul76.trace' as `./04Jul76.trace'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>tcpslice</i> cannot read its input from <i>stdin</i>, since it uses
  random-access to rummage through its input files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>tcpslice</i> refuses to write to its output if it is a terminal (as indicated
  by <i>isatty(3)</i>). This is not a bug but a feature, to prevent it from
  spraying binary data to the user's terminal. Note that this means you must
  either redirect <i>stdout</i> or specify an output file via <b>-w</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>tcpslice</i> will not work properly on <i>tcpdump</i> files spanning more
  than one year; with files containing portions of packets whose original length
  was more than 65,535 bytes; nor with files containing fewer than two packets.
  Such files result in the error message: `couldn't find final packet in file'.
  These problems are due to the interpolation scheme used by <i>tcpslice</i> to
  greatly speed up its processing when dealing with large trace files. Note that
  <i>tcpslice</i> can efficiently extract slices from the middle of trace files
  of any size, and can also work with truncated trace files (i.e., the final
  packet in the file is only partially present, typically due to <i>tcpdump</i>
  being ungracefully killed).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adding <b>-l</b> has broken some compatibility with older versions, since
  <i>tcpslice</i> now merges its input files, rather than (approximately)
  concatenating them together as it did previously.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It would sometimes be convenient if you could specify a clock offset to use with
  the <b>-l</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It would be nice if <i>tcpslice</i> supported more general editing of trace
  files.</div>
