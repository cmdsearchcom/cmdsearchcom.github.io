tdx-util - Tradindexed overview manipulation utility

  [<b>-R</b> <i>path</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>tdx-util</b> is an administrative interface to the tradindexed overview
  method for INN. It only works on tradindexed overview databases, not on any
  other type of INN overview. It allows the administrator to dump various
  information about the internal state of the overview, audit it for errors, and
  rebuild portions of the overview database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tradindexed overview method should lock properly and therefore it should be
  safe to run this utility and perform any operation it performs, including full
  repairs or per-group overview rebuilds, while the server is running. However,
  note that some of the operations performed by this utility can take an
  extended period of time and will hold locks in the overview database during
  that period, which depending on what the server is doing may cause the server
  to stall until <b>tdx-util</b> completes its operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The dump operations are <b>-i</b>, which dumps the master index for the overview
  database, <b>-g</b>, which dumps the index for an individual group, and
  <b>-o</b> and <b>-O</b>, which dump the overview information for a particular
  group (including the additional metadata stored in the index) in two different
  formats. For <b>-g</b>, <b>-o</b>, and <b>-O</b>, the <b>-n</b> option must
  also be given to specify a newsgroup to operate on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To add a new newsgroup to the overview database, use <b>-c</b>. A group must be
  specified with <b>-n</b>. If the group status is something other than
  &quot;y&quot;, it should be specified with <b>-f</b>, and the low and high
  article numbers may be specified with <b>-a</b>. If only one number is given
  rather than a range, it will be taken to be the high water mark and the low
  mark will be set to 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To audit the entire overview database for problems, use <b>-A</b>. Any problems
  found will be reported to standard error. Use <b>-F</b> to correct the errors
  found.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To rebuild the database for a particular newsgroup, use <b>-R</b>. The <b>-R</b>
  option takes a path to a directory which contains all of the articles for that
  newsgroup, one per file. The names of the files must be the numbers of the
  articles in that group. (In other words, this directory must be a traditional
  spool directory for that group.) The <b>-n</b> option must also be given to
  specify the newsgroup for which the overview is being rebuilt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For all operations performed by <b>tdx-util</b>, a different overview database
  than the one specified in <i>inn.conf</i> may be specified using the <b>-p</b>
  option.

      the correspondence of index entries to overview data, and similar such
      things. No changes will be made to the database, but problems will be

  <dd class="It-tag">The article number or numbers to act on. <i>article</i> is
      a valid NNTP range, meaning that it can be either a single article number
      or a range of article numbers (like &quot;1-5&quot;). Either the start or
      the end (or both) of the range may be omitted, in which case they will be
      set to the first or last article number in the group. Passing
      &quot;-&quot; for <i>article</i> is therefore equivalent to not using the
      <b>-a</b> option at all.

      numbers default to 1 and 0 respectively, but may be set with <b>-a</b>. If

      entries, the format of the individual overview entries, the correspondence

      used when fixing problems is to throw away data that's unrecoverable, so
      be warned that using this option may result in inaccessible articles if
      their overview data has been corrupted.

Dump the master index for the overview database in <i>/news/overview</i>,
  regardless of the overview path specified in <i>inn.conf</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tdx-util -i -p /news/overview
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dump the group index for example.test:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tdx-util -g -n example.test
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dump the complete overview information for example.test:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tdx-util -o -n example.test
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dump the overview information for articles 45 and higher in example.test:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tdx-util -o -n example.test -a 45-
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Create an entry for example.test with mode m and low and high article numbers of
  4 and 23, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tdx-util -c -n example.test -f m -a 4-23
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Audit the entire overview database for any problems:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tdx-util -A
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Rebuild the overview information for example.test from a traditional spool
  directory:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tdx-util -R &lt;patharticles in inn.conf&gt;/example/test -n example.test
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The last command may be useful for recovering from a bad crash or corrupted
  overview information for a particular group, if you are also using the
  tradspool article storage method.
