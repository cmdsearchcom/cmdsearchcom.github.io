<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tdx-util - Tradindexed overview manipulation utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tdx-util [-AFcgiOo] [-a article] [-f status] [-n newsgroup]
[-p path] [-R path]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tdx-util is an administrative interface to the tradindexed
overview method for INN. It only works on tradindexed
overview databases, not on any other type of INN overview.
It <br>
allows the administrator to dump various information about
the internal state of the overview, audit it for errors, and
rebuild portions of the overview database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tradindexed overview method
should lock properly and therefore it should be safe to run
this utility and perform any operation it performs,
including full repairs or per- <br>
group overview rebuilds, while the server is running.
However, note that some of the operations performed by this
utility can take an extended period of time and will hold
locks <br>
in the overview database during that period, which depending
on what the server is doing may cause the server to stall
until tdx-util completes its operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dump operations are -i,
which dumps the master index for the overview database, -g,
which dumps the index for an individual group, and -o and
-O, which dump the overview <br>
information for a particular group (including the additional
metadata stored in the index) in two different formats. For
-g, -o, and -O, the -n option must also be given to <br>
specify a newsgroup to operate on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add a new newsgroup to the
overview database, use -c. A group must be specified with
-n. If the group status is something other than
&quot;y&quot;, it should be specified with -f, and <br>
the low and high article numbers may be specified with -a.
If only one number is given rather than a range, it will be
taken to be the high water mark and the low mark will be
<br>
set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To audit the entire overview
database for problems, use -A. Any problems found will be
reported to standard error. Use -F to correct the errors
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To rebuild the database for a
particular newsgroup, use -R. The -R option takes a path to
a directory which contains all of the articles for that
newsgroup, one per file. The <br>
names of the files must be the numbers of the articles in
that group. (In other words, this directory must be a
traditional spool directory for that group.) The -n option
must <br>
also be given to specify the newsgroup for which the
overview is being rebuilt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all operations performed by
tdx-util, a different overview database than the one
specified in inn.conf may be specified using the -p
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A Audit the entire overview database for problems. This
runs the internal consistency checks built into the
tradindexed overview implementation, checking such things as
the <br>
validity and reachability of all group index entries, the
format of the individual overview entries, the
correspondence of index entries to overview data, and
similar such <br>
things. No changes will be made to the database, but
problems will be reported to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a article <br>
The article number or numbers to act on. article is a valid
NNTP range, meaning that it can be either a single article
number or a range of article numbers (like &quot;1-5&quot;).
<br>
Either the start or the end (or both) of the range may be
omitted, in which case they will be set to the first or last
article number in the group. Passing &quot;-&quot; for
article <br>
is therefore equivalent to not using the -a option at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only useful in combination with
the -o option to dump overview information or with -c to
specify the low and high article numbers when creating a
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Create a new group in the
overview database. The group must be specified with -n. The
newsgroup status defaults to &quot;y&quot; but may be set
with -f. The low and high article <br>
numbers default to 1 and 0 respectively, but may be set with
-a. If only one number is given to -a, it is taken as the
high article number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Audit the entire overview
database for problems, fixing them as they&rsquo;re detected
where possible. This runs the internal consistency checks
built into the tradindexed <br>
overview implementation, checking such things as the
validity and reachability of all group index entries, the
format of the individual overview entries, the
correspondence <br>
of index entries to overview data, and similar such things.
The strategy used when fixing problems is to throw away data
that&rsquo;s unrecoverable, so be warned that using this
<br>
option may result in inaccessible articles if their overview
data has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see what would be changed by
-F, run tdx-util with -A first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f status <br>
When creating a newsgroup with -c, set the status of the
newly created group to status instead of &quot;y&quot;. Only
useful with -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Dump the index of a
particular group. The fields are, in order, the article
number, the offset of the data for that article in the
overview data file for that group, the <br>
length of the overview data, the time (in seconds since
epoch) when the article arrived on the server, the time (in
seconds since epoch) when the article should expire based
<br>
on its Expires: header (or 0 if there is no Expires:
header), and the storage API token of the article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is given, the -n
option must also be given to specify the newsgroup on which
to act.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Dump the master index of the
overview database. This contains similar information to the
server active file, such as high and low water marks and
moderation status, and is <br>
the information that nnrpd hands out to clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields are, in order, the
newsgroup name, the high water mark, the low water mark, the
base article number (the point at which the group index
begins), the count of <br>
articles in the group, the group status, the time (in
seconds since epoch) when that newsgroup was deleted or 0 if
it hasn&rsquo;t been, and the inode of the index file for
that <br>
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A particular newsgroup can be
specified with the -n option. If -n is not given, the entire
master index will be dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n newsgroup <br>
Specify the newsgroup on which to act, required for the -i,
-o, and -R options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Dump the overview information
for a newsgroup in the format used by overchan as input.
Each line will start with the storage API token, the arrival
timestamp in seconds <br>
since epoch, the expires timestamp in the same format (or 0
if there is no Expires: header), and then the overview
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is given, the -n
option must also be given to specify the newsgroup on which
to act. By default, all of the overview information for that
newsgroup is dumped, <br>
but the -a option may be given to restrict the dump to the
information for a single article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Dump the overview information
for a newsgroup, in the same format as it would be returned
to clients but with one modification. Appended to the end of
each entry will be <br>
four additional pieces of data: the article number according
to the index file for that group labelled with
&quot;Article:&quot;, the storage API token for that article
labelled with <br>
&quot;Token:&quot;, the arrival date for that article on the
server in RFC 5322 date format labelled with
&quot;Arrived:&quot;, and the expiration date for that
article (from the Expires: <br>
header) in RFC 5322 date format if there is any, labelled
with &quot;Expires:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is given, the -n
option must also be given to specify the newsgroup on which
to act. By default, all of the overview information for that
newsgroup is dumped, <br>
but the -a option may be given to restrict the dump to the
information for a single article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p path <br>
Act on the overview database rooted in path, overriding the
overview path specified in inn.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R path <br>
Rebuild the overview for a given group from the articles
stored in path. The articles must be in the form of a
traditional spool directory; in other words, each article
must <br>
be in a separate file and the name of the file must match
the article number of the article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is given, the -n
option must also be given to specify the newsgroup on which
to act.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Dump the master index for the overview database in
/news/overview, regardless of the overview path specified in
inn.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tdx-util -i -p
/news/overview</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump the group index for
example.test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tdx-util -g -n example.test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump the complete overview
information for example.test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tdx-util -o -n example.test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump the overview information
for articles 45 and higher in example.test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tdx-util -o -n example.test -a
45-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create an entry for example.test
with mode m and low and high article numbers of 4 and 23,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tdx-util -c -n example.test -f m
-a 4-23</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audit the entire overview
database for any problems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tdx-util -A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rebuild the overview information
for example.test from a traditional spool directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tdx-util -R &lt;patharticles in
inn.conf&gt;/example/test -n example.test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last command may be useful
for recovering from a bad crash or corrupted overview
information for a particular group, if you are also using
the tradspool article storage <br>
method.</p>
