filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
reiserfstune is used for tuning the ReiserFS. It can change
two journal parameters (the journal size and the maximum
transaction size), and it can move the journal&rsquo;s
location to <br>
a new specified block device. (The old ReiserFS&rsquo;s
journal may be kept unused, or discarded at the user&rsquo;s
option.) Besides that reiserfstune can store the bad block
list to the <br>
ReiserFS and set UUID and LABEL. Note: At the time of
writing the relocated journal was implemented for a special
release of ReiserFS, and was not expected to be put into the
<br>
mainstream kernel until approximately Linux 2.5. This means
that if you have the stock kernel you must apply a special
patch. Without this patch the kernel will refuse to mount
<br>
the newly modified file system. We will charge $25 to
explain this to you if you ask us why it doesn&rsquo;t
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perhaps the most interesting
application of this code is to put the journal on a solid
state disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">device is the special file
corresponding to the newly specified block device (e.g
/dev/hdXX for IDE disk partition or /dev/sdXX for the SCSI
disk partition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h | --help <br>
Print usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j | --journal-device FILE <br>
FILE is the file name of the block device the file system
has the current journal (the one prior to running
reiserfstune) on. This option is required when the journal
is <br>
already on a separate device from the main data device
(although it can be avoided with --no-journal-available). If
you don&rsquo;t specify journal device by this option,
reis&acirc; <br>
erfstune suppose that journal is on main device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-journal-available <br>
allows reiserfstune to continue when the current
journal&rsquo;s block device is no longer available. This
might happen if a disk goes bad and you remove it (and run
fsck).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--journal-new-device FILE <br>
FILE is the file name of the block device which will contain
the new journal for the file system. If you don&rsquo;t
specify this, reiserfstune supposes that journal device <br>
remains the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s | --journal-new-size N <br>
N is the size parameter for the new journal. When journal is
to be on a separate device - its size defaults to number of
blocks that device has. When journal is to be on <br>
the same device as the filesytem - its size defaults to
amount of blocks allocated for journal by mkreiserfs when it
created the filesystem. Minimum is 513 for both cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o | --journal-new-offset N <br>
N is an offset in blocks where journal will starts from when
journal is to be on a separate device. Default is 0. Has no
effect when journal is to be on the same device as <br>
the filesystem. Most users have no need to use this feature.
It can be used when you want the journals from multiple
filesystems to reside on the same device, and you <br>
don&rsquo;t want to or cannot partition that device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t | --maximal-transaction-size
N <br>
N is the maximum transaction size parameter for the new
journal. The default, and max possible, value is 1024
blocks. It should be less than half the size of the journal.
<br>
If specifed incorrectly, it will be adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b | --add-badblocks file <br>
File is the file name of the file that contains the list of
blocks to be marked as bad on the fs. The list is added to
the fs list of bad blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B | --badblocks file <br>
File is the file name of the file that contains the list of
blocks to be marked as bad on the fs. The bad block list on
the fs is cleared before the list specified in the <br>
File is added to the fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f | --force <br>
Normally reiserfstune will refuse to change a journal of a
file system that was created before this journal relocation
code. This is because if you change the journal, you <br>
cannot go back (without special option
--make-journal-standard) to an old kernel that lacks this
feature and be able to use your filesytem. This option
forces it to do <br>
that. Specified more than once it allows to avoid asking for
confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--make-journal-standard <br>
As it was mentioned above, if your file system has
non-standard journal, it can not be mounted on the kernel
without journal relocation code. The thing can be changed,
the <br>
only condition is that there is reserved area on main device
of the standard journal size 8193 blocks (it will be so for
instance if you convert standard journal to non- <br>
standard). Just specify this option when you relocate
journal back, or without relocation if you already have it
on main device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u | --uuid UUID <br>
Set the universally unique identifier ( UUID ) of the
filesystem to UUID (see also uuidgen(8)). The format of the
UUID is a series of hex digits separated <br>
by hypthens, like this:
&quot;c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l | --label LABEL <br>
Set the volume label of the filesystem. LABEL can be at most
16 characters long; if it is longer than 16 characters,
reiserfstune will truncate it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c | --check-interval
interval-in-days <br>
Adjust the maximal time between two filesystem checks. A
value of &quot;disable&quot; will disable the time-dependent
checking. A value of &quot;default&quot; will restore the
compile-time <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is strongly recommended that
either -m (mount-count dependent) or -c (time-dependent)
checking be enabled to force periodic full fsck.reiserfs(8)
checking of the <br>
filesystem. Failure to do so may lead to filesystem
corruption (due to bad disks, cables, memory, or kernel
bugs) going unnoticed, ultimately resulting in data loss or
<br>
corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C | --time-last-checked
timestamp <br>
Set the time the filesystem was last checked using
fsck.reiserfs. This can be useful in scripts which use a
Logical Volume Manager to make a consistent snapshot of a
<br>
filesystem, and then check the filesystem during off hours
to make sure it hasn&rsquo;t been corrupted due to hardware
problems, etc. If the filesystem was clean, then this <br>
option can be used to set the last checked time on the
original filesystem. The format of time-last-checked is the
international date format, with an optional time
speci&acirc; <br>
fier, i.e. YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]. The keyword now is also
accepted, in which case the last checked time will be set to
the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m | --max-mnt-count
max-mount-count <br>
Adjust the number of mounts after which the filesystem will
be checked by fsck.reiserfs(8). If max-mount-count is
&quot;disable&quot;, the number of times the filesystem is
<br>
mounted will be disregarded by fsck.reiserfs(8) and the
kernel. A value of &quot;default&quot; will restore the
compile-time default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Staggering the mount-counts at
which filesystems are forcibly checked will avoid all
filesystems being checked at one time when using journaled
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should strongly consider the
consequences of disabling mount-count-dependent checking
entirely. Bad disk drives, cables, memory, and kernel bugs
could <br>
all corrupt a filesystem without marking the filesystem
dirty or in error. If you are using journaling on your
filesystem, your filesystem will never be marked dirty, <br>
so it will not normally be checked. A filesys&acirc; tem
error detected by the kernel will still force an fsck on the
next reboot, but it may already be too late to prevent <br>
data loss at that point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires a kernel
which supports incrementing the count on each mount. This
feature has not been incorporated into kernel versions older
than 2.6.25.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the -c option for
time-dependent checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M | --mnt-count count <br>
Set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted. If
set to a greater value than the max-mount-counts parameter
set by the -m option, fsck.reiserfs(8) will <br>
check the filesystem at the next reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSSIBLE SCENARIOS OF USING
REISERFSTUNE: <br>
1. You have ReiserFS on /dev/hda1, and you wish to have it
working with its journal on the device /dev/journal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">boot kernel patched with special
&quot;relocatable journal support&quot; patch <br>
reiserfstune /dev/hda1 --journal-new-device /dev/journal -f
<br>
mount /dev/hda1 and use. <br>
You would like to change max transaction size to 512 blocks
<br>
reiserfstune -t 512 /dev/hda1 <br>
You would like to use your file system on another kernel
that doesn&rsquo;t <br>
contain relocatable journal support. <br>
umount /dev/hda1 <br>
reiserfstune /dev/hda1 -j /dev/journal --journal-new-device
/dev/hda1 --make-journal-standard <br>
mount /dev/hda1 and use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. You would like to have
ReiserFS on /dev/hda1 and to be able to <br>
switch between different journals including journal located
on the <br>
device containing the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">boot kernel patched with special
&quot;relocatable journal support&quot; patch <br>
mkreiserfs /dev/hda1 <br>
you got solid state disk (perhaps /dev/sda, they typically
look like scsi disks) <br>
reiserfstune --journal-new-device /dev/sda1 -f /dev/hda1
<br>
Your scsi device dies, it is three in the morning, you have
an extra IDE device <br>
lying around <br>
reiserfsck --no-journal-available /dev/hda1 <br>
or <br>
reiserfsck --rebuild-tree --no-journal-available /dev/hda1
<br>
reiserfstune --no-journal-available --journal-new-device
/dev/hda1 /dev/hda1 <br>
using /dev/hda1 under patched kernel</p>
