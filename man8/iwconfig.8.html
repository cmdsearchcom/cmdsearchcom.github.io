<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Iwconfig is similar to ifconfig(8), but is dedicated to the
wireless interfaces. It is used to set the parameters of the
network interface which are specific to the wireless <br>
operation (for example : the frequency). Iwconfig may also
be used to display those parameters, and the wireless
statistics (extracted from /proc/net/wireless).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these parameters and
statistics are device dependent. Each driver will provide
only some of them depending on hardware support, and the
range of values may change. Please <br>
refer to the man page of each device for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
essid Set the ESSID (or Network Name - in some products it
may also be called Domain ID). The ESSID is used to identify
cells which are part of the same virtual network. <br>
As opposed to the AP Address or NWID which define a single
cell, the ESSID defines a group of cells connected via
repeaters or infrastructure, where the user may roam <br>
transparently. <br>
With some cards, you may disable the ESSID checking (ESSID
promiscuous) with off or any (and on to reenable it). <br>
If the ESSID of your network is one of the special keywords
(off, on or any), you should use -- to escape it. <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 essid any <br>
iwconfig eth0 essid &quot;My Network&quot; <br>
iwconfig eth0 essid -- &quot;ANY&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nwid Set the Network ID. As all
adjacent wireless networks share the same medium, this
parameter is used to differentiate them (create logical
colocated networks) and identify <br>
nodes belonging to the same cell. <br>
This parameter is only used for pre-802.11 hardware, the
802.11 protocol uses the ESSID and AP Address for this
function. <br>
With some cards, you may disable the Network ID checking
(NWID promiscuous) with off (and on to reenable it). <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 nwid AB34 <br>
iwconfig eth0 nwid off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nick[name] <br>
Set the nickname, or the station name. Some 802.11 products
do define it, but this is not used as far as the protocols
(MAC, IP, TCP) are concerned and completely useless <br>
as far as configuration goes. Only some wireless diagnostic
tools may use it. <br>
Example : <br>
iwconfig eth0 nickname &quot;My Linux Node&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode Set the operating mode of
the device, which depends on the network topology. The mode
can be Ad-Hoc (network composed of only one cell and without
Access Point), Managed <br>
(node connects to a network composed of many Access Points,
with roaming), Master (the node is the synchronisation
master or acts as an Access Point), Repeater (the node <br>
forwards packets between other wireless nodes), Secondary
(the node acts as a backup master/repeater), Monitor (the
node is not associated with any cell and passively
mon&acirc; <br>
itor all packets on the frequency) or Auto. <br>
Example : <br>
iwconfig eth0 mode Managed <br>
iwconfig eth0 mode Ad-Hoc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freq/channel <br>
Set the operating frequency or channel in the device. A
value below 1000 indicates a channel number, a value greater
than 1000 is a frequency in Hz. You may append the <br>
suffix k, M or G to the value (for example,
&quot;2.46G&quot; for 2.46 GHz frequency), or add enough
&rsquo;0&rsquo;. <br>
Channels are usually numbered starting at 1, and you may use
iwlist(8) to get the total number of channels, list the
available frequencies, and display the current fre&acirc;
<br>
quency as a channel. Depending on regulations, some
frequencies/channels may not be available. <br>
When using Managed mode, most often the Access Point
dictates the channel and the driver may refuse the setting
of the frequency. In Ad-Hoc mode, the frequency setting may
<br>
only be used at initial cell creation, and may be ignored
when joining an existing cell. <br>
You may also use off or auto to let the card pick up the
best channel (when supported). <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 freq 2422000000 <br>
iwconfig eth0 freq 2.422G <br>
iwconfig eth0 channel 3 <br>
iwconfig eth0 channel auto</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ap Force the card to register to
the Access Point given by the address, if it is possible.
This address is the cell identity of the Access Point, as
reported by wireless <br>
scanning, which may be different from its network MAC
address. If the wireless link is point to point, set the
address of the other end of the link. If the link is ad-hoc,
<br>
set the cell identity of the ad-hoc network. <br>
When the quality of the connection goes too low, the driver
may revert back to automatic mode (the card selects the best
Access Point in range). <br>
You may also use off to re-enable automatic mode without
changing the current Access Point, or you may use any or
auto to force the card to reassociate with the currently
<br>
best Access Point. <br>
Example : <br>
iwconfig eth0 ap 00:60:1D:01:23:45 <br>
iwconfig eth0 ap any <br>
iwconfig eth0 ap off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rate/bit[rate] <br>
For cards supporting multiple bit rates, set the bit-rate in
b/s. The bit-rate is the speed at which bits are transmitted
over the medium, the user speed of the link is <br>
lower due to medium sharing and various overhead. <br>
You may append the suffix k, M or G to the value (decimal
multiplier : 10^3, 10^6 and 10^9 b/s), or add enough
&rsquo;0&rsquo;. Values below 1000 are card specific,
usually an index <br>
in the bit-rate list. Use auto to select automatic bit-rate
mode (fallback to lower rate on noisy channels), which is
the default for most cards, and fixed to revert back <br>
to fixed setting. If you specify a bit-rate value and append
auto, the driver will use all bit-rates lower and equal than
this value. <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 rate 11M <br>
iwconfig eth0 rate auto <br>
iwconfig eth0 rate 5.5M auto</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">txpower <br>
For cards supporting multiple transmit powers, sets the
transmit power in dBm. If W is the power in Watt, the power
in dBm is P = 30 + 10.log(W). If the value is post&acirc;
<br>
fixed by mW, it will be automatically converted to dBm. <br>
In addition, on and off enable and disable the radio, and
auto and fixed enable and disable power control (if those
features are available). <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 txpower 15 <br>
iwconfig eth0 txpower 30mW <br>
iwconfig eth0 txpower auto <br>
iwconfig eth0 txpower off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sens Set the sensitivity
threshold. This define how sensitive is the card to poor
operating conditions (low signal, interference). Positive
values are assumed to be the raw <br>
value used by the hardware or a percentage, negative values
are assumed to be dBm. Depending on the hardware
implementation, this parameter may control various
functions. <br>
On modern cards, this parameter usually control
handover/roaming threshold, the lowest signal level for
which the hardware remains associated with the current
Access <br>
Point. When the signal level goes below this threshold the
card starts looking for a new/better Access Point. Some
cards may use the number of missed beacons to trigger <br>
this. For high density of Access Points, a higher threshold
make sure the card is always associated with the best AP,
for low density of APs, a lower threshold minimise <br>
the number of failed handoffs. <br>
On more ancient card this parameter usually controls the
defer threshold, the lowest signal level for which the
hardware considers the channel busy. Signal levels above
<br>
this threshold make the hardware inhibits its own
transmission whereas signals weaker than this are ignored
and the hardware is free to transmit. This is usually
strongly <br>
linked to the receive threshold, the lowest signal level for
which the hardware attempts packet reception. Proper setting
of these thresholds prevent the card to waste <br>
time on background noise while still receiving weak
transmissions. Modern designs seems to control those
thresholds automatically. <br>
Example : <br>
iwconfig eth0 sens -80 <br>
iwconfig eth0 sens 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retry Most cards have MAC
retransmissions, and some allow to set the behaviour of the
retry mechanism. <br>
To set the maximum number of retries, enter limit
&lsquo;value&rsquo;. This is an absolute value (without
unit), and the default (when nothing is specified). To set
the maximum <br>
length of time the MAC should retry, enter lifetime
&lsquo;value&rsquo;. By defaults, this value is in seconds,
append the suffix m or u to specify values in milliseconds
or <br>
microseconds. <br>
You can also add the short, long, min and max modifiers. If
the card supports automatic mode, they define the bounds of
the limit or lifetime. Some other cards define dif&acirc;
<br>
ferent values depending on packet size, for example in
802.11 min limit is the short retry limit (non RTS/CTS
packets). <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 retry 16 <br>
iwconfig eth0 retry lifetime 300m <br>
iwconfig eth0 retry short 12 <br>
iwconfig eth0 retry min limit 8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rts[_threshold] <br>
RTS/CTS adds a handshake before each packet transmission to
make sure that the channel is clear. This adds overhead, but
increases performance in case of hidden nodes or a <br>
large number of active nodes. This parameter sets the size
of the smallest packet for which the node sends RTS ; a
value equal to the maximum packet size disables the <br>
mechanism. You may also set this parameter to auto, fixed or
off. <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 rts 250 <br>
iwconfig eth0 rts off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frag[mentation_threshold] <br>
Fragmentation allows to split an IP packet in a burst of
smaller fragments transmitted on the medium. In most cases
this adds overhead, but in a very noisy environment <br>
this reduces the error penalty and allow packets to get
through interference bursts. This parameter sets the maximum
fragment size which is always lower than the maximum <br>
packet size. <br>
This parameter may also control Frame Bursting available on
some cards, the ability to send multiple IP packets
together. This mechanism would be enabled if the fragment
<br>
size is larger than the maximum packet size. <br>
You may also set this parameter to auto, fixed or off. <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 frag 512 <br>
iwconfig eth0 frag off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key/enc[ryption] <br>
Used to manipulate encryption or scrambling keys and
security mode. <br>
To set the current encryption key, just enter the key in hex
digits as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX or XXXXXXXX. To set a key
other than the current key, prepend or append [index] <br>
to the key itself (this won&rsquo;t change which is the
active key). You can also enter the key as an ASCII string
by using the s: prefix. Passphrase is currently not
supported. <br>
To change which key is the currently active key, just enter
[index] (without entering any key value). <br>
off and on disable and reenable encryption. <br>
The security mode may be open or restricted, and its meaning
depends on the card used. With most cards, in open mode no
authentication is used and the card may also accept <br>
non-encrypted sessions, whereas in restricted mode only
encrypted sessions are accepted and the card will use
authentication if available. <br>
If you need to set multiple keys, or set a key and change
the active key, you need to use multiple key directives.
Arguments can be put in any order, the last one will <br>
take precedence. <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 key 0123-4567-89 <br>
iwconfig eth0 key [3] 0123-4567-89 <br>
iwconfig eth0 key s:password [2] <br>
iwconfig eth0 key [2] <br>
iwconfig eth0 key open <br>
iwconfig eth0 key off <br>
iwconfig eth0 key restricted [3] 0123456789 <br>
iwconfig eth0 key 01-23 key 45-67 [4] key [4]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">power Used to manipulate power
management scheme parameters and mode. <br>
To set the period between wake ups, enter period
&lsquo;value&rsquo;. To set the timeout before going back to
sleep, enter timeout &lsquo;value&rsquo;. To set the generic
level of power saving, <br>
enter saving &lsquo;value&rsquo;. You can also add the min
and max modifiers. By default, those values are in seconds,
append the suffix m or u to specify values in milliseconds
or <br>
microseconds. Sometimes, those values are without units
(number of beacon periods, dwell, percentage or similar).
<br>
off and on disable and reenable power management. Finally,
you may set the power management mode to all (receive all
packets), unicast (receive unicast packets only, dis&acirc;
<br>
card multicast and broadcast) and multicast (receive
multicast and broadcast only, discard unicast packets). <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 power period 2 <br>
iwconfig eth0 power 500m unicast <br>
iwconfig eth0 power timeout 300u all <br>
iwconfig eth0 power saving 3 <br>
iwconfig eth0 power off <br>
iwconfig eth0 power min period 2 power max period 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modu[lation] <br>
Force the card to use a specific set of modulations. Modern
cards support various modulations, some which are standard,
such as 802.11b or 802.11g, and some proprietary. <br>
This command force the card to only use the specific set of
modulations listed on the command line. This can be used to
fix interoperability issues. <br>
The list of available modulations depend on the card/driver
and can be displayed using iwlist modulation. Note that some
card/driver may not be able to select each modu&acirc; <br>
lation listed independently, some may come as a group. You
may also set this parameter to auto let the card/driver do
its best. <br>
Examples : <br>
iwconfig eth0 modu 11g <br>
iwconfig eth0 modu CCK OFDMa <br>
iwconfig eth0 modu auto</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit Some cards may not apply
changes done through Wireless Extensions immediately (they
may wait to aggregate the changes or apply it only when the
card is brought up via <br>
ifconfig). This command (when available) forces the card to
apply all pending changes. <br>
This is normally not needed, because the card will
eventually apply the changes, but can be useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
For each device which supports wireless extensions, iwconfig
will display the name of the MAC protocol used (name of
device for proprietary protocols), the ESSID (Network Name),
<br>
the NWID, the frequency (or channel), the sensitivity, the
mode of operation, the Access Point address, the bit-rate,
the RTS threshold, the fragmentation threshold, the
encryp&acirc; <br>
tion key and the power management settings (depending on
availability).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters displayed have
the same meaning and values as the parameters you can set,
please refer to the previous part for a detailed explanation
of them. <br>
Some parameters are only displayed in short/abbreviated form
(such as encryption). You may use iwlist(8) to get all the
details. <br>
Some parameters have two modes (such as bitrate). If the
value is prefixed by &lsquo;=&rsquo;, it means that the
parameter is fixed and forced to that value, if it is
prefixed by &lsquo;:&rsquo;, the <br>
parameter is in automatic mode and the current value is
shown (and may change).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access Point/Cell <br>
An address equal to 00:00:00:00:00:00 means that the card
failed to associate with an Access Point (most likely a
configuration issue). The Access Point parameter will be
<br>
shown as Cell in ad-hoc mode (for obvious reasons), but
otherwise works the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If /proc/net/wireless exists,
iwconfig will also display its content. Note that those
values will depend on the driver and the hardware specifics,
so you need to refer to your <br>
driver documentation for proper interpretation of those
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link quality <br>
Overall quality of the link. May be based on the level of
contention or interference, the bit or frame error rate, how
good the received signal is, some timing synchroni&acirc;
<br>
sation, or other hardware metric. This is an aggregate
value, and depends totally on the driver and hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal level <br>
Received signal strength (RSSI - how strong the received
signal is). May be arbitrary units or dBm, iwconfig uses
driver meta information to interpret the raw value given
<br>
by /proc/net/wireless and display the proper unit or maximum
value (using 8 bit arithmetic). In Ad-Hoc mode, this may be
undefined and you should use iwspy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Noise level <br>
Background noise level (when no packet is transmitted).
Similar comments as for Signal level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rx invalid nwid <br>
Number of packets received with a different NWID or ESSID.
Used to detect configuration problems or adjacent network
existence (on the same frequency).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rx invalid crypt <br>
Number of packets that the hardware was unable to decrypt.
This can be used to detect invalid encryption settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rx invalid frag <br>
Number of packets for which the hardware was not able to
properly re-assemble the link layer fragments (most likely
one was missing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tx excessive retries <br>
Number of packets that the hardware failed to deliver. Most
MAC protocols will retry the packet a number of times before
giving up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid misc <br>
Other packets lost in relation with specific wireless
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missed beacon <br>
Number of periodic beacons from the Cell or the Access Point
we have missed. Beacons are sent at regular intervals to
maintain the cell coordination, failure to receive <br>
them usually indicates that the card is out of range.</p>
