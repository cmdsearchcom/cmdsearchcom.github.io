The <i>chat</i> program defines a conversational exchange between the computer
  and the modem. Its primary purpose is to establish the connection between the
  Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon ( <i>pppd</i>) and the remote's <i>pppd</i>
  process.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHAT_SCRIPT"><a class="selflink" href="#CHAT_SCRIPT">CHAT
  SCRIPT</a></h1>
The <i>chat</i> script defines the communications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A script consists of one or more &quot;expect-send&quot; pairs of strings,
  separated by spaces, with an optional &quot;subexpect-subsend&quot; string
  pair, separated by a dash as in the following example:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ogin:-BREAK-ogin: ppp ssword: hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This line indicates that the <i>chat</i> program should expect the string
  &quot;ogin:&quot;. If it fails to receive a login prompt within the time
  interval allotted, it is to send a break sequence to the remote and then
  expect the string &quot;ogin:&quot;. If the first &quot;ogin:&quot; is
  received then the break sequence is not generated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once it received the login prompt the <i>chat</i> program will send the string
  ppp and then expect the prompt &quot;ssword:&quot;. When it receives the
  prompt for the password, it will send the password hello2u2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A carriage return is normally sent following the reply string. It is not
  expected in the &quot;expect&quot; string unless it is specifically requested
  by using the \r character sequence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The expect sequence should contain only what is needed to identify the string.
  Since it is normally stored on a disk file, it should not contain variable
  information. It is generally not acceptable to look for time strings, network
  identification strings, or other variable pieces of data as an expect string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To help correct for characters which may be corrupted during the initial
  sequence, look for the string &quot;ogin:&quot; rather than
  &quot;login:&quot;. It is possible that the leading &quot;l&quot; character
  may be received in error and you may never find the string even though it was
  sent by the system. For this reason, scripts look for &quot;ogin:&quot; rather
  than &quot;login:&quot; and &quot;ssword:&quot; rather than
  &quot;password:&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A very simple script might look like this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ogin: ppp ssword: hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In other words, expect ....ogin:, send ppp, expect ...ssword:, send hello2u2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In actual practice, simple scripts are rare. At the vary least, you should
  include sub-expect sequences should the original string not be received. For
  example, consider the following script:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ogin:--ogin: ppp ssword: hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This would be a better script than the simple one used earlier. This would look
  for the same login: prompt, however, if one was not received, a single return
  sequence is sent and then it will look for login: again. Should line noise
  obscure the first login prompt then sending the empty line will usually
  generate a login prompt again.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMENTS">COMMENTS</a></h1>
Comments can be embedded in the chat script. A comment is a line which starts
  with the <b>#</b> (hash) character in column 1. Such comment lines are just
  ignored by the chat program. If a '#' character is to be expected as the first
  character of the expect sequence, you should quote the expect string. If you
  want to wait for a prompt that starts with a # (hash) character, you would
  have to write something like this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"># Now wait for the prompt and send logout string
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    '# ' logout</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SENDING_DATA_FROM_A_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#SENDING_DATA_FROM_A_FILE">SENDING
  DATA FROM A FILE</a></h1>
If the string to send starts with an at sign (@), the rest of the string is
  taken to be the name of a file to read to get the string to send. If the last
  character of the data read is a newline, it is removed. The file can be a
  named pipe (or fifo) instead of a regular file. This provides a way for
  <b>chat</b> to communicate with another program, for example, a program to
  prompt the user and receive a password typed in.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ABORT_STRINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#ABORT_STRINGS">ABORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
Many modems will report the status of the call as a string. These strings may be
  <b>CONNECTED</b> or <b>NO CARRIER</b> or <b>BUSY</b>. It is often desirable to
  terminate the script should the modem fail to connect to the remote. The
  difficulty is that a script would not know exactly which modem string it may
  receive. On one attempt, it may receive <b>BUSY</b> while the next time it may
  receive <b>NO CARRIER</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These &quot;abort&quot; strings may be specified in the script using the
  <i>ABORT</i> sequence. It is written in the script as in the following
  example:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ABORT BUSY ABORT 'NO CARRIER' '' ATZ OK ATDT5551212
    CONNECT</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This sequence will expect nothing; and then send the string ATZ. The expected
  response to this is the string <i>OK</i>. When it receives <i>OK</i>, the
  string ATDT5551212 to dial the telephone. The expected string is
  <i>CONNECT</i>. If the string <i>CONNECT</i> is received the remainder of the
  script is executed. However, should the modem find a busy telephone, it will
  send the string <i>BUSY</i>. This will cause the string to match the abort
  character sequence. The script will then fail because it found a match to the
  abort string. If it received the string <i>NO CARRIER</i>, it will abort for
  the same reason. Either string may be received. Either string will terminate
  the <i>chat</i> script.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CLR_ABORT_STRINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#CLR_ABORT_STRINGS">CLR_ABORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
This sequence allows for clearing previously set <b>ABORT</b> strings.
  <b>ABORT</b> strings are kept in an array of a pre-determined size (at
  compilation time); <b>CLR_ABORT</b> will reclaim the space for cleared entries
  so that new strings can use that space.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SAY_STRINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#SAY_STRINGS">SAY
  STRINGS</a></h1>
The <b>SAY</b> directive allows the script to send strings to the user at the
  terminal via standard error. If <b>chat</b> is being run by pppd, and pppd is
  running as a daemon (detached from its controlling terminal), standard error
  will normally be redirected to the file /var/log/ppp/connect-errors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SAY</b> strings must be enclosed in single or double quotes. If carriage
  return and line feed are needed in the string to be output, you must
  explicitly add them to your string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The SAY strings could be used to give progress messages in sections of the
  script where you want to have 'ECHO OFF' but still let the user know what is
  happening. An example is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ABORT BUSY
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ECHO OFF
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    SAY &quot;Dialling your ISP...\n&quot;
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    '' ATDT5551212
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    TIMEOUT 120
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    SAY &quot;Waiting up to 2 minutes for connection ... &quot;
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    CONNECT ''
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    SAY &quot;Connected, now logging in ...0
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ogin: account
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ssword: pass
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    $ SAY &quot;Logged in OK ...0 <i>etc ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This sequence will only present the SAY strings to the user and all the details
  of the script will remain hidden. For example, if the above script works, the
  user will see:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Dialling your ISP...
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Waiting up to 2 minutes for connection ... Connected, now logging in ...
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Logged in OK ...</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPORT_STRINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#REPORT_STRINGS">REPORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
A <b>report</b> string is similar to the ABORT string. The difference is that
  the strings, and all characters to the next control character such as a
  carriage return, are written to the report file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The report strings may be used to isolate the transmission rate of the modem's
  connect string and return the value to the chat user. The analysis of the
  report string logic occurs in conjunction with the other string processing
  such as looking for the expect string. The use of the same string for a report
  and abort sequence is probably not very useful, however, it is possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The report strings to no change the completion code of the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These &quot;report&quot; strings may be specified in the script using the
  <i>REPORT</i> sequence. It is written in the script as in the following
  example:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">REPORT CONNECT ABORT BUSY '' ATDT5551212 CONNECT '' ogin:
      account</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This sequence will expect nothing; and then send the string ATDT5551212 to dial
  the telephone. The expected string is <i>CONNECT</i>. If the string
  <i>CONNECT</i> is received the remainder of the script is executed. In
  addition the program will write to the expect-file the string
  &quot;CONNECT&quot; plus any characters which follow it such as the connection
  rate.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CLR_REPORT_STRINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#CLR_REPORT_STRINGS">CLR_REPORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
This sequence allows for clearing previously set <b>REPORT</b> strings.
  <b>REPORT</b> strings are kept in an array of a pre-determined size (at
  compilation time); <b>CLR_REPORT</b> will reclaim the space for cleared
  entries so that new strings can use that space.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ECHO"><a class="selflink" href="#ECHO">ECHO</a></h1>
The echo options controls whether the output from the modem is echoed to
  <i>stderr</i>. This option may be set with the <i>-e</i> option, but it can
  also be controlled by the <i>ECHO</i> keyword. The &quot;expect-send&quot;
  pair <i>ECHO</i> <i>ON</i> enables echoing, and <i>ECHO</i> <i>OFF</i>
  disables it. With this keyword you can select which parts of the conversation
  should be visible. For instance, with the following script:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ABORT 'BUSY'
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    OK\r\n ATD1234567
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    \r\n \c
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ECHO ON
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    CONNECT \c
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ogin: account</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
all output resulting from modem configuration and dialing is not visible, but
  starting with the <i>CONNECT</i> (or <i>BUSY</i>) message, everything will be
  echoed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HANGUP"><a class="selflink" href="#HANGUP">HANGUP</a></h1>
The HANGUP options control whether a modem hangup should be considered as an
  error or not. This option is useful in scripts for dialling systems which will
  hang up and call your system back. The HANGUP options can be <b>ON</b> or
  <b>OFF</b>.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
When HANGUP is set OFF and the modem hangs up (e.g., after the first stage of
  logging in to a callback system), <b>chat</b> will continue running the script
  (e.g., waiting for the incoming call and second stage login prompt). As soon
  as the incoming call is connected, you should use the <b>HANGUP ON</b>
  directive to reinstall normal hang up signal behavior. Here is an (simple)
  example script:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ABORT 'BUSY'
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    OK\r\n ATD1234567
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    \r\n \c
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    CONNECT \c
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    'Callback login:' call_back_ID
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    HANGUP OFF
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ABORT &quot;Bad Login&quot;
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    'Callback Password:' Call_back_password
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    TIMEOUT 120
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    CONNECT \c
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    HANGUP ON
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot;
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ogin:--BREAK--ogin: real_account
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>etc ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TIMEOUT"><a class="selflink" href="#TIMEOUT">TIMEOUT</a></h1>
The initial timeout value is 45 seconds. This may be changed using the <b>-t</b>
  parameter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To change the timeout value for the next expect string, the following example
  may be used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ATZ OK ATDT5551212 CONNECT TIMEOUT 10 ogin:--ogin: TIMEOUT
      5 assword: hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will change the timeout to 10 seconds when it expects the login: prompt.
  The timeout is then changed to 5 seconds when it looks for the password
  prompt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The timeout, once changed, remains in effect until it is changed again.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SENDING_EOT"><a class="selflink" href="#SENDING_EOT">SENDING
  EOT</a></h1>
The special reply string of <i>EOT</i> indicates that the chat program should
  send an EOT character to the remote. This is normally the End-of-file
  character sequence. A return character is not sent following the EOT. The EOT
  sequence may be embedded into the send string using the sequence <i>^D</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GENERATING_BREAK"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERATING_BREAK">GENERATING
  BREAK</a></h1>
The special reply string of <i>BREAK</i> will cause a break condition to be
  sent. The break is a special signal on the transmitter. The normal processing
  on the receiver is to change the transmission rate. It may be used to cycle
  through the available transmission rates on the remote until you are able to
  receive a valid login prompt. The break sequence may be embedded into the send
  string using the <i>\K</i> sequence.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ESCAPE_SEQUENCES"><a class="selflink" href="#ESCAPE_SEQUENCES">ESCAPE
  SEQUENCES</a></h1>
The expect and reply strings may contain escape sequences. All of the sequences
  are legal in the reply string. Many are legal in the expect. Those which are
  not valid in the expect sequence are so indicated.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>''</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Expects or sends a null string. If you send a null string
      then it will still send the return character. This sequence may either be
      a pair of apostrophe or quote characters.</dd>

  VARIABLES</a></h1>
Environment variables are available within chat scripts, if the <i>-E</i> option
  was specified in the command line. The metacharacter <i>$</i> is used to
  introduce the name of the environment variable to substitute. If the
  substitution fails, because the requested environment variable is not set,
  <i>nothing</i> is replaced for the variable.

  CODES</a></h1>
The <i>chat</i> program will terminate with the following completion codes.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>0</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The normal termination of the program. This indicates that
      the script was executed without error to the normal conclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">One or more of the parameters are invalid or an expect
      string was too large for the internal buffers. This indicates that the
      program as not properly executed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An error occurred during the execution of the program. This
      may be due to a read or write operation failing for some reason or chat
      receiving a signal such as SIGINT.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>3</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A timeout event occurred when there was an <i>expect</i>
      string without having a &quot;-subsend&quot; string. This may mean that
      you did not program the script correctly for the condition or that some
      unexpected event has occurred and the expected string could not be
    found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>4</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The first string marked as an <i>ABORT</i> condition
      occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>5</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The second string marked as an <i>ABORT</i> condition
      occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>6</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The third string marked as an <i>ABORT</i> condition
      occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>7</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The fourth string marked as an <i>ABORT</i> condition
      occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>...</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The other termination codes are also strings marked as an
      <i>ABORT</i> condition.</dd>
</dl>

Using the termination code, it is possible to determine which event terminated
  the script. It is possible to decide if the string &quot;BUSY&quot; was
  received from the modem as opposed to &quot;NO DIAL TONE&quot;. While the
  first event may be retried, the second will probably have little chance of
  succeeding during a retry.
