<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chat - Automated conversational script with a modem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chat [ options ] script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The chat program defines a conversational exchange between
the computer and the modem. Its primary purpose is to
establish the connection between the Point-to-Point Protocol
Dae&acirc; <br>
mon (pppd) and the remote&rsquo;s pppd process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f &lt;chat file&gt; <br>
Read the chat script from the chat file. The use of this
option is mutually exclusive with the chat script
parameters. The user must have read access to the file.
Multiple <br>
lines are permitted in the file. Space or horizontal tab
characters should be used to separate the strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;timeout&gt; <br>
Set the timeout for the expected string to be received. If
the string is not received within the time limit then the
reply string is not sent. An alternate reply may be <br>
sent or the script will fail if there is no alternate reply
string. A failed script will cause the chat program to
terminate with a non-zero error code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;report file&gt; <br>
Set the file for output of the report strings. If you use
the keyword REPORT, the resulting strings are written to
this file. If this option is not used and you still use <br>
REPORT keywords, the stderr file is used for the report
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Start with the echo option
turned on. Echoing may also be turned on or off at specific
points in the chat script by using the ECHO keyword. When
echoing is enabled, all <br>
output from the modem is echoed to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Enables environment variable
substitution within chat scripts using the standard $xxx
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Request that the chat script
be executed in a verbose mode. The chat program will then
log the execution state of the chat script as well as all
text received from the <br>
modem and the output strings sent to the modem. The default
is to log through the SYSLOG; the logging method may be
altered with the -S and -s flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Request that the chat script
be executed in a stderr verbose mode. The chat program will
then log all text received from the modem and the output
strings sent to the modem <br>
to the stderr device. This device is usually the local
console at the station running the chat or pppd program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Use stderr. All log messages
from &rsquo;-v&rsquo; and all error messages will be sent to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Do not use the SYSLOG. By
default, error messages are sent to the SYSLOG. The use of
-S will prevent both log messages from &rsquo;-v&rsquo; and
error messages from being sent to <br>
the SYSLOG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;phone number&gt; <br>
Pass in an arbitrary string, usually a phone number, that
will be substituted for the T substitution metacharacter in
a send string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U &lt;phone number 2&gt; <br>
Pass in a second string, usually a phone number, that will
be substituted for the U substitution metacharacter in a
send string. This is useful when dialing an ISDN ter&acirc;
<br>
minal adapter that requires two numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script If the script is not
specified in a file with the -f option then the script is
included as parameters to the chat program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHAT SCRIPT <br>
The chat script defines the communications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A script consists of one or more
&quot;expect-send&quot; pairs of strings, separated by
spaces, with an optional &quot;subexpect-subsend&quot;
string pair, separated by a dash as in the following <br>
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ogin:-BREAK-ogin: ppp ssword:
hello2u2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This line indicates that the
chat program should expect the string &quot;ogin:&quot;. If
it fails to receive a login prompt within the time interval
allotted, it is to send a break <br>
sequence to the remote and then expect the string
&quot;ogin:&quot;. If the first &quot;ogin:&quot; is
received then the break sequence is not generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once it received the login
prompt the chat program will send the string ppp and then
expect the prompt &quot;ssword:&quot;. When it receives the
prompt for the password, it will send the <br>
password hello2u2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A carriage return is normally
sent following the reply string. It is not expected in the
&quot;expect&quot; string unless it ischaracter sequence.
specifically requested by using the</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expect sequence should
contain only what is needed to identify the string. Since it
is normally stored on a disk file, it should not contain
variable information. It is gen&acirc; <br>
erally not acceptable to look for time strings, network
identification strings, or other variable pieces of data as
an expect string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To help correct for characters
which may be corrupted during the initial sequence, look for
the string &quot;ogin:&quot; rather than &quot;login:&quot;.
It is possible that the leading &quot;l&quot; character <br>
may be received in error and you may never find the string
even though it was sent by the system. For this reason,
scripts look for &quot;ogin:&quot; rather than
&quot;login:&quot; and &quot;ssword:&quot; <br>
rather than &quot;password:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A very simple script might look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ogin: ppp ssword: hello2u2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, expect
....ogin:, send ppp, expect ...ssword:, send hello2u2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In actual practice, simple
scripts are rare. At the vary least, you should include
sub-expect sequences should the original string not be
received. For example, consider the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ogin:--ogin: ppp ssword:
hello2u2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would be a better script
than the simple one used earlier. This would look for the
same login: prompt, however, if one was not received, a
single return sequence is sent and <br>
then it will look for login: again. Should line noise
obscure the first login prompt then sending the empty line
will usually generate a login prompt again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMENTS <br>
Comments can be embedded in the chat script. A comment is a
line which starts with the # (hash) character in column 1.
Such comment lines are just ignored by the chat program. If
<br>
a &rsquo;#&rsquo; character is to be expected as the first
character of the expect sequence, you should quote the
expect string. If you want to wait for a prompt that starts
with a # (hash) <br>
character, you would have to write something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Now wait for the prompt and
send logout string <br>
&rsquo;# &rsquo; logout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDING DATA FROM A FILE <br>
If the string to send starts with an at sign (@), the rest
of the string is taken to be the name of a file to read to
get the string to send. If the last character of the data
<br>
read is a newline, it is removed. The file can be a named
pipe (or fifo) instead of a regular file. This provides a
way for chat to communicate with another program, for
exam&acirc; <br>
ple, a program to prompt the user and receive a password
typed in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT STRINGS <br>
Many modems will report the status of the call as a string.
These strings may be CONNECTED or NO CARRIER or BUSY. It is
often desirable to terminate the script should the modem
<br>
fail to connect to the remote. The difficulty is that a
script would not know exactly which modem string it may
receive. On one attempt, it may receive BUSY while the next
time <br>
it may receive NO CARRIER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These &quot;abort&quot; strings
may be specified in the script using the ABORT sequence. It
is written in the script as in the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT BUSY ABORT &rsquo;NO
CARRIER&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo; ATZ OK ATDT5551212 CONNECT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sequence will expect
nothing; and then send the string ATZ. The expected response
to this is the string OK. When it receives OK, the string
ATDT5551212 to dial the tele&acirc; <br>
phone. The expected string is CONNECT. If the string CONNECT
is received the remainder of the script is executed.
However, should the modem find a busy telephone, it will
send <br>
the string BUSY. This will cause the string to match the
abort character sequence. The script will then fail because
it found a match to the abort string. If it received the
<br>
string NO CARRIER, it will abort for the same reason. Either
string may be received. Either string will terminate the
chat script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLR_ABORT STRINGS <br>
This sequence allows for clearing previously set ABORT
strings. ABORT strings are kept in an array of a
pre-determined size (at compilation time); CLR_ABORT will
reclaim the <br>
space for cleared entries so that new strings can use that
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAY STRINGS <br>
The SAY directive allows the script to send strings to the
user at the terminal via standard error. If chat is being
run by pppd, and pppd is running as a daemon (detached from
<br>
its controlling terminal), standard error will normally be
redirected to the file /var/log/ppp/connect-errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAY strings must be enclosed in
single or double quotes. If carriage return and line feed
are needed in the string to be output, you must explicitly
add them to your string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SAY strings could be used to
give progress messages in sections of the script where you
want to have &rsquo;ECHO OFF&rsquo; but still let the user
know what is happening. An example is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT BUSY <br>
ECHO OFF <br>
SAY &quot;Dialling your ISP...0 <br>
&rsquo;&rsquo; ATDT5551212 <br>
TIMEOUT 120 <br>
SAY &quot;Waiting up to 2 minutes for connection ... &quot;
<br>
CONNECT &rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
SAY &quot;Connected, now logging in ...0 <br>
ogin: account <br>
ssword: pass <br>
$ SAY &quot;Logged in OK ...0 etc ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sequence will only present
the SAY strings to the user and all the details of the
script will remain hidden. For example, if the above script
works, the user will see:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dialling your ISP... <br>
Waiting up to 2 minutes for connection ... Connected, now
logging in ... <br>
Logged in OK ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT STRINGS <br>
A report string is similar to the ABORT string. The
difference is that the strings, and all characters to the
next control character such as a carriage return, are
written to the <br>
report file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report strings may be used
to isolate the transmission rate of the modem&rsquo;s
connect string and return the value to the chat user. The
analysis of the report string logic <br>
occurs in conjunction with the other string processing such
as looking for the expect string. The use of the same string
for a report and abort sequence is probably not very
use&acirc; <br>
ful, however, it is possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report strings to no change
the completion code of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These &quot;report&quot; strings
may be specified in the script using the REPORT sequence. It
is written in the script as in the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT CONNECT ABORT BUSY
&rsquo;&rsquo; ATDT5551212 CONNECT &rsquo;&rsquo; ogin:
account</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sequence will expect
nothing; and then send the string ATDT5551212 to dial the
telephone. The expected string is CONNECT. If the string
CONNECT is received the remainder of <br>
the script is executed. In addition the program will write
to the expect-file the string &quot;CONNECT&quot; plus any
characters which follow it such as the connection rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLR_REPORT STRINGS <br>
This sequence allows for clearing previously set REPORT
strings. REPORT strings are kept in an array of a
pre-determined size (at compilation time); CLR_REPORT will
reclaim the <br>
space for cleared entries so that new strings can use that
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECHO <br>
The echo options controls whether the output from the modem
is echoed to stderr. This option may be set with the -e
option, but it can also be controlled by the ECHO keyword.
The <br>
&quot;expect-send&quot; pair ECHO ON enables echoing, and
ECHO OFF disables it. With this keyword you can select which
parts of the conversation should be visible. For instance,
with the <br>
following script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT &rsquo;BUSY&rsquo; <br>
ABORT &rsquo;NO CARRIER&rsquo;ATD1234567 <br>
OK <br>
ECHO ON <br>
CONNECT ogin: account</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all output resulting from modem
configuration and dialing is not visible, but starting with
the CONNECT (or BUSY) message, everything will be
echoed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HANGUP <br>
The HANGUP options control whether a modem hangup should be
considered as an error or not. This option is useful in
scripts for dialling systems which will hang up and call
your <br>
system back. The HANGUP options can be ON or OFF. <br>
When HANGUP is set OFF and the modem hangs up (e.g., after
the first stage of logging in to a callback system), chat
will continue running the script (e.g., waiting for the <br>
incoming call and second stage login prompt). As soon as the
incoming call is connected, you should use the HANGUP ON
directive to reinstall normal hang up signal behavior. Here
<br>
is an (simple) example script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT
&rsquo;BUSY&rsquo;ATD1234567 <br>
OK <br>
CONNECT &rsquo;Callback login:&rsquo; call_back_ID <br>
HANGUP OFF <br>
ABORT &quot;Bad Login&quot; <br>
&rsquo;Callback Password:&rsquo; Call_back_password <br>
TIMEOUT 120 <br>
CONNECT HANGUP ON <br>
ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; <br>
ogin:--BREAK--ogin: real_account <br>
etc ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMEOUT <br>
The initial timeout value is 45 seconds. This may be changed
using the -t parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To change the timeout value for
the next expect string, the following example may be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATZ OK ATDT5551212 CONNECT
TIMEOUT 10 ogin:--ogin: TIMEOUT 5 assword: hello2u2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will change the timeout to
10 seconds when it expects the login: prompt. The timeout is
then changed to 5 seconds when it looks for the password
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timeout, once changed,
remains in effect until it is changed again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDING EOT <br>
The special reply string of EOT indicates that the chat
program should send an EOT character to the remote. This is
normally the End-of-file character sequence. A return
charac&acirc; <br>
ter is not sent following the EOT. The EOT sequence may be
embedded into the send string using the sequence ^D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATING BREAK <br>
The special reply string of BREAK will cause a break
condition to be sent. The break is a special signal on the
transmitter. The normal processing on the receiver is to
change <br>
the transmission rate. It may be used to cycle through the
available transmission rates on the remote until you are
able to receive a valid login prompt. The break sequence may
<br>
be embedded into the send string using the K sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCAPE SEQUENCES <br>
The expect and reply strings may contain escape sequences.
All of the sequences are legal in the reply string. Many are
legal in the expect. Those which are not valid in the <br>
expect sequence are so indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;&rsquo; Expects or sends
a null string. If you send a null string then it will still
send the return character. This sequence may either be a
pair of apostrophe or quote charac&acirc; <br>
ters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">represents a backspace
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string. For example, the
sequence hello <br>
Delay for one second. The program uses sleep(1) which will
delay to a maximum of one second. (not valid in expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K Insert a BREAK (not valid in
expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send a newline or linefeed
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send a null character. The same
sequence may be represented by . (not valid in expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pause for a fraction of a
second. The delay is 1/10th of a second. (not valid in
expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Suppress writing the string to
the SYSLOG file. The string ?????? is written to the log in
its place. (not valid in expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send or expect a carriage
return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Represents a space character in
the string. This may be used when it is not desirable to
quote the strings which contains spaces. The sequence
&rsquo;HI TIM&rsquo; and HIM are the <br>
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send or expect a tab
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Send the phone number string
as specified with the -T option (not valid in expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Send the phone number 2 string
as specified with the -U option (not valid in expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">\ Send or expect a backslash
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd Collapse the octal digits
(ddd) into a single ASCII character and send that character.
(some characters are not valid in expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^C Substitute the sequence with
the control character represented by C. For example, the
character DC1 (17) is shown as ^Q. (some characters are not
valid in expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
Environment variables are available within chat scripts, if
the -E option was specified in the command line. The
metacharacter $ is used to introduce the name of the
environment <br>
variable to substitute. If the substitution fails, because
the requested environment variable is not set, nothing is
replaced for the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINATION CODES <br>
The chat program will terminate with the following
completion codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The normal termination of the
program. This indicates that the script was executed without
error to the normal conclusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 One or more of the parameters
are invalid or an expect string was too large for the
internal buffers. This indicates that the program as not
properly executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 An error occurred during the
execution of the program. This may be due to a read or write
operation failing for some reason or chat receiving a signal
such as SIGINT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 A timeout event occurred when
there was an expect string without having a
&quot;-subsend&quot; string. This may mean that you did not
program the script correctly for the condition <br>
or that some unexpected event has occurred and the expected
string could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 The first string marked as an
ABORT condition occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 The second string marked as an
ABORT condition occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 The third string marked as an
ABORT condition occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 The fourth string marked as an
ABORT condition occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... The other termination codes
are also strings marked as an ABORT condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the termination code, it
is possible to determine which event terminated the script.
It is possible to decide if the string &quot;BUSY&quot; was
received from the modem as opposed to <br>
&quot;NO DIAL TONE&quot;. While the first event may be
retried, the second will probably have little chance of
succeeding during a retry.</p>
