<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
memtester - stress test to find memory subsystem faults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
memtester [-p PHYSADDR [-d DEVICE]] &lt;MEMORY&gt;
[ITERATIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
memtester is an effective userspace tester for
stress-testing the memory subsystem. It is very effective at
finding intermittent and non-deterministic faults. Note that
prob&acirc; <br>
lems in other hardware areas (overheating CPU,
out-of-specification power supply, etc.) can cause
intermittent memory faults, so it is still up to you to
determine where the <br>
fault lies through normal hardware diagnostic procedures;
memtester just helps you determine whether a problem
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memtester will malloc(3) the
amount of memory specified, if possible. If this fails, it
will decrease the amount of memory requested until it
succeeds. It will then attempt to <br>
mlock(3) this memory; if it cannot do so, testing will be
slower and much less effective. Run memtester as root so
that it can mlock the memory it tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the maximum amount of
memory that memtester can test will be less than the total
amount of memory installed in the system; the operating
system, libraries, and other <br>
system limits take some of the available memory. memtester
is also limited to the amount of memory available to a
single process; for example, on 32-bit machines with more
than <br>
4GB of memory, memtester is still limited to less than
4GB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it is up to you to
know how much memory you can safely allocate for testing. If
you attempt to allocate more memory than is available,
memtester should figure that <br>
out, reduce the amount slightly, and try again. However,
this can lead to memtester successfully allocating and
mlocking essentially all free memory on the system -- if
other <br>
programs are running, this can lead to excessive swapping
and slowing the system down to the point that it is
difficult to use. If the system allows allocation of more
memory <br>
than is actually available (overcommit), it may lead to a
deadlock, where the system halts. If the system has an
out-of-memory process killer (like Linux), memtester or
another <br>
process may be killed by the OOM killer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So choose wisely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p PHYSADDR <br>
tells memtester to test a specific region of memory starting
at physical address PHYSADDR (given in hex), by mmap(2)ing a
device specified by the -d option (below, or <br>
/dev/mem by default). This is mostly of use to hardware
developers, for testing memory-mapped I/O devices and
similar. Note that the memory region will be overwritten
<br>
during testing, so it is not safe to specify memory which is
allocated for the system or for other applications; doing so
will cause them to crash. If you absolutely must <br>
test a particular region of actual physical memory, arrange
to have that memory allocated by your test software, and
hold it in this allocated state, then run memtester on <br>
it with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMORY the amount of memory to
allocate and test, in megabytes by default. You can include
a suffix of B, K, M, or G to indicate bytes, kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes <br>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ITERATIONS <br>
(optional) number of loops to iterate through. Default is
infinite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If the environment variable MEMTESTER_TEST_MASK is set,
memtester treats the value as a bitmask of which tests
(other than the stuck address test) to run. The value can be
spec&acirc; <br>
ified in decimal, in octal (with a leading 0), or in
hexadecimal (with a leading 0x). The specific bit values
corresponding to particular tests may change from release to
<br>
release; consult the list of tests in the source for the
appropriate index values for the version of memtester you
are running. Note that skipping some tests will reduce the
<br>
time it takes for memtester to run, but also reduce
memtester&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
memtester must be run with root privileges to mlock(3) its
pages. Testing memory without locking the pages in place is
mostly pointless and slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
memtester&rsquo;s exit code is 0 when everything works
properly. Otherwise, it is the logical OR of the following
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x01 error allocating or locking
memory, or invocation error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x02 error during stuck address
test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x04 error during one of the
other tests</p>
