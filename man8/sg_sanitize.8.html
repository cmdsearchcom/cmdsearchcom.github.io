<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_sanitize - remove all user data from disk with SCSI
SANITIZE command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_sanitize [--ause] [--block] [--count=OC] [--crypto]
[--early] [--fail] [--help] [--invert] [--ipl=LEN]
[--overwrite] [--pattern=PF] [--quick] [--test=TE]
[--verbose] [--ver&acirc; <br>
sion] [--wait] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility invokes the SCSI SANITIZE command. This command
was first introduced in the SBC-3 revision 27 draft. The
purpose of the sanitize operation is to alter the
informa&acirc; <br>
tion in the cache and on the medium of a logical unit (e.g.
a disk) so that the recovery of user data is not possible.
If that user data cannot be erased, or is in the process of
<br>
being erased, then the sanitize operation prevents access to
that user data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a SCSI SANITIZE command has
successfully started, then user data from that disk is no
longer available. Even if the disk is power cycled, the
sanitize operation will con&acirc; <br>
tinue after power is re-instated until it is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility requires either the
--block, --crypto, --fail or --overwrite option. With the
--block, --crypto or --overwrite option the user is given 15
seconds to reconsider <br>
whether they wish to erase all the data on a disk, unless
the --quick option is given in which case the sanitize
operation starts immediately. The disk&rsquo;s INQUIRY
response strings <br>
are printed out just in case the wrong DEVICE has been
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --early option is given
this utility will exit soon after starting the SANITIZE
command with the IMMED bit set. The user can monitor the
progress of the sanitize operation <br>
with the &quot;sg_request --num=9999 --progress&quot; which
sends a REQUEST SENSE command every 30 seconds. Otherwise if
the --wait option is given then this utility will wait until
the <br>
SANITIZE command completes (or fails) and that can be many
hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the --early nor
--wait option is given then the SANITIZE command is started
with the IMMED bit set. After that this utility sends a
REQUEST SENSE command every 60 sec&acirc; <br>
onds until there are no more progress indications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. The options are arranged in alphabetical order based
on the long option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --ause <br>
sets the AUSE bit in the cdb. AUSE is an acronym for
&quot;allow unrestricted sanitize exit&quot;. Default action
is to leave the bit cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --block <br>
perform a &quot;block erase&quot; sanitize operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --count=OC <br>
where OC is the &quot;overwrite count&quot; associated with
the &quot;overwrite&quot; sanitize operation. OC can be a
value between 1 and 31 and 1 is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --crypto <br>
perform a &quot;cryptographic erase&quot; sanitize
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --early <br>
the default action of this utility is to poll the disk every
60 seconds to fetch the progress indication until the
sanitize is finished. When this option is given this <br>
utility will exit &quot;early&quot; as soon as the sanitize
has commenced. This option and --wait cannot both be
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fail <br>
perform an &quot;exit failure mode&quot; sanitize operation.
Typically requires the preceding SANITIZE command to have
set the AUSE bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print out the usage information then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ipl=LEN <br>
set the initialization pattern length to LEN bytes. By
default it is set to the length of the pattern file (PF).
Only active when the --overwrite option is also given. It
<br>
is the number of bytes from the PF file that will be used as
the initialization pattern. The minimum size is 1 byte and
the maximum is the logical block size of the DEVICE <br>
(and not to exceed 65535). If LEN exceeds the PF file size
then the initialization pattern is padded with zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --invert <br>
set the INVERT bit in the overwrite service action parameter
list. This only affects the &quot;overwrite&quot; sanitize
operation. The default is a clear INVERT bit. When the
INVERT <br>
bit is set then the initialization pattern is inverted
between consecutive overwrite passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --overwrite <br>
perform an &quot;overwrite&quot; sanitize operation. When
this option is given then the --pattern=PF option is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pattern=PF <br>
where PF is the filename of a file containing the
initialization pattern required by an &quot;overwrite&quot;
sanitize operation. The length of this file will be used as
the length <br>
of the initialization pattern unless the --ipl=LEN option is
given. The length of the initialization pattern must be from
1 to the logical block size of the DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --quick <br>
the default action (i.e. when the option is not given) is to
give the user 15 seconds to reconsider doing a sanitize
operation on the DEVICE. When this option is given <br>
that step (i.e. the 15 second warning period) is
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --test=TE <br>
set the TEST field in the overwrite service action parameter
list. This only affects the &quot;overwrite&quot; sanitize
operation. The default is to place 0 in that field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wait <br>
the default action (i.e. without this option and the --early
option) is to start the SANITIZE command with the IMMED bit
set then poll for the progress indication with the <br>
REQUEST SENSE command until the sanitize operation is
complete (or fails). When this option is given (and the
--early option is not given) then the SANITIZE command is
<br>
started with the IMMED bit clear. For a large disk this
might take hours. [A cryptographic erase operation could
potentially be very quick.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The SCSI SANITIZE command is closely related to the ATA
SANITIZE command, both are relatively new with the ATA
command being the first one defined. The SCSI to ATA
Translation <br>
(SAT) definition for the SCSI SANITIZE command appeared in
the SAT-3 revision 4 draft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SCSI SANITIZE command is
related to the SCSI FORMAT UNIT command. It is likely that a
block erase sanitize operation would take a similar amount
of time as a format on the <br>
same disk (e.g. 9 hours for a 2 Terabyte disk). The primary
goal of a format is the configuration of the disk at the end
of a format (e.g. different logical block size or
protec&acirc; <br>
tion information added). Removal of user data is only a side
effect of a format. With the SCSI SANITIZE command, removal
of user data is the primary goal. If a sanitize opera&acirc;
<br>
tion is interrupted (e.g. the disk is power cycled) then
after power up any remaining user data will not be available
and the sanitize operation will continue. When a format is
<br>
interrupted (e.g. the disk is power cycled) the drafts say
very little about the state of the disk. In practice some of
the original user data may remain and the format may need
<br>
to be restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finding out whether a disk (SCSI
or ATA) supports SANITIZE can be a challenge. If the user
really needs to find out and no other information is
available then try &rsquo;sg_sanitize <br>
--fail -vvv &lt;device&gt;&rsquo; and observe the sense data
returned may be the safest approach. Using the --fail
variant of this utility should have no effect unless it
follows an already <br>
failed sanitize operation. If the SCSI REPORT SUPPORTED
OPERATION CODES command (see sg_opcodes) is supported then
using it would be a better approach for finding if sanitize
is <br>
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device
names in other supported Operating Systems see the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a precaution if this utility
is called with no options then apart from printing a usage
message, nothing happens:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_sanitize /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do a &quot;block erase&quot;
sanitize the --block option is required. The user will be
given a 15 second period to reconsider, the SCSI SANITIZE
command will be started with the IMMED <br>
bit set, then this utility will poll for a progress
indication with a REQUEST SENSE command until the sanitize
operation is finished:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_sanitize --block /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start a &quot;block
erase&quot; sanitize and return from this utility once it is
started (but not yet completed) use the --early option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_sanitize --block --early
/dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the 15 second reconsideration
time is not required add the --quick option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_sanitize --block --quick
--early /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do an &quot;overwrite&quot;
sanitize a pattern file is required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_sanitize --overwrite
--pattern=rand.img /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the length of that
&quot;rand.img&quot; is 512 bytes (a typically logical block
size) then to use only the first 17 bytes (repeatedly) in
the &quot;overwrite&quot; sanitize operation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_sanitize --overwrite
--pattern=rand.img --ipl=17 /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_sanitize is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page. Unless the --wait
option is given, the exit status may not reflect the success
<br>
of otherwise of the format.</p>
