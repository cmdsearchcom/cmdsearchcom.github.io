<p>zcav(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual zcav(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zcav - program to test raw hard drive throughput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
zcav [-b block-size[:chunk-size]] [-c count] [-r
[first-block]:last-block] [-w] [-s skip-rate] [-u
uid-to-use:gid-to-use] [-g gid-to-use] [-l log-file] [-f]
file-name [-l <br>
log-file [-f] file-name]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the zcav, program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modern hard drives have a
constant rotational speed but have varying numbers of
sectors per track (outside tracks are longer and have more
sectors). This is referred to as Zoned <br>
Constant Angular Velocity (or ZCAV). The outer tracks will
have a higher data transfer rate due to having more sectors
per track, these tracks generally have the lower
track/sec&acirc; <br>
tor numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program tests the ZCAV
performance of a hard drive, by reading the entire data on
it a specified number of times. The file name given as the
first parameter, it can be spec&acirc; <br>
ified as -, for standard input. This file will be opened as
read-only and in usual operation it will be /dev/hdX or
/dev/ide/host0/busX/targetY/lun0/disc depending on whether
you <br>
use devfs or not (NB operating systems other than Linux will
have different device names).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output should be able to be
easily graphed with gnuplot which is what I use to view the
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b the size (in Meg) of the blocks to read/write (default
512M), optionally followed by a &rsquo;:&rsquo; and the
chunk size for read/write operations (default 1M). Note that
the chunk <br>
size must be less than or equal to the block size and must
also be significantly less than the size of the RAM in the
machine. Also note that for the write test there <br>
will be a fsync() after writing every chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c the number of times to
read/write the entire disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r the range of data (in Meg) to
read/write on each pass (default the entire device). Useful
if you want to quickly test part of a large drive. If a
single number is given <br>
then that is the last block to read, if two numbers then
it&rsquo;s the start and end of a range. Values are in megs,
but they are rounded down to the block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s skip rate. The option -s 10
will cause it to read every 10th block and skip the rest.
Accepts values from 2 to 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f the file-name for the input
data. This isn&rsquo;t needed on well configured systems
that have a recent Glibc where you can specify the file name
without the -f flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user-id to use. When running
as root specify the UID to run the tests as, it is not
recommended to use root, so if you want to run as root use
-u root. Also if you want <br>
to specify the group to run as then use the user:group
format. If you specify a user by name but no group then the
primary group of that user will be chosen. If you <br>
specify a user by number and no group then the group will be
nogroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g group-id to use. Same as
using :group for the -u parameter, just a different way to
specify it for compatibility with other programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w write zero blocks to the disk
instead of reading from the disk - will destroy data!</p>
