<p>SASLAUTHD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
SASLAUTHD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
saslauthd &acirc; sasl authentication server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
saslauthd -a authmech [-Tvdchlr] [-O option] [-m mux_path]
[-n threads] [-s size] [-t timeout]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
saslauthd is a daemon process that handles plaintext
authentication requests on behalf of the SASL library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server fulfills two roles:
it isolates all code requiring superuser privileges into a
single process, and it can be used to provide proxy
authentication services to clients <br>
that do not understand SASL based authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saslauthd should be started from
the system boot scripts when going to multi-user mode. When
running against a protected authentication database (e.g.
the shadow mechanism), it <br>
must be run as the superuser. Otherwise it is recommended to
run daemon unprivileged as saslauth:saslauth. You can do so
by following these steps: <br>
1. create directory /etc/systemd/system/saslauthd.service.d/
<br>
2. create file
/etc/systemd/system/saslauthd.service.d/user.conf with
content</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Service] <br>
User=saslauth <br>
Group=saslauth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Reload systemd service file:
run &acirc;systemctl daemon-reload&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
Options named by lower-case letters configure the server
itself. Upper-case options control the behavior of specific
authentication mechanisms; their applicability to a
particular <br>
authentication mechanism is described in the AUTHENTICATION
MECHANISMS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a authmech <br>
Use authmech as the authentication mechanism. (See the
AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS section below.) This parameter is
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O option <br>
A mechanism specific option (e.g. rimap hostname or config
file path)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H hostname <br>
The remote host to be contacted by the rimap authentication
mechanism. (Deprecated, use -O instead)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m path <br>
Use path as the pathname to the named socket to listen on
for connection requests. This must be an absolute pathname,
and MUST NOT include the trailing &quot;/mux&quot;. Note
that <br>
the default for this value is
&quot;/var/state/saslauthd&quot; (or what was specified at
compile time) and that this directory must exist for
saslauthd to function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n threads <br>
Use threads processes for responding to authentication
queries. (default: 5) A value of zero will indicate that
saslauthd should fork an individual process for each
con&acirc; <br>
nection. This can solve leaks that occur in some
deployments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size <br>
Use size as the table size of the hash table (in
kilobytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Use timeout as the expiration time of the authentication
cache (in seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Honour time-of-day login
restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show usage information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Enable caching of
authentication credentials</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Disable the use of a lock
file for controlling access to accept().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Combine the realm with the
login (with an &rsquo;@&rsquo; sign in between). e.g. login:
&quot;foo&quot; realm: &quot;bar&quot; will get passed as
login: &quot;foo@bar&quot;. Note that the realm will still
be <br>
passed, which may lead to unexpected behavior for
authentication mechanisms that make use of the realm,
however for mechanisms which don&rsquo;t, such as getpwent,
this is the <br>
only way to authenticate domain-specific users sharing the
same userid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number and
available authentication mechanisms on standard error, then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debugging mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging <br>
saslauthd logs its activities via syslogd using the LOG_AUTH
facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS <br>
saslauthd supports one or more &quot;authentication
mechanisms&quot;, dependent upon the facilities provided by
the underlying operating system. The mechanism is selected
by the -a flag <br>
from the following list of choices:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dce (AIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate using the DCE
authentication environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getpwent (All platforms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate using the
getpwent() library function. Typically this authenticates
against the local password file. See your system&rsquo;s
getpwent(3) man page for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kerberos4 (All platforms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate against the local
Kerberos 4 realm. (See the NOTES section for caveats about
this driver.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kerberos5 (All platforms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate against the local
Kerberos 5 realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pam (Linux, Solaris)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate using Pluggable
Authentication Modules (PAM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rimap (All platforms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forward authentication requests
to a remote IMAP server. This driver connects to a remote
IMAP server, specified using the -O flag, and attempts to
login (via an IMAP <br>
&acirc;LOGIN&acirc; command) using the credentials supplied
to the local server. If the remote authentication succeeds
the local connection is also considered to be authenticated.
<br>
The remote connection is closed as soon as the tagged
response from the &acirc;LOGIN&acirc; command is received
from the remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option parameter to the -O
flag describes the remote server to forward authentication
requests to. hostname can be a hostname (imap.example.com)
or a dotted-quad IP <br>
address (192.168.0.1). The latter is useful if the remote
server is multi-homed and has network interfaces that are
unreachable from the local IMAP server. The remote <br>
host is contacted on the &acirc;imap&acirc; service port. A
non-default port can be specified by appending a slash and
the port name or number to the hostname argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -O flag and argument are
mandatory when using the rimap mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shadow (AIX, Irix, Linux,
Solaris)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate against the local
&quot;shadow password file&quot;. The exact mechanism is
system dependent. saslauthd currently understands the
getspnam() and getuserpw() library <br>
routines. Some systems honour the -T flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sasldb (All platforms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate against the SASL
authentication database. Note that this is probably not what
you want to use, and is even disabled at compile-time by
default. If you <br>
want to use sasldb with the SASL library, you probably want
to use the pwcheck_method of &quot;auxprop&quot; along with
the sasldb auxprop plugin instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ldap (All platforms that support
OpenLDAP 2.0 or higher)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate against an ldap
server. The ldap configuration parameters are read from
/etc/saslauthd.conf. The location of this file can be
changed with the -O parame&acirc; <br>
ter. See the LDAP_SASLAUTHD file included with the
distribution for the list of available parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sia (Digital UNIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authenticate using the Digital
UNIX Security Integration Architecture (a.k.a.
&quot;enhanced security&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The kerberos4 authentication driver consumes considerable
resources. To perform an authentication it must obtain a
ticket granting ticket from the TGT server on every <br>
authentication request. The Kerberos library routines that
obtain the TGT also create a local ticket file, on the
reasonable assumption that you will want to save the TGT for
use <br>
by other Kerberos applications. These ticket files are
unusable by saslauthd , however there is no way not to
create them. The overhead of creating and removing these
ticket files <br>
can cause serious performance degradation on busy servers.
(Kerberos was never intended to be used in this manner,
anyway.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/run/saslauthd/mux The default communications socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/saslauthd.conf <br>
The default configuration file for ldap support.</p>
