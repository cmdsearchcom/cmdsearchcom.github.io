<p>ZIC(8) Linux System Administration ZIC(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zic - timezone compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
zic [ -v ] [ -d directory ] [ -l localtime ] [ -p posixrules
] [ -L leapsecondfilename ] [ -s ] [ -y command ] [ filename
... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Zic reads text from the file(s) named on the command line
and creates the time conversion information files specified
in this input. If a filename is -, the standard input is
<br>
read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory <br>
Create time conversion information files in the named
directory rather than in the standard directory named
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l timezone <br>
Use the given timezone as local time. Zic will act as if the
input contained a link line of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link timezone localtime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p timezone <br>
Use the given timezone&rsquo;s rules when handling
POSIX-format timezone environment variables. Zic will act as
if the input contained a link line of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link timezone posixrules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L leapsecondfilename <br>
Read leap second information from the file with the given
name. If this option is not used, no leap second information
appears in output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Complain if a year that
appears in a data file is outside the range of years
representable by time(2) values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Limit time values stored in
output files to values that are the same whether
they&rsquo;re taken to be signed or unsigned. You can use
this option to generate SVVS-compatible <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y command <br>
Use the given command rather than yearistype when checking
year types (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input lines are made up of
fields. Fields are separated from one another by any number
of white space characters. Leading and trailing white space
on input lines is ignored. <br>
An unquoted sharp character (#) in the input introduces a
comment which extends to the end of the line the sharp
character appears on. White space characters and sharp
charac&acirc; <br>
ters may be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) if
they&rsquo;re to be used as part of a field. Any line that
is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored. Nonblank
lines are expected to <br>
be of one of three types: rule lines, zone lines, and link
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rule line has the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rule NAME FROM TO TYPE IN ON AT
SAVE LETTER/S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rule US 1967 1973 - Apr lastSun
2:00 1:00 D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields that make up a rule
line are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME Gives the (arbitrary) name
of the set of rules this rule is part of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FROM Gives the first year in
which the rule applies. Any integer year can be supplied;
the Gregorian calendar is assumed. The word minimum (or an
abbreviation) means the <br>
minimum year representable as an integer. The word maximum
(or an abbreviation) means the maximum year representable as
an integer. Rules can describe times that are <br>
not representable as time values, with the unrepresentable
times ignored; this allows rules to be portable among hosts
with differing time value types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TO Gives the final year in which
the rule applies. In addition to minimum and maximum (as
above), the word only (or an abbreviation) may be used to
repeat the value of the <br>
FROM field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPE Gives the type of year in
which the rule applies. If TYPE is - then the rule applies
in all years between FROM and TO inclusive. If TYPE is
something else, then zic <br>
executes the command <br>
yearistype year type <br>
to check the type of a year: an exit status of zero is taken
to mean that the year is of the given type; an exit status
of one is taken to mean that the year is not of <br>
the given type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IN Names the month in which the
rule takes effect. Month names may be abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ON Gives the day on which the
rule takes effect. Recognized forms include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 the fifth of the month <br>
lastSun the last Sunday in the month <br>
lastMon the last Monday in the month <br>
Sun&gt;=8 first Sunday on or after the eighth <br>
Sun&lt;=25 last Sunday on or before the 25th</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Names of days of the week may be
abbreviated or spelled out in full. Note that there must be
no spaces within the ON field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AT Gives the time of day at
which the rule takes effect. Recognized forms include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 time in hours <br>
2:00 time in hours and minutes <br>
15:00 24-hour format time (for times after noon) <br>
1:28:14 time in hours, minutes, and seconds <br>
- equivalent to 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where hour 0 is midnight at the
start of the day, and hour 24 is midnight at the end of the
day. Any of these forms may be followed by the letter w if
the given time is <br>
local &quot;wall clock&quot; time, s if the given time is
local &quot;standard&quot; time, or u (or g or z) if the
given time is universal time; in the absence of an
indicator, wall clock <br>
time is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAVE Gives the amount of time to
be added to local standard time when the rule is in effect.
This field has the same format as the AT field (although, of
course, the w and s <br>
suffixes are not used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LETTER/S <br>
Gives the &quot;variable part&quot; (for example, the
&quot;S&quot; or &quot;D&quot; in &quot;EST&quot; or
&quot;EDT&quot;) of timezone abbreviations to be used when
this rule is in effect. If this field is -, the vari&acirc;
<br>
able part is null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A zone line has the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zone NAME UTCOFF RULES/SAVE
FORMAT [UNTIL]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zone Australia/Adelaide 9:30 Aus
CST 1971 Oct 31 2:00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields that make up a zone
line are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME The name of the timezone.
This is the name used in creating the time conversion
information file for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTCOFF <br>
The amount of time to add to UTC to get standard time in
this zone. This field has the same format as the AT and SAVE
fields of rule lines; begin the field with a minus <br>
sign if time must be subtracted from UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RULES/SAVE <br>
The name of the rule(s) that apply in the timezone or,
alternately, an amount of time to add to local standard
time. If this field is - then standard time always applies
<br>
in the timezone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMAT <br>
The format for timezone abbreviations in this timezone. The
pair of characters %s is used to show where the
&quot;variable part&quot; of the timezone abbreviation goes.
Alter&acirc; <br>
nately, a slash (/) separates standard and daylight
abbreviations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNTIL The time at which the UTC
offset or the rule(s) change for a location. It is specified
as a year, a month, a day, and a time of day. If this is
specified, the timezone <br>
information is generated from the given UTC offset and rule
change until the time specified. The month, day, and time of
day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT <br>
columns of a rule; trailing columns can be omitted, and
default to the earliest possible value for the missing
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next line must be a
&quot;continuation&quot; line; this has the same form as a
zone line except that the string &quot;Zone&quot; and the
name are omitted, as the continuation line will <br>
place information starting at the time specified as the
UNTIL field in the previous line in the file used by the
previous line. Continuation lines may contain an UNTIL <br>
field, just as zone lines do, indicating that the next line
is a further continuation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A link line has the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link LINK-FROM LINK-TO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link Europe/Istanbul
Asia/Istanbul</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LINK-FROM field should
appear as the NAME field in some zone line; the LINK-TO
field is used as an alternate name for that zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except for continuation lines,
lines may appear in any order in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines in the file that describes
leap seconds have the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leap YEAR MONTH DAY HH:MM:SS
CORR R/S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leap 1974 Dec 31 23:59:60 +
S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The YEAR, MONTH, DAY, and
HH:MM:SS fields tell when the leap second happened. The CORR
field should be &quot;+&quot; if a second was added or
&quot;-&quot; if a second was skipped. The R/S field <br>
should be (an abbreviation of) &quot;Stationary&quot; if the
leap second time given by the other fields should be
interpreted as UTC or (an abbreviation of)
&quot;Rolling&quot; if the leap second <br>
time given by the other fields should be interpreted as
local wall clock time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/local/etc/zoneinfo standard directory used for created
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
For areas with more than two types of local time, you may
need to use local standard time in the AT field of the
earliest transition time&rsquo;s rule to ensure that the
earliest tran&acirc; <br>
sition time recorded in the compiled file is correct.</p>
