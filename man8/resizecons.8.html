<p>RESIZECONS(8) Console Support RESIZECONS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
resizecons - change kernel idea of the console size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
resizecons COLSxROWS <br>
resizecons -lines ROWS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The resizecons command tries to change the videomode of the
console. There are several aspects to this: (a) the kernel
must know about it, (b) the hardware must know about it,
<br>
(c) user programs must know about it, (d) the console font
may have to be adapted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(a) The kernel is told about the
change using the ioctl VT_RESIZE. This causes the kernel to
reallocate console screen memory for all virtual consoles,
and might fail if there <br>
is not enough memory. (In that case, try to disallocate some
virtual consoles first.) If this ioctl succeeds, but a later
step fails (e.g., because you do not have root permis&acirc;
<br>
sions), you may be left with a very messy screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most difficult part of this
is (b), since it requires detailed knowledge of the video
card hardware, and the setting of numerous registers. Only
changing the number of rows <br>
is slightly easier, and resizecons will try to do that
itself, when given the -lines option. (Probably, root
permission will be required.) The command resizecons
COLSxROWS will <br>
execute restoretextmode -r COLSxROWS (and hence requires
that you have svgalib installed). Here COLSxROWS is a file
that was created earlier by restoretextmode -w COLSxROWS.
<br>
Again, either root permissions are required, or
restoretextmode has to be suid root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to deal with (c),
resizecons does a &lsquo;stty rows ROWS cols COLS&rsquo; for
each active console (in the range tty0..tty15), and sends a
SIGWINCH signal to selection if it finds <br>
the file /tmp/selection.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, (d) is dealt with by
executing a setfont command. Most likely, the wrong font is
loaded, and you may want to do another setfont yourself
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
resizecons does not work on all hardware. This command used
to be called resize, but was renamed to avoid conflict with
another command with the same name.</p>
