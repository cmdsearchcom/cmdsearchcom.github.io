<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The address is a protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) address attached to
a network device. Each device must have at least one address
to use the corresponding protocol. It is possible to <br>
have several different addresses attached to one device.
These addresses are not discriminated, so that the term
alias is not quite appropriate for them and we do not use it
in <br>
this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ip address command displays
addresses and their properties, adds new addresses and
deletes old ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address add - add new
protocol address. <br>
dev IFNAME <br>
the name of the device to add the address to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local ADDRESS (default) <br>
the address of the interface. The format of the address
depends on the protocol. It is a dotted quad for IP and a
sequence of hexadecimal halfwords separated by colons for
<br>
IPv6. The ADDRESS may be followed by a slash and a decimal
number which encodes the network prefix length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">peer ADDRESS <br>
the address of the remote endpoint for pointopoint
interfaces. Again, the ADDRESS may be followed by a slash
and a decimal number, encoding the network prefix length. If
<br>
a peer address is specified, the local address cannot have a
prefix length. The network prefix is associated with the
peer rather than with the local address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">broadcast ADDRESS <br>
the broadcast address on the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to use the
special symbols &rsquo;+&rsquo; and &rsquo;-&rsquo; instead
of the broadcast address. In this case, the broadcast
address is derived by setting/resetting the host bits <br>
of the interface prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label LABEL <br>
Each address may be tagged with a label string. In order to
preserve compatibility with Linux-2.0 net aliases, this
string must coincide with the name of the device or <br>
must be prefixed with the device name followed by colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scope SCOPE_VALUE <br>
the scope of the area where this address is valid. The
available scopes are listed in file /etc/iproute2/rt_scopes.
Predefined scope values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">global - the address is globally
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site - (IPv6 only, deprecated)
the address is site local, i.e. it is valid inside this
site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link - the address is link
local, i.e. it is valid only on this device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host - the address is valid only
inside this host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">valid_lft LFT <br>
the valid lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4 of RFC
4862. When it expires, the address is removed by the kernel.
Defaults to forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preferred_lft LFT <br>
the preferred lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4 of
RFC 4862. When it expires, the address is no longer used for
new outgoing connections. Defaults to forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">home (IPv6 only) designates this
address the &quot;home address&quot; as defined in RFC
6275.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mngtmpaddr <br>
(IPv6 only) make the kernel manage temporary addresses
created from this one as template on behalf of Privacy
Extensions (RFC3041). For this to become active, the
use_tem&acirc; <br>
paddr sysctl setting has to be set to a value greater than
zero. The given address needs to have a prefix length of 64.
This flag allows to use privacy extensions in a <br>
manually configured network, just like if stateless
auto-configuration was active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodad (IPv6 only) do not perform
Duplicate Address Detection (RFC 4862) when adding this
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noprefixroute <br>
Do not automatically create a route for the network prefix
of the added address, and don&rsquo;t search for one to
delete when removing the address. Changing an address to add
<br>
this flag will remove the automatically added prefix route,
changing it to remove this flag will create the prefix route
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autojoin <br>
Joining multicast groups on Ethernet level via ip maddr
command does not work if connected to an Ethernet switch
that does IGMP snooping since the switch would not
repli&acirc; <br>
cate multicast packets on ports that did not have IGMP
reports for the multicast addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux VXLAN interfaces created
via ip link add vxlan have the group option that enables
them to do the required join.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the autojoin flag when
adding a multicast address enables similar functionality for
Openvswitch VXLAN interfaces as well as other tunneling
mechanisms that need to <br>
receive multicast traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address delete - delete
protocol address <br>
Arguments: coincide with the arguments of ip addr add. The
device name is a required argument. The rest are optional.
If no arguments are given, the first address is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address show - look at
protocol addresses <br>
dev IFNAME (default) <br>
name of device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scope SCOPE_VAL <br>
only list addresses with this scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to PREFIX <br>
only list addresses matching this prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label PATTERN <br>
only list addresses with labels matching the PATTERN.
PATTERN is a usual shell style pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">master DEVICE <br>
only list interfaces enslaved to this master device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type TYPE <br>
only list interfaces of the given type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the type name is not
checked against the list of supported types - instead it is
sent as-is to the kernel. Later it is used to filter the
returned interface list <br>
by comparing it with the relevant attribute in case the
kernel didn&rsquo;t filter already. Therefore any string is
accepted, but may lead to empty output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">up only list running
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dynamic and permanent <br>
(IPv6 only) only list addresses installed due to stateless
address configuration or only list permanent (not dynamic)
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tentative <br>
(IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not yet passed
duplicate address detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tentative <br>
(IPv6 only) only list addresses which are not in the process
of duplicate address detection currently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deprecated <br>
(IPv6 only) only list deprecated addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-deprecated <br>
(IPv6 only) only list addresses not being deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dadfailed <br>
(IPv6 only) only list addresses which have failed duplicate
address detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dadfailed <br>
(IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not failed
duplicate address detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">temporary <br>
(IPv6 only) only list temporary addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary and secondary <br>
only list primary (or secondary) addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address flush - flush
protocol addresses <br>
This command flushes the protocol addresses selected by some
criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command has the same
arguments as show except that type and master selectors are
not supported. Another difference is that it does not run
when no arguments are given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: This command and other
flush commands are unforgiving. They will cruelly purge all
the addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -statistics option, the
command becomes verbose. It prints out the number of deleted
addresses and the number of rounds made to flush the address
list. If this option <br>
is given twice, ip address flush also dumps all the deleted
addresses in the format described in the previous
subsection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
ip address show <br>
Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to all network
interfaces. The &rsquo;show&rsquo; subcommand can be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address show up <br>
Same as above except that only addresses assigned to active
network interfaces are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address show dev eth0 <br>
Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to network interface
eth0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address add
2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1 <br>
Adds an IPv6 address to network interface eth1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address delete
2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1 <br>
Delete the IPv6 address added above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip address flush dev eth4 scope
global <br>
Removes all global IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from device eth4.
Without &rsquo;scope global&rsquo; it would remove all
addresses including IPv6 link-local ones.</p>
