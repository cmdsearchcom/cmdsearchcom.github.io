<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
aptitude is a text-based interface to the Debian GNU/Linux
package system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It allows the user to view the
list of packages and to perform package management tasks
such as installing, upgrading, and removing packages.
Actions may be performed from a <br>
visual interface or from the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE ACTIONS <br>
The first argument which does not begin with a hyphen
(&acirc;-&acirc;) is considered to be an action that the
program should perform. If an action is not specified on the
command-line, <br>
aptitude will start up in visual mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following actions are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install <br>
Install one or more packages. The packages should be listed
after the &acirc;install&acirc; command; if a package name
contains a tilde character (&acirc;~&acirc;) or a question
mark (&acirc;?&acirc;), it will <br>
be treated as a search pattern and every package matching
the pattern will be installed (see the section &acirc;Search
Patterns&acirc; in the aptitude reference manual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select a particular version
of the package, append &acirc;=&lt;version&gt;&acirc; to the
package name: for instance, &acirc;aptitude install
apt=0.3.1&acirc;. Similarly, to select a package from a <br>
particular archive, append &acirc;/&lt;archive&gt;&acirc; to
the package name: for instance, &acirc;aptitude install
apt/experimental&acirc;. You cannot specify both an archive
and a version for a <br>
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not every package listed on the
command line has to be installed; you can tell aptitude to
do something different with a package by appending an
&acirc;override specifier&acirc; to the <br>
name of the package. For example, aptitude remove wesnoth+
will install wesnoth, not remove it. The following override
specifiers are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;+ <br>
Install &lt;package&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the package was not
installed, it is marked as manually installed, and the
dependencies newly installed are marked with the automatic
flag. If the package or the <br>
dependencies were already installed, the automatic flag is
preserved. See the section about automatic installations in
the documentation for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;+M <br>
Install &lt;package&gt; and immediately mark it as
automatically installed (note that if nothing depends on
&lt;package&gt;, this will cause it to be immediately
removed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;- <br>
Remove &lt;package&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;_ <br>
Purge &lt;package&gt;: remove it and all its associated
configuration and data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;= <br>
Place &lt;package&gt; on hold: cancel any active
installation, upgrade, or removal, and prevent this package
from being automatically upgraded in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;: <br>
Keep &lt;package&gt; at its current version: cancel any
installation, removal, or upgrade. Unlike &acirc;hold&acirc;
(above) this does not prevent automatic upgrades in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;&amp;M <br>
Mark &lt;package&gt; as having been automatically
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;&amp;m <br>
Mark &lt;package&gt; as having been manually installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt;&amp;BD <br>
Install the build-dependencies of a &lt;package&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case,
&acirc;install&acirc; with no arguments will act on any
stored/pending actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Once you enter Y at the final confirmation prompt, the
&acirc;install&acirc; command will modify aptitude&rsquo;s
stored information about what actions to perform. Therefore,
if you issue <br>
(e.g.) the command &acirc;aptitude install foo bar&acirc; on
packages previously uninstalled, and then the installation
fails once aptitude has started downloading and installing
<br>
packages, you will need to run &acirc;aptitude remove foo
bar&acirc; to go back to the previous state (and possibly
undo installations or upgrades to other packages that were
<br>
affected by the &acirc;install&acirc; action).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove, purge, reinstall <br>
These commands are the same as &acirc;install&acirc;, but
apply the named action to all packages given on the command
line for which it is not overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, &acirc;aptitude
remove &rsquo;~ndeity&rsquo;&acirc; will remove all packages
whose name contains &acirc;deity&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">build-depends, build-dep <br>
Satisfy the build-dependencies of a package. Each package
name may be a source package, in which case the build
dependencies of that source package are installed;
otherwise, <br>
binary packages are found in the same way as for the
&acirc;install&acirc; command, and the build-dependencies of
the source packages that build those binary packages are
satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command-line parameter
--arch-only is present, only architecture-dependent build
dependencies (i.e., not Build-Depends-Indep or
Build-Conflicts-Indep) will be obeyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">markauto, unmarkauto <br>
Mark packages as automatically installed or manually
installed, respectively. Packages are specified in exactly
the same way as for the &acirc;install&acirc; command. For
instance, <br>
&acirc;aptitude markauto &rsquo;~slibs&rsquo;&acirc; will
mark all packages in the &acirc;libs&acirc; section as
having been automatically installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on
automatically installed packages, see the section
&acirc;Managing Automatically Installed Packages&acirc; in
the aptitude reference manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hold, unhold, keep <br>
Mark packages to be on hold, remove this property, or set to
keep in the current state. Packages are specified in exactly
the same way as for the &acirc;install&acirc; command. For
<br>
instance, &acirc;aptitude hold &rsquo;~e^dpkg$&rsquo;&acirc;
will mark all packages coming from the source package
&acirc;dpkg&acirc; to be on hold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The difference between hold and
keep is that hold will cause a package to be ignored by
future safe-upgrade or full-upgrade commands, while keep
merely cancels any scheduled <br>
actions on the package. unhold will allow a package to be
upgraded by future safe-upgrade or full-upgrade commands,
without otherwise altering its state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep-all <br>
Cancels all scheduled actions on all packages; any packages
whose sticky state indicates an installation, removal, or
upgrade will have this sticky state cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forget-new <br>
Forgets all internal information about what packages are
&acirc;new&acirc; (equivalent to pressing &acirc;f&acirc;
when in visual mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command accepts package
names or patterns as arguments. If the string contains a
tilde character (&acirc;~&acirc;) or a question mark
(&acirc;?&acirc;), it will be treated as a search pattern
<br>
and every package matching the pattern will be considered
(see the section &acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in the
aptitude reference manual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forbid-version <br>
Forbid a package from being upgraded to a particular
version, while allowing automatic upgrades to future
versions. This is useful for example to avoid a known broken
version <br>
of a package, without having to set and clear manual
holds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, aptitude will select
the forbidden version to be the one which the package would
normally be upgraded (the candidate version). This may be
overridden by appending <br>
&acirc;=&lt;version&gt;&acirc; to the package name: for
instance, &acirc;aptitude forbid-version
vim=1.2.3.broken-4&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To revert the action,
&acirc;aptitude install &lt;package&gt;&acirc; will remove
the ban. To remove the forbidden version without installing
the candidate version, the current version should <br>
be appended: &acirc;install
&lt;package&gt;=&lt;version&gt;&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update <br>
Updates the list of available packages from the apt sources
(this is equivalent to &acirc;apt-get update&acirc;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safe-upgrade <br>
Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version.
Installed packages will not be removed unless they are
unused (see the section &acirc;Managing Automatically
Installed <br>
Packages&acirc; in the aptitude reference manual). Packages
which are not currently installed may be installed to
resolve dependencies unless the --no-new-installs
command-line <br>
option is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no &lt;package&gt;s are
listed on the command line, aptitude will attempt to upgrade
every package that can be upgraded. Otherwise, aptitude will
attempt to upgrade only the <br>
packages which it is instructed to upgrade. The
&lt;package&gt;s can be extended with suffixes in the same
manner as arguments to aptitude install, so you can also
give additional <br>
instructions to aptitude here; for instance, aptitude
safe-upgrade bash dash- will attempt to upgrade the bash
package and remove the dash package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is sometimes necessary to
remove one package in order to upgrade another; this command
is not able to upgrade packages in such situations. Use the
full-upgrade command to <br>
upgrade as many packages as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">full-upgrade <br>
Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version,
removing or installing packages as necessary. It also
installs new Essential or Required packages. This command is
<br>
less conservative than safe-upgrade and thus more likely to
perform unwanted actions. However, it is capable of
upgrading packages that safe-upgrade cannot upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no &lt;package&gt;s are
listed on the command line, aptitude will attempt to upgrade
every package that can be upgraded. Otherwise, aptitude will
attempt to upgrade only the <br>
packages which it is instructed to upgrade. The
&lt;package&gt;s can be extended with suffixes in the same
manner as arguments to aptitude install, so you can also
give additional <br>
instructions to aptitude here; for instance, aptitude
full-upgrade bash dash- will attempt to upgrade the bash
package and remove the dash package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This command was originally named dist-upgrade for
historical reasons, and aptitude still recognizes
dist-upgrade as a synonym for full-upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search <br>
Searches for packages matching one of the patterns supplied
on the command line. All packages which match any of the
given patterns will be displayed; for instance,
&acirc;aptitude <br>
search &rsquo;~N&rsquo; edit&acirc; will list all
&acirc;new&acirc; packages and all packages whose name
contains &acirc;edit&acirc;. For more information on search
patterns, see the section &acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in
the <br>
aptitude reference manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
In the example above, &acirc;aptitude search
&rsquo;~N&rsquo; edit&acirc; has two arguments after search
and thus is searching for two patterns: &acirc;~N&acirc; and
&acirc;edit&acirc;. As described in the search <br>
pattern reference, a single pattern composed of two
sub-patterns separated by a space (such as &acirc;~N
edit&acirc;) matches only if both patterns match. Thus, the
command &acirc;aptitude <br>
search &rsquo;~N edit&rsquo;&acirc; will only show
&acirc;new&acirc; packages whose name contains
&acirc;edit&acirc;. <br>
Unless you pass the -F option, the output of aptitude search
will look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i apt - Advanced front-end for
dpkg <br>
pi apt-build - frontend to apt to build, optimize and in
<br>
cp apt-file - APT package searching utility -- command- <br>
ihA raptor-utils - Raptor RDF Parser utilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each search result is listed on
a separate line. The first character of each line indicates
the current state of the package: the most common states are
p, meaning that no <br>
trace of the package exists on the system, c, meaning that
the package was deleted but its configuration files remain
on the system, i, meaning that the package is installed,
<br>
and v, meaning that the package is virtual. The second
character indicates the stored action (if any; otherwise a
blank space is displayed) to be performed on the package,
<br>
with the most common actions being i, meaning that the
package will be installed, d, meaning that the package will
be deleted, and p, meaning that the package and its <br>
configuration files will be removed. If the third character
is A, the package was automatically installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a complete list of the
possible state and action flags, see the section
&acirc;Accessing Package Information&acirc; in the aptitude
reference guide. To customize the output of <br>
search, see the command-line options -F and --sort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show <br>
Displays detailed information about one or more packages. If
a package name contains a tilde character (&acirc;~&acirc;)
or a question mark (&acirc;?&acirc;), it will be treated as
a search pattern <br>
and all matching packages will be displayed (see the section
&acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in the aptitude reference
manual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the verbosity level is 1 or
greater (i.e., at least one -v is present on the
command-line), information about all versions of the package
is displayed. Otherwise, <br>
information about the &acirc;candidate version&acirc; (the
version that &acirc;aptitude install&acirc; would download)
is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can display information
about a different version of the package by appending
=&lt;version&gt; to the package name; you can display the
version from a particular archive or <br>
release by appending /&lt;archive&gt; or /&lt;release&gt; to
the package name: for instance, /unstable or /sid. If either
of these is present, then only the version you request will
be <br>
displayed, regardless of the verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the verbosity level is 1 or
greater, the package&rsquo;s architecture, compressed size,
filename, and md5sum fields will be displayed. If the
verbosity level is 2 or greater, <br>
the select version or versions will be displayed once for
each archive in which they are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showsrc <br>
Displays detailed information about one or more source
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a thin wrapper over
apt(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source <br>
Downloads one or more source packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a thin wrapper over
apt(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">versions <br>
Displays the versions of the packages listed on the
command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ aptitude versions wesnoth <br>
p 1:1.4.5-1 100 <br>
p 1:1.6.5-1 unstable 500 <br>
p 1:1.7.14-1 experimental 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each version is listed on a
separate line. The leftmost three characters indicate the
current state, planned state (if any), and whether the
package was automatically <br>
installed; for more information on their meanings, see the
documentation of aptitude search. To the right of the
version number you can find the releases from which the <br>
version is available, and the pin priority of the
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a package name contains a
tilde character (&acirc;~&acirc;) or a question mark
(&acirc;?&acirc;), it will be treated as a search pattern
and all matching versions will be displayed (see the <br>
section &acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in the aptitude
reference manual). This means that, for instance, aptitude
versions &rsquo;~i&rsquo; will display all the versions that
are currently installed <br>
on the system and nothing else, not even other versions of
the same packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ aptitude versions
&rsquo;~nexim4-daemon-light&rsquo; <br>
Package exim4-daemon-light: <br>
i 4.71-3 100 <br>
p 4.71-4 unstable 500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package exim4-daemon-light-dbg:
<br>
p 4.71-4 unstable 500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input is a search
pattern, or if more than one package&rsquo;s versions are to
be displayed, aptitude will automatically group the output
by package, as shown above. You can <br>
disable this via --group-by=none, in which case aptitude
will display a single list of all the versions that were
found and automatically include the package name in each
<br>
output line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ aptitude versions
--group-by=none &rsquo;~nexim4-daemon-light&rsquo; <br>
i exim4-daemon-light 4.71-3 100 <br>
p exim4-daemon-light 4.71-4 unstable 500 <br>
p exim4-daemon-light-dbg 4.71-4 unstable 500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable the package name,
pass --show-package-names=never:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ aptitude versions
--show-package-names=never --group-by=none
&rsquo;~nexim4-daemon-light&rsquo; <br>
i 4.71-3 100 <br>
p 4.71-4 unstable 500 <br>
p 4.71-4 unstable 500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the above
options, the information printed for each version can be
controlled by the command-line option -F. The order in which
versions are displayed can be <br>
controlled by the command-line option --sort. To prevent
aptitude from formatting the output into columns, use
--disable-columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-user-tag, remove-user-tag
<br>
Adds a user tag to or removes a user tag from the selected
group of packages. If a package name contains a tilde
(&acirc;~&acirc;) or question mark (&acirc;?&acirc;), it is
treated as a search <br>
pattern and the tag is added to or removed from all the
packages that match the pattern (see the section
&acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in the aptitude reference
manual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User tags are arbitrary strings
associated with a package. They can be used with the
?user-tag(&lt;tag&gt;) search term, which will select all
the packages that have a user tag <br>
matching &lt;tag&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">why, why-not <br>
Explains the reason that a particular package should or
cannot be installed on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command searches for
packages that require or conflict with the given package. It
displays a sequence of dependencies leading to the target
package, along with a note <br>
indicating the installed state of each package in the
dependency chain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ aptitude why kdepim <br>
i nautilus-data Recommends nautilus <br>
i A nautilus Recommends desktop-base (&gt;= 0.2) <br>
i A desktop-base Suggests gnome | kde | xfce4 | wmaker <br>
p kde Depends kdepim (&gt;= 4:3.4.3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command why finds a
dependency chain that installs the package named on the
command line, as above. Note that the dependency that
aptitude produced in this case is only a <br>
suggestion. This is because no package currently installed
on this computer depends on or recommends the kdepim
package; if a stronger dependency were available, aptitude
<br>
would have displayed it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, why-not finds a
dependency chain leading to a conflict with the target
package:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ aptitude why-not textopo <br>
i ocaml-core Depends ocamlweb <br>
i A ocamlweb Depends tetex-extra | texlive-latex-extra <br>
i A texlive-latex-extra Conflicts textopo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more &lt;pattern&gt;s
are present (in addition to the mandatory last argument,
which should be a valid &lt;package&gt; name), then aptitude
will begin its search at these <br>
patterns. That is, the first package in the chain it prints
to explain why &lt;package&gt; is or is not installed, will
be a package matching the pattern in question. The patterns
<br>
are considered to be package names unless they contain a
tilde character (&acirc;~&acirc;) or a question mark
(&acirc;?&acirc;), in which case they are treated as search
patterns (see the section <br>
&acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in the aptitude reference
manual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no patterns are present, then
aptitude will search for dependency chains beginning at
manually installed packages. This effectively shows the
packages that have caused or <br>
would cause a given package to be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
aptitude why does not perform full dependency resolution; it
only displays direct relationships between packages. For
instance, if A requires B, C requires D, and B and C <br>
conflict, &acirc;aptitude why-not D&acirc; will not produce
the answer &acirc;A depends on B, B conflicts with C, and D
depends on C&acirc;. <br>
By default aptitude outputs only the &acirc;most installed,
strongest, tightest, shortest&acirc; dependency chain. That
is, it looks for a chain that only contains packages which
are <br>
installed or will be installed; it looks for the strongest
possible dependencies under that restriction; it looks for
chains that avoid ORed dependencies and Provides; and it
<br>
looks for the shortest dependency chain meeting those
criteria. These rules are progressively weakened until a
match is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the verbosity level is 1 or
more, then all the explanations aptitude can find will be
displayed, in inverse order of relevance. If the verbosity
level is 2 or more, a <br>
truly excessive amount of debugging information will be
printed to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command returns 0 if
successful, 1 if no explanation could be constructed, and -1
if an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean <br>
Removes all previously downloaded .deb files from the
package cache directory (usually
/var/cache/apt/archives).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoclean <br>
Removes any cached packages which can no longer be
downloaded. This allows you to prevent a cache from growing
out of control over time without completely emptying it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changelog <br>
Downloads and displays the Debian changelog for each of the
given source or binary packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the changelog for
the version which would be installed with &acirc;aptitude
install&acirc; is downloaded. You can select a particular
version of a package by appending <br>
=&lt;version&gt; to the package name; you can select the
version from a particular archive or release by appending
/&lt;archive&gt; or /&lt;release&gt; to the package name
(for instance, <br>
/unstable or /sid).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download <br>
Downloads the .deb file for the given package to the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a thin wrapper over
apt(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extract-cache-subset <br>
Copy the apt configuration directory (/etc/apt) and a subset
of the package database to the specified directory. If no
packages are listed, the entire package database is <br>
copied; otherwise only the entries corresponding to the
named packages are copied. Each package name may be a search
pattern, and all the packages matching that pattern will
<br>
be selected (see the section &acirc;Search Patterns&acirc;
in the aptitude reference manual). Any existing package
database files in the output directory will be
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dependencies in binary package
stanzas will be rewritten to remove references to packages
not in the selected set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Displays a brief summary of the available commands and
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options may be used to modify the behavior of
the actions described above. Note that while all options
will be accepted for all commands, some options don&rsquo;t
apply <br>
to particular commands and will be ignored by those
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-user-tag &lt;tag&gt; <br>
For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade, forbid-version, hold,
install, keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall,
remove, unhold, and unmarkauto: add the user tag &lt;tag&gt;
to all <br>
packages that are installed, removed, or upgraded by this
command as if with the add-user-tag command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-user-tag-to
&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;pattern&gt; <br>
For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade, forbid-version, hold,
install, keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall,
remove, unhold, and unmarkauto: add the user tag &lt;tag&gt;
to all <br>
packages that match &lt;pattern&gt; as if with the
add-user-tag command. The pattern is a search pattern as
described in the section &acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in
the aptitude reference <br>
manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, aptitude
safe-upgrade --add-user-tag-to
&quot;new-installs,?action(install)&quot; will add the tag
new-installs to all the packages installed by the
safe-upgrade command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-new-upgrades <br>
When the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver
was passed, the action is safe-upgrade, or
Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), allow
the <br>
dependency resolver to install upgrades for packages
regardless of the value of
Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Upgrades.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-new-installs <br>
Allow the safe-upgrade command to install new packages; when
the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was
passed, the action is safe-upgrade, or <br>
Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), allow
the dependency resolver to install new packages. This option
takes effect regardless of the value of <br>
Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Installs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-untrusted <br>
Install packages from untrusted sources without prompting.
You should only use this if you know what you are doing, as
it could easily compromise your system&rsquo;s security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-columns <br>
This option causes aptitude search and aptitude versions to
output their results without any special formatting. In
particular: normally aptitude will add whitespace or <br>
truncate search results in an attempt to fit its results
into vertical &acirc;columns&acirc;. With this flag, each
line will be formed by replacing any format escapes in the
format <br>
string with the corresponding text; column widths will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, the first few
lines of output from &acirc;aptitude search -F &rsquo;%p
%V&rsquo; --disable-columns libedataserver&acirc; might
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disksearch 1.2.1-3 <br>
hp-search-mac 0.1.3 <br>
libbsearch-ruby 1.5-5 <br>
libbsearch-ruby1.8 1.5-5 <br>
libclass-dbi-abstractsearch-perl 0.07-2 <br>
libdbix-fulltextsearch-perl 0.73-10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As in the above example,
--disable-columns is often useful in combination with a
custom display format set using the command-line option
-F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::CmdLine::Disable-Columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --show-deps <br>
For commands that will install or remove packages (install,
full-upgrade, etc), show brief explanations of automatic
installations and removals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Deps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --download-only <br>
Download packages to the package cache as necessary, but do
not install or remove anything. By default, the package
cache is stored in /var/cache/apt/archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::CmdLine::Download-Only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;format&gt;,
--display-format &lt;format&gt; <br>
Specify the format which should be used to display output
from the search and versions commands. For instance, passing
&acirc;%p %v %V&acirc; for &lt;format&gt; will display a
package&rsquo;s name, <br>
followed by its currently installed version and its
candidate version (see the section &acirc;Customizing how
packages are displayed&acirc; in the aptitude reference
manual for more <br>
information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command-line option
--disable-columns is often useful in combination with
-F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For search, this corresponds to
the configuration option
Aptitude::CmdLine::Package-Display-Format; for versions,
this corresponds to the configuration option <br>
Aptitude::CmdLine::Version-Display-Format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Try hard to fix the dependencies of broken packages, even if
it means ignoring the actions requested on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration item Aptitude::CmdLine::Fix-Broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-resolver <br>
When package dependency problems are encountered, use the
default &acirc;full&acirc; resolver to solve them. Unlike
the &acirc;safe&acirc; resolver activated by
--safe-resolver, the full resolver <br>
will happily remove packages to fulfill dependencies. It can
resolve more situations than the safe algorithm, but its
solutions are more likely to be undesirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to force
the use of the full resolver even when
Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--group-by &lt;grouping-mode&gt;
<br>
Control how the versions command groups its output. The
following values are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; archive to group
packages by the archive they occur in (&acirc;stable&acirc;,
&acirc;unstable&acirc;, etc). If a package occurs in several
archives, it will be displayed in each of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; auto to group
versions by their package unless there is exactly one
argument and it is not a search pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; none to display
all the versions in a single list without any grouping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; package to group
versions by their package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; source-package
to group versions by their source package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; source-version
to group versions by their source package and source
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option
Aptitude::CmdLine::Versions-Group-By.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a brief help message. Identical to the help
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file=&lt;file&gt; <br>
If &lt;file&gt; is a nonempty string, log messages will be
written to it, except that if &lt;file&gt; is
&acirc;-&acirc;, the messages will be written to standard
output instead. If this option <br>
appears multiple times, the last occurrence is the one that
will take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does not affect the log of
installations that aptitude has performed
(/var/log/aptitude); the log messages written using this
configuration include internal program <br>
events, errors, and debugging messages. See the command-line
option --log-level to get more control over what gets
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::Logging::File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-level=&lt;level&gt;,
--log-level=&lt;category&gt;:&lt;level&gt; <br>
--log-level=&lt;level&gt; causes aptitude to only log
messages whose level is &lt;level&gt; or higher. For
instance, setting the log level to error will cause only
messages at the log <br>
levels error and fatal to be displayed; all others will be
hidden. Valid log levels (in descending order) are off,
fatal, error, warn, info, debug, and trace. The default log
<br>
level is warn.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-level=&lt;category&gt;:&lt;level&gt;
causes messages in &lt;category&gt; to only be logged if
their level is &lt;level&gt; or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-level may appear multiple
times on the command line; the most specific setting is the
one that takes effect, so if you pass
--log-level=aptitude.resolver:fatal and <br>
--log-level=aptitude.resolver.hints.match:trace, then
messages in aptitude.resolver.hints.parse will only be
printed if their level is fatal, but all messages in <br>
aptitude.resolver.hints.match will be printed. If you set
the level of the same category two or more times, the last
setting is the one that will take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does not affect the log of
installations that aptitude has performed
(/var/log/aptitude); the log messages written using this
configuration include internal program <br>
events, errors, and debugging messages. See the command-line
option --log-file to change where log messages go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration group Aptitude::Logging::Levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-resolver <br>
Set some standard log levels related to the resolver, to
produce logging output suitable for processing with
automated tools. This is equivalent to the command-line
options <br>
--log-level=aptitude.resolver.search:trace
--log-level=aptitude.resolver.search.tiers:info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-new-installs <br>
Prevent safe-upgrade from installing any new packages; when
the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was
passed or Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to <br>
true), forbid the dependency resolver from installing new
packages. This option takes effect regardless of the value
of Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Installs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mimics the historical
behavior of apt-get upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-new-upgrades <br>
When the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver
was passed or Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to
true), forbid the dependency resolver from installing <br>
upgrades for packages regardless of the value of
Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Upgrades.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-show-resolver-actions <br>
Do not display the actions performed by the
&acirc;safe&acirc; resolver, overriding any configuration
option or earlier --show-resolver-actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O &lt;order&gt;, --sort
&lt;order&gt; <br>
Specify the order in which output from the search and
versions commands should be displayed. For instance, passing
&acirc;installsize&acirc; for &lt;order&gt; will list
packages in order <br>
according to their size when installed (see the section
&acirc;Customizing how packages are sorted&acirc; in the
aptitude reference manual for more information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default sort order is
name,version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<br>
Set a configuration file option directly; for instance, use
-o Aptitude::Log=/tmp/my-log to log aptitude&rsquo;s actions
to /tmp/my-log. For more information on configuration file
<br>
options, see the section &acirc;Configuration file
reference&acirc; in the aptitude reference manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --prompt <br>
Always display a prompt before downloading, installing or
removing packages, even when no actions other than those
explicitly requested will be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::CmdLine::Always-Prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--purge-unused <br>
If Aptitude::Delete-Unused is set to &acirc;true&acirc; (its
default), then in addition to removing each package that is
no longer required by any installed package, aptitude will
also <br>
purge them, removing their configuration files and perhaps
other important data. For more information about which
packages are considered to be &acirc;unused&acirc;, see the
section <br>
&acirc;Managing Automatically Installed Packages&acirc; in
the aptitude reference manual. THIS OPTION CAN CAUSE DATA
LOSS! DO NOT USE IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::Purge-Unused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q[=&lt;n&gt;],
--quiet[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Suppress all incremental progress indicators, thus making
the output loggable. This may be supplied multiple times to
make the program quieter, but unlike apt-get, aptitude <br>
does not enable -y when -q is supplied more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional =&lt;n&gt; may be
used to directly set the amount of quietness (for instance,
to override a setting in /etc/apt/apt.conf); it causes the
program to behave as if -q had <br>
been passed exactly &lt;n&gt; times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --without-recommends <br>
Do not treat recommendations as dependencies when installing
new packages (this overrides settings in /etc/apt/apt.conf
and ~/.aptitude/config). Packages previously installed <br>
due to recommendations will not be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the pair of
configuration options APT::Install-Recommends and
APT::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --with-recommends <br>
Treat recommendations as dependencies when installing new
packages (this overrides settings in /etc/apt/apt.conf and
~/.aptitude/config).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option APT::Install-Recommends</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-user-tag &lt;tag&gt;
<br>
For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold,
install, keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall,
remove, unhold, and unmarkauto: remove the user tag
&lt;tag&gt; from <br>
all packages that are installed, removed, or upgraded by
this command as if with the add-user-tag command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-user-tag-from
&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;pattern&gt; <br>
For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold,
install, keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall,
remove, unhold, and unmarkauto: remove the user tag
&lt;tag&gt; from <br>
all packages that match &lt;pattern&gt; as if with the
remove-user-tag command. The pattern is a search pattern as
described in the section &acirc;Search Patterns&acirc; in
the aptitude <br>
reference manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, aptitude
safe-upgrade --remove-user-tag-from
&quot;not-upgraded,?action(upgrade)&quot; will remove the
not-upgraded tag from all packages that the safe-upgrade
command is <br>
able to upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --simulate <br>
In command-line mode, print the actions that would normally
be performed, but don&rsquo;t actually perform them. This
does not require root privileges. In the visual interface,
<br>
always open the cache in read-only mode regardless of
whether you are root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::Simulate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--safe-resolver <br>
When package dependency problems are encountered, use a
&acirc;safe&acirc; algorithm to solve them. This resolver
attempts to preserve as many of your choices as possible; it
will never <br>
remove a package or install a version of a package other
than the package&rsquo;s default candidate version. It is
the same algorithm used in safe-upgrade; indeed, aptitude
<br>
--safe-resolver full-upgrade is equivalent to aptitude
safe-upgrade. Because safe-upgrade always uses the safe
resolver, it does not accept the --safe-resolver flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
setting the configuration variable
Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--schedule-only <br>
For commands that modify package states, schedule operations
to be performed in the future, but don&rsquo;t perform them.
You can execute scheduled actions by running aptitude <br>
install with no arguments. This is equivalent to making the
corresponding selections in visual mode, then exiting the
program normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, aptitude
--schedule-only install evolution will schedule the
evolution package for later installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-package-names
&lt;when&gt; <br>
Controls when the versions command shows package names. The
following settings are allowed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; always: display
package names every time that aptitude versions runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; auto: display
package names when aptitude versions runs if the output is
not grouped by package, and either there is a
pattern-matching argument or there is more than one <br>
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; never: never
display package names in the output of aptitude
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option corresponds to the
configuration item
Aptitude::CmdLine::Versions-Show-Package-Names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-resolver-actions <br>
Display the actions performed by the &acirc;safe&acirc;
resolver and by safe-upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When executing the command
safe-upgrade or when the option --safe-resolver is present,
aptitude will display a summary of the actions performed by
the resolver before <br>
printing the installation preview. This is equivalent to the
configuration option
Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::Show-Resolver-Actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-summary[=&lt;MODE&gt;]
<br>
Changes the behavior of &acirc;aptitude why&acirc; to
summarize each dependency chain that it outputs, rather than
displaying it in long form. If this option is present and
&lt;MODE&gt; is not <br>
&acirc;no-summary&acirc;, chains that contain Suggests
dependencies will not be displayed: combine --show-summary
with -v to see a summary of all the reasons for the target
package to be <br>
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;MODE&gt; can be any one of
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. no-summary: don&rsquo;t show
a summary (the default behavior if --show-summary is not
present).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. first-package: display the
first package in each chain. This is the default value of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;width&gt;, --width
&lt;width&gt; <br>
Specify the display width which should be used for output
from the search and versions commands (in the command
line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default and when the output
is seen directly in a terminal, the terminal width is used.
When the output is redirected or piped, a very large
&quot;unlimited&quot; line width is <br>
used, and this option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option
Aptitude::CmdLine::Package-Display-Width</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --assume-yes <br>
When a yes/no prompt would be presented, assume that the
user entered &acirc;yes&acirc;. In particular, suppresses
the prompt that appears when installing, upgrading, or
removing <br>
packages. Prompts for &acirc;dangerous&acirc; actions, such
as removing essential packages, will still be displayed.
This option overrides -P.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option Aptitude::CmdLine::Assume-Yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z <br>
Show how much disk space will be used or freed by the
individual packages being installed, upgraded, or
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds to the
configuration option
Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Size-Changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options apply to
the visual mode of the program, but are primarily for
internal use; you generally won&rsquo;t need to use them
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autoclean-on-startup <br>
Deletes old downloaded files when the program starts
(equivalent to starting the program and immediately
selecting Actions &acirc; Clean obsolete files). You cannot
use this option <br>
and &acirc;--clean-on-startup&acirc;, &acirc;-i&acirc;, or
&acirc;-u&acirc; at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clean-on-startup <br>
Cleans the package cache when the program starts (equivalent
to starting the program and immediately selecting Actions
&acirc; Clean package cache). You cannot use this option and
<br>
&acirc;--autoclean-on-startup&acirc;, &acirc;-i&acirc;, or
&acirc;-u&acirc; at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Displays a download preview when the program starts
(equivalent to starting the program and immediately pressing
&acirc;g&acirc;). You cannot use this option and <br>
&acirc;--autoclean-on-startup&acirc;,
&acirc;--clean-on-startup&acirc;, or &acirc;-u&acirc; at the
same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;fname&gt; <br>
Loads the extended state information from &lt;fname&gt;
instead of the standard state file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
Begins updating the package lists as soon as the program
starts. You cannot use this option and
&acirc;--autoclean-on-startup&acirc;,
&acirc;--clean-on-startup&acirc;, or &acirc;-i&acirc; at the
same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME <br>
If $HOME/.aptitude exists, aptitude will store its
configuration file in $HOME/.aptitude/config. Otherwise, it
will look up the current user&rsquo;s home directory using
<br>
getpwuid(2) and place its configuration file there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER <br>
If this environment variable is set, aptitude will use it to
display changelogs when &acirc;aptitude changelog&acirc; is
invoked. If not set, it defaults to more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMP <br>
If TMPDIR is unset, aptitude will store its temporary files
in TMP if that variable is set. Otherwise, it will store
them in /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR <br>
aptitude will store its temporary files in the directory
indicated by this environment variable. If TMPDIR is not
set, then TMP will be used; if TMP is also unset, then <br>
aptitude will use /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/aptitude/pkgstates <br>
The file in which stored package states and some package
flags are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/apt/apt.conf,
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*, ~/.aptitude/config <br>
The configuration files for aptitude. ~/.aptitude/config
overrides /etc/apt/apt.conf. See apt.conf(5) for
documentation of the format and contents of these files.</p>
