<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gdnsd - An authoritative DNS daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Usage: gdnsd [-fsSD] [-c /etc/gdnsd] &lt;action&gt; <br>
-D - Enable verbose debug output <br>
-f - Foreground mode for [re]start actions <br>
-s - Force &rsquo;zones_strict_startup = true&rsquo; for
this invocation <br>
-S - Force &rsquo;zones_strict_data = true&rsquo; for this
invocation <br>
-c - Configuration directory <br>
-x - No syslog output (must use -f with this if [re]start)
<br>
Actions: <br>
checkconf - Checks validity of config and zone files <br>
start - Start as a regular daemon <br>
stop - Stops a running daemon previously started by
&rsquo;start&rsquo; <br>
reload-zones - Send SIGUSR1 to running daemon for zone data
reload <br>
restart - Equivalent to checkconf &amp;&amp; stop &amp;&amp;
start, but faster <br>
condrestart - Does &rsquo;restart&rsquo; action only if
already running <br>
try-restart - Aliases &rsquo;condrestart&rsquo; <br>
status - Checks the status of the running daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gdnsd is very fast, light, and pluggable authoritative DNS
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC SECURITY <br>
When started as the &quot;root&quot; user, gdnsd will always
attempt to drop privileges to another user, and will fail
fatally if that does not succeed. The default username for
this is <br>
&quot;gdnsd&quot;, but this can be overridden in the main
config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC CONFIGURATION <br>
The primary configuration file is the file named config in
the configuration directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the configuration file
does not have to exist for successful startup. Without a
configuration file, gdnsd will load all of the zones in the
zones directory and listen <br>
on port 53 of 0.0.0.0 and &quot;::&quot; using default
settings. It will also, by default, automatically process
changes (add/delete/update) to the set of zonefiles present
in the zones <br>
directory, which defaults to the zones/ subdirectory of the
configuration directory (&quot;/etc/gdnsd/zones/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDLINE OPTION FLAGS <br>
-c Set the configuration directory, defaults to
/etc/gdnsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Sets foreground mode for the
start, restart, condrestart, or try-restart actions. All
other actions are implicitly foreground operations and
ignore this flag. When <br>
[re]starting with &quot;-f&quot;, the new daemon will not
use &quot;fork(); setsid(); fork();&quot; to detach from the
terminal, and will not close default stdio descriptors or
stop mirroring <br>
its log output to the stdio descriptors at runtime.
Otherwise it behaves the same as an invocation without this
flag. See also &quot;-x&quot; regarding syslog output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Forces the
&quot;zones_strict_startup&quot; configuration option to
true for this invocation, regardless of the setting in the
config file. This is mostly useful for validation during
<br>
the &quot;checkconf&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Forces the
&quot;zones_strict_data&quot; configuration option to true
for this invocation, regardless of the setting in the config
file. This is mostly useful for validation during <br>
the &quot;checkconf&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enables additional debugging
output to syslog and/or the terminal, as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Disables syslog output
completely. By default, almost all possible output from all
gdnsd invocations is sent to syslog, even if it is also
mirrored to the terminal. The <br>
only exception to this rule (well, apart from certain early
fatal log outputs which are only triggered in the case of
internal code bugs) is the commandline usage output on <br>
invalid commandline arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is only legal for the
start, restart, condrestart, and try-restart options if used
in combination with the &quot;-f&quot; flag (as otherwise
the resulting daemon could end up <br>
with no error output channel at all). It is legal for all
other commands (which are all implicitly foreground actions,
and all also output to syslog by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Primarily intended for e.g.
linting invocations of checkconf, the daemon&rsquo;s
testsuite, etc, to avoid spamming syslog with things
unrelated to a real runtime daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use this flag for a start
invocation within a systemd unit file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
gdnsd acts as its own initscript, internalizing daemon
management functions. All valid invocations of the gdnsd
command include an action, most of which model normal
initscript <br>
actions. You may still want a light initscript wrapper to
comply with distribution standards for e.g. terminal output
on success/failure, setting up resource and security <br>
limits, etc, but it&rsquo;s not necessary for basic
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkconf <br>
Checks the validity of the configuration file and zonefiles,
setting the exit status appropriately (0 for success).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;start&quot;, and all
&quot;restart&quot;-like actions implicitly do the same
checks as &quot;checkconf&quot; as they load the
configuration for runtime use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start <br>
Starts gdnsd as a runtime DNS daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop <br>
Stops a gdnsd daemon previously started by start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart <br>
This is equivalent to the sequence &quot;checkconf
&amp;&amp; stop &amp;&amp; start&quot;. What actually
happens behind the scenes is a bit more complicated, with
the goal of making restarts as <br>
seamless and downtime-free as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;restart&quot; is a special
case of &quot;start&quot; which first completely starts
itself (including the acquisition of listening sockets, if
possible, see below) and is ready to answer <br>
requests *before* it stops the previous instance of the
daemon. This eliminates any stop -&gt; start delays from
expensive startup steps like parsing large numbers of
zonefiles <br>
and/or polling for initial monitoring results on a large
number of resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On platforms where
&quot;SO_REUSEPORT&quot; works correctly, the new daemon
uses this option (as did the old) to start its listening
sockets in parallel with those of the previous <br>
daemon just before sending the termination signal to it, to
eliminate any window of true unavailability. However, keep
in mind that a handful of requests will still be lost: <br>
those which were already in the local socket buffers for the
old instance when it exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;SO_REUSEPORT&quot;
isn&rsquo;t supported or doesn&rsquo;t work properly, the
daemon will re-attempt its socket acquisition after the
short delay of waiting for the previous daemon&rsquo;s pid
<br>
to exit. The delay should normally be fairly constant (does
not scale up with zones/configuration) and minimal in these
cases, on the order of &lt;1s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SO_REUSEPORT&quot; became
available in Linux starting with kernel version 3.9. BSDs
have had it for much longer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: &quot;restart&quot; will
not work correctly for a daemon that&rsquo;s running under
systemd, no matter how it&rsquo;s executed. Executing it
from the commandline will sort-of work in that <br>
it will replace the daemon that&rsquo;s running as a systemd
service with one that isn&rsquo;t a systemd service, but
that probably isn&rsquo;t what you want to do. Those running
under <br>
systemd will need to use e.g. &quot;systemctl restart
gdnsd&quot;, which will do a full serial stop -&gt; start
cycle, in order for configuration changes to take
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload-zones <br>
Sends &quot;SIGUSR1&quot; to the running daemon, forcing a
manual re-check of the zones directory for updated files.
Generally this should only be necessary if the configuration
<br>
option &quot;zones_rfc1035_auto&quot; has been explicitly
set to &quot;false&quot;, disabling the default mode where
gdnsd continuously monitors for and loads zonefile data
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not advised to set up an
initscript &quot;reload&quot; action which invokes
&quot;reload-zones&quot;, as a future version of gdnsd will
very likely include a true reload action for full <br>
re-configuration without restart. It&rsquo;s better to leave
the canonical reload action undefined for now to reduce
incompatibilities and/or surprises when that update
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">condrestart <br>
This is basically &quot;restart only if already
running&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performs the same actions as
&quot;restart&quot;, but aborts early (with a successful
exit value) if the daemon was not already running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">try-restart <br>
Alias for &quot;condrestart&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
Checks the status of the running daemon, returning 0 if it
is running or non-zero if it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other commandline option
will be treated as invalid, which will result in displaying
a short help text to STDERR and exiting with a non-zero exit
status. This includes <br>
things like the ubiquitous --help and --version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZONE FILES - RFC1035 <br>
The directory for standard RFC1035 zone files (the default
zone data backend) is the subdirectory named
&quot;zones&quot; in the configuration directory, so the
default would be <br>
/etc/gdnsd/zones/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC1035 zone files are the
traditional zone file format that one typically uses with
e.g. BIND. For more information on the internal format and
processing of these files, see <br>
gdnsd.zonefile(5). This section is about how the directory
itself is managed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files in the zones directory
are considered zone files. In general there should be
exactly one file per zone, and the filename should match the
zone name. Filenames <br>
beginning with &quot;.&quot; are ignored. All zone file must
be regular files (as opposed to directories, symlinks,
sockets, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the zones directory
is handled dynamically: as files are added, modified, and
deleted in this directory, zone data will automatically
update at runtime. This feature <br>
can be disabled (such that an explicit SIGUSR1 or
&quot;gdnsd reload-zones&quot; is required to re-scan for
changes) in the config file via the directive
&quot;zones_rfc1035_auto&quot; (see <br>
gdnsd.config(5)). It is legal for the directory to be empty
at startup, which results in all queries returning
&quot;REFUSED&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to better support the
special case of RFC 2137 -style classless in-addr.arpa
delegation zones (which contain forward slashes), any
&quot;@&quot; symbol in the filename will be <br>
translated to a forward slash (&quot;/&quot;) when
transforming a filename into its corresponding zone
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For similar reasons, if your
server is intended to serve the root of the DNS, the
filename for the root zone should be the special filename
ROOT_ZONE, rather than the impossible <br>
literal filename .. Because authoritative servers cannot
serve two domains which have a parent&lt;-&gt;child
relationship correctly, a root server cannot serve any other
zone, so this <br>
would be the sole zonefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard DNS zone file
escape sequences are recognized within the filenames (e.g.
&quot;.&quot; for a dot within a label, or &quot;&quot;
where NNN is a decimal integer in the range 0 - <br>
255), if for some reason you need a strange character in
your zone name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trailing dots on zonefile names
are ignored; e.g. example.com and example.com. are
functionally equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate zones (e.g. having
both of the above representations of &quot;example.com&quot;
present in the zones directory, and/or adding a different
case-mapping such as EXample.Com) are <br>
handled by loading both and giving runtime lookup priority
to one of the copies based on a couple of simple rules: the
highest &quot;serial&quot; wins, and if more than one file
has the <br>
highest serial, the highest filesystem &quot;mtime&quot;
value wins. If the primary copy is later removed, any
remaining copy of the zone will be promoted for runtime
lookups according to <br>
that same ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subzones (e.g. having zonefiles
for both &quot;example.com&quot; and
&quot;subz.example.com&quot;) are only marginally supported.
The child zone will be loaded into memory, but its data
won&rsquo;t be <br>
available for lookup, as it is suppressed by the existence
of the parent zone. If the parent zone is later removed, the
subzone data will become available. Logically, it is not
<br>
possible for a single server to be authoritative for both a
subzone and its parent zone at the same time, as each
&quot;role&quot; (parent and child) requires different
responses to <br>
requests for data within the child zone. gdnsd choses to
default to the &quot;parent&quot; role in these conflict
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tools which are used to update
zonefiles while gdnsd is running should always use atomic
operations (&quot;rename()&quot;, &quot;unlink()&quot;,
&quot;link()&quot;) to alter the zone files. See the <br>
documentation for &quot;zones_rfc1035_quiesce&quot; in
gdnsd.config(5) for more details about this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZONE FILES - DJBDNS <br>
There is now experimental support for djbdns-format
zonefiles in the djbdns subdirectory of the config directory
(default /etc/gdnsd/djbdns/. For more information see <br>
gdnsd.djbdns(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the same zone is specified
via more than one zone data backend (e.g. rfc1035 + djbdns),
the same rules shown in the above section apply: both will
be loaded and managed, but <br>
only one will be used for queries at any given time (based
on mtime/serial).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORIES <br>
Important directory paths for the core daemon code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/gdnsd <br>
Default configuration directory, unless overridden via
&quot;-c&quot;. The primary configuration file is always the
file config in the configuration directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/gdnsd <br>
Default run_dir. The daemon will store a pidfile here (which
is not intended for reliable text-based consumption by third
parties). See the entry for &quot;run_dir&quot; in the <br>
gdnsd.config(5) manpage for more information about this
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/gdnsd <br>
Default state_dir. The admin_state file is read from this
directory for administrative state-overrides on monitored
resources, see below in the FILES section. See the entry
<br>
for &quot;state_dir&quot; in the gdnsd.config(5) manpage for
more information about this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gdnsd
<br>
This is the default path that plugin shared libraries are
loaded from. Other directories can be prepended to the
search path via the configuration option <br>
&quot;plugin_search_path&quot;, documented in
gdnsd.config(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gdnsd
<br>
This is the default path for daemon-private executables that
users should not run. The only current case is
gdnsd_extmon_helper for the extmon plugin and the path for
this <br>
can be overridden in that plugin&rsquo;s configuration,
documented in gdnsd-plugin-extmon(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADMIN STATE FILE -
/var/lib/gdnsd/admin_state <br>
This file is the input for administrative state overrides
affecting plugin resolution decisions. The intent of this
file is to allow explicit, human administrative decisions to
<br>
temporarily override the states affecting plugin
decision-making on issues of failover and/or geographic
distribution. A non-existent file is treated the same as an
empty file. <br>
The file is watched at runtime for changes, and any
overridden state found is applied quickly. The file is
expected to persist reboots and daemon restarts in order to
preserve <br>
the administrator&rsquo;s intent through these events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A basic understanding of how
both monitoring and resolution plugins in gdnsd work is
assumed (see gdnsd.config(5)). This file is parsed as a vscf
hash data structure (again, see <br>
gdnsd.config(5) for deeper details of that format). The keys
are the names of monitored or virtual resources, and the
values are forced state values (optionally with monitored-
<br>
TTL values as well). Keys can also be wildcards using the
shell glob syntax which affect multiple resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For normal monitored resources,
the typical form of a key would be
&quot;THING/service_type&quot;, where &quot;THING&quot; is
the monitored address or CNAME value and
&quot;service_type&quot; is the <br>
service_type configured to monitor that address or CNAME
value by one or more resolver plugins. The value portion
takes the form of &quot;STATE[/TTL]&quot;, where
&quot;STATE&quot; is &quot;UP&quot; or <br>
&quot;DOWN&quot; and the TTL portion is an optional override
of the monitored TTL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of the lines in the
file is important; they are processed and applied in-order
such that later lines can override the actions of earlier
lines. This is especially <br>
handy for making exceptions to glob-matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/gdnsd/admin_state: <br>
2001:db8::2:123/my_http_check =&gt; DOWN # down a specific
res+stype <br>
foo.example.com./extmon_ping =&gt; UP # up a specific
res+stype <br>
192.0.2.1/* =&gt; DOWN # down all service_types for this
address <br>
*/xmpp =&gt; UP/30 # up all resources monitored by xmpp w/
TTL 30 ... <br>
192.0.2.2/xmpp =&gt; DOWN # ... except this one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some resolution plugins can also
register virtual resources (which are not monitored by any
&quot;service_type&quot;) solely for the purpose of
administrative override of decision-making. <br>
Currently the geoip and metafo plugins do this for their
&quot;datacenters&quot;, and the keys they create take the
form of &quot;plugin_name/resname/dcname&quot; to force a
datacenter&rsquo;s state at <br>
the per-resource level. The geoip plugin also supports keys
of the form &quot;plugin_name/mapname/dcname&quot; to force
a datacenter&rsquo;s state at the per-map level. These
forcings override <br>
the aggregate state passed up to geoip/metafo from
per-datacenter plugins (e.g. multifo or weighted monitoring
several addresses in a datacenter), and in the geoip case
the more- <br>
specific per-resource forced state will override any per-map
forced state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/gdnsd/admin_state: <br>
geoip/map3/dc-us =&gt; DOWN # down dc-us in geoip map3 <br>
*/dc-jp =&gt; DOWN # down all datacenters named dc-jp for
geoip and metafo <br>
metafo/res_www/dc-jp =&gt; UP # exception to above</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the available monitored
and virtual keys that can be matched in this file are listed
in the daemon&rsquo;s HTML, CSV, and JSON -format outputs
from the built-in status http <br>
server (default port 3506), as are their current monitors
and admin_state-forced states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEMD COMPATIBILITY <br>
This daemon is implicitly compatible with running as a
systemd service on Linux, and should have come with a
ready-made unit file during installation that works
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the daemon detects that
it&rsquo;s running underneath systemd as a unit (by
detecting that systemd is the running init system and that
gdnsd&rsquo;s initial parent pid is 1), it makes <br>
some changes to its default behaviors to be more
systemd-friendly. This includes shutting off stdio output
very early (as soon as syslog is open) because the stdio and
syslog <br>
output channels are redundant under systemd and lead to
duplicate messages in the journal. It also makes use of
systemd&rsquo;s notification socket to coordinate operations
with the <br>
init system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of these things, it is
critical that the gdnsd unit file uses the
&quot;NotifyAccess=all&quot; setting, and that the
&quot;ExecStart=&quot; command for gdnsd uses a commandline
that <br>
resembles &quot;gdnsd -f start&quot; and does not use
&quot;-x&quot; (other extra options are ok).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example unit file contents for
the Service section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Service] <br>
Type=notify <br>
NotifyAccess=all <br>
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/gdnsd -f start <br>
ExecStop=/usr/sbin/gdnsd stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not advised to set up
&quot;ExecReload=/usr/sbin/gdnsd reload-zones&quot; to
re-purpose the systemctl reload action for zone reloads, as
a future version of gdnsd will very likely <br>
include a real option for full configuration reload under
systemd, which would change this behavior. It&rsquo;s better
to leave the canonical reload action undefined for now to
reduce <br>
incompatibilities and/or surprises when that update occurs.
It is even less advised to try to configure
&quot;ExecReload=/usr/sbin/gdnsd restart&quot;, as this will
not work!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, if you&rsquo;re
running gdnsd as a systemd service, you should use the
supplied style of unit file and use &quot;systemctl&quot;
for daemon control (e.g. start, stop, restart, <br>
status), and use &quot;/usr/sbin/gdnsd reload-zones&quot;
for zone reloads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Any signal not explicitly mentioned is not explicitly
handled. That is to say, they will have their default
actions, which often include aborting execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM, SIGINT <br>
Causes the daemon to exit gracefully with accompanying log
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Causes the daemon to attempt to load any new changes to the
zone data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
Ignored during daemon runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGPIPE <br>
Ignored always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
An exit status of zero indicates success, anything else
indicates failure.</p>
