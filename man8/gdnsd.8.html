gdnsd - An authoritative DNS daemon
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
  Usage: gdnsd [-fsSD] [-c /etc/gdnsd] &lt;action&gt;
    -D - Enable verbose debug output
    -f - Foreground mode for [re]start actions
    -s - Force 'zones_strict_startup = true' for this invocation
    -S - Force 'zones_strict_data = true' for this invocation
    -c - Configuration directory
    -x - No syslog output (must use -f with this if [re]start)
  Actions:
    checkconf - Checks validity of config and zone files
    start - Start as a regular daemon
    stop - Stops a running daemon previously started by 'start'
    reload-zones - Send SIGUSR1 to running daemon for zone data reload
    restart - Equivalent to checkconf &amp;&amp; stop &amp;&amp; start, but faster
    condrestart - Does 'restart' action only if already running
    try-restart - Aliases 'condrestart'
    status - Checks the status of the running daemon

<b>gdnsd</b> is very fast, light, and pluggable authoritative DNS daemon.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BASIC_SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#BASIC_SECURITY">BASIC
  SECURITY</a></h1>
When started as the &quot;root&quot; user, gdnsd will always attempt to drop
  privileges to another user, and will fail fatally if that does not succeed.
  The default username for this is &quot;gdnsd&quot;, but this can be overridden
  in the main config file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BASIC_CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#BASIC_CONFIGURATION">BASIC
  CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The primary configuration file is the file named <i>config</i> in the
  configuration directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the configuration file does not have to exist for successful startup.
  Without a configuration file, gdnsd will load all of the zones in the zones
  directory and listen on port 53 of 0.0.0.0 and &quot;::&quot; using default
  settings. It will also, by default, automatically process changes
  (add/delete/update) to the set of zonefiles present in the zones directory,
  which defaults to the <i>zones/</i> subdirectory of the configuration
  directory (&quot;/etc/gdnsd/zones/&quot;).

  <dd class="It-tag">This is equivalent to the sequence &quot;checkconf
      &amp;&amp; stop &amp;&amp; start&quot;. What actually happens behind the
      scenes is a bit more complicated, with the goal of making restarts as
      seamless and downtime-free as possible.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;restart&quot; is a special case of &quot;start&quot; which first
      completely starts itself (including the acquisition of listening sockets,
      if possible, see below) and is ready to answer requests *before* it stops
      the previous instance of the daemon. This eliminates any stop -&gt; start
      delays from expensive startup steps like parsing large numbers of
      zonefiles and/or polling for initial monitoring results on a large number
      of resources.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On platforms where &quot;SO_REUSEPORT&quot; works correctly, the new daemon
      uses this option (as did the old) to start its listening sockets in
      parallel with those of the previous daemon just before sending the
      termination signal to it, to eliminate any window of true unavailability.
      However, keep in mind that a handful of requests will still be lost: those
      which were already in the local socket buffers for the old instance when
      it exited.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If &quot;SO_REUSEPORT&quot; isn't supported or doesn't work properly, the
      daemon will re-attempt its socket acquisition after the short delay of
      waiting for the previous daemon's pid to exit. The delay should normally
      be fairly constant (does not scale up with zones/configuration) and
      minimal in these cases, on the order of &lt;1s.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;SO_REUSEPORT&quot; became available in Linux starting with kernel
      version 3.9. BSDs have had it for much longer.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: &quot;restart&quot; will <b>not</b> work correctly for a daemon that's
      running under systemd, no matter how it's executed. Executing it from the
      commandline will sort-of work in that it will replace the daemon that's
      running as a systemd service with one that isn't a systemd service, but
      that probably isn't what you want to do. Those running under systemd will
      need to use e.g. &quot;systemctl restart gdnsd&quot;, which will do a full
      serial stop -&gt; start cycle, in order for configuration changes to take
      effect.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>reload-zones</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sends &quot;SIGUSR1&quot; to the running daemon, forcing a

      monitors for and loads zonefile data changes.

    It is not advised to set up an initscript &quot;reload&quot; action which

      likely include a true reload action for full re-configuration without

Any other commandline option will be treated as invalid, which will result in
  displaying a short help text to <i>STDERR</i> and exiting with a non-zero exit
  status. This includes things like the ubiquitous <b>--help</b> and
  <b>--version</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ZONE_FILES_-_RFC1035"><a class="selflink" href="#ZONE_FILES_-_RFC1035">ZONE
  FILES - RFC1035</a></h1>
The directory for standard RFC1035 zone files (the default zone data backend) is
  the subdirectory named &quot;zones&quot; in the configuration directory, so
  the default would be <i>/etc/gdnsd/zones/</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
RFC1035 zone files are the traditional zone file format that one typically uses
  with e.g. BIND. For more information on the internal format and processing of
  these files, see <i>gdnsd.zonefile</i>(5). This section is about how the
  directory itself is managed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All files in the zones directory are considered zone files. In general there
  should be exactly one file per zone, and the filename should match the zone
  name. Filenames beginning with &quot;.&quot; are ignored. All zone file must
  be regular files (as opposed to directories, symlinks, sockets, etc).
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, the zones directory is handled dynamically: as files are added,
  modified, and deleted in this directory, zone data will automatically update
  at runtime. This feature can be disabled (such that an explicit SIGUSR1 or
  &quot;gdnsd reload-zones&quot; is required to re-scan for changes) in the
  config file via the directive &quot;zones_rfc1035_auto&quot; (see
  <i>gdnsd.config</i>(5)). It is legal for the directory to be empty at startup,
  which results in all queries returning &quot;REFUSED&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to better support the special case of RFC 2137 -style classless
  in-addr.arpa delegation zones (which contain forward slashes), any
  &quot;@&quot; symbol in the filename will be translated to a forward slash
  (&quot;/&quot;) when transforming a filename into its corresponding zone name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For similar reasons, if your server is intended to serve the root of the DNS,
  the filename for the root zone should be the special filename
  <i>ROOT_ZONE</i>, rather than the impossible literal filename <i>.</i>.
  Because authoritative servers cannot serve two domains which have a
  parent&lt;-&gt;child relationship correctly, a root server cannot serve any
  other zone, so this would be the sole zonefile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard DNS zone file escape sequences are recognized within the filenames
  (e.g. &quot;\.&quot; for a dot within a label, or &quot;\NNN&quot; where NNN
  is a decimal integer in the range 0 - 255), if for some reason you need a
  strange character in your zone name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Trailing dots on zonefile names are ignored; e.g. <i>example.com</i> and
  <i>example.com.</i> are functionally equivalent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Duplicate zones (e.g. having both of the above representations of
  &quot;example.com&quot; present in the zones directory, and/or adding a
  different case-mapping such as <i>EXample.Com</i>) are handled by loading both
  and giving runtime lookup priority to one of the copies based on a couple of
  simple rules: the highest &quot;serial&quot; wins, and if more than one file
  has the highest serial, the highest filesystem &quot;mtime&quot; value wins.
  If the primary copy is later removed, any remaining copy of the zone will be
  promoted for runtime lookups according to that same ordering.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Subzones (e.g. having zonefiles for both &quot;example.com&quot; and
  &quot;subz.example.com&quot;) are only marginally supported. The child zone
  will be loaded into memory, but its data won't be available for lookup, as it
  is suppressed by the existence of the parent zone. If the parent zone is later
  removed, the subzone data will become available. Logically, it is not possible
  for a single server to be authoritative for both a subzone and its parent zone
  at the same time, as each &quot;role&quot; (parent and child) requires
  different responses to requests for data within the child zone. gdnsd choses
  to default to the &quot;parent&quot; role in these conflict cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tools which are used to update zonefiles while gdnsd is running should always
  use atomic operations (&quot;rename()&quot;, &quot;unlink()&quot;,
  &quot;link()&quot;) to alter the zone files. See the documentation for
  &quot;zones_rfc1035_quiesce&quot; in <i>gdnsd.config</i>(5) for more details
  about this.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ZONE_FILES_-_DJBDNS"><a class="selflink" href="#ZONE_FILES_-_DJBDNS">ZONE
  FILES - DJBDNS</a></h1>
There is now experimental support for djbdns-format zonefiles in the
  <i>djbdns</i> subdirectory of the config directory (default
  <i>/etc/gdnsd/djbdns/</i>. For more information see <i>gdnsd.djbdns</i>(5).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the same zone is specified via more than one zone data backend (e.g. rfc1035
  + djbdns), the same rules shown in the above section apply: both will be
  loaded and managed, but only one will be used for queries at any given time
  (based on mtime/serial).

  STATE FILE - <i>/var/lib/gdnsd/admin_state</i></a></h1>
This file is the input for administrative state overrides affecting plugin
  resolution decisions. The intent of this file is to allow explicit, human
  administrative decisions to temporarily override the states affecting plugin
  decision-making on issues of failover and/or geographic distribution. A
  non-existent file is treated the same as an empty file. The file is watched at
  runtime for changes, and any overridden state found is applied quickly. The
  file is expected to persist reboots and daemon restarts in order to preserve
  the administrator's intent through these events.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A basic understanding of how both monitoring and resolution plugins in gdnsd
  work is assumed (see <i>gdnsd.config</i>(5)). This file is parsed as a vscf
  hash data structure (again, see <i>gdnsd.config</i>(5) for deeper details of
  that format). The keys are the names of monitored or virtual resources, and
  the values are forced state values (optionally with monitored-TTL values as
  well). Keys can also be wildcards using the shell glob syntax which affect
  multiple resources.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For normal monitored resources, the typical form of a key would be
  &quot;THING/service_type&quot;, where &quot;THING&quot; is the monitored
  address or CNAME value and &quot;service_type&quot; is the service_type
  configured to monitor that address or CNAME value by one or more resolver
  plugins. The value portion takes the form of &quot;STATE[/TTL]&quot;, where
  &quot;STATE&quot; is &quot;UP&quot; or &quot;DOWN&quot; and the TTL portion is
  an optional override of the monitored TTL.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The order of the lines in the file is important; they are processed and applied
  in-order such that later lines can override the actions of earlier lines. This
  is especially handy for making exceptions to glob-matches.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /var/lib/gdnsd/admin_state:
        2001:db8::2:123/my_http_check =&gt; DOWN # down a specific res+stype
        foo.example.com./extmon_ping =&gt; UP # up a specific res+stype
        192.0.2.1/* =&gt; DOWN # down all service_types for this address
        */xmpp =&gt; UP/30 # up all resources monitored by xmpp w/ TTL 30 ...
        192.0.2.2/xmpp =&gt; DOWN # ... except this one
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some resolution plugins can also register virtual resources (which are not
  monitored by any &quot;service_type&quot;) solely for the purpose of
  administrative override of decision-making. Currently the geoip and metafo
  plugins do this for their &quot;datacenters&quot;, and the keys they create
  take the form of &quot;plugin_name/resname/dcname&quot; to force a
  datacenter's state at the per-resource level. The geoip plugin also supports
  keys of the form &quot;plugin_name/mapname/dcname&quot; to force a
  datacenter's state at the per-map level. These forcings override the aggregate
  state passed up to geoip/metafo from per-datacenter plugins (e.g. multifo or
  weighted monitoring several addresses in a datacenter), and in the geoip case
  the more-specific per-resource forced state will override any per-map forced
  state.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /var/lib/gdnsd/admin_state:
        geoip/map3/dc-us =&gt; DOWN # down dc-us in geoip map3
        */dc-jp =&gt; DOWN # down all datacenters named dc-jp for geoip and metafo
        metafo/res_www/dc-jp =&gt; UP # exception to above
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of the available monitored and virtual keys that can be matched in this file
  are listed in the daemon's HTML, CSV, and JSON -format outputs from the
  built-in status http server (default port 3506), as are their current monitors
  and admin_state-forced states.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSTEMD_COMPATIBILITY"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSTEMD_COMPATIBILITY">SYSTEMD
  COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
This daemon is implicitly compatible with running as a systemd service on Linux,
  and should have come with a ready-made unit file during installation that
  works correctly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the daemon detects that it's running underneath systemd as a unit (by
  detecting that systemd is the running init system and that gdnsd's initial
  parent pid is 1), it makes some changes to its default behaviors to be more
  systemd-friendly. This includes shutting off stdio output very early (as soon
  as syslog is open) because the stdio and syslog output channels are redundant
  under systemd and lead to duplicate messages in the journal. It also makes use
  of systemd's notification socket to coordinate operations with the init
  system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because of these things, it is critical that the gdnsd unit file uses the
  &quot;NotifyAccess=all&quot; setting, and that the &quot;ExecStart=&quot;
  command for gdnsd uses a commandline that resembles &quot;gdnsd -f start&quot;
  and does not use &quot;-x&quot; (other extra options are ok).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example unit file contents for the Service section:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    [Service]
    Type=notify
    NotifyAccess=all
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/gdnsd -f start
    ExecStop=/usr/sbin/gdnsd stop
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is not advised to set up &quot;ExecReload=/usr/sbin/gdnsd reload-zones&quot;
  to re-purpose the systemctl reload action for zone reloads, as a future
  version of gdnsd will very likely include a real option for full configuration
  reload under systemd, which would change this behavior. It's better to leave
  the canonical reload action undefined for now to reduce incompatibilities
  and/or surprises when that update occurs. It is even less advised to try to
  configure &quot;ExecReload=/usr/sbin/gdnsd restart&quot;, as this will
  <b>not</b> work!
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, if you're running gdnsd as a systemd service, you should use the
  supplied style of unit file and use &quot;systemctl&quot; for daemon control
  (e.g. start, stop, restart, status), and use &quot;/usr/sbin/gdnsd
  reload-zones&quot; for zone reloads.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
Any signal not explicitly mentioned is not explicitly handled. That is to say,
  they will have their default actions, which often include aborting execution.
