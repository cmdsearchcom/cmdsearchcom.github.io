<p>multilog(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
multilog(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
multilog - reads a sequence of lines from stdin and appends
selected lines to any number of logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
multilog script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
script consists of any number of arguments. Each argument
specifies one action. The actions are carried out in order
for each line of input. Note that actions may contain shell
<br>
metacharacters that need to be quoted when multilog is run
from a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multilog exits 0 when it sees
the end of stdin. If stdin has a partial final line then
multilog inserts a final newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multilog writes a message to
stderr and exits 111, without reading any input, if it runs
out of memory or if another multilog process is writing to
one of the same automatically <br>
rotated logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multilog has trouble writing
to disk after it starts reading input, it writes a message
to stderr, pauses, and tries again, without losing any data.
Note that this may block <br>
any program feeding input to multilog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multilog receives a TERM
signal, it will read and process data until the next
newline, and then exit, leaving stdin at the first byte of
data it has not processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTING LINES <br>
Each line is initially selected. The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pattern <br>
deselects the line if pattern matches the line. The
action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+pattern <br>
selects the line if pattern matches the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern is a string of stars and
non-stars. It matches any concatenation of strings matched
by all the stars and non-stars in the same order. A non-star
matches itself. A star <br>
before the end of pattern matches any string that does not
include the next character in pattern. A star at the end of
pattern matches any string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+hello</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selects hello. It does not
select hello world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-named[*]: Cleaned cache *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deselects named[135]: Cleaned
cache of 3121 RRs. The first star matches any string that
does not include a right bracket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deselects every line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To save memory, multilog
actually checks pattern against only the first 1000
characters of each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALERTS <br>
The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e prints (the first 200 bytes
of) each selected line to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS FILES <br>
The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=file replaces the contents of
file with (the first 1000 bytes of) each selected line,
padded with newlines to 1001 bytes. There is no protection
of file against power outages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the sequence of
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-* <br>
+STAT* <br>
=log/status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maintains log/status as a copy
of the most recent line starting with STAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMESTAMPING <br>
The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t inserts an @, a precise
timestamp, and a space in front of each line, using the same
format as tai64n(8). This is required to be the first
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patterns apply to the line after
the timestamp is inserted. For example, if</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multilog t &rsquo;-*&rsquo;
&rsquo;+* fatal: *&rsquo; ./main</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reads the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fatal: out of memory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then it will log a line such
as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@400000003b4a39c23294b13c fatal:
out of memory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with the first * matching the
timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use tai64nlocal(8) to
convert these timestamps to human-readable form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOMATICALLY ROTATED LOGS <br>
If dir starts with a dot or slash then the action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir appends each selected line
to a log named dir. If dir does not exist, multilog creates
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not attempt to write to one
log from two simultaneous multilog processes, or two actions
in one process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The log format is as follows.
dir is a directory containing some number of old log files,
a log file named current, and other files for multilog to
keep track of its <br>
actions. Each old log file has a name beginning with @,
continuing with a precise timestamp showing when the file
was finished, and ending with one of the following
codes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.s This file is completely
processed and safely written to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.u This file was being created
at the moment of an outage. It may have been truncated and
has not been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware that NFS, async
filesystems, and softupdates filesystems may discard files
that were not safely written to disk before an outage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While multilog is running,
current has mode 644. If multilog sees the end of stdin, it
writes current safely to disk, and sets the mode of current
to 744. When it <br>
restarts, it sets the mode of current back to 644 and
continues writing new lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multilog decides that
current is big enough, it writes current safely to disk,
sets the mode of current to 744, and renames current as an
old log file. The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssize sets the maximum file size
for subsequent dir actions. multilog will decide that
current is big enough if current has size bytes. (multilog
will also decide that current <br>
is big enough if it sees a newline within 2000 bytes of the
maximum file size; it tries to finish log files at line
boundaries.) size must be between 4096 and 16777215. <br>
The default maximum file size is 99999.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In versions 0.75 and above: If
multilog receives an ALRM signal, it immediately decides
that current is big enough, if current is nonempty. The
action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nnum sets the number of log
files for subsequent dir actions. After renaming current, if
multilog sees num or more old log files, it removes the old
log file with the smallest <br>
timestamp. num must be at least 2. The default number of log
files is 10. The action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!processor <br>
sets a processor for subsequent dir actions. multilog will
feed current through processor and save the output as an old
log file instead of current. multilog will also <br>
save any output that processor writes to descriptor 5, and
make that output readable on descriptor 4 when it runs
processor on the next log file. For reliability,
proces&acirc; <br>
sor must exit nonzero if it has any trouble creating its
output; multilog will then run it again. Note that running
processor may block any program feeding input to
multi&acirc; <br>
log.</p>
