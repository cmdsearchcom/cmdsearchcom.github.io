<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sslh - protocol demultiplexer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sslh [-F config file] [ -t num ] [--transparent] [-p
listening address [-p listening address ...] [--ssl target
address for SSL] [--ssh target address for SSH] [--openvpn
target <br>
address for OpenVPN] [--http target address for HTTP]
[--anyprot default target address] [--on-timeout protocol
name] [-u username] [-P pidfile] [-v] [-i] [-V] [-f]
[-n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sslh accepts connections on specified ports, and forwards
them further based on tests performed on the first data
packet sent by the remote client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Probes for HTTP, SSL, SSH,
OpenVPN, tinc, XMPP are implemented, and any other protocol
that can be tested using a regular expression, can be
recognised. A typical use case is to <br>
allow serving several services on port 443 (e.g. to connect
to ssh from inside a corporate firewall, which almost never
block port 443) while still serving HTTPS on that port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hence sslh acts as a protocol
demultiplexer, or a switchboard. Its name comes from its
original function to serve SSH and HTTPS on the same
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libwrap support <br>
One drawback of sslh is that the servers do not see the
original IP address of the client anymore, as the connection
is forwarded through sslh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this reason, sslh can be
compiled with libwrap to check accesses defined in
/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny. Libwrap services can
be defined using the configuration <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration file <br>
A configuration file can be supplied to sslh. Command line
arguments override file settings. sslh uses libconfig to
parse the configuration file, so the general file format is
<br>
indicated in
&lt;http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html&gt;.
Please refer to the example configuration file provided with
sslh for the specific format (Options have <br>
the same names as on the command line, except for the list
of listen ports and the list of protocols).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file makes it
possible to specify protocols using regular expressions: a
list of regular expressions is given as the regex_patterns
parameter, and if the first <br>
packet received from the client matches any of these
expressions, sslh connects to that protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Probing protocols <br>
When receiving an incoming connection, sslh will read the
first bytes sent be the connecting client. It will then
probe for the protocol in the order specified on the command
<br>
line (or the configuration file). Therefore --anyprot should
alway be used last, as it always succeeds and further
protocols will never be tried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no data is sent by the
client, sslh will eventually time out and connect to the
protocol specified with --on-timeout, or ssh if none is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging <br>
As a security/authorization program, sslh logs to the
LOG_AUTH facility, with priority LOG_INFO for normal
connections and LOG_ERR for failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-F filename, --config filename <br>
Uses filename has configuration file. If other command-line
options are specified, they will override the configuration
file&rsquo;s settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t num, --timeout num <br>
Timeout before forwarding the connection to the timeout
protocol (which should usually be SSH). Default is 2s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--on-timeout protocol name <br>
Name of the protocol to connect to after the timeout period
is over. Default is &rsquo;ssh&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--transparent <br>
Makes sslh behave as a transparent proxy, i.e. the receiving
service sees the original client&rsquo;s IP address. This
works on Linux only and involves iptables settings. Refer
<br>
to the README for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p listening address, --listen
listening address <br>
Interface and port on which to listen, e.g. foobar:443,
where foobar is the name of an interface (typically the IP
address on which the Internet connection ends up).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be specified several
times to bind sslh to several addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl target address <br>
--tls target address <br>
Interface and port on which to forward SSL connection,
typically localhost:443.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can set sslh to
listen on ext_ip:443 and httpd to listen on localhost:443:
this allows clients inside your network to just connect
directly to httpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, sslh probes for SSLv3 (or
TLSv1) handshake and will reject connections from clients
requesting SSLv2. This is compliant to RFC6176 which
prohibits the usage of SSLv2. <br>
If you wish to accept SSLv2, use --default instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssh target address <br>
Interface and port on which to forward SSH connections,
typically localhost:22.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--openvpn target address <br>
Interface and port on which to forward OpenVPN connections,
typically localhost:1194.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xmpp target address <br>
Interface and port on which to forward XMPP connections,
typically localhost:5222.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--http target address <br>
Interface and port on which to forward HTTP connections,
typically localhost:80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tinc target address <br>
Interface and port on which to forward tinc connections,
typically localhost:655.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is experimental. If you use
this feature, please report the results (even if it
works!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--anyprot target address <br>
Interface and port on which to forward if no other protocol
has been found. Because sslh tries protocols in the order
specified on the command line, this should be specified <br>
last. If no default is specified, sslh will forward unknown
protocols to the first protocol specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Increase verboseness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numeric <br>
Do not attempt to resolve hostnames: logs will contain IP
addresses. This is mostly useful if the system&rsquo;s DNS
is slow and running the sslh-select variant, as DNS requests
<br>
will hang all connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints sslh version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username, --user username
<br>
Requires to run under the specified username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P pidfile, --pidfile pidfile
<br>
Specifies a file in which to write the PID of the main
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --inetd <br>
Runs as an inetd server. Options -P (PID file), -p (listen
address), -u (user) are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
Runs in foreground. The server will not fork and will remain
connected to the terminal. Messages normally sent to syslog
will also be sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--background <br>
Runs in background. This overrides foreground if set in the
configuration file (or on the command line, but there is no
point setting both on the command line unless you have <br>
a personality disorder).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/lib/systemd/system/sslh.service <br>
Systemd unit to control the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/sysconfig/sslh <br>
Server configuration. These are environment variables loaded
by the start-up script and passed to sslh as command-line
arguments. Refer to the OPTIONS section for a detailed <br>
explanation of the variables used by sslh.</p>
