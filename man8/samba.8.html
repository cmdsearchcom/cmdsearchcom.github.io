samba - Server to provide AD and SMB/CIFS services to
clients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
samba [-D] [-i] [-M &lt;model&gt;]
[--maximum-runtime=&lt;seconds&gt;] [-b] [--help] [--usage]
[-d &lt;debug level&gt;] [--debug-stderr] [-s

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">samba is the server daemon that
provides Active Directory, filesharing and printing services
to clients. The server provides filespace and directory
services to clients using the <br>
SMB (or CIFS) protocol and other related protocols such as
DCE/RPC, LDAP and Kerberos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients supported include
MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows
95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000/XP/2003, OS/2, DAVE for
Macintosh, and cifsfs for Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extensive description of the
services that the server can provide is given in the man
page for the configuration file controlling the attributes
of those services (see <br>
smb.conf(5). This man page will not describe the services,
but will concentrate on the administrative aspects of
running the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that there are
significant security implications to running this server,
and the smb.conf(5) manual page should be regarded as
mandatory reading before proceeding <br>
with installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-D|--daemon <br>
If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as
a daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the
background, fielding requests on the appropriate ports. <br>
Operating the server as a daemon is the recommended way of
running samba for servers that provide more than casual use
file and print services. This switch is assumed if <br>
samba is executed on the command line of a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i|--interactive <br>
If this parameter is specified it causes the server to run
&quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if the
server is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting
this <br>
parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when run from the
command line. samba also logs to standard output, as if the
-S parameter had been given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M model <br>
This parameter can be used to specify the &quot;process
model&quot; samba should use. This determines how concurrent
clients are handled. Available process models include single
<br>
(everything in a single process), standard (similar
behaviour to that of Samba 3), thread (single process,
different threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maximum-runtime=seconds <br>
Set maximum runtime of the server process till
autotermination in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b|--show-build <br>
Print information about how Samba was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Display brief usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-stderr <br>
Send debug output to STDERR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--leak-report <br>
Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--leak-report-full <br>
Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--debuglevel=level <br>
level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
parameter is not specified is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The higher this value, the more
detail will be logged to the log files about the activities
of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious
warnings will be <br>
logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running
- it generates a small amount of information about
operations carried out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Levels above 1 will generate
considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used
when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed
for use only by developers <br>
and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that specifying this
parameter here will override the log level parameter in the
smb.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V|--version <br>
Prints the program version number.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s|--configfile=&lt;configuration
file&gt; <br>
The file specified contains the configuration details
required by the server. The information in this file
includes server-specific information such as what printcap
file to <br>
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at <br>
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
<br>
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
&quot;.progname&quot; will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the
client.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<br>
Set the smb.conf(5) option &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; to value
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?|--help <br>
Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Display brief usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/rc <br>
or whatever initialization script your system uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If running the server as a
daemon at startup, this file will need to contain an
appropriate startup sequence for the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/services <br>
If running the server via the meta-daemon inetd, this file
must contain a mapping of service name (e.g., netbios-ssn)
to service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g., <br>
tcp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
<br>
This is the default location of the smb.conf(5) server
configuration file. Other common places that systems install
this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and <br>
/etc/samba/smb.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file describes all the
services the server is to make available to clients. See
smb.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Most diagnostics issued by the server are logged in a
specified log file. The log file name is specified at
compile time, but may be overridden on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number and nature of
diagnostics available depends on the debug level used by the
server. If you have problems, set the debug level to 3 and
peruse the log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most messages are reasonably
self-explanatory. Unfortunately, at the time this man page
was created, there are too many diagnostics available in the
source code to warrant <br>
describing each and every diagnostic. At this stage your
best bet is still to grep the source code and inspect the
conditions that gave rise to the diagnostics you are
seeing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This man page is correct for version 4 of the Samba
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
hosts_access(5) smb.conf(5), smbclient(8), samba-tool(8),
smbd(8), nmbd(8), winbindd(1), and the Internet RFC&rsquo;s
rfc1001.txt, rfc1002.txt. In addition the CIFS (formerly
SMB) <br>
specification is available as a link from the Web page
http://samba.org/cifs/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux <br>
kernel is developed.</p>
