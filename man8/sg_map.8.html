<p>SG_MAP(8) SG3_UTILS SG_MAP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_map - displays mapping between Linux sg and other SCSI
devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_map [-a] [-h] [-i] [-n] [-scd] [-sd] [-sr] [-st] [-V]
[-x]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sometimes it is difficult to determine which SCSI device a
sg device name (e.g. /dev/sg0) refers to. This command loops
through the sg devices and finds the corresponding SCSI <br>
disk, cdrom or tape device name (if any). Scanners are an
example of SCSI devices that have no alternate SCSI device
name apart from their sg device name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is deprecated and
has not been updated for years, only very obvious bugs will
be fixed. Unless a very old version of Linux is being used
(e.g. 2.4 series or ear&acirc; <br>
lier), then please use a utility like lsscsi(8) or the
facilities offered by udev(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a assume the sg devices have alphabetical device names and
loop through /dev/sga, /dev/sgb, etc. Default is numeric
scan. Note that sg device nodes with an alphabetical <br>
index have been deprecated since the Linux kernel 2.2
series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h print usage message then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i in addition do a standard
INQUIRY and output vendor, product and revision strings for
devices that are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n assume the sg devices have
numeric device names and loop through /dev/sg0, /dev/sg1,
etc. Default is numeric scan</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scd display mappings to SCSI
cdrom device names of the form /dev/scd0, /dev/scd1 etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sd display mappings to SCSI
disk device names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sr display mappings to SCSI
cdrom device names of the form /dev/sr0, /dev/sr1 etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-st display mappings to SCSI
tape device names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print out version string then
exit (without further ado).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x after each active sg device
name is displayed there are five digits: &lt;host_number&gt;
&lt;bus&gt; &lt;scsi_id&gt; &lt;lun&gt;
&lt;scsi_type&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If no options starting with &quot;-s&quot; are given then
the mapping to all SCSI disk, cdrom and tape device names is
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the device file system
(devfs) is present a line noting this is output. The
&quot;native&quot; devfs scsi hierarchy makes the
relationship between a sg device name and any corresponding
<br>
disk, cdrom or tape device name easy to establish. This
replaces the need for this command. However many
applications will continue to look for Linux SCSI device
names in their <br>
traditional places. [Devfs supplies a compatibility daemon
called devfsd whose default configuration adds back the
Linux device names in their traditional positions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quite often the mapping
information can be derived by observing the output of the
command: &quot;cat /proc/scsi/scsi&quot;. However if devices
have been added since boot this can be <br>
deceptive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Linux kernel 2.6 series
something close to the mapping shown by this utility can be
found by analysing sysfs. The main difference is that sysfs
analysis will show the map&acirc; <br>
ping between sg nodes and other SCSI device nodes in terms
of major and minor numbers. While major 8, minor 16 will
usually be /dev/sdb this is not necessarily so. Facilities
<br>
associated with udev may assign major 8, minor 16 some other
device node name. This version of sg_map has been extended
to cope with sparse disk device node names of the form <br>
&quot;/dev/sd&lt;str&gt;&quot; where &lt;str&gt; can be one
of [a-z,aa-zz,aaa-zzz]. See the sg_map26 utility for a more
precise way (i.e. less directory scanning) for mapping
between sg device names <br>
and higher level names; including finding user defined
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility was written at a
time when hotplugging of SCSI devices was not supported in
Linux. It used a simple algorithm to scan sg device nodes in
ascending numeric or alpha&acirc; <br>
betical order, stopping after there were 5 consecutive
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Linux kernel 2.6 series,
this utility uses sysfs to find which sg device nodes are
active and only checks those. Hence there can be large
&quot;holes&quot; in the numbering of sg <br>
device nodes (e.g. after an adapter has been removed) and
still all active sg device nodes will be listed. This
utility assumes that sg device nodes are named using the
normal <br>
conventions and searches from /dev/sg0 to /dev/sg4095
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
My system has a SCSI disk, a cd writer and a dvd player:
<br>
$ sg_map <br>
# Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present <br>
/dev/sg0 /dev/sda <br>
/dev/sg1 /dev/sr0 <br>
/dev/sg2 /dev/sr1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to find which sg device
name corresponds to the disk: <br>
$ sg_map -sd <br>
# Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present <br>
/dev/sg0 /dev/sda <br>
/dev/sg1 <br>
/dev/sg2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-x&quot; option gives
the following output: <br>
sg_map -x <br>
# Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present <br>
/dev/sg0 1 0 1 0 0 /dev/sda <br>
/dev/sg1 2 0 4 0 5 /dev/sr0 <br>
/dev/sg2 2 0 6 0 5 /dev/sr1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a SCSI scanner is added the
output becomes: <br>
$ sg_map <br>
# Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present <br>
/dev/sg0 /dev/sda <br>
/dev/sg1 /dev/sr0 <br>
/dev/sg2 /dev/sr1 <br>
/dev/sg3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By process of elimination
/dev/sg3 must be the scanner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_map is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
