<p>ureadahead(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ureadahead(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ureadahead - Read files in advance during boot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ureadahead [OPTIONS]... [PACK]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ureadahead (&Atilde;&frac14;ber-readahead) is used during
boot to read files in advance of when they are needed such
that they are already in the page cache, improving boot
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When started without any
arguments, it checks for the existance and age of the
default pack file /var/lib/ureadahead/pack, and if not
present or older than a month, will discard <br>
it and retrace the boot sequence. The pack will then contain
information about the files opened during boot, and the
blocks that were in memory at the completion of the
boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file exists and is newer
than a month old, or an alternate PACK path is given on the
command-line, the files listed in the pack are opened and
the blocks read into the <br>
page cache using the readahead(2) system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pack files are automatically
optimised for Solid-State Disks or rotational Hard Drives,
depending on which you have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--verbose <br>
May be used to report on ureadahead&rsquo;s operation. In
particular, this causes information about the size of the
pack file to be output when reading and a complete dump of
<br>
the contents of the pack file after tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon <br>
Places ureadahead into the background once the pack file has
been read, or once tracing has been enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is ignored when reading on
rotational hard drives, since it&rsquo;s important for
performance reasons not to contend with other processes for
I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-trace <br>
Discards all pack files and forces re-tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout=SECONDS <br>
Normally when tracing, ureadahead will wait for a TERM or
INT signal before concluding and generating the pack file.
This option instead sets a timeout after which trac&acirc;
<br>
ing is terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump Dump the contents of the
pack file to standard output in a pretty format, does not
trace or read the contents into memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort=SORT <br>
Used with --dump to sort the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is open, which is
the order that the files will be opened. path sorts by path
name, disk sorts by on-disk location, and size sorts by the
amount of data that <br>
will be read for that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER MOUNT POINTS <br>
PACK need not be the filename of a pack, instead it may be
the name of a mount point (or indeed any non-file within the
filesystem), in which case the pack for that device is <br>
read instead. This allows ureadahead to be called in the
style ureadahead /usr for filesystems split across multiple
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pack files for these other
devices are also stored under /var/lib/ureadahead and are
named mountpoint.pack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tracing, these will be
automatically generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/ureadahead/pack</p>
