<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apcupsd &acirc; a daemon for controlling most APC UPSes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apcupsd [-b] [-d level | --debug level] [-f file |
--config-file file] [-P file | --pid-file file] [-p |
--kill-on-powerfail | -t | --term-on-powerfail] [-R]</p>

--hibernate | -o | --power-off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apcupsd [-h | --help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apcupsd [-V | --version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The apcupsd daemon controls the operation of most American
Power Conversion Corp (APC) UPSes. During a power failure,
apcupsd informs users about the loss of utility power and
<br>
that a shutdown may occur. If utility power is not restored,
a system shutdown will follow when the battery is exhausted,
a specified timeout expires, a specified battery charge <br>
percentage is reached, or a specified battery runtime (based
on internal UPS calculations and determined by power
consumption rates) expires. If the utility power is restored
<br>
before one of the these shutdown conditions is met, apcupsd
will inform users of this and the shutdown will generally be
cancelled. Refer to the Implementation Notes section below
<br>
for situations in which the shutdown may not be
cancelled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meaning of the command line
options is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Run in the foreground, do not
detach and become a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d level --debug level <br>
Set debugging output level where level is a number greater
than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file --config-file file <br>
Load the specified configuration file. The default
configuration file is /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf. It must be
changed when running more than one copy of apcupsd on <br>
the same computer to control multiple UPSes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k | --killpower | --hibernate
<br>
Power down the UPS in hibernate mode after a 10 second
delay. This option is normally only used by apcupsd itself
to power down the UPS after a system shutdown has <br>
almost completed. In hibernate mode, the UPS will again
supply power to the system when the utility power
returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o | --power-off <br>
Power down UPS completely. The UPS will not supply power to
the system when the utility power returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P file --pid-file file <br>
Create the specified process ID file. The default is
/var/run/apcupsd.pid. It must be changed when running more
than one copy of apcupsd on the same computer to con&acirc;
<br>
trol multiple UPSes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --kill-on-powerfail <br>
apcupsd commands the UPS to power down in hibernate mode
just before apcupsd starts the system shutdown. This relies
on the grace shutdown delay of a Smart-UPS being <br>
long enough to allow the system to shutdown completely
before the UPS shuts off the power to the system and goes
into hibernate mode. This shutdown grace delay is a <br>
programmable value stored in a Smart-UPS EEPROM which can be
changed using apctest(8). In hibernate mode, the UPS will
again supply power to the system when the util&acirc; <br>
ity power returns. Refer to apcupsd.conf(5) for an
alternative method using the KILLDELAY configuration
directive and the only method available when using a
Back-UPS or <br>
other UPS operating in simple signalling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t --term-on-powerfail <br>
apcupsd exits immediately when it issues the system shutdown
command. This behaviour is useful for those systems where it
is not possible to insert apcupsd commands in <br>
a halt script to issue the killpower command. Without this
option, apcupsd will wait for the SIGTERM signal from the
system shutdown process before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Put a UPS which runs in smart
signalling mode by default (eg a Smart-UPS) into simple
signalling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --version <br>
Prints the apcupsd version number and the program help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help Prints the program
help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The apcupsd daemon supports a
networking mode called Network Information Server (NIS) --
not related to Sun&rsquo;s NIS/YP -- in which the daemon
serves status and event information to <br>
clients over a network. See the &quot;Running The Network
Information Server&quot; section of the apcupsd manual for
more information and configuration details on this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The apcupsd daemon also supports
a Smart-UPS in SNMP mode provided an APC Web/SNMP or APC
PowerNet SNMP card is installed in the UPS&rsquo;s
SmartSlot. For more information and configu&acirc; <br>
ration details on this mode, refer to the &quot;Support for
SNMP UPSes&quot; section of the apcupsd manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION NOTES <br>
The shutdown is made by calls to the script
/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol by the apcupsd daemon. Consequently,
no changes to /etc/inittab are necessary on Linux as there
is no communi&acirc; <br>
cation between the daemon and the init(1) process.
Installation of the daemon modifies the halt script so that
at the end of the shutdown process, the daemon will be
re-executed <br>
to power off the UPS in hibernate mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some operating systems (eg
FreeBSD) there is no halt script so apccontrol must be
modified to cause the daemon to power off the UPS after a
delay. Alternatives are to use the <br>
--kill-on-powerfail command on the apcupsd command line or
refer to apcupsd.conf(5) for details of the KILLDELAY
configuration directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
It will almost certainly be necessary to customise the
configuration information in the /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
configuration file to suit your configuration and desired
UPS be&acirc; <br>
haviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information on the
configuration directives and the format of the configuration
file, refer to apcupsd.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENTS <br>
apcupsd generates events when certain conditions occur.
These events are sent to the system log and, optionally, to
the temporary events file (/var/log/apcupsd.events). They
also <br>
generate a call to the /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol script which
in turn will call any custom scripts placed in the
/etc/apcupsd directory which may override apccontrol&rsquo;s
default be&acirc; <br>
haviour. For details of the events and customising
apccontrol&rsquo;s behaviour, refer to apccontrol(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATA FILE FORMAT <br>
If the DATATIME configuration directive is set to non-zero,
apcupsd will log a data record at the interval defined by
the DATATIME directive. This data record is in a format
simi&acirc; <br>
lar to the APC PowerChute software data file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS REPORT FORMAT <br>
The status report output format is simple ASCII. Generally
there is a single piece of information on each line of
output. The content varies based on the model of UPS being
used <br>
and, in some cases, the firmware version. This status report
is also optionally written the the
/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status file. Refer to apcaccess(8) for
full details of the sta&acirc; <br>
tus report output.</p>
