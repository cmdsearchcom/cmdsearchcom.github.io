<p>IRCD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual IRCD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ircd - The Internet Relay Chat Program Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ircd [ -abciqst ] [ -f configfile ] [ -x debuglevel ] [ -h
hostname ] [ -T [ tunefile ] ] [ -p mode ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ircd -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ircd is the server (daemon) program for the Internet Relay
Chat Program. The ircd is a server in that its function is
to &quot;serve&quot; the client program irc(1) with messages
and <br>
commands. All commands and user messages are passed directly
to the ircd for processing and relaying to other ircd sites.
The irc(1) program depends upon there being an ircd <br>
server running somewhere (either on your local UNIX site or
a remote ircd site) so that it will have somewhere to
connect to and thus allow the user to begin talking to other
<br>
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ircd will reread its
configuration file whenever it received a hangup signal,
SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending an interrupt signal to
ircd process will cause it to restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Instructs the server to automatically die off if it loses
all it&rsquo;s clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b If the ircd.tune file is
corrupted, by default the server will not start. This option
will make the server start anyways, with the default values
(ignoring the corrupted <br>
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c This flag must be given if
you are running ircd from /dev/console or any other
situation where fd 0 isnt a tty and you want the server to
fork off and run in the <br>
background. This needs to be given if you are starting ircd
from an rc (such as /etc/rc.local) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i The server was started by
inetd and it should start accepting connections from
standard input. The following inetd.conf-line could be used
to start up ircd automatically <br>
when needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ircd stream tcp wait irc
/etc/ircd ircd -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allows inetd to start up ircd on
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Using this option stops the
server from doing DNS lookups on all the servers in your
ircd.conf file when it boots. This can take a lengthy amount
of time if you have a <br>
large number of servers and they are not all close by.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s When this option is
specified, iauth will not be started. This means that the
IRC daemon will perform &quot;ident lookups&quot; (RFC 1413)
internally to attempt to authenticate <br>
incoming connections. No other authentication mechanism will
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Instructs the server to
direct debugging output to standard output and to not fork
nor detach from terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Specifies the ircd.conf file to be used for this ircdaemon.
The option is used to override the default ircd.conf given
at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x # Defines the debuglevel for
ircd. The higher the debuglevel, the more stuff gets
directed to debugging file (or standard output if -t option
was used as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hostname <br>
Allows the user to manually set the server name at startup.
The default name is hostname.domainname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p mode <br>
Specify whether the server should enable built-in
protections against various type of user abuse that is
commonly found on big public networks. Possible modes are
strict <br>
(default), on and off and standalone. The strict option
enables the protections, and refuses to establish a link to
a server not running with this option. This is useful <br>
to force all servers on an IRC network to enable them. The
standalone option removes split checks and disallows any
server to connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T tunefile <br>
Specifies the ircd.tune file to be used for this ircdaemon.
The option is used to override the default ircd.tune given
at compile time. If no tune file is given, reading <br>
and writing of tune file is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option prevents the
server from starting, and dumps some information about the
version instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you plan to connect your ircd
server to an existing Irc-Network, <br>
you will need to alter your local IRC CONFIGURATION FILE
(typically named &quot;ircd.conf&quot;) so that it will
accept and make connections to other ircd servers. This file
<br>
contains the hostnames, Network Addresses, and sometimes
passwords for connections to other ircds around the world.
Because description of the actual file format of the <br>
&quot;ircd.conf&quot; file is beyond the scope of this
document, please refer to the file INSTALL in the IRC source
files documentation directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTING THE SERVER: The ircd
server can be started as part of the UNIX boot procedure or
just by placing the server into Unix Background. Keep in
mind that if it is *not* part <br>
of your UNIXES Boot-up procedure then you will have to
manually start the ircd server each time your UNIX is
rebooted. This means if your UNIX is prone to crashing or
going for <br>
for repairs a lot it would make sense to start the ircd
server as part of your UNIX bootup procedure. In some cases
the irc(1) will automatically attempt to boot the ircd
server <br>
if the user is on the SAME UNIX that the ircd is supposed to
be running on. If the irc(1) cannot connect to the ircd
server it will try to start the server on it&rsquo;s own and
will <br>
then try to reconnect to the newly booted ircd server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
tolsun% ircd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Places ircd into UNIX Background
and starts up the server for use. Note: You do not have to
add the &quot;&amp;&quot; to this command, the program will
automatically detach itself from tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tolsun% ircd -v <br>
ircd 2.9.3 AaCDEfFHiIkMsu_V1 <br>
zlib not used <br>
Tue Apr 1 1997 at 20:17:50 EDT #1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This indicates that this binary
is the version 2.9.3 of the software. AaCDEfFHiIkMsu_V1 are
the compile time options which were used. This binary does
not support compression <br>
of server-server links (does not use zlib) and was compiled
on April the 1st.</p>
