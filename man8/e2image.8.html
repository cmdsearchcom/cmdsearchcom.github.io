<p>E2IMAGE(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual E2IMAGE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
e2image - Save critical ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem metadata
to a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
e2image [ -r|Q ] [ -fr ] device image-file <br>
e2image -I device image-file <br>
e2image -ra [ -cfnp ] [ -o src_offset ] [ -O dest_offset ]
src_fs [ dest_fs ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The e2image program will save critical ext2, ext3, or ext4
filesystem metadata located on device to a file specified by
image-file. The image file may be examined by dumpe2fs <br>
and debugfs, by using the -i option to those programs. This
can assist an expert in recovering catastrophically
corrupted filesystems. In the future, e2fsck will be
enhanced to <br>
be able to use the image file to help recover a badly
damaged filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When saving an e2image for
debugging purposes, using either the -r or -Q options, the
filesystem must be unmounted or be mounted read/only, in
order for the image file to be in a <br>
consistent state. This requirement can be overriden using
the -f option, but the resulting image file is very likely
not going to be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If image-file is -, then the
output of e2image will be sent to standard output, so that
the output can be piped to another program, such as gzip(1).
(Note that this is currently <br>
only supported when creating a raw image file using the -r
option, since the process of creating a normal image file,
or QCOW2 image currently requires random access to the file,
<br>
which cannot be done using a pipe. This restriction will
hopefully be lifted in a future version of e2image.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is a very good idea to create
image files for all of filesystems on a system and save the
partition layout (which can be generated using the fdisk -l
command) at regular <br>
intervals --- at boot time, and/or every week or so. The
image file should be stored on some filesystem other than
the filesystem whose data it contains, to ensure that this
<br>
data is accessible in the case where the filesystem has been
badly damaged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To save disk space, e2image
creates the image file as a sparse file, or in QCOW2 format.
Hence, if the sparse image file needs to be copied to
another location, it should either <br>
be compressed first or copied using the --sparse=always
option to the GNU version of cp. This does not apply to the
QCOW2 image, which is not sparse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of an ext2 image file
depends primarily on the size of the filesystems and how
many inodes are in use. For a typical 10 gigabyte
filesystem, with 200,000 inodes in use <br>
out of 1.2 million inodes, the image file will be
approximately 35 megabytes; a 4 gigabyte filesystem with
15,000 inodes in use out of 550,000 inodes will result in a
3 megabyte <br>
image file. Image files tend to be quite compressible; an
image file taking up 32 megabytes of space on disk will
generally compress down to 3 or 4 megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTORING FILESYSTEM METADATA
USING AN IMAGE FILE <br>
The -I option will cause e2image to install the metadata
stored in the image file back to the device. It can be used
to restore the filesystem metadata back to the device in
<br>
emergency situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING!!!! The -I option should
only be used as a desperation measure when other
alternatives have failed. If the filesystem has changed
since the image file was created, data <br>
will be lost. In general, you should make a full image
backup of the filesystem first, in case you wish to try
other recovery strategies afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RAW IMAGE FILES <br>
The -r option will create a raw image file instead of a
normal image file. A raw image file differs from a normal
image file in two ways. First, the filesystem metadata is
<br>
placed in the proper position so that e2fsck, dumpe2fs,
debugfs, etc. can be run directly on the raw image file. In
order to minimize the amount of disk space consumed by a raw
<br>
image file, the file is created as a sparse file. (Beware of
copying or compressing/decompressing this file with
utilities that don&rsquo;t understand how to create sparse
files; the <br>
file will become as large as the filesystem itself!)
Secondly, the raw image file also includes indirect blocks
and directory blocks, which the standard image file does not
<br>
have, although this may change in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raw image files are sometimes
used when sending filesystems to the maintainer as part of
bug reports to e2fsprogs. When used in this capacity, the
recommended command is as fol&acirc; <br>
lows (replace hda1 with the appropriate device):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e2image -r /dev/hda1 - | bzip2
&gt; hda1.e2i.bz2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will only send the metadata
information, without any data blocks. However, the filenames
in the directory blocks can still reveal information about
the contents of the <br>
filesystem that the bug reporter may wish to keep
confidential. To address this concern, the -s option can be
specified. This will cause e2image to scramble directory
entries <br>
and zero out any unused portions of the directory blocks
before writing the image file. However, the -s option will
prevent analysis of problems related to hash-tree indexed
<br>
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this will work even if
you substitute &quot;/dev/hda1&quot; for another raw disk
image, or QCOW2 image previously created by e2image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QCOW2 IMAGE FILES <br>
The -Q option will create a QCOW2 image file instead of a
normal, or raw image file. A QCOW2 image contains all the
information the raw image does, however unlike the raw image
<br>
it is not sparse. The QCOW2 image minimize the amount of
disk space by storing data in special format with pack data
closely together, hence avoiding holes while still
minimizing <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to send filesystem to
the maintainer as a part of bug report to e2fsprogs, use
following commands (replace hda1 with the appropriate
device):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e2image -Q /dev/hda1 hda1.qcow2
<br>
bzip2 -z hda1.qcow2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will only send the metadata
information, without any data blocks. However, the filenames
in the directory blocks can still reveal information about
the contents of the <br>
filesystem that the bug reporter may wish to keep
confidential. To address this concern, the -s option can be
specified. This will cause e2image to scramble directory
entries <br>
and zero out any unused portions of the directory blocks
before writing the image file. However, the -s option will
prevent analysis of problems related to hash-tree indexed
<br>
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that QCOW2 image created by
e2image is regular QCOW2 image and can be processed by tools
aware of QCOW2 format such as for example qemu-img.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can convert a qcow2 image
into a raw image with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e2image -r hda1.qcow2
hda1.raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be useful to write a
qcow2 image containing all data to a sparse image file where
it can be loop mounted, or to a disk partition. Note that
this may not work with qcow2 <br>
images not generated by e2image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDING DATA <br>
Normally e2image only includes fs metadata, not regular file
data. The -a option can be specified to include all data.
This will give an image that is suitable to use to clone
<br>
the entire FS or for backup purposes. Note that this option
only works with the raw or QCOW2 formats. The -p switch may
be given to show progress. If the file system is being <br>
cloned to a flash-based storage device (where reads are very
fast and where it is desirable to avoid unnecessary writes
to reduce write wear on the device), the -c option which
<br>
cause e2image to try reading a block from the destination to
see if it is identical to the block which e2image is about
to copy. If the block is already the same, the write can
<br>
be skipped. The -n option will cause all of the writes to be
no-ops, and print the blocks that would have been
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OFFSETS <br>
Normally a filesystem starts at the beginning of a
partition, and e2image is run on the partition. When working
with image files, you don&rsquo;t have the option of using
the parti&acirc; <br>
tion device, so you can specify the offset where the
filesystem starts directly with the -o option. Similarly the
-O option specifies the offset that should be seeked to in
the <br>
destination before writing the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you have a dd
image of a whole hard drive that contains an ext2 fs in a
partition starting at 1 MiB, you can clone that fs with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e2image -aro 1048576 img
/dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or you can clone a fs into an
image file, leaving room in the first MiB for a partition
table with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e2image -arO 1048576 /dev/sda1
img</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify at least one
offset, and only one file, an in-place move will be
performed, allowing you to safely move the filesystem from
one offset to another.</p>
