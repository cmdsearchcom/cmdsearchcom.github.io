e2image - Save critical ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem metadata to a file

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>e2image</b> program will save critical ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem
  metadata located on <i>device</i> to a file specified by <i>image-file</i>.
  The image file may be examined by <b>dumpe2fs</b> and <b>debugfs</b>, by using
  the <b>-i</b> option to those programs. This can assist an expert in
  recovering catastrophically corrupted filesystems. In the future, e2fsck will
  be enhanced to be able to use the image file to help recover a badly damaged
  filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When saving an e2image for debugging purposes, using either the <b>-r</b> or
  <b>-Q</b> options, the filesystem must be unmounted or be mounted read/only,
  in order for the image file to be in a consistent state. This requirement can
  be overriden using the <b>-f</b> option, but the resulting image file is very
  likely not going to be useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>image-file</i> is -, then the output of <b>e2image</b> will be sent to
  standard output, so that the output can be piped to another program, such as
  <b>gzip</b>(1). (Note that this is currently only supported when creating a
  raw image file using the <b>-r</b> option, since the process of creating a
  normal image file, or QCOW2 image currently requires random access to the
  file, which cannot be done using a pipe. This restriction will hopefully be
  lifted in a future version of <b>e2image</b>.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is a very good idea to create image files for all of filesystems on a system
  and save the partition layout (which can be generated using the <b>fdisk
  -l</b> command) at regular intervals --- at boot time, and/or every week or
  so. The image file should be stored on some filesystem other than the
  filesystem whose data it contains, to ensure that this data is accessible in
  the case where the filesystem has been badly damaged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To save disk space, <b>e2image</b> creates the image file as a sparse file, or
  in QCOW2 format. Hence, if the sparse image file needs to be copied to another
  location, it should either be compressed first or copied using the
  <b>--sparse=always</b> option to the GNU version of <b>cp</b>. This does not
  apply to the QCOW2 image, which is not sparse.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The size of an ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of the filesystems
  and how many inodes are in use. For a typical 10 gigabyte filesystem, with
  200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2 million inodes, the image file will be
  approximately 35 megabytes; a 4 gigabyte filesystem with 15,000 inodes in use
  out of 550,000 inodes will result in a 3 megabyte image file. Image files tend
  to be quite compressible; an image file taking up 32 megabytes of space on
  disk will generally compress down to 3 or 4 megabytes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESTORING_FILESYSTEM_METADATA_USING_AN_IMAGE_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#RESTORING_FILESYSTEM_METADATA_USING_AN_IMAGE_FILE">RESTORING
  FILESYSTEM METADATA USING AN IMAGE FILE</a></h1>
The <b>-I</b> option will cause e2image to install the metadata stored in the
  image file back to the device. It can be used to restore the filesystem
  metadata back to the device in emergency situations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>WARNING!!!!</b> The <b>-I</b> option should only be used as a desperation
  measure when other alternatives have failed. If the filesystem has changed
  since the image file was created, data <b>will</b> be lost. In general, you
  should make a full image backup of the filesystem first, in case you wish to
  try other recovery strategies afterwards.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RAW_IMAGE_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#RAW_IMAGE_FILES">RAW
  IMAGE FILES</a></h1>
The <b>-r</b> option will create a raw image file instead of a normal image
  file. A raw image file differs from a normal image file in two ways. First,
  the filesystem metadata is placed in the proper position so that e2fsck,
  dumpe2fs, debugfs, etc. can be run directly on the raw image file. In order to
  minimize the amount of disk space consumed by a raw image file, the file is
  created as a sparse file. (Beware of copying or compressing/decompressing this
  file with utilities that don't understand how to create sparse files; the file
  will become as large as the filesystem itself!) Secondly, the raw image file
  also includes indirect blocks and directory blocks, which the standard image
  file does not have, although this may change in the future.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Raw image files are sometimes used when sending filesystems to the maintainer as
  part of bug reports to e2fsprogs. When used in this capacity, the recommended
  command is as follows (replace hda1 with the appropriate device):
<div class="Pp"></div>
	 <b>e2image -r /dev/hda1 - | bzip2 &gt; hda1.e2i.bz2</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will only send the metadata information, without any data blocks. However,
  the filenames in the directory blocks can still reveal information about the
  contents of the filesystem that the bug reporter may wish to keep
  confidential. To address this concern, the <b>-s</b> option can be specified.
  This will cause <b>e2image</b> to scramble directory entries and zero out any
  unused portions of the directory blocks before writing the image file.
  However, the <b>-s</b> option will prevent analysis of problems related to
  hash-tree indexed directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this will work even if you substitute &quot;/dev/hda1&quot; for
  another raw disk image, or QCOW2 image previously created by <b>e2image</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="QCOW2_IMAGE_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#QCOW2_IMAGE_FILES">QCOW2
  IMAGE FILES</a></h1>
The <b>-Q</b> option will create a QCOW2 image file instead of a normal, or raw
  image file. A QCOW2 image contains all the information the raw image does,
  however unlike the raw image it is not sparse. The QCOW2 image minimize the
  amount of disk space by storing data in special format with pack data closely
  together, hence avoiding holes while still minimizing size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to send filesystem to the maintainer as a part of bug report to
  e2fsprogs, use following commands (replace hda1 with the appropriate device):
<div class="Pp"></div>
	 <b>e2image -Q /dev/hda1 hda1.qcow2</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	 <b>bzip2 -z hda1.qcow2</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will only send the metadata information, without any data blocks. However,
  the filenames in the directory blocks can still reveal information about the
  contents of the filesystem that the bug reporter may wish to keep
  confidential. To address this concern, the <b>-s</b> option can be specified.
  This will cause <b>e2image</b> to scramble directory entries and zero out any
  unused portions of the directory blocks before writing the image file.
  However, the <b>-s</b> option will prevent analysis of problems related to
  hash-tree indexed directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that QCOW2 image created by <b>e2image</b> is regular QCOW2 image and can
  be processed by tools aware of QCOW2 format such as for example
  <b>qemu-img</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can convert a qcow2 image into a raw image with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
	 <b>e2image -r hda1.qcow2 hda1.raw</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This can be useful to write a qcow2 image containing all data to a sparse image
  file where it can be loop mounted, or to a disk partition. Note that this may
  not work with qcow2 images not generated by e2image.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INCLUDING_DATA"><a class="selflink" href="#INCLUDING_DATA">INCLUDING
  DATA</a></h1>
Normally <b>e2image</b> only includes fs metadata, not regular file data. The
  <b>-a</b> option can be specified to include all data. This will give an image
  that is suitable to use to clone the entire FS or for backup purposes. Note
  that this option only works with the raw or QCOW2 formats. The <b>-p</b>
  switch may be given to show progress. If the file system is being cloned to a
  flash-based storage device (where reads are very fast and where it is
  desirable to avoid unnecessary writes to reduce write wear on the device), the
  <b>-c</b> option which cause e2image to try reading a block from the
  destination to see if it is identical to the block which <b>e2image</b> is
  about to copy. If the block is already the same, the write can be skipped. The
  <b>-n</b> option will cause all of the writes to be no-ops, and print the
  blocks that would have been written.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OFFSETS"><a class="selflink" href="#OFFSETS">OFFSETS</a></h1>
Normally a filesystem starts at the beginning of a partition, and <b>e2image</b>
  is run on the partition. When working with image files, you don't have the
  option of using the partition device, so you can specify the offset where the
  filesystem starts directly with the <b>-o</b> option. Similarly the <b>-O</b>
  option specifies the offset that should be seeked to in the destination before
  writing the filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, if you have a <b>dd</b> image of a whole hard drive that contains
  an ext2 fs in a partition starting at 1 MiB, you can clone that fs with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
	 <b>e2image -aro 1048576 img /dev/sda1</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Or you can clone a fs into an image file, leaving room in the first MiB for a
  partition table with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
	 <b>e2image -arO 1048576 /dev/sda1 img</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify at least one offset, and only one file, an in-place move will be
  performed, allowing you to safely move the filesystem from one offset to
  another.
