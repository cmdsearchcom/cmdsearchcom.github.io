<p>APT-FORKTRACER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
APT-FORKTRACER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apt-forktracer - a utility for managing package versions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apt-forktracer [ -v ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Background <br>
Maintaining Debian stable systems sometimes requires
installation of unofficial versions of packages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backporting newer versions <br>
This is necessary, when significant new functionality is
required on the system but unavailable in the official
version found in the current stable release. In this case,
<br>
the version string usually sorts as newer than the official
stable version string. This means that pinning is not
necessary, as APT will select such package version by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local changes to the official
version <br>
Usually these are small changes, so a minor modification of
the package version string is sufficient. There are two ways
to do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to invent a version string
newer than the current one, but older than the next official
one. This way does not require pinning, but is difficult to
do reliably. It <br>
might turn out, that the next official version string is
older than the one invented by you, which would cause the
official version to be silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other way is to modify the
version string in such way that it sorts as older than the
official one. The tilde character is very useful here,
because dpkg treats it in <br>
a special way: it is sufficient to append any string
starting with the tilde, to the version string, e.g. 1.2
&acirc; 1.2~sl.1. This requires you to &quot;pin&quot; the
package to that <br>
version, but it is more reliable, because works regardless
of what the next official version number will be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases, there is one
major drawback: APT will not warn you when newer versions of
official packages (point releases, security updates) will
appear in the stable release. <br>
This means you may miss some important change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-forktracer&rsquo;s job let
you track newer official versions of locally overridden
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Official package version
definition <br>
Official package version is a version which is available
from a source, whose Release file&rsquo;s Origin header
value is equal to the system distributor identifier, as
indicated by <br>
the lsb_release --id command, or by the DISTRIB_ID field in
the /etc/lsb-release file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program operation <br>
apt-forktracer analyzes each installed package separately,
reporting on the standard output these packages which are in
a &quot;non-standard&quot; state. What
&quot;non-standard&quot; means depends <br>
on the mode of program operation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default (non-verbose) mode <br>
this state means packages in an incorrect state (e.g. no
candidate version) or packages whose candidate version is
different than the newest available official version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose mode <br>
this state also includes packages whose installed version is
different from the candidate version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default mode the program
also reads configuration files, which let you ignore some of
the &quot;non-standard&quot; packages, as long as they meet
certain criteria. If there is no <br>
configuration for a given package, then a default
configuration is used. More information is available in
forktracer.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message format <br>
The program outputs messages such as the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foobar (1.2.3-&gt;1.2.4)
[Debian: 1.2.3 1.2.4] [Other origin: 1.2.2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foobar package name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2.3 installed package
version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2.4 candidate package version
- see apt-cache(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debian the value of the
&quot;Origin&quot; field of one of the package sources.
Versions available from this source are listed after a
colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other origin <br>
another source origin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Turns on the verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/apt/forktracer.conf <br>
/etc/apt/forktracer.d/*.conf</p>
