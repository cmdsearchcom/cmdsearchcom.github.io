<p>I2CDUMP(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual I2CDUMP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
i2cdump - examine I2C registers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
i2cdump [-f] [-r first-last] [-y] i2cbus address [mode [bank
[bankreg]]] <br>
i2cdump -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
i2cdump is a small helper program to examine registers
visible through the I2C bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force access to the device
even if it is already busy. By default, i2cdump will refuse
to access a device which is already under the control of a
kernel driver. Using this <br>
flag is dangerous, it can seriously confuse the kernel
driver in question. It can also cause i2cdump to return
invalid results. So use at your own risk and only if you
<br>
know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r first-last <br>
Limit the range of registers being accessed. This option is
only available with modes b, w, c and W. For mode W, first
must be even and last must be odd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Disable interactive mode. By
default, i2cdump will wait for a confirmation from the user
before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it
will perform the oper&acirc; <br>
ation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least two options must be
provided to i2cdump. i2cbus indicates the number or name of
the I2C bus to be scanned. This number should correspond to
one of the busses listed by <br>
i2cdetect -l. address indicates the address to be scanned on
that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and 0x77.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode parameter, if
specified, is one of the letters b, w, s, or i,
corresponding to a read size of a single byte, a 16-bit
word, an SMBus block, an I2C block, respectively. <br>
The c mode is a little different, it reads all bytes
consecutively, and is useful for chips that have an address
auto-increment feature, such as EEPROMs. The W mode is also
spe&acirc; <br>
cial, it is similar to w except that a read command will
only be issued on even register addresses; this is again
mainly useful for EEPROMs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A p can also be appended to the
mode parameter (except for i and W) to enable PEC. If the
mode parameter is omitted, i2cdump defaults to byte access
without PEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bank and bankreg parameters
are useful on the W83781D and similar chips (at the time of
writing, all Winbond and Asus chips). bank is an integer
between 0 and 7, and bankreg <br>
is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF (default value: 0x4E).
The W83781D data sheet has more information on bank
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
i2cdump can be dangerous if used improperly. Most notably,
the c mode starts with WRITING a byte to the chip. On most
chips it will be stored in the address pointer register,
<br>
which is OK, but some chips with a single register or no
(visible) register at all will most likely see this as a
real WRITE, resulting in possible misbehavior or corruption.
Do <br>
not use i2cdump on random addresses. Anyway, it is of little
use unless you have good knowledge of the chip you&rsquo;re
working with and an idea of what you are looking for.</p>
