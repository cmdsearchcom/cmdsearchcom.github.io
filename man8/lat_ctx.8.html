<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lat_ctx - context switching benchmark</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lat_ctx [ -P &lt;parallelism&gt; ] [ -W &lt;warmups&gt; ] [
-N &lt;repetitions&gt; ] [ -s &lt;size_in_kbytes&gt; ]
#procs [ #procs ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lat_ctx measures context switching time for any reasonable
number of processes of any reasonable size. The processes
are connected in a ring of Unix pipes. Each process reads a
<br>
token from its pipe, possibly does some work, and then
writes the token to the next process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processes may vary in number.
Smaller numbers of processes result in faster context
switches. More than 20 processes is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processes may vary in size. A
size of zero is the baseline process that does nothing
except pass the token on to the next process. A process size
of greater than zero means <br>
that the process does some work before passing on the token.
The work is simulated as the summing up of an array of the
specified size. The summing is an unrolled loop of about
<br>
a 2.7 thousand instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect is that both the data
and the instruction cache get polluted by some amount before
the token is passed on. The data cache gets polluted by
approximately the process <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;size&rsquo;&rsquo;. The instruction cache gets
polluted by a constant amount, approximately 2.7 thousand
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pollution of the caches
results in larger context switching times for the larger
processes. This may be confusing because the benchmark takes
pains to measure only the con&acirc; <br>
text switch time, not including the overhead of doing the
work. The subtle point is that the overhead is measured
using hot caches. As the number and size of the processes
<br>
increases, the caches are more and more polluted until the
set of processes do not fit. The context switch times go up
because a context switch is defined as the switch time <br>
plus the time it takes to restore all of the process state,
including cache state. This means that the switch includes
the time for the cache misses on larger processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
Output format is intended as input to xgraph or some similar
program. The format is multi line, the first line is a title
that specifies the size and non-context switching
over&acirc; <br>
head of the test. Each subsequent line is a pair of numbers
that indicates the number of processes and the cost of a
context switch. The overhead and the context switch times
<br>
are in micro second units. The numbers below are for a
SPARCstation 2.</p>

20 438</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The numbers produced by this benchmark are somewhat
inaccurate; they vary by about 10 to 15% from run to run. A
series of runs may be done and the lowest numbers reported.
The <br>
lower the number the more accurate the results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reasons for the inaccuracies
are possibly interaction between the VM system and the
processor caches. It is possible that sometimes the
benchmark processes are laid out in <br>
memory such that there are fewer TLB/cache conflicts than
other times. This is pure speculation on our part.</p>
