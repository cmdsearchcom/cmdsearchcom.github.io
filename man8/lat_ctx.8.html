lat_ctx - context switching benchmark

<b>lat_ctx</b> measures context switching time for any reasonable number of
  processes of any reasonable size. The processes are connected in a ring of
  Unix pipes. Each process reads a token from its pipe, possibly does some work,
  and then writes the token to the next process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Processes may vary in number. Smaller numbers of processes result in faster
  context switches. More than 20 processes is not supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Processes may vary in size. A size of zero is the baseline process that does
  nothing except pass the token on to the next process. A process size of
  greater than zero means that the process does some work before passing on the
  token. The work is simulated as the summing up of an array of the specified
  size. The summing is an unrolled loop of about a 2.7 thousand instructions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The effect is that both the data and the instruction cache get polluted by some
  amount before the token is passed on. The data cache gets polluted by
  approximately the process ``size''. The instruction cache gets polluted by a
  constant amount, approximately 2.7 thousand instructions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The pollution of the caches results in larger context switching times for the
  larger processes. This may be confusing because the benchmark takes pains to
  measure only the context switch time, not including the overhead of doing the
  work. The subtle point is that the overhead is measured using hot caches. As
  the number and size of the processes increases, the caches are more and more
  polluted until the set of processes do not fit. The context switch times go up
  because a context switch is defined as the switch time plus the time it takes
  to restore all of the process state, including cache state. This means that
  the switch includes the time for the cache misses on larger processes.

Output format is intended as input to <b>xgraph</b> or some similar program. The
  format is multi line, the first line is a title that specifies the size and
  non-context switching overhead of the test. Each subsequent line is a pair of
  numbers that indicates the number of processes and the cost of a context
  switch. The overhead and the context switch times are in micro second units.
  The numbers below are for a SPARCstation 2.

The numbers produced by this benchmark are somewhat inaccurate; they vary by
  about 10 to 15% from run to run. A series of runs may be done and the lowest
  numbers reported. The lower the number the more accurate the results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reasons for the inaccuracies are possibly interaction between the VM system
  and the processor caches. It is possible that sometimes the benchmark
  processes are laid out in memory such that there are fewer TLB/cache conflicts
  than other times. This is pure speculation on our part.
