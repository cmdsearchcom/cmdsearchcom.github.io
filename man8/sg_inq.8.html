<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility by default sends a SCSI INQUIRY command to the
given device and then outputs the response. All SCSI devices
are meant to respond to a &quot;standard&quot; INQUIRY
command with <br>
at least a 36 byte response (in SCSI 2 and higher). An
INQUIRY is termed as &quot;standard&quot; when both the EVPD
and CmdDt (now obsolete) bits are clear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility supports two
command line syntaxes, the preferred one is shown first in
the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section
on the old command line syntax <br>
outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An important
&quot;non-standard&quot; INQUIRY page is the Device
Identification Vital Product Data (VPD) page [0x83]. Since
SPC-3, support for this page is mandatory. The --id option
<br>
decodes this page. New VPD page information is no longer
being added to this utility. To get information on new VPD
pages see the sg_vpd(8) or sdparm(8) utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the DEVICE exists and the
SCSI INQUIRY fails (because the SG_IO ioctl is not
supported) then an ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE is tried. If
it succeeds then device identifica&acirc; <br>
tion strings are output. The --raw and --hex options can be
used to manipulate the output. If the --ata option is given
then the SCSI INQUIRY is not performed and the DEVICE is
<br>
assumed to be ATA (or ATAPI).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reference document used for
interpreting an INQUIRY is T10/1713-D Revision 36e (SPC-4,
24 August 2012) found at http://www.t10.org . Obsolete and
reserved items in the stan&acirc; <br>
dard INQUIRY response output are displayed in brackets. The
reference document for the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE
command is ATA8-ACS found at http://www.t13.org .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. The options are arranged in alphabetical order based
on the long option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --ata <br>
Assume given DEVICE is an ATA or ATAPI device which can
receive ATA commands from the host operating system. Skip
the SCSI INQUIRY command and use either the ATA IDENTIFY
<br>
DEVICE command (for non-packet devices) or the ATA IDENTIFY
PACKET DEVICE command. To show the response in hex, add a
&rsquo;--verbose&rsquo; option. This option is only
available in <br>
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cmddt <br>
set the Command Support Data (CmdDt) bit (defaults to
clear(0)). Used in conjunction with the --page=PG option
where PG specifies the SCSI command opcode to query. When
<br>
used twice (e.g. &rsquo;-cc&rsquo;) this utility forms a
list by looping over all 256 opcodes (0 to 255 inclusive)
only outputting a line for found commands. The CmdDt bit is
now <br>
obsolete. It has been replaced by the REPORT SUPPORTED
OPERATION CODES command, see the sg_opcodes(8) utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --descriptors <br>
decodes and prints the version descriptors found in a
standard INQUIRY response. There are up to 8 of them.
Version descriptors indicate which versions of standards
and/or <br>
drafts the DEVICE complies with. The normal components of a
standard INQUIRY are output (typically from the first 36
bytes of the response) followed by the version <br>
descriptors if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e see entry below for
--vpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --export <br>
prints out information obtained from the device. The output
can be modified by selecting a VPD page with PG (from
--page=PG). If the device identification VPD page 0x83 is
<br>
given it prints out information in the form:
&quot;SCSI_IDENT_&lt;assoc&gt;_&lt;type&gt;=&lt;ident&gt;&quot;
to stdout. If the device serial number VPD page 0x80 is
given it prints out information in <br>
the form: &quot;SCSI_SERIAL=&lt;ident&gt;&quot;. Other VPD
pages are not supported. If no VPD page is given it prints
out information in the form:
&quot;SCSI_VENDOR=&lt;vendor&gt;&quot;, <br>
&quot;SCSI_MODEL=&lt;model&gt;&quot;, and
&quot;SCSI_REVISION=&lt;rev&gt;&quot;, taken from the
standard inquiry. This may be useful for tools like udev(7)
in Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, -x, --extended <br>
prints the extended INQUIRY VPD page [0x86].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print out the usage message then exit. When used twice,
after the usage message, there is a list of available
abbreviations than can be given to the --page=PG option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
rather than decode a standard INQUIRY response, a VPD page
or command support data; print out the response in hex to
stdout. Error messages and warnings are typically out&acirc;
<br>
put to stderr. When used twice with the ATA Information VPD
page [0x89] decodes the start of the response then outputs
the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response in hexa&acirc;
<br>
decimal bytes (not 16 bit words). When used three times with
the ATA Information VPD page [0x89] or the --ata option,
this utility outputs the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE <br>
response in hexadecimal words suitable for input to
&rsquo;hdparm --Istdin&rsquo;. See note below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --id <br>
prints the device identification VPD page [0x83].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --len=LEN <br>
the number LEN is the &quot;allocation length&quot; field in
the INQUIRY cdb. This is the (maximum) length of the
response to be sent by the device. The default value of LEN
is 0 <br>
which is interpreted as: first request is for 36 bytes and
if necessary execute another INQUIRY if the &quot;additional
length&quot; field in the response indicates that more than
<br>
36 bytes is available. If LEN is greater than 0 then only
one INQUIRY command is performed. See paragraph below about
&quot;36 byte INQUIRYs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --maxlen=LEN <br>
this option has the same action as the --len=LEN option. It
has been added for compatibility with the sg_vpd, sg_modes
and sg_logs utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --old <br>
switch to older style options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --page=PG <br>
the PG argument can be either a number of an abbreviation
for a VPD page. To enumerate the available abbreviations for
VPD pages use &rsquo;-hh&rsquo; or a bad abbreviation (e.g,
<br>
&rsquo;--page=xxx&rsquo;). When the --cmddt option is given
(once) then PG is interpreted as an opcode number (so VPD
page abbreviations make little sense).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
output the response in binary to stdout. Error messages and
warnings, if any, are sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --vendor <br>
output a standard INQUIRY response&rsquo;s vendor specific
field from offset 36 to 55 in ASCII. When used twice (i.e.
&rsquo;-ss&rsquo;) also output the vendor specific field
from offset 96 <br>
in ASCII. This is only done if the data passes some simple
sanity checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print out version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --vpd <br>
set the Enable Vital Product Data (EVPD) bit (defaults to
clear(0)). Used in conjunction with the --page=PG option
where PG specifies the VPD page number to query. If the <br>
--page=PG is not given then PG defaults to zero which is the
&quot;Supported VPD pages&quot; VPD page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Some devices with weak SCSI command set implementations lock
up when they receive commands they don&rsquo;t understand
(or even response lengths that they don&rsquo;t expect).
Such devices <br>
need to be treated carefully, use the &rsquo;--len=36&rsquo;
option. Without this option this utility will issue an
initial standard INQUIRY requesting 36 bytes of response
data. If the <br>
device indicates it could have supplied more data then a
second INQUIRY is issued to fetch the longer response. That
second command may lock up faulty devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATA or ATAPI devices that use a
SCSI to ATA Translation layer (see SAT at www.t10.org) may
support the ATA Information VPD page. This returns the
IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE <br>
response amongst other things. The ATA Information VPD page
can be fetched with &rsquo;--page=ai&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the INQUIRY standard response
there is a &rsquo;MultiP&rsquo; flag which is set when the
device has 2 or more ports. Some vendors use the preceding
vendor specific (&rsquo;VS&rsquo;) bit to indicate <br>
which port is being accessed by the INQUIRY command (0 -&gt;
relative port 1 (port &quot;a&quot;), 1 -&gt; relative port
2 (port &quot;b&quot;)). When the &rsquo;MultiP&rsquo; flag
is set, the preceding vendor spe&acirc; <br>
cific bit is shown in parentheses. SPC-3 compliant devices
should use the device identification VPD page (0x83) to show
which port is being used for access and the SCSI ports VPD
<br>
page (0x88) to show all available ports on the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 2.4 series of Linux
kernels the DEVICE must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In
the 2.6 series block devices (e.g. disks and ATAPI DVDs) can
also be specified. For example <br>
&quot;sg_inq /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6 series
kernels. From lk 2.6.6 other SCSI &quot;char&quot; device
names may be used as well (e.g. &quot;/dev/st0m&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of bytes output by
--hex and --raw is 36 bytes or the number given to --len=LEN
(or --maxlen=LEN). That number is reduced if the
&quot;resid&quot; returned by the HBA indicates <br>
less bytes were sent back from DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATA DEVICES <br>
There are two major types of ATA devices: non-packet devices
(e.g. ATA disks) and packet devices (ATAPI). The majority of
ATAPI devices are CD/DVD/BD drives in which the ATAPI <br>
transport carries the MMC set (i.e. a SCSI command set).
Further, both types of ATA devices can be connected to a
host computer via a &quot;SCSI&quot; (or some other)
transport. When an <br>
ATA disk is controlled via a SCSI (or non-ATA) transport
then two approaches are commonly used: tunnelling (e.g. STP
in Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)) or by emulating a SCSI device
<br>
(e.g. with a SCSI to ATA translation layer, see SAT at
www.t10.org ). Even when the physical transport to the host
computer is ATA (especially in the case of SATA) the
operating <br>
system may choose to put a SAT layer in the driver
&quot;stack&quot; (e.g. libata in Linux).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main identifying command for
any SCSI device is an INQUIRY. The corresponding command for
an ATA non-packet device is IDENTIFY DEVICE while for an ATA
packet device it is <br>
IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this utility is invoked for
an ATAPI device (e.g. a CD/DVD/BD drive with &quot;sg_inq
/dev/hdc&quot;) then a SCSI INQUIRY is sent to the device
and if it responds then the response to <br>
decoded and output and this utility exits. To see the
response for an ATA IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command add the
--ata option (e.g. &quot;sg_inq --ata /dev/hdc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility doesn&rsquo;t
decode the response to an ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE
command, hdparm does a good job at that. The
&rsquo;-HHH&rsquo; option has been added for use with either
the <br>
&rsquo;--ata&rsquo; or &rsquo;--page=ai&rsquo; option to
produce a format acceptable to &quot;hdparm --Istdin&quot;.
An example: &rsquo;sg_inq --ata -HHH /dev/hdc | hdparm
--Istdin&rsquo;. See hdparm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_inq is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The options in this section were the only ones available
prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23
and later these older options can be selected by either
set&acirc; <br>
ting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
--old (or -O) as the first option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-36 only requests 36 bytes of
response data for an INQUIRY. Furthermore even if the device
indicates in its response it can supply more data, a second
(longer) INQUIRY is not <br>
performed. This is a paranoid setting. Equivalent to
&rsquo;--len=36&rsquo; in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a fetch the ATA Information VPD
page [0x89]. Equivalent to &rsquo;--page=ai&rsquo; in the
main description. This page is defined in SAT (see at
www.t10.org).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Assume given DEVICE is an ATA
or ATAPI device. Equivalent to --ata in the main
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b decodes the Block Limits VPD
page [0xb0]. Equivalent to &rsquo;--page=bl&rsquo; in the
main description. This page is defined in SBC-2 (see
www.t10.org).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c set the Command Support Data
(CmdDt) bit (defaults to clear(0)). Used in <br>
conjunction with the -o=OPCODE_PG option to specify the SCSI
command opcode to query. Equivalent to --cmddt in the main
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cl lists the command data for
all supported commands (followed by the command name) by
looping through all 256 opcodes. This option uses the CmdDt
bit which is now obsolete. <br>
See the sg_opcodes(8) utility. Equivalent to &rsquo;--cmddt
--cmddt&rsquo; in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d decodes depending on context.
If -e option is given, or any option that implies -e (e.g.
&rsquo;-i&rsquo; or &rsquo;-p=80&rsquo;), then this utility
attempts to decode the indicated VPD page. <br>
Otherwise the version descriptors (if any) are listed
following a standard INQUIRY response. In the version
descriptors sense, equivalent to --descriptors in the main
<br>
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e enable (i.e. sets) the Vital
Product Data (EVPD) bit (defaults to clear(0)). Used in
conjunction with the -p=VPD_PG option to specify the VPD
page to fetch. If -p=VPD_PG <br>
is not given then VPD page 0 (list supported VPD pages) is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h outputs INQUIRY response in
hex rather than trying to decode it. Equivalent to --hex in
the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H same action as -h. Equivalent
to --hex in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i decodes the Device
Identification VPD page [0x83]. Equivalent to --id in the
main description. This page is made up of several
&quot;designation descriptors&quot;. If -h is given <br>
then each descriptor header is decoded and the identifier
itself is output in hex. To see the whole VPD 0x83 page
response in hex use &rsquo;-p=83 -h&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m decodes the Management
network addresses VPD page [0x85]. Equivalent to
&rsquo;--page=mna&rsquo; in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M decodes the Mode page policy
VPD page [0x87]. Equivalent to &rsquo;--page=mpp&rsquo; in
the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N switch to the newer style
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o=OPCODE_PG <br>
used in conjunction with the -e or -c option. If neither
given then the -e option assumed. When the -e option is also
given (or assumed) then the argument to this option <br>
is the VPD page number. The argument is interpreted as
hexadecimal and is expected to be in the range 0 to ff
inclusive. Only VPD page 0 is decoded and it lists supported
<br>
VPD pages and their names (if known). To decode the
mandatory device identification page (0x83) use the -i
option. A now obsolete usage is when the -c option is given
in <br>
which case the argument to this option is assumed to be a
command opcode number. Recent SCSI draft standards have
moved this facility to a separate command (see <br>
sg_opcodes(8)). Defaults to 0 so if -e is given without this
option then VPD page 0 is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p=VPD_PG <br>
same action as -o=OPCODE_PG option described in the previous
entry. Since the opcode value with the CmdDt is now
obsolete, the main use of this option is to specify the <br>
VPD page number. The argument is interpreted as hexadecimal
and is expected to be in the range 0 to ff inclusive.
Defaults to 0 so if -e is given without this option then
<br>
VPD page 0 is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P decodes the Unit Path Report
VPD page [0xc0] which is EMC specific. Equivalent to
&rsquo;--page=upr&rsquo; in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r outputs the response in
binary to stdout. Equivalent to --raw in the main
description. Can be used twice (i.e. &rsquo;-rr&rsquo; (and
&rsquo;-HHH&rsquo; has same effect)) and if used with the
<br>
-A or -a option yields output with the same format as
&quot;cat /proc/ide/hd&lt;x&gt;/identify&quot; so that it
can then be piped to &quot;hdparm --Istdin&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s decodes the SCSI Ports VPD
page [0x88]. Equivalent to &rsquo;--page=sp&rsquo; in the
main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u equivalent to
&rsquo;--export&rsquo; in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v increase level of verbosity.
Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print out version string then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x decodes the Extended INQUIRY
data VPD [0x86] page. Equivalent to &rsquo;--page=ei&rsquo;
in the main description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? output usage message and
exit. Ignore all other parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The examples in this page use Linux device names. For
suitable device names in other supported Operating Systems
see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view the standard inquiry
response use without options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_inq /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some SCSI devices include
version descriptors indicating the various SCSI standards
and drafts they support. They can be viewed with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_inq -d /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modern SCSI devices include
Vital Product Data (VPD)pages which can be viewed with the
SCSI INQUIRY command. To list the supported VPD pages (but
not their contents) try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_inq -e /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some VPD pages can be read with
the sg_inq utility but a newer utility called sg_vpd
specializes in showing their contents. The sdparm utility
can also be used to show the con&acirc; <br>
tents of VPD pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further examples of sg_inq
together with some typical output can be found on
