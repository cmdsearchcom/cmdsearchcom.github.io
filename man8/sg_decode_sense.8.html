<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_decode_sense - decode SCSI sense data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_decode_sense [--binary=FN] [--file=FN] [--help] [--hex]
[--nospace] [--status=SS] [--verbose] [--version]
[--write=WFN] [H1 H2 H3 ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility takes SCSI sense data in binary or as a
sequence of ASCII hexadecimal bytes and decodes it. The
primary reference for the decoding is SPC-3 ANSI INCITS
408-2005 and <br>
the most recent draft SPC-4 revision 29 which can be found
at http://www.t10.org and other locations on the
internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCSI sense data is often found
in kernel log files as a result of something going wrong but
may just be informative. It is often shown as a sequence of
hexadecimal bytes, start&acirc; <br>
ing with 70, 71, 72, 73, f0 or f1. Sense data could be up to
252 bytes long but typically is much shorter than that, 18
bytes long is often seen and is usually associated with <br>
the older &quot;fixed&quot; format sense data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sense data can be provided
on the command line or in a file. If given on the command
line the sense data should be a sequence of hexadecimal
bytes separated by space. Alter&acirc; <br>
natively a file can be given with the contents in binary or
ASCII hexadecimal bytes. The latter form can contain several
lines each with none, one or more ASCII hexadecimal bytes
<br>
separated by space (comma or tab). The hash symbol may
appear and it and the rest of the line is ignored making it
useful for comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --binary=FN <br>
the sense data is read in binary from a file called FN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
this option is used in conjunction with --write=WFN in order
to change the output written to WFN to lines of ASCII hex
bytes suitable for a C language compiler. Each line <br>
contains up to 16 bytes (e.g. a line starting with
&quot;0x3b,0x07,0x00,0xff&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --file=FN <br>
the sense data is read in ASCII hexadecimal from a file
called FN. The sense data should appear as a sequence of
bytes separated by space, comma, tab or newline.
Every&acirc; <br>
thing from and including a hash symbol to the end of that
line is ignored. If --nospace is set then no separator is
required between the ASCII hexadecimal digits in FN <br>
with bytes decoded from pairs of ASCII hexadecimal
digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nospace <br>
expect ASCII hexadecimal to be a string of hexadecimal
digits with no spaces between them. Bytes are decoded by
taking two hexadecimal digits at a time, so an even number
<br>
of digits is expected. The string of hexadecimal digits may
be on the command line (replacing &quot;H1 H2 H3&quot;) or
spread across multiple lines the FN given to --file=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --status=SS <br>
where SS is a SCSI status byte value, given in hexadecimal.
The SCSI status byte is related to but distinct from sense
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
output version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --write=WFN <br>
writes the sense data out to a file called WFN. If necessary
WFN is created. If WFN exists then it is truncated prior to
writing the sense data to it. If the --hex option <br>
is also given then ASCII hex is written to WFN (see the
--hex option description); otherwise binary is written to
WFN. This option is a convenience and may be helpful in <br>
converting the ASCII hexadecimal representation of sense
data (or anything else) into the equivalent binary or a
compilable ASCII hex form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Unlike most utilities in this package, this utility does not
access a SCSI device (logical unit). This utility accesses a
library associated with this package. Amongst other <br>
things the library decodes SCSI sense data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Sense data is often printed out in kernel logs and sometimes
on the command line when verbose or debug flags are given.
It will be at least 8 bytes long, often 18 bytes long but
<br>
may be longer. A sense data string might look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f0 00 03 00 00 12 34 0a 00 00 00
00 11 00 00 00 <br>
00 00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cut and paste it after the
sg_decode_sense command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_decode_sense f0 00 03 00 00
12 34 0a 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00 00 00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and for this sense data the
output should look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fixed format, current; Sense
key: Medium Error <br>
Additional sense: Unrecovered read error <br>
Info fld=0x1234 [4660]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a medium error the Info
field is the logical block address (LBA) of the lowest
numbered block that the associated SCSI command was not able
to read (verify or write).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_decode_sense is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
