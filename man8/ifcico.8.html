<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifcico tsync | yoohoo |
**EMSI_INQC816</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(this implies slave mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ifcico stands for &quot;Internet - Fidonet Copy In / Copy
Out&quot;, this is a FidoNet(r) compatible transport agent.
Currently it supports FTS-0001, YooHoo/2U2 and EMSI
handshake proto&acirc; <br>
cols, Xmodem (untested), Telink (untested), Modem7
(untested), SEAlink w/overdrive and crash recovery, Bark
file and update requests, WaZOO protocols: DietIFNA, plain
Zmodem (aka <br>
ZedZip, EMSI flag &quot;ZMO&quot;), ZedZap and Hydra, WaZOO
file and update requests (nodelist flag should be XA).
Password protected requests are not implemented. There are
plans to <br>
implement Janus protocol in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a special protocol
optimized to use over TCP/IP connection, contributed by
Stanislav Voronyi &lt;stas@uanet.kharkov.ua&gt;, it is
identified by EMSI proto code TCP (not <br>
registered).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Outbound directory structure is
BinkleyTerm compatible, with domains and point
subdirectories (full 5d). There are separate
&quot;listed&quot; and &quot;protected&quot; inbound
directories for the <br>
incoming sessions with the nodes present in the nodelist(s)
and with nodes that have a password assigned respectively.
Files received during an outbound session are always put
<br>
into the &quot;protected&quot; directory. (Only
&quot;protected&quot; directory is looked up by ifunpack by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Magic&quot; file request
processors are executable files placed in the
&quot;magic&quot; directory. If request is made for a file
with matching name, the executable from the
&quot;magic&quot; directory <br>
is run, and its stdout sent to the requester. Full
requester&rsquo;s address, in the form &quot;John Smith of
1:234/56.7&quot; is passed to the executable in the command
line. See &quot;misc/FILES&quot; <br>
for an example of a magic request processor. Non- executable
files in the &quot;magic&quot; directory are
&quot;references&quot;. If a request is made for a file with
matching name, the file is <br>
read line by line, and request re-made for the name found in
each line. Up to 5 levels of recursion are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run ifcico in master mode,
you must make dialout devices read/writable for ifcico, -B
and do the same for the directory where your uucp locks are
created (usually /var/lock/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make ifcico work in answer
mode, you need an FTN-able getty. Linux &quot;standard&quot;
getty_ps, and Gert Doering&rsquo;s mgetty (from the
mgetty+sendfax package) and later versions have <br>
fidonet support built-in. Getty must distinguish incoming
FidoNet type calls, and start ifcico with one parameter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTS-0001 call: &quot;ifcico
tsync&quot; <br>
FTS-0006 call: &quot;ifcico yoohoo&quot; <br>
EMSI call: &quot;ifcico **EMSI_.....&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(in the latter case the received
EMSI packet should be passed without trailing CR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using getty_ps,
don&rsquo;t forget to create the file /etc/default/uugetty
with the contents similar to the following (case
sensitive):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIDO=/usr/local/lib/fnet/ifcico
<br>
EMSI=yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When called without parameters,
ifcico runs in slave mode and determines the type of inbound
session itself. This mode may be used when ifcico runs as an
internet or ISDN dae&acirc; <br>
mon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make ifcico scan for pending
outbound mail and do appropriate calls, start it with
&quot;-r1&quot; flag. To force polling of particular nodes,
specify these nodes in the command line <br>
(addresses should be in domain notation, e.g. &quot;ifcico
f23.n5020 f155.n5020&quot;). The latter implies master mode
(-r1). Note that &quot;hold&quot; packets and files, as well
as file <br>
requests, do not cause the node to be polled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inbound directory is created
automatically if it does not exist, along with the
&quot;tmp&quot; subdir. The latter is used while receiving
files. After being successfully received, the <br>
files are moved up to the &quot;inbound&quot; directory.
&quot;protinbound&quot; and &quot;listinbound&quot;
directories accept files received during password protected
sessions and session with the nodes <br>
present in the nodelist(s) respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifcico can use text format
nodelists in original (MS/DOS) form with
&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&rsquo;s as well as in UNIX form, with
&lt;LF&gt;&rsquo;s only. When you get a fresh nodelist, or
change the &quot;nodelist&quot; <br>
statements in the config file, you must rebuild index with
ifindex program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For outgoing calls, status files
are created for nodes, with the extention &quot;.sts&quot;.
These are ascii files containg three decimal numbers in a
single line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time retries code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time is the last call attempt
time (attempts failing with &quot;retry time not
reached&quot; do not count). It is unsigned long
representing the number of seconds since the epoch. <br>
retries is the number of consequitve call attempts made that
returned &quot;call failed&quot; or &quot;could not
establish session&quot;. This field is zeroed when call
succeeds. <br>
code is the return code of the last attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nlpatch program compiles a new
version of the nodelist from the old nodelist and
nodediff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display a short help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Verbosity Set the debug
verbosity Verbosity may be a number from 0 to 32 to set
&rsquo;on&rsquo; bits from 1 to number, or a string of
letters where &rsquo;a&rsquo; = bit 1, &rsquo;b&rsquo; = bit
<br>
2, etc. up to bit 26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I File Use the alternate
configuration file File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Role 1 - master, 0 - slave.
default is 0 (slave mode) if no node is provided; else the
default is 1 (master mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Inetaddr Tell an internet
address Inetaddr to make a connection by TCP/IP. A specific
port can be given ( -a Inetaddr:Port ). The default is the
one given by <br>
fido in /etc/services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Mode 0 - TCP, 1 -
Telnet-Vmodem. Tells the mode to use for TCP/IP connections,
the default is TCP mode (-t0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Phone <br>
For modem conections, this overrides the phone number given
in the nodelist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l TtyDevice <br>
For modem connections, this overrides the tty value give in
the config file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Node This is the FTN addres of
the node to call. The addres must be in the format
&quot;[pNN.]fNN.nNN[.zNN[.domain]]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsync | yoohoo | **EMSI_INQC816
Those values are typically given by an FTN-able getty (
mgetty or getty_ps ), they determine the type of FTN
protocol to use. They <br>
imply slave mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN CODES <br>
ifcico returns maximum return code for all calls made. Codes
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successfull call <br>
1 Dialout port unavailable <br>
2 Dial failed (no &quot;CONNECT&quot; or TCP connection
failed) <br>
3 Could not reset the modem (no &quot;OK&quot;) <br>
4 System locked <br>
5 Retry time not reached <br>
6 Fatal error in nodelist lookup <br>
7 Call prohibited by config options <br>
8 Phone number unavailable <br>
9 No matching ports defined <br>
10 Unused <br>
&gt;10 Session failures (not defined yet) <br>
30 Could not establish session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$IFLIBDIR/config <br>
Runtime configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/services <br>
Determines the default port number for fido, the port used
by ifcico for tcp connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodelist.??? <br>
A list of nodes in an FTN network. ifcico uses it by
compiling it with ifindex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$BINDIR/ifindex <br>
compiles a nodelist so ifcico can use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$BINDIR/ifstat <br>
show statistics of calls, etc.</p>
