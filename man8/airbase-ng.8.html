<p>AIRBASE-NG(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
AIRBASE-NG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
airbase-ng - multi-purpose tool aimed at attacking clients
as opposed to the Access Point (AP) itself</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
airbase-ng [options] &lt;interface name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
airbase-ng is multi-purpose tool aimed at attacking clients
as opposed to the Access Point (AP) itself. Since it is so
versatile and flexible, summarizing it is a challenge. Here
<br>
are some of the feature highlights: <br>
- Implements the Caffe Latte WEP client attack <br>
- Implements the Hirte WEP client attack <br>
- Ability to cause the WPA/WPA2 handshake to be captured
<br>
- Ability to act as an ad-hoc Access Point <br>
- Ability to act as a full Access Point <br>
- Ability to filter by SSID or client MAC addresses <br>
- Ability to manipulate and resend packets <br>
- Ability to encrypt sent packets and decrypt received
packets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main idea is of the
implementation is that it should encourage clients to
associate with the fake AP, not prevent them from accessing
the real AP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tap interface (atX) is created
when airbase-ng is run. This can be used to receive
decrypted packets or to send encrypted packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As real clients will most
probably send probe requests for common/configured networks,
these frames are important for binding a client to our
softAP. In this case, the AP will <br>
respond to any probe request with a proper probe response,
which tells the client to authenticate to the airbase-ng
BSSID. That being said, this mode could possibly disrupt the
<br>
correct functionality of many APs on the same channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-H, --help <br>
Shows the help screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &lt;bssid&gt; <br>
If the BSSID is not explicitly specified by using &quot;-a
&lt;BSSID&gt;&quot;, then the current MAC of the specified
interface is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;iface&gt; <br>
Also capture and process from this interface in addition to
the replay interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;WEP key&gt; <br>
If WEP should be used as encryption, then the parameter
&quot;-w &lt;WEP key&gt;&quot; sets the en-/decryption key.
This is sufficient to let airbase-ng set all the appropriate
flags by <br>
itself. If the softAP operates with WEP encryption, the
client can choose to use open system authentication or
shared key authentication. Both authentication methods are
<br>
supported by airbase-ng. But to get a keystream, the user
can try to force the client to use shared key
authentication. &quot;-s&quot; forces a shared key auth and
&quot;-S &lt;len&gt;&quot; sets <br>
the challenge length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h &lt;MAC&gt; <br>
This is the source MAC for the man-in-the-middle attack. The
&quot;-M&quot; must also be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;disallow&gt; <br>
If this option is not specified, it defaults to &quot;-f
allow&quot;. This means the various client MAC filters (-d
and -D) define which clients to accept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using the &quot;-f
disallow&quot; option, this reverses selection and causes
airbase to ignore the clients specified by the filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W &lt;0|1&gt; <br>
This sets the beacon WEP flag. Remember that clients will
normally only connect to APs which are the same as
themselves. Meaning WEP to WEP, open to open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;auto&quot; option is
to allow airbase-ng to automatically set the flag based on
context of the other options specified. For example, if you
set a WEP key with -w, then the <br>
beacon flag would be set to WEP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One other use of
&quot;auto&quot; is to deal with clients which can
automatically adjust their connection type. However, these
are few and far between.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practice, it is best to set
the value to the type of clients you are dealing with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q This suppresses printing any
statistics or status information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This prints additional
messages and details to assist in debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M This option is not
implemented yet. It is a man-in-the-middle attack between
specified clients and BSSIDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --ad-hoc <br>
This causes airbase-ng to act as an ad-hoc client instead of
a normal Access Point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ad-hoc mode airbase-ng also
sends beacons, but doesn&rsquo;t need any
authentication/association. It can be activated by using
&quot;-A&quot;. The soft AP will adjust all flags needed
<br>
to simulate a station in ad-hoc mode automatically and
generate a random MAC, which is used as CELL MAC instead of
the BSSID. This can be overwritten by the &quot;-a
&lt;BSSID&gt;&quot; <br>
tag. The interface MAC will then be used as source mac,
which can be changed with &quot;-h
&lt;sourceMAC&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y &lt;in|out|both&gt; <br>
The parameter &quot;-Y&quot; enables the &quot;external
processing&quot; Mode. This creates a second interface
&quot;atX&quot;, which is used to replay/modify/drop or
inject packets at will. This <br>
interface must also be brought up with ifconfig and an
external tool is needed to create a loop on that
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packet structure is rather
simple: the ethernet header (14 bytes) is ignored and right
after that follows the complete ieee80211 frame the same way
it is going to be <br>
processed by airbase-ng (for incoming packets) or before the
packets will be sent out of the wireless card (outgoing
packets). This mode intercepts all data packets and <br>
loops them through an external application, which decides
what happens with them. The MAC and IP of the second tap
interface doesn&rsquo;t matter, as real ethernet frames on
<br>
this interface are dropped dropped anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 3 arguments for
&quot;-Y&quot;: &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot; and
&quot;both&quot;, which specify the direction of frames to
loop through the external application. Obviously
&quot;in&quot; redirects only <br>
incoming (through the wireless NIC) frames, while outgoing
frames aren&rsquo;t touched. &quot;out&quot; does the
opposite, it only loops outgoing packets and
&quot;both&quot; sends all both direc&acirc; <br>
tions through the second tap interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a small and simple
example application to replay all frames on the second
interface. The tool is called &quot;replay.py&quot; and is
located in &quot;./test&quot;. It&rsquo;s written in <br>
python, but the language doesn&rsquo;t matter. It uses pcapy
to read the frames and scapy to possibly alter/show and
reinject the frames. The tool as it is, simply replays all
<br>
frames and prints a short summary of the received frames.
The variable &quot;packet&quot; contains the complete
ieee80211 packet, which can easily be dissected and modified
using <br>
scapy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be compared to ettercap
filters, but is more powerful, as a real programming
language can be used to build complex logic for filtering
and packet customization. <br>
The downside on using python is, that it adds a delay of
around 100ms and the cpu utilizations is rather large on a
high speed network, but its perfect for a demonstration <br>
with only a few lines of code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;channel&gt; <br>
This is used to specify the channel on which to run the
Access Point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --hidden <br>
This causes the Access Point to hide the SSID and to not
broadcast the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s When specfiied, this forces
shared key authentication for all clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The soft AP will send an
&quot;authentication method unsupported&quot; rejection to
any open system authentication request if &quot;-s&quot; is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S It sets the shared key
challenge length, which can be anything from 16 to 1480. The
default is 128 bytes. It is the number of bytes used in the
random challenge. Since one <br>
tag can contain a maximum size of 255 bytes, any value above
255 creates several challenge tags until all specified bytes
are written. Many clients ignore values different <br>
than 128 bytes so this option may not always work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --caffe-latte <br>
Airbase-ng also contains the new caffe-latte attack, which
is also implemented in aireplay-ng as attack &quot;-6&quot;.
It can be used with &quot;-L&quot; or
&quot;caffe-latte&quot;. This attack <br>
specifically works against clients, as it waits for a
broadcast arp request, which happens to be a gratuitous arp.
See this for an explanation of what a gratuitous arp is.
<br>
It then flips a few bits in the sender MAC and IP, corrects
the ICV (crc32) value and sends it back to the client, where
it came from. The point why this attack works in <br>
practice is, that at least windows sends gratuitous arps
after a connection on layer 2 is established and a static ip
is set, or dhcp fails and windows assigned an IP out <br>
of 169.254.X.X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-x &lt;pps&gt;&quot; sets
the number of packets per second to send when performing the
caffe-latte attack. At the moment, this attack doesn&rsquo;t
stop, it continuously sends arp <br>
requests. Airodump-ng is needed to capture the replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --cfrag <br>
This attack listens for an ARP request or IP packet from the
client. Once one is received, a small amount of PRGA is
extracted and then used to create an ARP request <br>
packet targeted to the client. This ARP request is actually
made of up of multiple packet fragments such that when
received, the client will respond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attack works especially
well against ad-hoc networks. As well it can be used against
softAP clients and normal AP clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x &lt;nbpps&gt; <br>
This sets the number of packets per second that packets will
be sent (default: 100).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y When using this option, the
fake AP will not respond to broadcast probes. A broadcast
probe is where the the specific AP is not identified
uniquely. Typically, most APs <br>
will respond with probe responses to a broadcast probe. This
flag will prevent this happening. It will only respond when
the specific AP is uniquely requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 This enables all WPA/WPA2/WEP
Tags to be enabled in the beacons sent. It cannot be
specified when also using -z or -Z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z &lt;type&gt; <br>
This specifies the WPA beacon tags. The valid values are:
1=WEP40 2=TKIP 3=WRAP 4=CCMP 5=WEP104.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z &lt;type&gt; <br>
same as -z, but for WPA2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V &lt;type&gt; <br>
This specifies the valid EAPOL types. The valid values are:
1=MD5 2=SHA1 3=auto</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;prefix&gt; <br>
This option causes airbase-ng to write all sent and received
packets to a pcap file on disk. This is the file prefix
(like airodump-ng -w).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P This causes the fake access
point to respond to all probes regardless of the ESSIDs
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I &lt;interval&gt; <br>
This sets the time in milliseconds between each beacon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;seconds&gt; <br>
The wildcard ESSIDs will also be beaconed this number of
seconds. A good typical value to use is &quot;-C 60&quot;
(require -P).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;hex&gt; <br>
ANonce (nonce from the AP) to use instead of a randomized
one. It must be 64 hexadecimal characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filter options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bssid &lt;MAC&gt;, -b
&lt;MAC&gt; <br>
BSSID to filter/use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bssids &lt;file&gt;, -B
&lt;file&gt; <br>
Read a list of BSSIDs out of that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--client &lt;MAC&gt;, -d
&lt;MAC&gt; <br>
MAC of client to accept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clients &lt;file&gt;, -D
&lt;file&gt; <br>
Read a list of client&rsquo;s MACs out of that file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--essid &lt;ESSID&gt;, -e
&lt;ESSID&gt; <br>
Specify a single ESSID. For SSID containing special
characters, see
http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=faq#how_to_use_spaces_double_quote_and_sin&acirc;
<br>
gle_quote_etc._in_ap_names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--essids &lt;file&gt;, -E
&lt;file&gt; <br>
Read a list of ESSIDs out of that file. It will use the same
BSSID for all AP which can generate some interesting output
in Airodump-ng like: http://www.chim&acirc; <br>
