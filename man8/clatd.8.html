clatd - a CLAT / SIIT-DC Edge Relay implementation for Linux
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>clatd</b> implements the CLAT component of the 464XLAT network architecture
  specified in <i>RFC 6877</i>. It allows an IPv6-only host to have IPv4
  connectivity that is translated to IPv6 before being routed to an upstream
  PLAT (which is typically a Stateful NAT64 operated by the ISP) and there
  translated back to IPv4 before being routed to the IPv4 internet. This is
  especially useful when local applications on the host requires actual IPv4
  connectivity or cannot make use of DNS64 (for example because they use legacy
  AF_INET socket calls, or if they are simply not using DNS64).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>clatd</b> may also be used to implement an SIIT-DC Edge Relay as described in
  <i>RFC 7756</i>. In this scenario, the PLAT is in reality a SIIT-DC Border
  Relay (see <i>RFC 7755</i>) instead of a Stateful NAT64 (see <i>RFC6146</i>).
  When used as a SIIT-DC Edge Relay, you will probably want to manually
  configure the settings <i>clat-v4-addr</i>, <i>clat-v6-addr</i>, and
  <i>plat-prefix</i> to mirror the SIIT-DC Border Relay's configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It relies on the software package TAYGA by Nathan Lutchansky for the actual
  translation of packets between IPv4 and IPv6 ( <i>RFC 6145</i>) TAYGA may be
  downloaded from its home page at &lt;http://www.litech.org/tayga/&gt;.

<b>clatd</b> is meant to be run under a daemonising control process such as
  systemd, upstart, or similar. It is further meant to be (re)started whenever a
  network interface goes up/down as this might mean a change in the PLAT
  availability or which prefixes/addresses needs to be used for the CLAT to
  work. It may also be run directly from the command line. It will run until
  killed with SIGINT (^C) or SIGTERM, at which point it will clean up after
  itself and exit gracefully.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the <i>scripts/</i> directory in the source distribution for some examples
  on how to invoke it it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INSTALLATION"><a class="selflink" href="#INSTALLATION">INSTALLATION</a></h1>
The following commands will quickly download and install the latest version of
  <b>clatd</b> and its dependencies:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">git clone https://github.com/toreanderson/clatd</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">sudo make -C clatd install installdeps</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will install <b>clatd</b> to /usr/sbin, plus install systemd, upstart,
  and/or NetworkManager scripts if your distribution appears to be using them,
  and install all the dependencies. Note that TAYGA isn't available in RPM
  format, so on RedHat/Fedora the installdeps target will install gcc and
  attempt to compile TAYGA from source.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<b>clatd</b> is designed to be able to run without any user-supplied
  configuration in most cases. However, user-specified onfiguration settings may
  be added to the configuration file, the path to which may be given on the
  command line using the <i>-c</i> option, or if it is not, the default location
  <i>/etc/clatd.conf</i> is used. Configuration settings may also be given
  directly on the command line when starting <b>clatd</b>, which takes
  precedence over settings in the configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Settings are of the form <b>key=value</b>. A list of recogniced keys and their
  possible values follow below:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>quiet=integer</b> (default: <i>0</i>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set this to 1 to suppress normal output from <b>clatd</b>.
      This is the same as providing the command line option <i>-q</i>. Set it to
      2 to additionally suppress warnings and errors. Note that this does not
      suppress debugging output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>debug=integer</b> (default: <i>0</i>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set this to 1 to get debugging output from <b>clatd</b>, or
      2 to get even more of the stuff. These are the equivalent of providing the
      command line option <i>-d</i> the specified number of times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>script-up=string</b> (no default)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify a custom script to be run when <b>clatd</b> is
      starting up. The invocation of this script is the last thing that happens
      before TAYGA starts up, so all the preparations have been completed at
      that point (i.e., the <b>clat-dev</b> exists and has routing/addressing
      configured, forwarding has been enabled, and so on).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The script is run by the system shell, so you can do everything you could in
      an interactive shell: run multiple commands by separating them by
      semi-colon or double ampersands, use standard if/else statements, use
      variable substitutions, redirect output to files, set up command
      pipelines, and so on. However it must all be on one line, so if you want
      to do complex things or use some other programming language it's probably
      better to put the script itself in a separate executable file and just
      make <b>script-up</b> invoke that file instead.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the script returns a nonzero exit status, this is considered a fatal
      error, and <b>clatd</b> will abort. This can be prevented by appending
      <i>|| true</i> at the end of the script.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All of <b>clatd</b>'s configuration settings are available as standard
      variables in the script's environment (hyphens are replaced with
      underscores).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Logging or debug messages from the script may simply be sent to stdout,
      where it will be picked up by the init system along with <b>clatd</b>'s
      own output. The script may of course consult the
      <i></i><i>$quiet</i><i></i> and <i></i><i>$debug</i><i></i> environment
      variables in order to determine how much output is appropriate.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The script should not be enclosed in quotes in the configuration file (even
      though it contains whitespace). For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>script-up=echo `date -Ins`: clatd started on </b><b>$clat_dev</b><b> |
      tee -a ~/clatd.log</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If on the other hand you want to supply a <b>script-up</b> containing
      whitespace directly <b>clatd</b>'s command line, quoting is required in
      order to prevent the shell from splitting it up and into multiple command
      line arguments. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>clatd 'script-up=ip route add 192.0.2.0/24 dev </b><b>$clat_dev</b><b>
      || true'</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>script-down=string</b> (no default)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This works exactly the same as <b>script-up</b>, only that
      this script is run right after TAYGA has exited, before the clean-up
      process of restoring any settings that were changed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An unsuccessful exit code from <b>script-down</b> will cause <b>clatd</b> to
      exit unsuccessfully too. Beyond that an unsuccessful exit won't change
      anything, because <b>script-down</b> is invoked at a point in time where
      the only thing left for <b>clatd</b> to do is to clean up after itself and
      exit anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>clat-dev=string</b> (default: <i>clat</i>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name of the network device used by the CLAT. There
      should be no reason to change the default, unless you plan on running
      multiple instances of <b>clatd</b> simultaneously.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      Local applications will bind to this address when communicating with
      external IPv4 destinations. In a standard 464XLAT environment with a
      stateful NAT64 serving as the PLAT, there should be no need to change the
      default.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When using <b>clatd</b> as an SIIT-DC Edge Relay (<i>RFC 7756</i>), you will
      want to set this to the IPv4 Service Address configured in the SIIT-DC
      Border Relay. This way, local applications can correctly identify which
      public address they'll be using on the IPv4 internet, and will be able to
      provide fully functional references to it in application-level payload,
      and so on.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default address is one from <i>RFC 7335</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>clat-v6-addr=ipv6-address</b> (default:
    auto-generated)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The IPv6 address of the CLAT. Traffic to/from the
      <b>clat-v4-addr</b> will be translated into this address. When using
      <b>clatd</b> as an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, you will want to set this to the
      same IPv6 address in the Explicit Address Mapping configured in the
      SIIT-DC Border Relay.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By default, <b>clatd</b> will attempt to figure out which network device
      will be used for traffic towards the PLAT, see if there is any SLAAC-based
      globally scoped addresses on it (i.e., a /64 with '0xfffe' in the middle
      of the Interface ID), and will if so substitute that '0xfffe' value with
      '0xc1a7' (&quot;clat&quot;) to generate a CLAT IPv6 address.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If only a non-SLAAC global address is found on the PLAT-facing device,
      <b>clatd</b> will substitute its Interface ID with a random integer and
      use the result as the CLAT IPv6 address. It will only do so if the prefix
      length is /120 or smaller, as otherwise the risk of IID collisions is
      considered to be too high. Note that on most Perl platforms, the
      <i></i><i>rand()</i><i></i> function is limited to 48 bits, which means
      that for longer IIDs, the least significant bits will be all 0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If multiple addresses are found in either category, the one that shares the
      longest common prefix with the PLAT prefix will be preferred when deriving
      the CLAT IPv6 address according to the algorithm described above.</dd>

      TCP connections made through the CLAT.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You should normally not need to set this. By default the value is calculated
      by taking the value of <b>v4-defaultroute-mtu</b> and substracting 40 (20
      bytes for the IPv4 header + 20 bytes for the TCP header). If
      <b>v4-defaultroute-mtu</b> is unset or 0, there is no default.</dd>

<b>clatd</b> will not be able to acquire an IPv6 address for the CLAT if SLAAC
  isn't used. <i>RFC 6877</i> suggests DHCPv6 IA_PD should be attempted in this
  case, but this isn't currently implemented.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>clatd</b> will not attempt to perform Duplicate Address Detection for the
  IPv6 address it generates. This is a violation of <i>RFC 6877</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>clatd</b> will not attempt to perform a connectivity check to a discovered
  PLAT prefix before setting up the CLAT, as <i>RFC 7050</i> suggest it should.
