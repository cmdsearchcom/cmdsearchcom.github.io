<p>clatd(8) clatd - a CLAT implementation for Linux
clatd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
clatd - a CLAT / SIIT-DC Edge Relay implementation for
Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
clatd implements the CLAT component of the 464XLAT network
architecture specified in RFC 6877. It allows an IPv6-only
host to have IPv4 connectivity that is translated to IPv6
<br>
before being routed to an upstream PLAT (which is typically
a Stateful NAT64 operated by the ISP) and there translated
back to IPv4 before being routed to the IPv4 internet. This
<br>
is especially useful when local applications on the host
requires actual IPv4 connectivity or cannot make use of
DNS64 (for example because they use legacy AF_INET socket
calls, <br>
or if they are simply not using DNS64).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clatd may also be used to
implement an SIIT-DC Edge Relay as described in RFC 7756. In
this scenario, the PLAT is in reality a SIIT-DC Border Relay
(see RFC 7755) instead of a <br>
Stateful NAT64 (see RFC6146). When used as a SIIT-DC Edge
Relay, you will probably want to manually configure the
settings clat-v4-addr, clat-v6-addr, and plat-prefix to
mirror <br>
the SIIT-DC Border Relay&rsquo;s configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It relies on the software
package TAYGA by Nathan Lutchansky for the actual
translation of packets between IPv4 and IPv6 (RFC 6145)
TAYGA may be downloaded from its home page at <br>
&lt;http://www.litech.org/tayga/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
clatd [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q Quiet mode; suppress normal output. This is the same as
setting quiet=1. Warnings and errors are still outputted, to
silence those too, repeat -q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable debugging output. This
is the same as setting debug=1. Repeat for even more
debugging output, which is the equivalent of setting
debug=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c conf-file <br>
Read configuration settings from conf-file. See section
CONFIGURATION below for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a brief usage help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key=value <br>
Set configuration key to value, overriding any setting found
in the configuration file. Refer to the section
CONFIGURATION below for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
clatd is meant to be run under a daemonising control process
such as systemd, upstart, or similar. It is further meant to
be (re)started whenever a network interface goes up/down
<br>
as this might mean a change in the PLAT availability or
which prefixes/addresses needs to be used for the CLAT to
work. It may also be run directly from the command line. It
<br>
will run until killed with SIGINT (^C) or SIGTERM, at which
point it will clean up after itself and exit gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the scripts/ directory in
the source distribution for some examples on how to invoke
it it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
The following commands will quickly download and install the
latest version of clatd and its dependencies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git clone
https://github.com/toreanderson/clatd <br>
sudo make -C clatd install installdeps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will install clatd to
/usr/sbin, plus install systemd, upstart, and/or
NetworkManager scripts if your distribution appears to be
using them, and install all the <br>
dependencies. Note that TAYGA isn&rsquo;t available in RPM
format, so on RedHat/Fedora the installdeps target will
install gcc and attempt to compile TAYGA from source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
clatd is designed to be able to run without any
user-supplied configuration in most cases. However,
user-specified onfiguration settings may be added to the
configuration file, <br>
the path to which may be given on the command line using the
-c option, or if it is not, the default location
/etc/clatd.conf is used. Configuration settings may also be
given <br>
directly on the command line when starting clatd, which
takes precedence over settings in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings are of the form
key=value. A list of recogniced keys and their possible
values follow below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet=integer (default: 0) <br>
Set this to 1 to suppress normal output from clatd. This is
the same as providing the command line option -q. Set it to
2 to additionally suppress warnings and errors. Note <br>
that this does not suppress debugging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug=integer (default: 0) <br>
Set this to 1 to get debugging output from clatd, or 2 to
get even more of the stuff. These are the equivalent of
providing the command line option -d the specified number of
<br>
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script-up=string (no default)
<br>
Specify a custom script to be run when clatd is starting up.
The invocation of this script is the last thing that happens
before TAYGA starts up, so all the preparations have <br>
been completed at that point (i.e., the clat-dev exists and
has routing/addressing configured, forwarding has been
enabled, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script is run by the system
shell, so you can do everything you could in an interactive
shell: run multiple commands by separating them by
semi-colon or double <br>
ampersands, use standard if/else statements, use variable
substitutions, redirect output to files, set up command
pipelines, and so on. However it must all be on one line, so
<br>
if you want to do complex things or use some other
programming language it&rsquo;s probably better to put the
script itself in a separate executable file and just make
script-up <br>
invoke that file instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the script returns a nonzero
exit status, this is considered a fatal error, and clatd
will abort. This can be prevented by appending || true at
the end of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of clatd&rsquo;s
configuration settings are available as standard variables
in the script&rsquo;s environment (hyphens are replaced with
underscores).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging or debug messages from
the script may simply be sent to stdout, where it will be
picked up by the init system along with clatd&rsquo;s own
output. The script may of course <br>
consult the $quiet and $debug environment variables in order
to determine how much output is appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script should not be
enclosed in quotes in the configuration file (even though it
contains whitespace). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script-up=echo &lsquo;date
-Ins&lsquo;: clatd started on $clat_dev | tee -a
~/clatd.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If on the other hand you want to
supply a script-up containing whitespace directly
clatd&rsquo;s command line, quoting is required in order to
prevent the shell from splitting it <br>
up and into multiple command line arguments. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clatd &rsquo;script-up=ip route
add 192.0.2.0/24 dev $clat_dev || true&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script-down=string (no default)
<br>
This works exactly the same as script-up, only that this
script is run right after TAYGA has exited, before the
clean-up process of restoring any settings that were
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An unsuccessful exit code from
script-down will cause clatd to exit unsuccessfully too.
Beyond that an unsuccessful exit won&rsquo;t change
anything, because script-down is invoked <br>
at a point in time where the only thing left for clatd to do
is to clean up after itself and exit anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clat-dev=string (default: clat)
<br>
The name of the network device used by the CLAT. There
should be no reason to change the default, unless you plan
on running multiple instances of clatd simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clat-v4-addr=ipv4-address
(default: 192.0.0.1) <br>
The IPv4 address that will be assigned to the CLAT device.
Local applications will bind to this address when
communicating with external IPv4 destinations. In a standard
<br>
464XLAT environment with a stateful NAT64 serving as the
PLAT, there should be no need to change the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using clatd as an SIIT-DC
Edge Relay (RFC 7756), you will want to set this to the IPv4
Service Address configured in the SIIT-DC Border Relay. This
way, local <br>
applications can correctly identify which public address
they&rsquo;ll be using on the IPv4 internet, and will be
able to provide fully functional references to it in
application- <br>
level payload, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default address is one from
RFC 7335.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clat-v6-addr=ipv6-address
(default: auto-generated) <br>
The IPv6 address of the CLAT. Traffic to/from the
clat-v4-addr will be translated into this address. When
using clatd as an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, you will want to set
this to <br>
the same IPv6 address in the Explicit Address Mapping
configured in the SIIT-DC Border Relay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, clatd will attempt
to figure out which network device will be used for traffic
towards the PLAT, see if there is any SLAAC-based globally
scoped addresses on it <br>
(i.e., a /64 with &rsquo;0xfffe&rsquo; in the middle of the
Interface ID), and will if so substitute that
&rsquo;0xfffe&rsquo; value with &rsquo;0xc1a7&rsquo;
(&quot;clat&quot;) to generate a CLAT IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only a non-SLAAC global
address is found on the PLAT-facing device, clatd will
substitute its Interface ID with a random integer and use
the result as the CLAT IPv6 <br>
address. It will only do so if the prefix length is /120 or
smaller, as otherwise the risk of IID collisions is
considered to be too high. Note that on most Perl platforms,
<br>
the rand() function is limited to 48 bits, which means that
for longer IIDs, the least significant bits will be all
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple addresses are found
in either category, the one that shares the longest common
prefix with the PLAT prefix will be preferred when deriving
the CLAT IPv6 address <br>
according to the algorithm described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dns64-servers=srv1,[srv2,..]
(default: use system resolver) <br>
Comma-separated list of DNS64 servers to use when
discovering the PLAT prefix using the method described in
RFC 7050. By default, the system resolver is used, but it
might be <br>
useful to override this in case your ISP doesn&rsquo;t
provide you with a DNS64-enabled name server, and you want
to test clatd using any of the public DNS64/NAT64 instances
on the <br>
internet. The first PLAT prefix encountered will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmd-ip=path (default: assume in
$PATH) <br>
Path to the ip binary from the iproute2 package available at
&lt;https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/net/iproute2&gt;.
Required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmd-ip6tables=path (default:
assume in $PATH) <br>
Path to the ip6tables binary from the netfilter package
available at &lt;http://netfilter.org&gt;. Only required for
adding ip6tables rules (see the ip6tables-enable
configuration <br>
setting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmd-tayga=path (default: assume
in $PATH) <br>
Path to the tayga binary from the TAYGA package available at
&lt;http://www.litech.org/tayga&gt;. Required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forwarding-enable=bool (default:
yes) <br>
Controls whether or not clatd should enable IPv6 forwarding
if necessary. IPv6 forwarding is necessary for clatd to work
correctly. It will also ensure that the accept_ra <br>
sysctl is to &rsquo;2&rsquo; for all devices have it set to
&rsquo;1&rsquo;, in order to prevent any connectivity loss
as a result of enabling forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All sysctls that are modified
will be restored to their original values when clatd is
shutting down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip6tables-enable=bool (default:
see below) <br>
Controls whether or not clatd should insert ip6tables rules
that permit the forwarding of IPv6 traffic between the CLAT
and PLAT devices. Such forwarding must be permitted <br>
for clatd to work correctly. Any rules added will be removed
when clatd is shutting down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is yes if the
ip6tables_filter kernel module is loaded, no if it is
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plat-dev (default: auto-detect)
<br>
Which network device is facing the PLAT (NAT64). By default,
this is auto-detected by performing a route table lookup
towards the PLAT prefix. This setting is used when <br>
setting up generating the CLAT IPv6 address, and when
setting up ip6tables rules and Proxy-ND entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plat-prefix (default:
auto-detect) <br>
The IPv6 translation prefix into which the PLAT maps the
IPv4 internet. See RFC 6052 for a closer description. By
default, this is auto-detected from DNS64 answers using the
<br>
method in RFC 7050.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proxynd-enable (default: yes)
<br>
Controls whether or not clatd should add a Proxy-ND entry
for the CLAT IPv6 address on the network device facing the
PLAT. This is probably necessary on Ethernet networks <br>
(otherwise the upstream IPv6 router won&rsquo;t know where
to send packets to the CLAT&rsquo;s IPv6 adderss), but
likely not necessary on point-to-point links like PPP or
3GPP mobile <br>
broadband, as in those cases IPv6 ND isn&rsquo;t used.
However it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to add Proxy-ND entries in
that case, either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any entries added wil be removed
when clatd is shutting down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tayga-conffile (default: use a
temporary file) <br>
Where to write the TAYGA configuration file. By default, a
temporary file will be created (and also deleted when clatd
is shutting down), but you may also specify an explicit <br>
configuration file here, which will not be deleted on
shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tayga-v4-addr (default:
192.0.0.2) <br>
The IPv4 address assigned to the TAYGA process. This is used
for emitting ICMPv4 errors back to the host (i.e., it will
show up as the first hop when tracerouting to IPv4 <br>
destinations), and you may also ping it to verify that the
TAYGA process is still alive and well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default address is one from
RFC 7335.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v4-conncheck-enable=bool
(default: yes) <br>
Whether or not to check if the system has IPv4 connectivity
before starting the CLAT. If it does, then clatd will simply
exit without doing anything. This is meant so that <br>
you can always enable clatd to the system startup scripts or
network-up event scripts (such as NetworkManager&rsquo;s
dispatcher scripts), but not have clatd interfering with
<br>
native IPv4 connectivity when this is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to always start the
CLAT whenever possible, even though the system has IPv4
connectivity, disable this setting. You may instead use the
v4-defaultroute-enable and <br>
v4-defaultroute-metric settings to prevent clatd from
interfering with native IPv4 connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that enabling
v4-defaultroute-replace will override v4-conncheck-enable
and unconditionally disable IPv4 connectivity checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v4-conncheck-delay=seconds
(default: 10) <br>
When performing an IPv4 connectivity check, wait this number
of seconds before actually doing anything. This is to avoid
a race condition where for example IPv6 SLAAC finshes <br>
and triggers a network-up event script to start clatd, while
IPv4 DHCPv4 is still running in the background. This is at
least a likely scenario when using NetworkManager, as <br>
it will start the dispatcher scripts as soon as either IPv4
or IPv6 has completed, and IPv6 SLAAC is typically faster
than IPv4 DHCPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set it to 0 to perform the check
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v4-defaultroute-enable=bool
(default: yes) <br>
Whether or not to add an IPv4 default route pointing to the
CLAT. In a typical 464XLAT environment, you want this.
However when using clatd in an environment where native <br>
IPv4 connectivity is also present, you might want to disable
this and instead control manually which IPv4 destinations is
reached through the CLAT and which are not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v4-defaultroute-replace=bool
(default: no) <br>
Instructs clatd to remove any pre-existing IPv4 default
routes, replacing it with one pointing to the CLAT (assuming
v4-defaultroute-enable is yes). The replacement is <br>
temporary, any pre-existing routes that were removed will be
restored when clatd is shutting down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that nothing prevents
software like a connection manager or a DHCPv4 client daemon
from re-adding any replaced routes while clatd is
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you enable
v4-defaultroute-replace while at the same time disabling
v4-defaultroute-enable, clatd will remove any pre-existing
IPv4 default routes but not add any of its <br>
own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting v4-defaultroute-replace
to yes will disable the IPv4 connectivity check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v4-defaultroute-metric=integer
(default: 2048) <br>
The metric of the IPv4 default route pointing to the CLAT.
The default is chosen because it is higher than that of a
native IPv4 default route added by NetworkManager, which
<br>
makes it so that the native IPv4 connectivity is preferred
if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v4-defaultroute-mtu=integer
(default: 1260) <br>
The MTU of the default route pointing to the CLAT. The
default is the default IPv6 MTU used by TAYGA (1280, which
in turn comes from RFC 6145) minus 20 to compensate for the
<br>
difference in header size between IPv4 and IPv6. This
prevents outbound packets from having to be fragmented by
TAYGA, and also makes local applications advertise a TCP MSS
<br>
to their remote peers that prevent them from sending packets
beck to us that would require fragmentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you know that the IPv6 Path
MTU between the host and the PLAT is larger than 1280, you
may increase this, but then you should also recompile TAYGA
with a larger <br>
ipv6_offlink_mtu setting in conffile.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v4-defaultroute-advmss=integer
(default: v4-defaultroute-mtu - 40) <br>
The &quot;advmss&quot; value assigned to the the default
route potining to the CLAT. This controls the advertised TCP
MSS value for TCP connections made through the CLAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should normally not need to
set this. By default the value is calculated by taking the
value of v4-defaultroute-mtu and substracting 40 (20 bytes
for the IPv4 header + 20 <br>
bytes for the TCP header). If v4-defaultroute-mtu is unset
or 0, there is no default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
clatd will not be able to acquire an IPv6 address for the
CLAT if SLAAC isn&rsquo;t used. RFC 6877 suggests DHCPv6
IA_PD should be attempted in this case, but this isn&rsquo;t
currently <br>
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clatd will not attempt to
perform Duplicate Address Detection for the IPv6 address it
generates. This is a violation of RFC 6877.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clatd will not attempt to
perform a connectivity check to a discovered PLAT prefix
before setting up the CLAT, as RFC 7050 suggest it
should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
