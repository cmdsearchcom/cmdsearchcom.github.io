<p>LCMAPS_LOCALACCOUNT.MOD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
LCMAPS_LOCALACCOUNT.MOD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lcmaps_localaccount.mod - LCMAPS plugin to switch user
identity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lcmaps_localaccount.mod [-gridmapfile gridmapfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This plugin is an Acquisition Plugin and will provide the
LCMAPS system with Local Account credential information. To
do this it needs to look up the Distinguished Name (DN) <br>
from a user&rsquo;s certificate in the gridmapfile. If this
DN is found in the gridmapfile the plugin knows the mapped
local (system) account username. By knowing the username of
the <br>
local account the plugin can gather additional information
about this account. The plugin will resolve the UID, GID and
all the secondary GIDs. When this has been done and <br>
there weren&rsquo;t any problems detected, the plugin will
add this information to a datastructure in the Plugin
Manager. The plugin will finish its run with a
LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS. <br>
This result will be reported to the Plugin Manager which
started this plugin and it will forward this result to the
Evaluation Manager, which will take appropriate actions for
<br>
the next plugin to run. Normally this plugin would be
followed by an Enforcement plugin that can apply these
gathered credentials in a way that is appropriate to a
system admin&acirc; <br>
istration&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-gridmapfile gridmapfile <br>
When this option is set it will override the default path of
the gridmapfile. It is advised to use an absolute path to
the gridmapfile to avoid usage of the wrong <br>
file(path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS <br>
Success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL <br>
Failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Since version 1.6.0 the localaccount plugin supports
grid-mapfile entries with multiple usernames, separated by a
comma without whitespace. This can be used in combination
with <br>
specifying a requested username (such as by gsissh), to pick
any of these accounts. When no requested username is
specified, the first is used. This requires LCMAPS version
<br>
1.6.0 or newer.</p>
