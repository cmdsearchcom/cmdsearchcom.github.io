<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Amd is a daemon that automatically mounts filesystems
whenever a file or directory within that filesystem is
accessed. Filesystems are automatically unmounted when they
appear <br>
to have become quiescent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amd operates by attaching itself
as an NFS server to each of the specified directories.
Lookups within the specified directories are handled by amd,
which uses the map defined <br>
by mapname to determine how to resolve the lookup.
Generally, this will be a host name, some filesystem
information and some mount options for the given
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first form depicted
above, amd will print a short help string. In the second
form, if no options are specified, or the -F is used, amd
will read configuration parameters <br>
from the file conf_file which defaults to /etc/amd.conf. The
last form is described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a temporary-directory <br>
Specify an alternative location for the real mount points.
The default is /a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c duration <br>
Specify a duration, in seconds, that a looked up name
remains cached when not in use. The default is 5
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d domain <br>
Specify the local domain name. If this option is not given
the domain name is determined from the hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k kernel-arch <br>
Specifies the kernel architecture. This is used solely to
set the ${karch} selector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
Specify a logfile in which to record mount and unmount
events. If logfile is the string syslog then the log
messages will be sent to the system log daemon by syslog(3).
<br>
The default syslog facility used is LOG_DAEMON. If you wish
to change it, append its name to the log file name,
delimited by a single colon. For example, if logfile is <br>
the string syslog:local7 then Amd will log messages via
syslog(3) using the LOG_LOCAL7 facility (if it exists on the
system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Normalize hostnames. The name
refereed to by ${rhost} is normalized relative to the host
database before being used. The effect is to translate
aliases into &lsquo;&lsquo;official&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o op_sys_ver <br>
Override the compiled-in version number of the operating
system. Useful when the built in version is not desired for
backward compatibility reasons. For example, if the <br>
build in version is &lsquo;&lsquo;2.5.1&rsquo;&rsquo;, you
can override it to &lsquo;&lsquo;5.5.1&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
use older maps that were written with the latter in
mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Print PID. Outputs the
process-id of amd to standard output where it can be saved
into a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Restart existing mounts. Amd
will scan the mount file table to determine which
filesystems are currently mounted. Whenever one of these
would have been auto-mounted, amd <br>
inherits it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout.retransmit <br>
Specify the NFS timeout interval, in tenths of a second,
between NFS/RPC retries (for UDP only). The default is 0.8
seconds. The second value alters the retransmit <br>
counter, which defaults to 11 retransmissions. Both of these
values are used by the kernel to communicate with amd.
Useful defaults are supplied if either or both values <br>
are missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amd relies on the kernel RPC
retransmit mechanism to trigger mount retries. The values of
these parameters change the overall retry interval. Too long
an interval gives <br>
poor interactive response; too short an interval causes
excessive retries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Version. Displays version and
configuration information on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w interval <br>
Specify an interval, in seconds, between attempts to
dismount filesystems that have exceeded their cached times.
The default is 2 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x options <br>
Specify run-time logging options. The options are a comma
separated list chosen from: fatal, error, user, warn, info,
map, stats, defaults, and all. Note that &quot;fatal&quot;
<br>
and &quot;error&quot; are mandatory and cannot be turned
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y domain <br>
Specify an alternative NIS domain from which to fetch the
NIS maps. The default is the system domain name. This option
is ignored if NIS support is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A arch <br>
Specifies the OS architecture. This is used solely to set
the ${arch} selector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cluster-name <br>
Specify an alternative HP-UX cluster name to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D option <br>
Select from a variety of debug options. Prefixing an option
with the strings no reverses the effect of that option.
Options are cumulative. The most useful option is <br>
all. Since -D is only used for debugging other options are
not documented here: the current supported set of options is
listed by the -v option and a fuller description <br>
is available in the program source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F conf_file <br>
Specify an amd configuration file to use. See amd.conf(5)
for description of this file&rsquo;s format. This
configuration file is used to specify any options in lieu of
typing <br>
many of them on the command line. The amd.conf file includes
directives for every command line option amd has, and many
more that are only available via the configuration <br>
file facility. The configuration file specified by this
option is processed after all other options had been
processed, regardless of the actual location of this option
<br>
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print help and usage
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O op_sys_name <br>
Override the compiled-in name of the operating system.
Useful when the built in name is not desired for backward
compatibility reasons. For example, if the build in name
<br>
is &lsquo;&lsquo;sunos5&rsquo;&rsquo;, you can override it
to &lsquo;&lsquo;sos5&rsquo;&rsquo;, and use older maps
which were written with the latter in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Do not lock the running
executable pages of amd into memory. To improve amd&rsquo;s
performance, systems that support the plock(3) call, could
lock the amd process into memory. <br>
This way there is less chance the operating system will
schedule, page out, and swap the amd process as needed. This
tends improves amd&rsquo;s performance, at the cost of <br>
reserving the memory used by the amd process (making it
unavailable for other processes). If this behavior is not
desired, use the -S option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T tag Specify a tag to use with
amd.conf(5). All map entries tagged with tag will be
processed. Map entries that are not tagged are always
processed. Map entries that are <br>
tagged with a tag other than tag will not be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/a directory under which filesystems are dynamically
mounted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/amd.conf <br>
default configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Some care may be required when creating a mount map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbolic links on an NFS
filesystem can be incredibly inefficient. In most
implementations of NFS, their interpolations are not cached
by the kernel and each time a symlink is <br>
encountered during a lookuppn translation it costs an RPC
call to the NFS server. It would appear that a large
improvement in real-time performance could be gained by
adding a <br>
cache somewhere. Replacing symlinks with a suitable
incarnation of the auto-mounter results in a large real-time
speedup, but also causes a large number of process context
<br>
switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A weird imagination is most
useful to gain full advantage of all the features.</p>
