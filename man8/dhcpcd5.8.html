<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dhcpcd is an implementation of the DHCP client specified in
RFC 2131. dhcpcd gets the host information (IP address,
routes, etc) from a DHCP server and configures the network
<br>
interface of the machine on which it is running. dhcpcd then
runs the configuration script which writes DNS information
to resolvconf(8), if available, otherwise directly to <br>
/etc/resolv.conf. If the hostname is currently blank, (null)
or localhost, or force_hostname is YES or TRUE or 1 then
dhcpcd sets the hostname to the one supplied by the DHCP
<br>
server. dhcpcd then daemonises and waits for the lease
renewal time to lapse. It will then attempt to renew its
lease and reconfigure if the new lease changes when the
lease <br>
beings to expire or the DHCP server sends message to renew
early.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any interface reports a
working carrier then dhcpcd will try and obtain a lease
before forking to the background, otherwise it will fork
right away. This behaviour can be modi&acirc; <br>
fied with the -b, --background and -w, --waitip options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcpcd is also an implementation
of the BOOTP client specified in RFC 951.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcpcd is also an implementation
of the IPv6 Router Solicitor as specified in RFC 4861 and
RFC 6106.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcpcd is also an implementation
of the IPv6 Privacy Extensions to AutoConf as specified in
RFC 4941. This feature needs to be enabled in the kernel and
dhcpcd will start using <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcpcd is also an implementation
of the DHCPv6 client as specified in RFC 3315. By default,
dhcpcd only starts DHCPv6 when instructed to do so by an
IPV6 Router Advertisement. If <br>
no Identity Association is configured, then a Non-temporary
Address is requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local Link configuration <br>
If dhcpcd failed to obtain a lease, it probes for a valid
IPv4LL address (aka ZeroConf, aka APIPA). Once obtained it
restarts the process of looking for a DHCP server to get a
<br>
proper address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using IPv4LL, dhcpcd nearly
always succeeds and returns an exit code of 0. In the rare
case it fails, it normally means that there is a reverse ARP
proxy installed which <br>
always defeats IPv4LL probing. To disable this behaviour,
you can use the -L, --noipv4ll option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple interfaces <br>
If a list of interfaces are given on the command line, then
dhcpcd only works with those interfaces, otherwise dhcpcd
discovers available Ethernet interfaces that can be
config&acirc; <br>
ured. When dhcpcd is operating on more than one interface,
it is called Master mode. and this behaviour can be forced
with the -M, --master option so that an individual interface
<br>
can start dhcpcd but only one instance is running. The
dhcpcd-ui project expects dhcpcd to be running this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a single interface is given
then dhcpcd only works for that interface and runs as a
separate instance. The -w, --waitip option is enabled in
this instance to maintain compati&acirc; <br>
bility with older versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interfaces are preferred by
carrier, DHCP lease/IPv4LL and then lowest metric. For
systems that support route metrics, each route will be
tagged with the metric, otherwise dhcpcd <br>
changes the routes to use the interface with the same route
and the lowest metric. See options below for controlling
which interfaces we allow and deny through the use of
pat&acirc; <br>
terns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hooking into events <br>
dhcpcd runs /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks, or the script
specified by the -c, --script option. This script runs each
script found in /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks in a lexical order.
<br>
The default installation supplies the scripts 01-test,
02-dump, 20-resolv.conf and 30-hostname. You can disable
each script by using the -C, --nohook option. See <br>
dhcpcd-run-hooks(8) for details on how these scripts work.
dhcpcd currently ignores the exit code of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More scripts are supplied in
/usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks and need to be copied to
/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks if you intend to use them. For
example, you could install 10-wpa_supplicant <br>
so that dhcpcd can ensure that wpa_supplicant(8) is always
running on a hot-plugged wireless interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fine tuning <br>
You can fine-tune the behaviour of dhcpcd with the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --background <br>
Background immediately. This is useful for startup scripts
which don&rsquo;t disable link messages for carrier
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --script script <br>
Use this script instead of the default
/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --duid <br>
Generate an RFC 4361 compliant clientid. This requires
persistent storage and not all DHCP servers work with it so
it is not enabled by default. dhcpcd generates the DUID <br>
and stores it in /etc/dhcpcd.duid. This file should not be
copied to other hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Echo debug messages to the stderr and syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --lastlease <br>
If dhcpcd cannot obtain a lease, then try to use the last
lease acquired for the interface. If the -p, --persistent
option is not given then the lease is used if it
hasn&rsquo;t <br>
expired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --env value <br>
Push value to the environment for use in
dhcpcd-run-hooks(8). For example, you can force the hostname
hook to always set the hostname with -e
force_hostname=YES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --reconfigure <br>
dhcpcd will re-apply IP address, routing and run
dhcpcd-run-hooks(8) for each interface. This is useful so
that a 3rd party such as PPP or VPN can change the routing
table <br>
and / or DNS, etc and then instruct dhcpcd to put things
back afterwards. dhcpcd does not read a new configuration
when this happens - you should rebind if you need that <br>
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fqdn fqdn <br>
Requests that the DHCP server updates DNS using FQDN instead
of just a hostname. Valid values for fqdn are disable, none,
ptr and both. dhcpcd itself never does any DNS <br>
updates. dhcpcd encodes the FQDN hostname as specified in
RFC1035.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --config file <br>
Specify a config to load instead of /etc/dhcpcd.conf. dhcpcd
always processes the config file before any command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --hostname hostname <br>
Sends hostname to the DHCP server so it can be registered in
DNS. If hostname is an empty string then the current system
hostname is sent. If hostname is a FQDN (ie, con&acirc; <br>
tains a .) then it will be encoded as such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --clientid clientid <br>
Send the clientid. If the string is of the format 01:02:03
then it is encoded as hex. For interfaces whose hardware
address is longer than 8 bytes, or if the clientid is <br>
an empty string then dhcpcd sends a default clientid of the
hardware family and the hardware address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --vendorclassid
vendorclassid <br>
Override the DHCPv4 vendorclassid field sent. The default is
dhcpcd-&lt;version&gt;:&lt;os&gt;:&lt;machine&gt;:&lt;platform&gt;.
For example <br>
dhcpcd-5.5.6:NetBSD-6.99.5:i386:i386 <br>
If not set then none is sent. Some badly configured DHCP
servers reject unknown vendorclassids. To work around it,
try and impersonate Windows by using the MSFT vendor&acirc;
<br>
classid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --logfile logfile <br>
Writes to the specified logfile rather than syslog(3). The
logfile is truncated when opened and is reopened when dhcpcd
receives the SIGUSR2 signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --release [interface] <br>
This causes an existing dhcpcd process running on the
interface to release its lease and de-configure the
interface regardless of the -p, --persistent option. If no
<br>
interface is specified then this applies to all interfaces.
If no interfaces are left running, dhcpcd will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --leasetime seconds <br>
Request a specific lease time in seconds. By default dhcpcd
does not request any lease time and leaves it in the hands
of the DHCP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --master <br>
Start dhcpcd in master mode even if only one interface
specified on the command line. See the Multiple Interfaces
section above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --metric metric <br>
Metrics are used to prefer an interface over another one,
lowest wins. dhcpcd will supply a default metic of 200 +
if_nametoindex(3). An extra 100 will be added for
wire&acirc; <br>
less interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --rebind [interface] <br>
Notifies dhcpcd to reload its configuration and rebind the
specified interface. If no interface is specified then this
applies to all interfaces. If dhcpcd is not run&acirc; <br>
ning, then it starts up as normal. This may also cause
wpa_supplicant(8) to reload its configuration for each
interface as well if the relevant hook script has been <br>
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --renew [interface] <br>
Notifies dhcpcd to renew existing addresses on the specified
interface. If no interface is specified then this applies to
all interfaces. If dhcpcd is not running, then <br>
it starts up as normal. Unlike the -n, --rebind option
above, the configuration for dhcpcd is not reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --option option <br>
Request the DHCP option variable for use in
/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --persistent <br>
dhcpcd normally de-configures the interface and
configuration when it exits. Sometimes, this isn&rsquo;t
desirable if, for example, you have root mounted over NFS or
SSH clients <br>
connect to this host and they need to be notified of the
host shutting down. You can use this option to stop this
from happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --request [address] <br>
Request the address in the DHCP DISCOVER message. There is
no guarantee this is the address the DHCP server will
actually give. If no address is given then the first <br>
address currently assigned to the interface is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --inform [address[/cidr]]
<br>
Behaves like -r, --request as above, but sends a DHCP INFORM
instead of DISCOVER/REQUEST. This does not get a lease as
such, just notifies the DHCP server of the address <br>
in use. You should also include the optional cidr network
number in case the address is not already configured on the
interface. dhcpcd remains running and pretends it <br>
has an infinite lease. dhcpcd will not de-configure the
interface when it exits. If dhcpcd fails to contact a DHCP
server then it returns a failure instead of falling <br>
back on IPv4LL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inform6 <br>
Performs a DHCPv6 Information Request. No address is
requested or specified, but all other DHCPv6 options are
allowed. This is normally performed automatically when the
<br>
IPv6 Router Advertises that the client should perform this
operation. This option is only needed when dhcpcd is not
processing IPv6RA messages and the need for DHCPv6 <br>
Information Request exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --static value <br>
Configures a static DHCP value. If you set ip_address then
dhcpcd will not attempt to obtain a lease and just use the
value for the address with an infinite lease time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example which
configures a static address, routes and dns. <br>
dhcpcd -S ip_address=192.168.0.10/24 -S routers=192.168.0.1
-S domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1 eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot presently set static
DHCPv6 values. Use the -e, --env option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout seconds <br>
Timeout after seconds, instead of the default 30. A setting
of 0 seconds causes dhcpcd to wait forever to get a lease.
If dhcpcd is working on a single interface then <br>
dhcpcd will exit when a timeout occurs, otherwise dhcpcd
will fork into the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --userclass class <br>
Tags the DHCPv4 message with the userclass class. DHCP
servers use this to give members of the class DHCP options
other than the default, without having to know things <br>
like hardware address or hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --vendor code,value <br>
Add an encapsulated vendor option. code should be between 1
and 254 inclusive. To add a raw vendor string, omit code but
keep the comma. Examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the vendor option 01 with an
IP address. <br>
dhcpcd -v 01,192.168.0.2 eth0 <br>
Set the vendor option 02 with a hex code. <br>
dhcpcd -v 02,01:02:03:04:05 eth0 <br>
Set the vendor option 03 with an IP address as a string.
<br>
dhcpcd -v 03, <br>
Set un-encapsulated vendor option to hello world. <br>
dhcpcd -v ,&quot;hello world&quot; eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display both program version and copyright information.
dhcpcd then exits before doing any configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Wait for an address to be
assigned before forking to the background. Does not take an
argument, unlike the below option. -fl -waitip option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--waitip [4 | 6] <br>
Wait for an address to be assigned before forking to the
background. 4 means wait for an IPv4 address to be assigned.
6 means wait for an IPv6 address to be assigned. If <br>
no argument is given, dhcpcd will wait for any address
protocol to be assigned. It is possible to wait for more
than one address protocol and dhcpcd will only fork to the
<br>
background when all waiting conditions are satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exit [interface] <br>
This will signal an existing dhcpcd process running on the
interface to exit. If no interface is specified, then the
above is applied to all interfaces. See the -p, <br>
--persistent option to control configuration persistence on
exit, which is enabled by default in dhcpcd.conf(5). dhcpcd
then waits until this process has exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --reboot seconds <br>
Allow reboot seconds before moving to the discover phase if
we have an old lease to use. Allow reboot seconds before
starting fallback states from the discover phase. <br>
IPv4LL is started when the first reboot timeout is reached.
The default is 5 seconds. A setting of 0 seconds causes
dhcpcd to skip the reboot phase and go straight into <br>
discover. This has no effect on DHCPv6 other than skipping
the reboot phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restricting behaviour <br>
dhcpcd will try to do as much as it can by default. However,
there are sometimes situations where you don&rsquo;t want
the things to be configured exactly how the the DHCP server
wants. <br>
Here are some options that deal with turning these bits
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1, --oneshot <br>
Exit after configuring an interface. Use the -w, --waitip
option to specify which protocol(s) to configure before
exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --ipv4only <br>
Configure IPv4 only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ipv6only <br>
Configure IPv6 only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --noarp <br>
Don&rsquo;t request or claim the address by ARP. This also
disables IPv4LL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --nobackground <br>
Don&rsquo;t run in the background when we acquire a lease.
This is mainly useful for running under the control of
another process, such as a debugger or a network
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --nohook script <br>
Don&rsquo;t run this hook script. Matches full name, or
prefixed with 2 numbers optionally ending with .sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So to stop dhcpcd from touching
your DNS settings you would do:- <br>
dhcpcd -C resolv.conf eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --nogateway <br>
Don&rsquo;t set any default routes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --xidhwaddr <br>
Use the last four bytes of the hardware address as the DHCP
xid instead of a randomly generated number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J, --broadcast <br>
Instructs the DHCP server to broadcast replies back to the
client. Normally this is only set for non Ethernet
interfaces, such as FireWire and InfiniBand. In most <br>
instances, dhcpcd will set this automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --nolink <br>
Don&rsquo;t receive link messages for carrier status. You
should only have to use this with buggy device drivers or
running dhcpcd through a network manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --noipv4ll <br>
Don&rsquo;t use IPv4LL (aka APIPA, aka Bonjour, aka
ZeroConf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --nooption option <br>
Removes the option from the DHCP message before
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, -FL -printpidfile <br>
Print the pidfile dhcpcd will use based on commmand-line
arguments to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --require option <br>
Requires the option to be present in all DHCP messages,
otherwise the message is ignored. To enforce that dhcpcd
only responds to DHCP servers and not BOOTP servers, you
<br>
can -Q dhcp_message_type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Quiet dhcpcd on the command line, only warnings and errors
will be displayed. The messages are still logged though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --test <br>
On receipt of DHCP messages just call
/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks with the reason of TEST which
echos the DHCP variables found in the message to the
console. The inter&acirc; <br>
face configuration isn&rsquo;t touched and neither are any
configuration files. The rapid_commit option is not sent in
TEST mode so that the server does not lease an address. <br>
To test INFORM the interface needs to be configured with the
desired address before starting dhcpcd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --dumplease interface <br>
Dumps the last lease for the interface to stdout. If
omitted, standard input is used to read a DHCP wire
formatted message. Use the -4 or -6 flags to specify an
address <br>
family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --variables <br>
Display a list of option codes, the associated variable and
encoding for use in dhcpcd-run-hooks(8). Variables are
prefixed with new_ and old_ unless the option number is <br>
-. Variables without an option are part of the DHCP message
and cannot be directly requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --whitelist address[/cidr]
<br>
Only accept packets from address[/cidr]. -X, --blacklist is
ignored if -W, --whitelist is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --blacklist address[/cidr]
<br>
Ignore all packets from address[/cidr].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --denyinterfaces pattern
<br>
When discovering interfaces, the interface name must not
match pattern which is a space or comma separated list of
patterns passed to fnmatch(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --allowinterfaces pattern
<br>
When discovering interfaces, the interface name must match
pattern which is a space or comma separated list of patterns
passed to fnmatch(3). If the same interface is <br>
matched in -Z, --denyinterfaces then it is still denied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodev <br>
Don&rsquo;t load any /dev management modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3RDPARTY LINK MANAGEMENT <br>
Some interfaces require configuration by 3rd parties, such
as PPP or VPN. When an interface configuration in dhcpcd is
marked as STATIC or INFORM without an address then dhcpcd
<br>
will monitor the interface until an address is added or
removed from it and act accordingly. For point to point
interfaces (like PPP), a default route to its destination is
auto&acirc; <br>
matically added to the configuration. If the point to point
interface is configured for INFORM, then dhcpcd unicasts
INFORM to the destination, otherwise it defaults to
STATIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
dhcpcd requires a Berkley Packet Filter, or BPF device on
BSD based systems and a Linux Socket Filter, or LPF device
on Linux based systems for all IPv4 configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If restricting dhcpcd to a
single interface and optionally address family via the
command-line then all futher calls to dhcpcd to rebind,
reconfigure or exit need to include the <br>
same restrictive flags so that dhcpcd knows which process to
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/dhcpcd.conf <br>
Configuration file for dhcpcd. If you always use the same
options, put them here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dhcpcd.duid <br>
Text file that holds the DUID used to identify the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dhcpcd.secret <br>
Text file that holds a secret key known only to the
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks
