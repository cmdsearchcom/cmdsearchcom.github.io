<p>pgpverify(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
pgpverify(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pgpverify - cryptographically verify Usenet control
messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pgpverify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pgpverify program reads (on standard input) a Usenet
control message that has been cryptographically signed using
the signcontrol program. pgpverify then uses the pgp
pro&acirc; <br>
gram to determine who signed the control message. If the
control message was validly signed, pgpverify outputs (to
stdout) the User ID of the key ID that signed the
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The pgpverify program takes no options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
pgpverify returns the follow exit statuses for the following
cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The control message had a good
PGP signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 The control message had no PGP
signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 The control message had an
unknown PGP signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 The control message had a bad
PGP signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">255 A problem occurred not
directly related to PGP analysis of signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
David C Lawrence &lt;tale@isc.org&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
pgpverify does not modify or otherwise alter the environment
before invoking the pgp program. It is the responsibility of
the person who installs pgpverify to ensure that when <br>
pgp runs, it has the ability to locate and read a PGP key
file that contains the PGP public keys for the appropriate
Usenet hierarchy administrators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Historically, Usenet news server administrators have
configured their news servers to automatically honor Usenet
control messages based on the originator of the control
messages <br>
and the hierarchies for which the control messages applied.
For example, in the past, David C Lawrence
&lt;tale@uunet.uu.net&gt; always issued control messages for
the &quot;Big 8&quot; hierar&acirc; <br>
chies (comp, humanities, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, talk).
Usenet news administrators would configure their news server
software to automatically honor newgroup and rmgroup
con&acirc; <br>
trol messages that originated from David Lawrence and
applied to any of the Big 8 hierarchies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, Usenet news
articles (including control messages) are notoriously easy
to forge. Soon, malicious users realized they could create
or remove (at least temporarily) <br>
any Big 8 newsgroup they wanted by simply forging an
appropriate control message in David Lawrence&rsquo;s name.
As Usenet became more widely used, forgeries became more
common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pgpverify program was
designed to allow Usenet news administrators to configure
their servers to cryptographically verify control messages
before automatically acting on <br>
them. Under the pgpverify system, a Usenet hierarchy
maintainer creates a PGP public/private key pair and
disseminates the public key. Whenever the hierarchy
maintainer issues <br>
a control message, he uses the signcontrol program to sign
the control message with the PGP private key. Usenet news
administrators configure their news servers to run the <br>
pgpverify program on the appropriate control messages, and
take action based on the PGP key User ID that signed the
control message, not the name and address that appear in the
<br>
control message&rsquo;s From or Sender headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, using the signcontrol and
pgpverify programs appropriately essentially eliminates the
possibility of malicious users forging Usenet control
messages that sites will act <br>
upon, as such users would have to obtain the PGP private key
in order to forge a control message that would pass the
cryptographic verification step. If the hierarchy
adminis&acirc; <br>
trators properly protect their PGP private keys, the only
way a malicious user could forge a validly-signed control
message would be by breaking the RSA encryption algorithm,
<br>
which (at least at this time) is believed to be an
NP-complete problem. If this is indeed the case, discovering
the PGP private key based on the PGP public key is
computation&acirc; <br>
ally impossible for PGP keys of a sufficient bit length.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/&gt;
is where the most recent versions of signcontrol and
pgpverify live, along with PGP public keys used for
hierarchy administration.</p>
