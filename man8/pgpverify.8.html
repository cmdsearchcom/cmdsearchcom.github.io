pgpverify - cryptographically verify Usenet control messages

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>pgpverify</i> program reads (on standard input) a Usenet control message
  that has been cryptographically signed using the <i>signcontrol</i> program.
  <i>pgpverify</i> then uses the <i>pgp</i> program to determine who signed the
  control message. If the control message was validly signed, <i>pgpverify</i>
  outputs (to stdout) the User ID of the key ID that signed the message.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The <i>pgpverify</i> program takes no options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<i>pgpverify</i> returns the follow exit statuses for the following cases:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>0</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The control message had a good PGP signature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">The control message had no PGP signature.</dd>

<i>pgpverify</i> does not modify or otherwise alter the environment before
  invoking the <i>pgp</i> program. It is the responsibility of the person who
  installs <i>pgpverify</i> to ensure that when <i>pgp</i> runs, it has the
  ability to locate and read a PGP key file that contains the PGP public keys
  for the appropriate Usenet hierarchy administrators.

Historically, Usenet news server administrators have configured their news
  servers to automatically honor Usenet control messages based on the originator
  of the control messages and the hierarchies for which the control messages
  applied. For example, in the past, David C Lawrence &lt;tale@uunet.uu.net&gt;
  always issued control messages for the &quot;Big 8&quot; hierarchies (comp,
  humanities, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, talk). Usenet news administrators would
  configure their news server software to automatically honor newgroup and
  rmgroup control messages that originated from David Lawrence and applied to
  any of the Big 8 hierarchies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unfortunately, Usenet news articles (including control messages) are notoriously
  easy to forge. Soon, malicious users realized they could create or remove (at
  least temporarily) any Big 8 newsgroup they wanted by simply forging an
  appropriate control message in David Lawrence's name. As Usenet became more
  widely used, forgeries became more common.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>pgpverify</i> program was designed to allow Usenet news administrators to
  configure their servers to cryptographically verify control messages before
  automatically acting on them. Under the pgpverify system, a Usenet hierarchy
  maintainer creates a PGP public/private key pair and disseminates the public
  key. Whenever the hierarchy maintainer issues a control message, he uses the
  <i>signcontrol</i> program to sign the control message with the PGP private
  key. Usenet news administrators configure their news servers to run the
  <i>pgpverify</i> program on the appropriate control messages, and take action
  based on the PGP key User ID that signed the control message, not the name and
  address that appear in the control message's From or Sender headers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, using the <i>signcontrol</i> and <i>pgpverify programs</i> appropriately
  essentially eliminates the possibility of malicious users forging Usenet
  control messages that sites will act upon, as such users would have to obtain
  the PGP private key in order to forge a control message that would pass the
  cryptographic verification step. If the hierarchy administrators properly
  protect their PGP private keys, the only way a malicious user could forge a
  validly-signed control message would be by breaking the RSA encryption
  algorithm, which (at least at this time) is believed to be an NP-complete
  problem. If this is indeed the case, discovering the PGP private key based on
  the PGP public key is computationally impossible for PGP keys of a sufficient
  bit length.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&lt;URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/&gt; is where the most recent versions
  of <i>signcontrol</i> and <i>pgpverify</i> live, along with PGP public keys
  used for hierarchy administration.</div>
