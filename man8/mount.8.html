<p>MOUNT(8) System Administration MOUNT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mount - mount a filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mount [-lhV]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t vfstype]
[-O optlist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount [-fnrsvw] [-o
option[,option]...] device|dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount [-fnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-o
options] device dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one
big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can
be spread out over several devices. The mount command serves
<br>
to attach the filesystem found on some device to the big
file tree. Conversely, the umount(8) command will detach it
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard form of the mount
command, is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -t type device dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells the kernel to attach
the filesystem found on device (which is of type type) at
the directory dir. The previous contents (if any) and owner
and mode of dir become <br>
invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted,
the pathname dir refers to the root of the filesystem on
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only directory or device is
given, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then mount looks for a
mountpoint and if not found then for a device in the
/etc/fstab file. It&rsquo;s possible to use --target or
--source options to avoid ambivalent interpretation <br>
of the given argument. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount --target /mountpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listing and help. <br>
The listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more robust and definable
output use findmnt(8), especially in your scripts. Note that
control characters in the mountpoint name are replaced with
&rsquo;?&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount [-l] [-t type] <br>
lists all mounted filesystems (of type type). The option -l
adds the labels in this listing. See below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device indication. <br>
Most devices are indicated by a file name (of a block
special device), like /dev/sda1, but there are other
possibilities. For example, in the case of an NFS mount,
device <br>
may look like knuth.cwi.nl:/dir. It is possible to indicate
a block special device using its filesystem LABEL or UUID
(see the -L and -U options below) and partition PAR&acirc;
<br>
TUUID or PARTLABEL (partition identifiers are supported for
GUID Partition Table (GPT) and MAC partition tables
only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recommended setup is to use
tags (e.g. LABEL=&lt;label&gt;) rather than
/dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,partuuid,partlabel} udev symlinks
in the /etc/fstab file. The tags are more <br>
readable, robust and portable. The mount(8) command
internally uses udev symlinks, so use the symlinks in
/etc/fstab has no advantage over the tags. For more details
see <br>
libblkid(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that mount(8) uses UUIDs as
strings. The UUIDs from command line or fstab(5) are not
converted to internal binary representation. The string
representation of the <br>
UUID should be based on lower case characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The proc filesystem is not
associated with a special device, and when mounting it, an
arbitrary keyword, such as proc can be used instead of a
device specification. (The <br>
customary choice none is less fortunate: the error message
&lsquo;none busy&rsquo; from umount can be confusing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and
/proc/mounts files. <br>
The file /etc/fstab (see fstab(5)), may contain lines
describing what devices are usually mounted where, using
which options. The default location of the fstab(5) file
<br>
could be overridden by --fstab &lt;path&gt; command line
option (see below for more details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -a [-t type] [-O
optlist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(usually given in a bootscript)
causes all filesystems mentioned in fstab (of the proper
type and/or having or not having the proper options) to be
mounted as indicated, <br>
except for those whose line contains the noauto keyword.
Adding the -F option will make mount fork, so that the
filesystems are mounted simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When mounting a filesystem
mentioned in fstab or mtab, it suffices to give only the
device, or only the mount point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The programs mount and umount
maintain a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file
/etc/mtab. If no arguments are given to mount, this list is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mount program does not read
the /etc/fstab file if device (or LABEL, UUID, PARTUUID or
PARTLABEL) and dir are specified. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /dev/foo /dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to override mount
options from /etc/fstab you have to use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount device|dir -o
&lt;options&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then the mount options from
command line will be appended to the list of options from
/etc/fstab. The usual behaviour is that the last option wins
if there is more <br>
duplicated options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the proc filesystem is
mounted (say at /proc), the files /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts
have very similar contents. The former has somewhat more
information, such as the <br>
mount options used, but is not necessarily up-to-date (cf.
the -n option below). It is possible to replace /etc/mtab by
a symbolic link to /proc/mounts, and especially <br>
when you have very large numbers of mounts things will be
much faster with that symlink, but some information is lost
that way, and in particular using the &quot;user&quot;
option <br>
will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The non-superuser mounts. <br>
Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems. However,
when fstab contains the user option on a line, anybody can
mount the corresponding system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, given a line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/cdrom /cd iso9660
ro,user,noauto,unhide</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">any user can mount the iso9660
filesystem found on his CDROM using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /dev/cdrom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /cd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see fstab(5).
Only the user that mounted a filesystem can unmount it
again. If any user should be able to unmount, then use users
instead of user in <br>
the fstab line. The owner option is similar to the user
option, with the restriction that the user must be the owner
of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for <br>
/dev/fd if a login script makes the console user owner of
this device. The group option is similar, with the
restriction that the user must be member of the group of the
<br>
special file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bind mounts. <br>
Since Linux 2.4.0 it is possible to remount part of the file
hierarchy somewhere else. The call is <br>
mount --bind olddir newdir <br>
or shortoption <br>
mount -B olddir newdir <br>
or fstab entry is: <br>
/olddir /newdir none bind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this call the same
contents is accessible in two places. One can also remount a
single file (on a single file). It&rsquo;s also possible to
use the bind mount to create a <br>
mountpoint from a regular directory, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount --bind foo foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bind mount call attaches
only (part of) a single filesystem, not possible submounts.
The entire file hierarchy including submounts is attached a
second place using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount --rbind olddir newdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or shortoption</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -R olddir newdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the filesystem mount
options will remain the same as those on the original mount
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount(8) since v2.27 (backported
to RHEL7.3) allow to change the options by passing the -o
option along with --bind for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount --bind,ro foo foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is not supported by
Linux kernel and it is implemented in userspace by
additional remount mount(2) syscall. This solution is not
atomic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternative (classic) way to
create a read-only bind mount is to use remount operation,
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount --bind olddir newdir <br>
mount -o remount,ro,bind olddir newdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that read-only bind will
create a read-only mountpoint (VFS entry), but the original
filesystem superblock will still be writable, meaning that
the olddir will be <br>
writable, but the newdir will be read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s impossible to change
mount options recursively (for example with -o
rbind,ro).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The move operation. <br>
Since Linux 2.5.1 it is possible to atomically move a
mounted tree to another place. The call is <br>
mount --move olddir newdir <br>
or shortoption <br>
mount -M olddir newdir <br>
This will cause the contents which previously appeared under
olddir to be accessed under newdir. The physical location of
the files is not changed. Note that the olddir <br>
has to be a mountpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that moving a mount
residing under a shared mount is invalid and unsupported.
Use findmnt -o TARGET,PROPAGATION to see the current
propagation flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shared subtrees operations.
<br>
Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its
submounts as shared, private, slave or unbindable. A shared
mount provides ability to create mirrors of that <br>
mount such that mounts and umounts within any of the mirrors
propagate to the other mirror. A slave mount receives
propagation from its master, but any not vice-versa. A <br>
private mount carries no propagation abilities. A unbindable
mount is a private mount which cannot be cloned through a
bind operation. Detailed semantics is documented in <br>
Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt file in the
kernel source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported operations: <br>
mount --make-shared mountpoint <br>
mount --make-slave mountpoint <br>
mount --make-private mountpoint <br>
mount --make-unbindable mountpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands allows
one to recursively change the type of all the mounts under a
given mountpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount --make-rshared mountpoint
<br>
mount --make-rslave mountpoint <br>
mount --make-rprivate mountpoint <br>
mount --make-runbindable mountpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount(8) does not read fstab(5)
when --make-* operation is requested. All necessary
information has to be specified on command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Linux kernel does not
allow to change more propagation flags by one mount(2)
syscall and the flags cannot be mixed with another mount
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since util-linux 2.23 mount
command allows to use more propagation flags together and
with another mount operations. This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.
The propagation flags <br>
are applied by additional mount(2) syscalls after previous
successful mount operation. Note that this use case is not
atomic. The propagation flags is possible to specify <br>
in fstab(5) as mount options (private, slave, shared,
unbindable, rprivate, rslave, rshared, runbindable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example <br>
mount --make-private --make-unbindable /dev/sda1 /A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is the same as <br>
mount /dev/sda1 /A <br>
mount --make-private /A <br>
mount --make-unbindable /A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The full set of mount options used by an invocation of mount
is determined by first extracting the mount options for the
filesystem from the fstab table, then applying any <br>
options specified by the -o argument, and finally applying a
-r or -w option, when present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options available
for the mount command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in
fstab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fork <br>
(Used in conjunction with -a.) Fork off a new incarnation of
mount for each device. This will do the mounts on different
devices or different NFS servers in parallel. <br>
This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts
go in parallel. A disadvantage is that the mounts are done
in undefined order. Thus, you cannot use this <br>
option if you want to mount both /usr and /usr/spool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fake <br>
Causes everything to be done except for the actual system
call; if it&rsquo;s not obvious, this
&lsquo;&lsquo;fakes&rsquo;&rsquo; mounting the filesystem.
This option is useful in conjunction with the <br>
-v flag to determine what the mount command is trying to do.
It can also be used to add entries for devices that were
mounted earlier with the -n option. The -f option <br>
checks for existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when the
record already exists (with regular non-fake mount, this
check is done by kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --internal-only <br>
Don&rsquo;t call the /sbin/mount.&lt;filesystem&gt; helper
even if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --show-labels <br>
Add the labels in the mount output. Mount must have
permission to read the disk device (e.g. be suid root) for
this to work. One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or
<br>
ext4 using the e2label(8) utility, or for XFS using
xfs_admin(8), or for reiserfs using reiserfstune(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-mtab <br>
Mount without writing in /etc/mtab. This is necessary for
example when /etc is on a read-only filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --no-canonicalize <br>
Don&rsquo;t canonicalize paths. The mount command
canonicalizes all paths (from command line or fstab) and
stores canonicalized paths to the /etc/mtab file. This
option can be <br>
used together with the -f flag for already canonicalized
absolute paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Tolerate sloppy mount options
rather than failing. This will ignore mount options not
supported by a filesystem type. Not all filesystems support
this option. This option <br>
exists for support of the Linux autofs-based
automounter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source src <br>
If only one argument for the mount command is given then the
argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or
source (device). This option allows to explicitly <br>
define that the argument is mount source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --read-only <br>
Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is -o ro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, depending on the
filesystem type, state and kernel behavior, the system may
still write to the device. For example, Ext3 or ext4 will
replay its journal if the <br>
filesystem is dirty. To prevent this kind of write access,
you may want to mount ext3 or ext4 filesystem with
&quot;ro,noload&quot; mount options or set the block device
to read- <br>
only mode, see command blockdev(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --rw, --read-write <br>
Mount the filesystem read/write. This is the default. A
synonym is -o rw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --label label <br>
Mount the partition that has the specified label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --uuid uuid <br>
Mount the partition that has the specified uuid. These two
options require the file /proc/partitions (present since
Linux 2.1.116) to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --fstab path <br>
Specifies alternative fstab file. If the path is directory
then the files in the directory are sorted by strverscmp(3),
files that starts with &quot;.&quot; or without .fstab
exten&acirc; <br>
sion are ignored. The option can be specified more than
once. This option is mostly designed for initramfs or chroot
scripts where additional configuration is specified <br>
outside standard system configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that mount(8) does not pass
the option --fstab to /sbin/mount.&lt;type&gt; helpers, it
means that the alternative fstab files will be invisible for
the helpers. This is no <br>
problem for normal mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always
require fstab to verify user&rsquo;s rights.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --types vfstype <br>
The argument following the -t is used to indicate the
filesystem type. The filesystem types which are currently
supported include: adfs, affs, autofs, cifs, coda,
coher&acirc; <br>
ent, cramfs, debugfs, devpts, efs, ext, ext2, ext3, ext4,
hfs, hfsplus, hpfs, iso9660, jfs, minix, msdos, ncpfs, nfs,
nfs4, ntfs, proc, qnx4, ramfs, reiserfs, romfs, <br>
squashfs, smbfs, sysv, tmpfs, ubifs, udf, ufs, umsdos,
usbfs, vfat, xenix, xfs, xiafs. Note that coherent, sysv and
xenix are equivalent and that xenix and coherent will <br>
be removed at some point in the future &acirc; use sysv
instead. Since kernel version 2.1.21 the types ext and xiafs
do not exist anymore. Earlier, usbfs was known as usbdevfs.
<br>
Note, the real list of all supported filesystems depends on
your kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The programs mount and umount
support filesystem subtypes. The subtype is defined by
&rsquo;.subtype&rsquo; suffix. For example
&rsquo;fuse.sshfs&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s recommended to use
subtype nota&acirc; <br>
tion rather than add any prefix to the mount source (for
example &rsquo;sshfs#example.com&rsquo; is depreacated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For most types all the mount
program has to do is issue a simple mount(2) system call,
and no detailed knowledge of the filesystem type is
required. For a few types how&acirc; <br>
ever (like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) ad hoc code is
necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems
have a separate mount program. In order to make it <br>
possible to treat all types in a uniform way, mount will
execute the program /sbin/mount.TYPE (if that exists) when
called with type TYPE. Since various versions of the <br>
smbmount program have different calling conventions,
/sbin/mount.smbfs may have to be a shell script that sets up
the desired call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -t option is given, or if
the auto type is specified, mount will try to guess the
desired type. Mount uses the blkid library for guessing the
filesystem type; if <br>
that does not turn up anything that looks familiar, mount
will try to read the file /etc/filesystems, or, if that does
not exist, /proc/filesystems. All of the filesystem <br>
types listed there will be tried, except for those that are
labeled &quot;nodev&quot; (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). If
/etc/filesystems ends in a line with a single * only, mount
<br>
will read /proc/filesystems afterwards. All of the
filesystem types will be mounted with mount option
&quot;silent&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The auto type may be useful for
user-mounted floppies. Creating a file /etc/filesystems can
be useful to change the probe order (e.g., to try vfat
before msdos or ext3 <br>
before ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More than one type may be
specified in a comma separated list. The list of filesystem
types can be prefixed with no to specify the filesystem
types on which no action <br>
should be taken. (This can be meaningful with the -a
option.) For example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -a -t nomsdos,ext</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mounts all filesystems except
those of type msdos and ext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target dir <br>
If only one argument for the mount command is given then the
argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or
source (device). This option allows to explicitly <br>
define that the argument is mount target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --test-opts opts <br>
Used in conjunction with -a, to limit the set of filesystems
to which the -a is applied. Like -t in this regard except
that it is useless except in the context of -a. <br>
For example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -a -O no_netdev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mounts all filesystems except
those which have the option _netdev specified in the options
field in the /etc/fstab file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is different from -t in that
each option is matched exactly; a leading no at the
beginning of one option does not negate the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t and -O options are
cumulative in effect; that is, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -a -t ext2 -O _netdev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mounts all ext2 filesystems with
the _netdev option, not all filesystems that are either ext2
or have the _netdev option specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --options opts <br>
Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma
separated string of options. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount LABEL=mydisk -o
noatime,nouser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see FILESYSTEM
INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS and FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT
OPTIONS sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --bind <br>
Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are
available in both places). See above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rbind <br>
Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else
(so that its contents are available in both places). See
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --move <br>
Move a subtree to some other place. See above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT
OPTIONS <br>
Some of these options are only useful when they appear in
the /etc/fstab file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of these options could be
enabled or disabled by default in the system kernel. To
check the current setting see the options in /proc/mounts.
Note that filesystems also <br>
have per-filesystem specific default mount options (see for
example tune2fs -l output for extN filesystems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options apply to
any filesystem that is being mounted (but not every
filesystem actually honors them - e.g., the sync option
today has effect only for ext2, ext3, <br>
fat, vfat and ufs):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">async All I/O to the filesystem
should be done asynchronously. (See also the sync
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atime Do not use noatime
feature, then the inode access time is controlled by kernel
defaults. See also the description for strictatime and
relatime mount options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noatime <br>
Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g.,
for faster access on the news spool to speed up news
servers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto Can be mounted with the -a
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noauto Can only be mounted
explicitly (i.e., the -a option will not cause the
filesystem to be mounted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context=context,
fscontext=context, defcontext=context and
rootcontext=context <br>
The context= option is useful when mounting filesystems that
do not support extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard
disk formatted with VFAT, or systems that are not <br>
normally running under SELinux, such as an ext3 formatted
disk from a non-SELinux workstation. You can also use
context= on filesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy.
<br>
It also helps in compatibility with xattr-supporting
filesystems on earlier 2.4.&lt;x&gt; kernel versions. Even
where xattrs are supported, you can save time not having to
label <br>
every file by assigning the entire disk one security
context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A commonly used option for
removable media is
context=&quot;system_u:object_r:removable_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two other options are fscontext=
and defcontext=, both of which are mutually exclusive of the
context option. This means you can use fscontext and
defcontext with each <br>
other, but neither can be used with context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fscontext= option works for
all filesystems, regardless of their xattr support. The
fscontext option sets the overarching filesystem label to a
specific security con&acirc; <br>
text. This filesystem label is separate from the individual
labels on the files. It represents the entire filesystem for
certain kinds of permission checks, such as during <br>
mount or file creation. Individual file labels are still
obtained from the xattrs on the files themselves. The
context option actually sets the aggregate context that <br>
fscontext provides, in addition to supplying the same label
for individual files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can set the default security
context for unlabeled files using defcontext= option. This
overrides the value set for unlabeled files in the policy
and requires a <br>
filesystem that supports xattr labeling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rootcontext= option allows
you to explicitly label the root inode of a FS being mounted
before that FS or inode becomes visible to userspace. This
was found to be <br>
useful for things like stateless linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the kernel rejects any
remount request that includes the context option, even when
unchanged from the current context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the context value might
contain commas, in which case the value has to be properly
quoted, otherwise mount(8) will interpret the comma as a
separator between <br>
mount options. Don&rsquo;t forget that the shell strips off
quotes and thus double quoting is required. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -t tmpfs none /mnt -o
&rsquo;context=&quot;system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c127,c456&quot;,noexec&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see
selinux(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaults <br>
Use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and
async.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the real set of the
all default mount options depends on kernel and filesystem
type. See the begin of this section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev Interpret character or block
special devices on the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodev Do not interpret character
or block special devices on the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diratime <br>
Update directory inode access times on this filesystem. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodiratime <br>
Do not update directory inode access times on this
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirsync <br>
All directory updates within the filesystem should be done
synchronously. This affects the following system calls:
creat, link, unlink, symlink, mkdir, rmdir, mknod and <br>
rename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec Permit execution of
binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noexec Do not allow direct
execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem. (Until
recently it was possible to run binaries anyway using a
command like /lib/ld*.so <br>
/mnt/binary. This trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 /
2.6.0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group Allow an ordinary (i.e.,
non-root) user to mount the filesystem if one of his groups
matches the group of the device. This option implies the
options nosuid and nodev <br>
(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option
line group,dev,suid).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iversion <br>
Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will
be incremented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noiversion <br>
Do not increment the i_version inode field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mand Allow mandatory locks on
this filesystem. See fcntl(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nomand Do not allow mandatory
locks on this filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_netdev <br>
The filesystem resides on a device that requires network
access (used to prevent the system from attempting to mount
these filesystems until the network has been enabled <br>
on the system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nofail Do not report errors for
this device if it does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relatime <br>
Update inode access times relative to modify or change time.
Access time is only updated if the previous access time was
earlier than the current modify or change time. <br>
(Similar to noatime, but doesn&rsquo;t break mutt or other
applications that need to know if a file has been read since
the last time it was modified.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel
defaults to the behavior provided by this option (unless
noatime was specified), and the strictatime option is
required to obtain tradi&acirc; <br>
tional semantics. In addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the
file&rsquo;s last access time is always updated if it is
more than 1 day old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norelatime <br>
Do not use relatime feature. See also the strictatime mount
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strictatime <br>
Allows to explicitly requesting full atime updates. This
makes it possible for kernel to defaults to relatime or
noatime but still allow userspace to override it. For more
<br>
details about the default system mount options see
/proc/mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nostrictatime <br>
Use the kernel&rsquo;s default behaviour for inode access
time updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suid Allow set-user-identifier
or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nosuid Do not allow
set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take
effect. (This seems safe, but is in fact rather unsafe if
you have suidperl(1) installed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">silent Turn on the silent
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loud Turn off the silent
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner Allow an ordinary (i.e.,
non-root) user to mount the filesystem if he is the owner of
the device. This option implies the options nosuid and nodev
(unless overridden by <br>
subsequent options, as in the option line
owner,dev,suid).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remount <br>
Attempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem. This is
commonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem,
especially to make a readonly filesystem writable. It <br>
does not change device or mount point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remount functionality
follows the standard way how the mount command works with
options from fstab. It means the mount command doesn&rsquo;t
read fstab (or mtab) only when a <br>
device and dir are fully specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo
/dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this call all old mount
options are replaced and arbitrary stuff from fstab is
ignored, except the loop= option which is internally
generated and maintained by the <br>
mount command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -o remount,rw /dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this call mount reads
fstab (or mtab) and merges these options with options from
command line ( -o ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ro Mount the filesystem
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rw Mount the filesystem
read-write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync All I/O to the filesystem
should be done synchronously. In case of media with limited
number of write cycles (e.g. some flash drives)
&quot;sync&quot; may cause life-cycle shorten&acirc; <br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user Allow an ordinary user to
mount the filesystem. The name of the mounting user is
written to mtab so that he can unmount the filesystem again.
This option implies the <br>
options noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden by
subsequent options, as in the option line
user,exec,dev,suid).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nouser Forbid an ordinary (i.e.,
non-root) user to mount the filesystem. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">users Allow every user to mount
and unmount the filesystem. This option implies the options
noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden by subsequent
options, as in the option <br>
line users,exec,dev,suid).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x-* All options prefixed with
&quot;x-&quot; are interpreted as comments or userspace
applications specific options. These options are not stored
to mtab file, send to mount.&lt;type&gt; <br>
helpers or mount(2) system call. The suggested format is
x-&lt;appname&gt;.&lt;option&gt; (e.g.
x-systemd.automount).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x-mount.mkdir[=&lt;mode&gt;]
<br>
Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint). The optional
argument &lt;mode&gt; specifies the file system access mode
used for mkdir (2) in octal notation. The default mode is
<br>
0755. This functionality is supported only for root
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT
OPTIONS <br>
The following options apply only to certain filesystems. We
sort them by filesystem. They all follow the -o flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What options are supported
depends a bit on the running kernel. More info may be found
in the kernel source subdirectory
Documentation/filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for adfs <br>
uid=value and gid=value <br>
Set the owner and group of the files in the filesystem
(default: uid=gid=0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ownmask=value and othmask=value
<br>
Set the permission mask for ADFS &rsquo;owner&rsquo;
permissions and &rsquo;other&rsquo; permissions,
respectively (default: 0700 and 0077, respectively). See
also /usr/src/linux/Documenta&acirc; <br>
tion/filesystems/adfs.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for affs <br>
uid=value and gid=value <br>
Set the owner and group of the root of the filesystem
(default: uid=gid=0, but with option uid or gid without
specified value, the uid and gid of the current process are
<br>
taken).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setuid=value and setgid=value
<br>
Set the owner and group of all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode=value <br>
Set the mode of all files to value &amp; 0777 disregarding
the original permissions. Add search permission to
directories that have read permission. The value is given in
<br>
octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protect <br>
Do not allow any changes to the protection bits on the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usemp Set uid and gid of the
root of the filesystem to the uid and gid of the mount point
upon the first sync or umount, and then clear this option.
Strange...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
Print an informational message for each successful
mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefix=string <br>
Prefix used before volume name, when following a link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volume=string <br>
Prefix (of length at most 30) used before &rsquo;/&rsquo;
when following a symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reserved=value <br>
(Default: 2.) Number of unused blocks at the start of the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root=value <br>
Give explicitly the location of the root block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs=value <br>
Give blocksize. Allowed values are 512, 1024, 2048,
4096.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grpquota|noquota|quota|usrquota
<br>
These options are accepted but ignored. (However, quota
utilities may react to such strings in /etc/fstab.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for cifs <br>
See the options section of the mount.cifs(8) man page
(cifs-utils package must be installed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for coherent <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for debugfs <br>
The debugfs filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally
mounted on /sys/kernel/debug. As of kernel version 3.4,
debugfs has the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid=n, gid=n <br>
Set the owner and group of the mountpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode=value <br>
Sets the mode of the mountpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for devpts <br>
The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally
mounted on /dev/pts. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal,
a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
ter&acirc; <br>
minal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
terminal slave can be accessed as
/dev/pts/&lt;number&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid=value and gid=value <br>
This sets the owner or the group of newly created PTYs to
the specified values. When nothing is specified, they will
be set to the UID and GID of the creating process. <br>
For example, if there is a tty group with GID 5, then gid=5
will cause newly created PTYs to belong to the tty
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode=value <br>
Set the mode of newly created PTYs to the specified value.
The default is 0600. A value of mode=620 and gid=5 makes
&quot;mesg y&quot; the default on newly created PTYs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newinstance <br>
Create a private instance of devpts filesystem, such that
indices of ptys allocated in this new instance are
independent of indices created in other instances of
devpts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All mounts of devpts without
this newinstance option share the same set of pty indices
(i.e legacy mode). Each mount of devpts with the newinstance
option has a private <br>
set of pty indices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mainly used to
support containers in the linux kernel. It is implemented in
linux kernel versions starting with 2.6.29. Further, this
mount option is valid <br>
only if CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the
kernel configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this option effectively,
/dev/ptmx must be a symbolic link to pts/ptmx. See
Documentation/filesystems/devpts.txt in the linux kernel
source tree for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptmxmode=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the mode for the new ptmx
device node in the devpts filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the support for multiple
instances of devpts (see newinstance option above), each
instance has a private ptmx node in the root of the devpts
filesystem (typically <br>
/dev/pts/ptmx).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of the kernel, the default mode of the new ptmx
node is 0000. ptmxmode=value specifies a more useful mode
for the ptmx node and is <br>
highly recommended when the newinstance option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only implemented
in linux kernel versions starting with 2.6.29. Further this
option is valid only if CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is
enabled in the ker&acirc; <br>
nel configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ext <br>
None. Note that the &lsquo;ext&rsquo; filesystem is
obsolete. Don&rsquo;t use it. Since Linux version 2.1.21
extfs is no longer part of the kernel source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ext2 <br>
The &lsquo;ext2&rsquo; filesystem is the standard Linux
filesystem. Since Linux 2.5.46, for most mount options the
default is determined by the filesystem superblock. Set them
with <br>
tune2fs(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acl|noacl <br>
Support POSIX Access Control Lists (or not).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsddf|minixdf <br>
Set the behaviour for the statfs system call. The minixdf
behaviour is to return in the f_blocks field the total
number of blocks of the filesystem, while the bsddf
behav&acirc; <br>
iour (which is the default) is to subtract the overhead
blocks used by the ext2 filesystem and not available for
file storage. Thus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mount /k -o minixdf; df /k;
umount /k <br>
Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on
<br>
/dev/sda6 2630655 86954 2412169 3% /k <br>
% mount /k -o bsddf; df /k; umount /k <br>
Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on
<br>
/dev/sda6 2543714 13 2412169 0% /k</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that this example shows
that one can add command line options to the options given
in /etc/fstab.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check=none or nocheck <br>
No checking is done at mount time. This is the default. This
is fast. It is wise to invoke e2fsck(8) every now and then,
e.g. at boot time. The non-default behavior is <br>
unsupported (check=normal and check=strict options have been
removed). Note that these mount options don&rsquo;t have to
be supported if ext4 kernel driver is used for ext2 and <br>
ext3 filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Print debugging info upon
each (re)mount.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">errors={continue|remount-ro|panic}
<br>
Define the behaviour when an error is encountered. (Either
ignore errors and just mark the filesystem erroneous and
continue, or remount the filesystem read-only, or <br>
panic and halt the system.) The default is set in the
filesystem superblock, and can be changed using
tune2fs(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grpid|bsdgroups and
nogrpid|sysvgroups <br>
These options define what group id a newly created file
gets. When grpid is set, it takes the group id of the
directory in which it is created; otherwise (the default) it
<br>
takes the fsgid of the current process, unless the directory
has the setgid bit set, in which case it takes the gid from
the parent directory, and also gets the setgid bit <br>
set if it is a directory itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grpquota|noquota|quota|usrquota
<br>
The usrquota (same as quota) mount option enables user quota
support on the filesystem. grpquota enables group quotas
support. You need the quota utilities to actually <br>
enable and manage the quota system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nouid32 <br>
Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs. This is for interoperability
with older kernels which only store and expect 16-bit
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oldalloc or orlov <br>
Use old allocator or Orlov allocator for new inodes. Orlov
is default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resgid=n and resuid=n <br>
The ext2 filesystem reserves a certain percentage of the
available space (by default 5%, see mke2fs(8) and
tune2fs(8)). These options determine who can use the
reserved <br>
blocks. (Roughly: whoever has the specified uid, or belongs
to the specified group.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sb=n Instead of block 1, use
block n as superblock. This could be useful when the
filesystem has been damaged. (Earlier, copies of the
superblock would be made every 8192 <br>
blocks: in block 1, 8193, 16385, ... (and one got thousands
of copies on a big filesystem). Since version 1.08, mke2fs
has a -s (sparse superblock) option to reduce the <br>
number of backup superblocks, and since version 1.15 this is
the default. Note that this may mean that ext2 filesystems
created by a recent mke2fs cannot be mounted r/w <br>
under Linux 2.0.*.) The block number here uses 1k units.
Thus, if you want to use logical block 32768 on a filesystem
with 4k blocks, use &quot;sb=131072&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_xattr|nouser_xattr <br>
Support &quot;user.&quot; extended attributes (or not).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ext3 <br>
The ext3 filesystem is a version of the ext2 filesystem
which has been enhanced with journaling. It supports the
same options as ext2 as well as the following additions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal=update <br>
Update the ext3 filesystem&rsquo;s journal to the current
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal=inum <br>
When a journal already exists, this option is ignored.
Otherwise, it specifies the number of the inode which will
represent the ext3 filesystem&rsquo;s journal file; ext3
will <br>
create a new journal, overwriting the old contents of the
file whose inode number is inum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_dev=devnum <br>
When the external journal device&rsquo;s major/minor numbers
have changed, this option allows the user to specify the new
journal location. The journal device is identified <br>
through its new major/minor numbers encoded in devnum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norecovery/noload <br>
Don&rsquo;t load the journal on mounting. Note that if the
filesystem was not unmounted cleanly, skipping the journal
replay will lead to the filesystem containing
inconsisten&acirc; <br>
cies that can lead to any number of problems.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">data={journal|ordered|writeback}
<br>
Specifies the journaling mode for file data. Metadata is
always journaled. To use modes other than ordered on the
root filesystem, pass the mode to the kernel as boot <br>
parameter, e.g. rootflags=data=journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal <br>
All data is committed into the journal prior to being
written into the main filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ordered <br>
This is the default mode. All data is forced directly out to
the main file system prior to its metadata being committed
to the journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writeback <br>
Data ordering is not preserved - data may be written into
the main filesystem after its metadata has been committed to
the journal. This is rumoured to be the <br>
highest-throughput option. It guarantees internal filesystem
integrity, however it can allow old data to appear in files
after a crash and journal recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">barrier=0 / barrier=1 <br>
This enables/disables barriers. barrier=0 disables it,
barrier=1 enables it. Write barriers enforce proper on-disk
ordering of journal commits, making volatile disk <br>
write caches safe to use, at some performance penalty. The
ext3 filesystem does not enable write barriers by default.
Be sure to enable barriers unless your disks are <br>
battery-backed one way or another. Otherwise you risk
filesystem corruption in case of power failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit=nrsec <br>
Sync all data and metadata every nrsec seconds. The default
value is 5 seconds. Zero means default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_xattr <br>
Enable Extended User Attributes. See the attr(5) manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acl Enable POSIX Access Control
Lists. See the acl(5) manual page.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">usrjquota=aquota.user|grpjquota=aquota.group|jqfmt=vfsv0
<br>
Apart from the old quota system (as in ext2, jqfmt=vfsold
aka version 1 quota) ext3 also supports journaled quotas
(version 2 quota). jqfmt=vfsv0 enables journaled quotas.
<br>
For journaled quotas the mount options usrjquota=aquota.user
and grpjquota=aquota.group are required to tell the quota
system which quota database files to use. Journaled <br>
quotas have the advantage that even after a crash no quota
check is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ext4 <br>
The ext4 filesystem is an advanced level of the ext3
filesystem which incorporates scalability and reliability
enhancements for supporting large filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options journal_dev, noload,
data, commit, orlov, oldalloc, [no]user_xattr [no]acl,
bsddf, minixdf, debug, errors, data_err, grpid, bsdgroups,
nogrpid sysvgroups, resgid, <br>
resuid, sb, quota, noquota, grpquota, usrquota usrjquota,
grpjquota and jqfmt are backwardly compatible with ext3 or
ext2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_checksum <br>
Enable checksumming of the journal transactions. This will
allow the recovery code in e2fsck and the kernel to detect
corruption in the kernel. It is a compatible change <br>
and will be ignored by older kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_async_commit <br>
Commit block can be written to disk without waiting for
descriptor blocks. If enabled older kernels cannot mount the
device. This will enable &rsquo;journal_checksum&rsquo;
inter&acirc; <br>
nally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">barrier=0 / barrier=1 / barrier
/ nobarrier <br>
This enables/disables the use of write barriers in the jbd
code. barrier=0 disables, barrier=1 enables. This also
requires an IO stack which can support barriers, and if <br>
jbd gets an error on a barrier write, it will disable again
with a warning. Write barriers enforce proper on-disk
ordering of journal commits, making volatile disk write <br>
caches safe to use, at some performance penalty. If your
disks are battery-backed in one way or another, disabling
barriers may safely improve performance. The mount <br>
options &quot;barrier&quot; and &quot;nobarrier&quot; can
also be used to enable or disable barriers, for consistency
with other ext4 mount options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ext4 filesystem enables
write barriers by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inode_readahead_blks=n <br>
This tuning parameter controls the maximum number of inode
table blocks that ext4&rsquo;s inode table readahead
algorithm will pre-read into the buffer cache. The value
must be <br>
a power of 2. The default value is 32 blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stripe=n <br>
Number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will try to use for
allocation size and alignment. For RAID5/6 systems this
should be the number of data disks * RAID chunk size <br>
in filesystem blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delalloc <br>
Deferring block allocation until write-out time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodelalloc <br>
Disable delayed allocation. Blocks are allocated when data
is copied from user to page cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_batch_time=usec <br>
Maximum amount of time ext4 should wait for additional
filesystem operations to be batch together with a
synchronous write operation. Since a synchronous write
operation <br>
is going to force a commit and then a wait for the I/O
complete, it doesn&rsquo;t cost much, and can be a huge
throughput win, we wait for a small amount of time to see if
any <br>
other transactions can piggyback on the synchronous write.
The algorithm used is designed to automatically tune for the
speed of the disk, by measuring the amount of time <br>
(on average) that it takes to finish committing a
transaction. Call this time the &quot;commit time&quot;. If
the time that the transaction has been running is less than
the commit <br>
time, ext4 will try sleeping for the commit time to see if
other operations will join the transaction. The commit time
is capped by the max_batch_time, which defaults to <br>
15000us (15ms). This optimization can be turned off entirely
by setting max_batch_time to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min_batch_time=usec <br>
This parameter sets the commit time (as described above) to
be at least min_batch_time. It defaults to zero
microseconds. Increasing this parameter may improve the <br>
throughput of multi-threaded, synchronous workloads on very
fast disks, at the cost of increasing latency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">journal_ioprio=prio <br>
The I/O priority (from 0 to 7, where 0 is the highest
priority) which should be used for I/O operations submitted
by kjournald2 during a commit operation. This defaults <br>
to 3, which is a slightly higher priority than the default
I/O priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abort Simulate the effects of
calling ext4_abort() for debugging purposes. This is
normally used while remounting a filesystem which is already
mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_da_alloc|noauto_da_alloc
<br>
Many broken applications don&rsquo;t use fsync() when
replacing existing files via patterns such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fd =
open(&quot;foo.new&quot;)/write(fd,..)/close(fd)/
rename(&quot;foo.new&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or worse yet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fd = open(&quot;foo&quot;,
O_TRUNC)/write(fd,..)/close(fd).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If auto_da_alloc is enabled,
ext4 will detect the replace-via-rename and
replace-via-truncate patterns and force that any delayed
allocation blocks are allocated such that <br>
at the next journal commit, in the default data=ordered
mode, the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk
before the rename() operation is committed. This provides
<br>
roughly the same level of guarantees as ext3, and avoids the
&quot;zero-length&quot; problem that can happen when a
system crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are
forced to <br>
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard/nodiscard <br>
Controls whether ext4 should issue discard/TRIM commands to
the underlying block device when blocks are freed. This is
useful for SSD devices and sparse/thinly-provi&acirc; <br>
sioned LUNs, but it is off by default until sufficient
testing has been done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nouid32 <br>
Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs. This is for interoperability
with older kernels which only store and expect 16-bit
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize Allows to resize
filesystem to the end of the last existing block group,
further resize has to be done with resize2fs either online,
or offline. It can be used only with <br>
conjunction with remount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block_validity/noblock_validity
<br>
This options allows to enables/disables the in-kernel
facility for tracking filesystem metadata blocks within
internal data structures. This allows multi- block allocator
<br>
and other routines to quickly locate extents which might
overlap with filesystem metadata blocks. This option is
intended for debugging purposes and since it negatively <br>
affects the performance, it is off by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dioread_lock/dioread_nolock <br>
Controls whether or not ext4 should use the DIO read
locking. If the dioread_nolock option is specified ext4 will
allocate uninitialized extent before buffer write and <br>
convert the extent to initialized after IO completes. This
approach allows ext4 code to avoid using inode mutex, which
improves scalability on high speed storages. How&acirc; <br>
ever this does not work with data journaling and
dioread_nolock option will be ignored with kernel warning.
Note that dioread_nolock code path is only used for extent-
<br>
based files. Because of the restrictions this options
comprises it is off by default (e.g. dioread_lock).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i_version <br>
Enable 64-bit inode version support. This option is off by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for fat <br>
(Note: fat is not a separate filesystem, but a common part
of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blocksize={512|1024|2048} <br>
Set blocksize (default 512). This option is obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid=value and gid=value <br>
Set the owner and group of all files. (Default: the uid and
gid of the current process.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask=value <br>
Set the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are not
present). The default is the umask of the current process.
The value is given in octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmask=value <br>
Set the umask applied to directories only. The default is
the umask of the current process. The value is given in
octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fmask=value <br>
Set the umask applied to regular files only. The default is
the umask of the current process. The value is given in
octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_utime=value <br>
This option controls the permission check of
mtime/atime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">20 If current process is in
group of file&rsquo;s group ID, you can change
timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Other users can change
timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is set from
&lsquo;dmask&rsquo; option. (If the directory is writable,
utime(2) is also allowed. I.e. ~dmask &amp; 022)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally utime(2) checks current
process is owner of the file, or it has CAP_FOWNER
capability. But FAT filesystem doesn&rsquo;t have uid/gid on
disk, so normal check is too <br>
inflexible. With this option you can relax it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check=value <br>
Three different levels of pickyness can be chosen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r[elaxed] <br>
Upper and lower case are accepted and equivalent, long name
parts are truncated (e.g. verylongname.foobar becomes
verylong.foo), leading and embedded spaces are <br>
accepted in each name part (name and extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n[ormal] <br>
Like &quot;relaxed&quot;, but many special characters (*, ?,
&lt;, spaces, etc.) are rejected. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s[trict] <br>
Like &quot;normal&quot;, but names may not contain long
parts and special characters that are sometimes used on
Linux, but are not accepted by MS-DOS are rejected. (+, =,
<br>
spaces, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">codepage=value <br>
Sets the codepage for converting to shortname characters on
FAT and VFAT filesystems. By default, codepage 437 is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conv={b[inary]|t[ext]|a[uto]}
<br>
The fat filesystem can perform CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL (MS-DOS text
format to UNIX text format) conversion in the kernel. The
following conversion modes are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary no translation is
performed. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL
translation is performed on all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL
translation is performed on all files that don&rsquo;t have
a &quot;well-known binary&quot; extension. The list of known
extensions can be found at the beginning of <br>
fs/fat/misc.c (as of 2.0, the list is: exe, com, bin, app,
sys, drv, ovl, ovr, obj, lib, dll, pif, arc, zip, lha, lzh,
zoo, tar, z, arj, tz, taz, tzp, tpz, gz, tgz, <br>
deb, gif, bmp, tif, gl, jpg, pcx, tfm, vf, gf, pk, pxl,
dvi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Programs that do computed lseeks
won&rsquo;t like in-kernel text conversion. Several people
have had their data ruined by this translation. Beware!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For filesystems mounted in
binary mode, a conversion tool (fromdos/todos) is available.
This option is obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvf_format=module <br>
Forces the driver to use the CVF (Compressed Volume File)
module cvf_module instead of auto-detection. If the kernel
supports kmod, the cvf_format=xxx option also controls <br>
on-demand CVF module loading. This option is obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvf_option=option <br>
Option passed to the CVF module. This option is
obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Turn on the debug flag. A
version string and a list of filesystem parameters will be
printed (these data are also printed if the parameters
appear to be inconsistent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard <br>
If set, causes discard/TRIM commands to be issued to the
block device when blocks are freed. This is useful for SSD
devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fat={12|16|32} <br>
Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat. This overrides the automatic
FAT type detection routine. Use with caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iocharset=value <br>
Character set to use for converting between 8 bit characters
and 16 bit Unicode characters. The default is iso8859-1.
Long filenames are stored on disk in Unicode format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nfs If set, enables in-memory
indexing of directory inodes to reduce the frequency of
ESTALE errors in NFS client operations. Useful only when the
filesystem is exported via <br>
NFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tz=UTC This option disables the
conversion of timestamps between local time (as used by
Windows on FAT) and UTC (which Linux uses internally). This
is particularly useful when <br>
mounting devices (like digital cameras) that are set to UTC
in order to avoid the pitfalls of local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet Turn on the quiet flag.
Attempts to chown or chmod files do not return errors,
although they fail. Use with caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showexec <br>
If set, the execute permission bits of the file will be
allowed only if the extension part of the name is .EXE,
.COM, or .BAT. Not set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sys_immutable <br>
If set, ATTR_SYS attribute on FAT is handled as IMMUTABLE
flag on Linux. Not set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush If set, the filesystem
will try to flush to disk more early than normal. Not set by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usefree <br>
Use the &quot;free clusters&quot; value stored on FSINFO.
It&rsquo;ll be used to determine number of free clusters
without scanning disk. But it&rsquo;s not used by default,
because recent Win&acirc; <br>
dows don&rsquo;t update it correctly in some case. If you
are sure the &quot;free clusters&quot; on FSINFO is correct,
by this option you can avoid scanning disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dots, nodots, dotsOK=[yes|no]
<br>
Various misguided attempts to force Unix or DOS conventions
onto a FAT filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for hfs <br>
creator=cccc, type=cccc <br>
Set the creator/type values as shown by the MacOS finder
used for creating new files. Default values:
&rsquo;????&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid=n, gid=n <br>
Set the owner and group of all files. (Default: the uid and
gid of the current process.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir_umask=n, file_umask=n,
umask=n <br>
Set the umask used for all directories, all regular files,
or all files and directories. Defaults to the umask of the
current process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session=n <br>
Select the CDROM session to mount. Defaults to leaving that
decision to the CDROM driver. This option will fail with
anything but a CDROM as underlying device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">part=n Select partition number n
from the device. Only makes sense for CDROMs. Defaults to
not parsing the partition table at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet Don&rsquo;t complain about
invalid mount options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for hpfs <br>
uid=value and gid=value <br>
Set the owner and group of all files. (Default: the uid and
gid of the current process.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask=value <br>
Set the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are not
present). The default is the umask of the current process.
The value is given in octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case={lower|asis} <br>
Convert all files names to lower case, or leave them.
(Default: case=lower.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conv={binary|text|auto} <br>
For conv=text, delete some random CRs (in particular, all
followed by NL) when reading a file. For conv=auto, choose
more or less at random between conv=binary and <br>
conv=text. For conv=binary, just read what is in the file.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocheck <br>
Do not abort mounting when certain consistency checks
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for iso9660 <br>
ISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to
be used on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on
some DVDs. See also the udf filesystem.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal iso9660 filenames appear
in a 8.3 format (i.e., DOS-like restrictions on filename
length), and in addition all characters are in upper case.
Also there is no field for <br>
file ownership, protection, number of links, provision for
block/character devices, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rock Ridge is an extension to
iso9660 that provides all of these UNIX-like features.
Basically there are extensions to each directory record that
supply all of the additional <br>
information, and when Rock Ridge is in use, the filesystem
is indistinguishable from a normal UNIX filesystem (except
that it is read-only, of course).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norock Disable the use of Rock
Ridge extensions, even if available. Cf. map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nojoliet <br>
Disable the use of Microsoft Joliet extensions, even if
available. Cf. map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check={r[elaxed]|s[trict]} <br>
With check=relaxed, a filename is first converted to lower
case before doing the lookup. This is probably only
meaningful together with norock and map=normal. (Default:
<br>
check=strict.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid=value and gid=value <br>
Give all files in the filesystem the indicated user or group
id, possibly overriding the information found in the Rock
Ridge extensions. (Default: uid=0,gid=0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">map={n[ormal]|o[ff]|a[corn]}
<br>
For non-Rock Ridge volumes, normal name translation maps
upper to lower case ASCII, drops a trailing
&lsquo;;1&rsquo;, and converts &lsquo;;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;.&rsquo;. With map=off no name translation is <br>
done. See norock. (Default: map=normal.) map=acorn is like
map=normal but also apply Acorn extensions if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode=value <br>
For non-Rock Ridge volumes, give all files the indicated
mode. (Default: read permission for everybody.) Since Linux
2.1.37 one no longer needs to specify the mode in <br>
decimal. (Octal is indicated by a leading 0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unhide Also show hidden and
associated files. (If the ordinary files and the associated
or hidden files have the same filenames, this may make the
ordinary files inaccessible.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block={512|1024|2048} <br>
Set the block size to the indicated value. (Default:
block=1024.)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">conv={a[uto]|b[inary]|m[text]|t[ext]}
<br>
(Default: conv=binary.) Since Linux 1.3.54 this option has
no effect anymore. (And non-binary settings used to be very
dangerous, possibly leading to silent data corrup&acirc;
<br>
tion.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cruft If the high byte of the
file length contains other garbage, set this mount option to
ignore the high order bits of the file length. This implies
that a file cannot be <br>
larger than 16MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session=x <br>
Select number of session on multisession CD. (Since
2.3.4.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sbsector=xxx <br>
Session begins from sector xxx. (Since 2.3.4.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are the
same as for vfat and specifying them only makes sense when
using discs encoded using Microsoft&rsquo;s Joliet
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iocharset=value <br>
Character set to use for converting 16 bit Unicode
characters on CD to 8 bit characters. The default is
iso8859-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8 Convert 16 bit Unicode
characters on CD to UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for jfs <br>
iocharset=name <br>
Character set to use for converting from Unicode to ASCII.
The default is to do no conversion. Use iocharset=utf8 for
UTF8 translations. This requires CONFIG_NLS_UTF8 <br>
to be set in the kernel .config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize=value <br>
Resize the volume to value blocks. JFS only supports growing
a volume, not shrinking it. This option is only valid during
a remount, when the volume is mounted read-write. <br>
The resize keyword with no value will grow the volume to the
full size of the partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nointegrity <br>
Do not write to the journal. The primary use of this option
is to allow for higher performance when restoring a volume
from backup media. The integrity of the volume is <br>
not guaranteed if the system abnormally ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integrity <br>
Default. Commit metadata changes to the journal. Use this
option to remount a volume where the nointegrity option was
previously specified in order to restore normal <br>
behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">errors={continue|remount-ro|panic}
<br>
Define the behaviour when an error is encountered. (Either
ignore errors and just mark the filesystem erroneous and
continue, or remount the filesystem read-only, or <br>
panic and halt the system.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noquota|quota|usrquota|grpquota
<br>
These options are accepted but ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for minix <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for msdos <br>
See mount options for fat. If the msdos filesystem detects
an inconsistency, it reports an error and sets the file
system read-only. The filesystem can be made writable again
by <br>
remounting it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ncpfs <br>
Just like nfs, the ncpfs implementation expects a binary
argument (a struct ncp_mount_data) to the mount system call.
This argument is constructed by ncpmount(8) and the current
<br>
version of mount (2.12) does not know anything about
ncpfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for nfs and nfs4
<br>
See the options section of the nfs(5) man page (nfs-utils
package must be installed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nfs and nfs4 implementation
expects a binary argument (a struct nfs_mount_data) to the
mount system call. This argument is constructed by

of mount (2.13) does not know anything about nfs and
nfs4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ntfs <br>
iocharset=name <br>
Character set to use when returning file names. Unlike VFAT,
NTFS suppresses names that contain nonconvertible
characters. Deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nls=name <br>
New name for the option earlier called iocharset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8 Use UTF-8 for converting
file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uni_xlate={0|1|2} <br>
For 0 (or &lsquo;no&rsquo; or &lsquo;false&rsquo;), do not
use escape sequences for unknown Unicode characters. For 1
(or &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;true&rsquo;) or 2, use
vfat-style 4-byte escape sequences starting <br>
with &quot;:&quot;. Here 2 give a little-endian encoding and
1 a byteswapped bigendian encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">posix=[0|1] <br>
If enabled (posix=1), the filesystem distinguishes between
upper and lower case. The 8.3 alias names are presented as
hard links instead of being suppressed. This option <br>
is obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid=value, gid=value and
umask=value <br>
Set the file permission on the filesystem. The umask value
is given in octal. By default, the files are owned by root
and not readable by somebody else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for proc <br>
uid=value and gid=value <br>
These options are recognized, but have no effect as far as I
can see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ramfs <br>
Ramfs is a memory based filesystem. Mount it and you have
it. Unmount it and it is gone. Present since Linux
2.3.99pre4. There are no mount options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for reiserfs <br>
Reiserfs is a journaling filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conv Instructs version 3.6
reiserfs software to mount a version 3.5 filesystem, using

will no longer be compatible <br>
with reiserfs 3.5 tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash={rupasov|tea|r5|detect}
<br>
Choose which hash function reiserfs will use to find files
within directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rupasov <br>
A hash invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov. It is fast and
preserves locality, mapping lexicographically close file
names to close hash values. This option should not be <br>
used, as it causes a high probability of hash
collisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tea A Davis-Meyer function
implemented by Jeremy Fitzhardinge. It uses hash permuting
bits in the name. It gets high randomness and, therefore,
low probability of <br>
hash collisions at some CPU cost. This may be used if
EHASHCOLLISION errors are experienced with the r5 hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r5 A modified version of the
rupasov hash. It is used by default and is the best choice
unless the filesystem has huge directories and unusual
file-name patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detect Instructs mount to detect
which hash function is in use by examining the filesystem
being mounted, and to write this information into the
reiserfs superblock. This <br>
is only useful on the first mount of an old format
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hashed_relocation <br>
Tunes the block allocator. This may provide performance
improvements in some situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_unhashed_relocation <br>
Tunes the block allocator. This may provide performance
improvements in some situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noborder <br>
Disable the border allocator algorithm invented by Yury Yu.
Rupasov. This may provide performance improvements in some
situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nolog Disable journaling. This
will provide slight performance improvements in some
situations at the cost of losing reiserfs&rsquo;s fast
recovery from crashes. Even with this <br>
option turned on, reiserfs still performs all journaling
operations, save for actual writes into its journaling area.
Implementation of nolog is a work in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notail By default, reiserfs
stores small files and &lsquo;file tails&rsquo; directly
into its tree. This confuses some utilities such as LILO(8).
This option is used to disable packing of <br>
files into the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">replayonly <br>
Replay the transactions which are in the journal, but do not
actually mount the filesystem. Mainly used by
reiserfsck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize=number <br>
A remount option which permits online expansion of reiserfs
partitions. Instructs reiserfs to assume that the device has
number blocks. This option is designed for use <br>
with devices which are under logical volume management
(LVM). There is a special resizer utility which can be
obtained from ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_xattr <br>
Enable Extended User Attributes. See the attr(5) manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acl Enable POSIX Access Control
Lists. See the acl(5) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">barrier=none / barrier=flush
<br>
This enables/disables the use of write barriers in the
journaling code. barrier=none disables it, barrier=flush
enables it. Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering
<br>
of journal commits, making volatile disk write caches safe
to use, at some performance penalty. The reiserfs filesystem
does not enable write barriers by default. Be sure <br>

way or another. Otherwise you risk filesystem corruption in
case of power failure.</p>

None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for squashfs <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for smbfs <br>
Just like nfs, the smbfs implementation expects a binary
argument (a struct smb_mount_data) to the mount system call.
This argument is constructed by smbmount(8) and the current
<br>
version of mount (2.12) does not know anything about
smbfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for sysv <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for tmpfs <br>
size=nbytes <br>
Override default maximum size of the filesystem. The size is
given in bytes, and rounded up to entire pages. The default
is half of the memory. The size parameter also <br>
accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that
percentage of your physical RAM: the default, when neither
size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nr_blocks= <br>
The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nr_inodes= <br>
The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default
is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a
machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM <br>
pages, whichever is the lower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tmpfs mount options for
sizing ( size, nr_blocks, and nr_inodes) accept a suffix k,
m or g for Ki, Mi, Gi (binary kilo, mega and giga) and can
be changed on remount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode= Set initial permissions of
the root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid= The user id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gid= The group id.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpol=[default|prefer:Node|bind:NodeList|interleave|interleave:NodeList]
<br>
Set the NUMA memory allocation policy for all files in that
instance (if the kernel CONFIG_NUMA is enabled) - which can
be adjusted on the fly via &rsquo;mount -o remount
...&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
prefers to allocate memory from the local node</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefer:Node <br>
prefers to allocate memory from the given Node</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind:NodeList <br>
allocates memory only from nodes in NodeList</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interleave <br>
prefers to allocate from each node in turn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interleave:NodeList <br>
allocates from each node of NodeList in turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NodeList format is a
comma-separated list of decimal numbers and ranges, a range
being two hyphen-separated decimal numbers, the smallest and
largest node numbers in <br>
the range. For example, mpol=bind:0-3,5,7,9-15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that trying to mount a
tmpfs with an mpol option will fail if the running kernel
does not support NUMA; and will fail if its nodelist
specifies a node which is not <br>
online. If your system relies on that tmpfs being mounted,
but from time to time runs a kernel built without NUMA
capability (perhaps a safe recovery kernel), or with <br>
fewer nodes online, then it is advisable to omit the mpol
option from automatic mount options. It can be added later,
when the tmpfs is already mounted on MountPoint, by <br>
&rsquo;mount -o remount,mpol=Policy:NodeList
MountPoint&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ubifs <br>
UBIFS is a flash file system which works on top of UBI
volumes. Note that atime is not supported and is always
turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device name may be specified
as <br>
ubiX_Y UBI device number X, volume number Y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ubiY UBI device number 0, volume

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ubiX:NAME <br>
UBI device number X, volume with name NAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ubi:NAME <br>
UBI device number 0, volume with name NAME <br>
Alternative ! separator may be used instead of :.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following mount options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bulk_read <br>
Enable bulk-read. VFS read-ahead is disabled because it
slows down the file system. Bulk-Read is an internal
optimization. Some flashes may read faster if the data are
<br>
read at one go, rather than at several read requests. For
example, OneNAND can do &quot;read-while-load&quot; if it
reads more than one NAND page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_bulk_read <br>
Do not bulk-read. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chk_data_crc <br>
Check data CRC-32 checksums. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_chk_data_crc. <br>
Do not check data CRC-32 checksums. With this option, the
filesystem does not check CRC-32 checksum for data, but it
does check it for the internal indexing information. <br>
This option only affects reading, not writing. CRC-32 is
always calculated when writing the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compr={none|lzo|zlib} <br>
Select the default compressor which is used when new files
are written. It is still possible to read compressed files
if mounted with the none option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for udf <br>
udf is the &quot;Universal Disk Format&quot; filesystem

<p style="margin-top: 1em">partition= <br>
Override the PartitionDesc location. (unused)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lastblock= <br>

Override the fileset block location. (unused)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootdir= <br>
Override the root directory location. (unused)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for ufs <br>
ufstype=value <br>
UFS is a filesystem widely used in different operating
systems. The problem are differences among implementations.
Features of some implementations are undocumented, so <br>
its hard to recognize the type of ufs automatically.
That&rsquo;s why the user must specify the type of ufs by
mount option. Possible values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old Old format of ufs, this is
the default, read only. (Don&rsquo;t forget to give the -r
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">44bsd For filesystems created by
a BSD-like system (NetBSD,FreeBSD,OpenBSD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ufs2 Used in FreeBSD 5.x
supported as read-write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5xbsd Synonym for ufs2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sun For filesystems created by
SunOS or Solaris on Sparc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sunx86 For filesystems created
by Solaris on x86.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hp For filesystems created by
HP-UX, read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nextstep <br>
For filesystems created by NeXTStep (on NeXT station)
(currently read only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nextstep-cd <br>
For NextStep CDROMs (block_size == 2048), read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openstep <br>
For filesystems created by OpenStep (currently read only).
The same filesystem type is also used by Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onerror=value <br>
Set behaviour on error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">panic If an error is
encountered, cause a kernel panic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[lock|umount|repair] <br>
These mount options don&rsquo;t do anything at present; when
an error is encountered only a console message is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for umsdos <br>
See mount options for msdos. The dotsOK option is explicitly
killed by umsdos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for vfat <br>
First of all, the mount options for fat are recognized. The
dotsOK option is explicitly killed by vfat. Furthermore,
there are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uni_xlate <br>
Translate unhandled Unicode characters to special escaped
sequences. This lets you backup and restore filenames that
are created with any Unicode characters. Without this <br>
option, a &rsquo;?&rsquo; is used when no translation is
possible. The escape character is &rsquo;:&rsquo; because it
is otherwise illegal on the vfat filesystem. The escape
sequence that gets <br>
used, where u is the unicode character, is: &rsquo;:&rsquo;,
(u &amp; 0x3f), ((u&gt;&gt;6) &amp; 0x3f),
(u&gt;&gt;12).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">posix Allow two files with names
that only differ in case. This option is obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nonumtail <br>
First try to make a short name without sequence number,
before trying name~num.ext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8 UTF8 is the filesystem safe
8-bit encoding of Unicode that is used by the console. It
can be enabled for the filesystem with this option or
disabled with utf8=0, utf8=no <br>
or utf8=false. If &lsquo;uni_xlate&rsquo; gets set, UTF8
gets disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">shortname={lower|win95|winnt|mixed}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines the behaviour for
creation and display of filenames which fit into 8.3
characters. If a long name for a file exists, it will always
be preferred display. There are <br>
four modes: :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lower Force the short name to
lower case upon display; store a long name when the short
name is not all upper case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">win95 Force the short name to
upper case upon display; store a long name when the short
name is not all upper case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">winnt Display the shortname as
is; store a long name when the short name is not all lower
case or all upper case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mixed Display the short name as
is; store a long name when the short name is not all upper
case. This mode is the default since Linux 2.6.32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for usbfs <br>
devuid=uid and devgid=gid and devmode=mode <br>
Set the owner and group and mode of the device files in the
usbfs filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0644). The mode
is given in octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">busuid=uid and busgid=gid and
busmode=mode <br>
Set the owner and group and mode of the bus directories in
the usbfs filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0555). The
mode is given in octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listuid=uid and listgid=gid and
listmode=mode <br>
Set the owner and group and mode of the file devices
(default: uid=gid=0, mode=0444). The mode is given in
octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for xenix <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for xfs <br>
allocsize=size <br>
Sets the buffered I/O end-of-file preallocation size when
doing delayed allocation writeout. Valid values for this
option are page size (typically 4KiB) through to 1GiB, <br>
inclusive, in power-of-2 increments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour is for
dynamic end-of-file preallocation size, which uses a set of
heuristics to optimise the preallocation size based on the
current allocation pat&acirc; <br>
terns within the file and the access patterns to the file.
Specifying a fixed allocsize value turns off the dynamic
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attr2|noattr2 <br>
The options enable/disable an &quot;opportunistic&quot;
improvement to be made in the way inline extended attributes
are stored on-disk. When the new form is used for the first
<br>
time when attr2 is selected (either when setting or removing
extended attributes) the on-disk superblock feature bit
field will be updated to reflect this format being in <br>
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour is
determined by the on-disk feature bit indicating that attr2
behaviour is active. If either mount option it set, then
that becomes the new default <br>
used by the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRC enabled filesystems always
use the attr2 format, and so will reject the noattr2 mount
option if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">barrier|nobarrier <br>
Enables/disables the use of block layer write barriers for
writes into the journal and for data integrity operations.
This allows for drive level write caching to be <br>
enabled, for devices that support write barriers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard|nodiscard <br>
Enable/disable the issuing of commands to let the block
device reclaim space freed by the filesystem. This is useful
for SSD devices, thinly provisioned LUNs and virtual <br>
machine images, but may have a performance impact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: It is currently
recommended that you use the fstrim application to discard
unused blocks rather than the discard mount option because
the performance impact of this <br>
option is quite severe.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">grpid|bsdgroups|nogrpid|sysvgroups
<br>
These options define what group ID a newly created file
gets. When grpid is set, it takes the group ID of the
directory in which it is created; otherwise it takes the
<br>
fsgid of the current process, unless the directory has the
setgid bit set, in which case it takes the gid from the
parent directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it
<br>
is a directory itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filestreams <br>
Make the data allocator use the filestreams allocation mode
across the entire filesystem rather than just on directories
configured to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ikeep is specified, XFS
does not delete empty inode <br>
clusters and keeps them around on disk. When noikeep is
specified, empty inode clusters are returned to the free
space pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inode32|inode64 <br>
When inode32 is specified, it indicates that XFS limits
inode creation to locations which will not result in inode
numbers with more than 32 bits of significance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When inode64 is specified, it
indicates that XFS is allowed to create inodes at any
location in the filesystem, including those which will
result in inode numbers occupy&acirc; <br>
ing more than 32 bits of significance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inode32 is provided for
backwards compatibility with older systems and applications,
since 64 bits inode numbers might cause problems for some
applications that cannot <br>
handle large inode numbers. If applications are in use which
do not handle inode numbers bigger than 32 bits, the inode32
option should be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">largeio|nolargeio <br>
If &quot;nolargeio&quot; is specified, the optimal I/O
reported in st_blksize by stat(2) will be as small as
possible to allow user applications to avoid inefficient
read/mod&acirc; <br>
ify/write I/O. This is typically the page size of the
machine, as this is the granularity of the page cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;largeio&quot;
specified, a filesystem that was created with a
&quot;swidth&quot; specified will return the
&quot;swidth&quot; value (in bytes) in st_blksize. If the
filesystem does not have a <br>
&quot;swidth&quot; specified but does specify an
&quot;allocsize&quot; then &quot;allocsize&quot; (in bytes)
will be returned instead. Otherwise the behaviour is the
same as if &quot;nolargeio&quot; was speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logbufs=value <br>
Set the number of in-memory log buffers. Valid numbers range
from 2-8 inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 8
buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the memory cost of 8 log
buffers is too high on small systems, then it may be reduced
at some cost to performance on metadata intensive workloads.
The logbsize option <br>
below controls the size of each buffer and so is also
relevent to this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logbsize=value <br>
Set the size of each in-memory log buffer. The size may be
specified in bytes, or in kilobytes with a &quot;k&quot;
suffix. Valid sizes for version 1 and version 2 logs are
16384 <br>
(16k) and 32768 (32k). Valid sizes for version 2 logs also
include 65536 (64k), 131072 (128k) and 262144 (256k). The
logbsize must be an integer multiple of the log <br>
stripe unit configured at mkfs time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for version 1
logs is 32768, while the default value for version 2 logs is
MAX(32768, log_sunit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logdev=deviceandrtdev=device
<br>
Use an external log (metadata journal) and/or real-time
device. An XFS filesystem has up to three parts: a data
section, a log section, and a real-time section. The <br>
real-time section is optional, and the log section can be
separate from the data section or contained within it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noalign <br>
Data allocations will not be aligned at stripe unit
boundaries. This is only relevant to filesystems created
with non-zero data alignment parameters (sunit, swidth) by
<br>
mkfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norecovery <br>
The filesystem will be mounted without running log recovery.
If the filesystem was not cleanly unmounted, it is likely to
be inconsistent when mounted in &quot;norecovery&quot; <br>
mode. Some files or directories may not be accessible
because of this. Filesystems mounted &quot;norecovery&quot;
must be mounted read-only or the mount will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nouuid Don&rsquo;t check for
double mounted file systems using the file system uuid. This
is useful to mount LVM snapshot volumes, and often used in
combination with &quot;norecovery&quot; for <br>
mounting read-only snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noquota <br>
Forcibly turns off all quota accounting and enforcement
within the filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">uquota/usrquota/uqnoenforce/quota
<br>
User disk quota accounting enabled, and limits (optionally)
enforced. Refer to xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gquota/grpquota/gqnoenforce <br>
Group disk quota accounting enabled and limits (optionally)
enforced. Refer to xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pquota/prjquota/pqnoenforce <br>
Project disk quota accounting enabled and limits
(optionally) enforced. Refer to xfs_quota(8) for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sunit=value and swidth=value
<br>
Used to specify the stripe unit and width for a RAID device
or a stripe volume. &quot;value&quot; must be specified in
512-byte block units. These options are only relevant to
<br>
filesystems that were created with non-zero data alignment
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sunit and swidth parameters
specified must be compatible with the existing filesystem
alignment characteristics. In general, that means the only
valid changes to <br>
sunit are increasing it by a power-of-2 multiple. Valid
swidth values are any integer multiple of a valid sunit
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically the only time these
mount options are necessary if after an underlying RAID
device has had it&rsquo;s geometry modified, such as adding
a new disk to a RAID5 lun and <br>
reshaping it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swalloc <br>
Data allocations will be rounded up to stripe width
boundaries when the current end of file is being extended
and the file size is larger than the stripe width size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wsync When specified, all
filesystem namespace operations are executed synchronously.
This ensures that when the namespace operation (create,
unlink, etc) completes, the change <br>
to the namespace is on stable storage. This is useful in HA
setups where failover must not result in clients seeing
inconsistent namespace presentation during or after a <br>
failover event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount options for xiafs <br>
None. Although nothing is wrong with xiafs, it is not used
much, and is not maintained. Probably one shouldn&rsquo;t
use it. Since Linux version 2.1.21 xiafs is no longer part
of the <br>
kernel source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE LOOP DEVICE <br>
One further possible type is a mount via the loop device.
For example, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat
-o loop=/dev/loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will set up the loop device
/dev/loop3 to correspond to the file /tmp/disk.img, and then
mount this device on /mnt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no explicit loop device is
mentioned (but just an option &lsquo;-o loop&rsquo; is
given), then mount will try to find some unused loop device
and use that, for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -o
loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mount command automatically
creates a loop device from a regular file if a filesystem
type is not specified or the filesystem is known for
libblkid, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -t ext3 /tmp/disk.img
/mnt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This type of mount knows about
four options, namely loop, offset and sizelimit , that are
really options to losetup(8). (These options can be used in
addition to those specific <br>
to the filesystem type.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Linux 2.6.25 is supported
auto-destruction of loop devices and then any loop device
allocated by mount will be freed by umount independently on
/etc/mtab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also free a loop device
by hand, using &lsquo;losetup -d&rsquo; or &lsquo;umount
-d&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN CODES <br>
mount has the following return codes (the bits can be
ORed):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 success</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 incorrect invocation or
permissions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 system error (out of memory,
cannot fork, no more loop devices)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 internal mount bug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 user interrupt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 problems writing or locking
/etc/mtab</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32 mount failure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 some mount succeeded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command mount -a returns 0
(all success), 32 (all failed) or 64 (some failed, some
success).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The syntax of external mount helpers is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/sbin/mount.&lt;suffix&gt; spec
dir [-sfnv] [-o options] [-t type.subtype]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the &lt;type&gt; is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some Linux filesystems
don&rsquo;t support -o sync and -o dirsync (the ext2, ext3,
fat and vfat filesystems do support synchronous updates (a
la BSD) when mounted with the sync <br>
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o remount may not be able
to change mount parameters (all ext2fs-specific parameters,
except sb, are changeable with a remount, for example, but
you can&rsquo;t change gid or <br>
umask for the fatfs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible that files
/etc/mtab and /proc/mounts don&rsquo;t match. The first file
is based only on the mount command options, but the content
of the second file also depends on <br>
the kernel and others settings (e.g. remote NFS server. In
particular case the mount command may reports unreliable
information about a NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts
file <br>
usually contains more reliable information.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checking files on NFS filesystem
referenced by file descriptors (i.e. the fcntl and ioctl
families of functions) may lead to inconsistent result due
to the lack of consistency <br>
check in kernel even if noac is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The loop option with the offset
or sizelimit options used may fail when using older kernels
if the mount command can&rsquo;t confirm that the size of
the block device has been config&acirc; <br>
ured as requested. This situation can be worked around by
using the losetup command manually before calling mount with
the configured loop device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
A mount command existed in Version 5 AT&amp;T UNIX.</p>
