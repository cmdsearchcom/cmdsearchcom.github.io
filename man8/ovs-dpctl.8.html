<p>ovs-dpctl(8) Open vSwitch Manual ovs-dpctl(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ovs-dpctl - administer Open vSwitch datapaths</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ovs-dpctl [options] command [switch] [args...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ovs-dpctl program can create, modify, and delete Open
vSwitch datapaths. A single machine may host any number of
datapaths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program works only with
datapaths that are implemented outside of ovs-vswitchd
itself, such as the Linux and Windows kernel-based
datapaths. To manage datapaths that are <br>
integrated into ovs-vswitchd, such as the userspace (netdev)
datapath, use ovs-appctl(8) to invoke the dpctl/* commands,
which are documented in ovs-vswitchd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A newly created datapath is
associated with only one network device, a virtual network
device sometimes called the datapath&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;local port&rsquo;&rsquo;. A newly created
datapath is not, <br>
however, associated with any of the host&rsquo;s other
network devices. To intercept and process traffic on a given
network device, use the add-if command to explicitly add
that net&acirc; <br>
work device to the datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ovs-vswitchd(8) is in use,
use ovs-vsctl(8) instead of ovs-dpctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most ovs-dpctl commands that
work with datapaths take an argument that specifies the name
of the datapath. Datapath names take the form [type@]name,
where name is the network <br>
device associated with the datapath&rsquo;s local port. If
type is given, it specifies the datapath provider of name,
otherwise the default provider system is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands manage
datapaths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-dp dp [netdev[,option]...]
<br>
Creates datapath dp, with a local port also named dp. This
will fail if a network device dp already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If netdevs are specified,
ovs-dpctl adds them to the new datapath, just as if add-if
was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-dp dp <br>
Deletes datapath dp. If dp is associated with any network
devices, they are automatically removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-if dp netdev[,option]...
<br>
Adds each netdev to the set of network devices datapath dp
monitors, where dp is the name of an existing datapath, and
netdev is the name of one of the host&rsquo;s network <br>
devices, e.g. eth0. Once a network device has been added to
a datapath, the datapath has complete ownership of the
network device&rsquo;s traffic and the network device
appears <br>
silent to the rest of the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A netdev may be followed by a
comma-separated list of options. The following options are
currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type=type <br>
Specifies the type of port to add. The default type is
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port_no=port <br>
Requests a specific port number within the datapath. If this
option is not specified then one will be automatically
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key=value <br>
Adds an arbitrary key-value option to the port&rsquo;s
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)
documents the available port types and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-if dp port[,option]... <br>
Reconfigures each port in dp as specified. An option of the
form key=value adds the specified key-value option to the
port or overrides an existing key&rsquo;s value. An <br>
option of the form key=, that is, without a value, deletes
the key-value named key. The type and port number of a port
cannot be changed, so type and port_no are only <br>
allowed if they match the existing configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-if dp netdev... <br>
Removes each netdev from the list of network devices
datapath dp monitors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump-dps <br>
Prints the name of each configured datapath on a separate
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-s | --statistics] show [dp...]
<br>
Prints a summary of configured datapaths, including their
datapath numbers and a list of ports connected to each
datapath. (The local port is identified as port 0.) If <br>
-s or --statistics is specified, then packet and byte
counters are also printed for each port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The datapath numbers consists of
flow stats and mega flow mask stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;lookups&quot; row
displays three stats related to flow lookup triggered by
processing incoming packets in the datapath. &quot;hit&quot;
displays number of packets matches existing <br>
flows. &quot;missed&quot; displays the number of packets not
matching any existing flow and require user space
processing. &quot;lost&quot; displays number of packets
destined for user space <br>
process but subsequently dropped before reaching userspace.
The sum of &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;miss&quot; equals to
the total number of packets datapath processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;flows&quot; row
displays the number of flows in datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;masks&quot; row
displays the mega flow mask stats. This row is omitted for
datapath not implementing mega flow. &quot;hit&quot;
displays the total number of masks visited for match&acirc;
<br>
ing incoming packets. &quot;total&quot; displays number of
masks in the datapath. &quot;hit/pkt&quot; displays the
average number of masks visited per packet; the ratio
between &quot;hit&quot; and <br>
total number of packets processed by the datapath&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more datapaths are
specified, information on only those datapaths are
displayed. Otherwise, ovs-dpctl displays information about
all configured datapaths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATAPATH FLOW TABLE DEBUGGING
COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are primarily useful for debugging
Open vSwitch. The flow table entries (both matches and
actions) that they work with are not OpenFlow flow entries.
<br>
Instead, they are different and considerably simpler flows
maintained by the Open vSwitch kernel module. Use
ovs-ofctl(8), instead, to work with OpenFlow flow
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dp argument to each of these
commands is optional when exactly one datapath exists, in
which case that datapath is the default. When multiple
datapaths exist, then a data&acirc; <br>
path name is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-m | --more] dump-flows [dp]
[filter=filter] <br>
Prints to the console all flow entries in datapath
dp&rsquo;s flow table. Without -m or --more, output omits
match fields that a flow wildcards entirely; with -m or
--more, <br>
output includes all wildcarded fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filter=filter is specified,
only displays the flows that match the filter. filter is a
flow in the form similiar to that accepted by
ovs-ofctl(8)&rsquo;s add-flow command. <br>
(This is not an OpenFlow flow: besides other differences, it
never contains wildcards.) The filter is also useful to
match wildcarded fields in the datapath flow. As an <br>
example, filter=&rsquo;tcp,tp_src=100&rsquo; will match the
datapath flow containing
&rsquo;tcp(src=80/0xff00,dst=8080/0xff)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-flow [dp] flow actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--clear] [--may-create] [-s |
--statistics] mod-flow [dp] flow actions <br>
Adds or modifies a flow in dp&rsquo;s flow table that, when
a packet matching flow arrives, causes actions to be
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The add-flow command succeeds
only if flow does not already exist in dp. Contrariwise,
mod-flow without --may-create only modifies the actions for
an existing flow. With <br>
--may-create, mod-flow will add a new flow or modify an
existing one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -s or --statistics is
specified, then mod-flow prints the modified flow&rsquo;s
statistics. A flow&rsquo;s statistics are the number of
packets and bytes that have passed through <br>
the flow, the elapsed time since the flow last processed a
packet (if ever), and (for TCP flows) the union of the TCP
flags processed through the flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --clear, mod-flow zeros out
the flow&rsquo;s statistics. The statistics printed if -s or
--statistics is also specified are those from just before
clearing the statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-s | --statistics] del-flow
[dp] flow <br>
Deletes the flow from dp&rsquo;s flow table that matches
flow. If -s or --statistics is specified, then del-flow
prints the deleted flow&rsquo;s statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-flow [dp] ufid:ufid <br>
Fetches the flow from dp&rsquo;s flow table with unique
identifier ufid. ufid must be specified as a string of 32
hexadecimal characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del-flows [dp] <br>
Deletes all flow entries from datapath dp&rsquo;s flow
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION TRACKING TABLE
DEBUGGING COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are primarily useful for debugging
the connection tracking entries in the datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dp argument to each of these
commands is optional when exactly one datapath exists, in
which case that datapath is the default. When multiple
datapaths exist, then a data&acirc; <br>
path name is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N.B.(Linux specific): the system
datapaths (i.e. the Linux kernel module Open vSwitch
datapaths) share a single connection tracking table (which
is also used by other kernel sub&acirc; <br>
systems, such as iptables, nftables and the regular host
stack). Therefore, the following commands do not apply
specifically to one datapath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-m | --more] [-s |
--statistics] dump-conntrack [dp] [zone=zone] <br>
Prints to the console all the connection entries in the
tracker used by dp. If zone=zone is specified, only shows
the connections in zone. With --more, some implementa&acirc;
<br>
tion specific details are included. With --statistics
timeouts and timestamps are added to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush-conntrack [dp] [zone=zone]
<br>
Flushes all the connection entries in the tracker used by
dp. If zone=zone is specified, only flushes the connections
in zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-s <br>
--statistics <br>
Causes the show command to print packet and byte counters
for each port within the datapaths that it shows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
--more Increases the verbosity of dump-flows output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
--timeout=secs <br>
Limits ovs-dpctl runtime to approximately secs seconds. If
the timeout expires, ovs-dpctl will exit with a SIGALRM
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[spec] <br>
--verbose=[spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively. (If
--detach is specified, ovs-dpctl <br>
closes its standard file descriptors, so logging to the
console will have no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be fil&acirc; <br>
tered out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8)
for a definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
--log-file is also specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
--verbose=dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vPATTERN:destination:pattern
<br>
--verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vFACILITY:facility <br>
--verbose=FACILITY:facility <br>
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can
be one of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, <br>
local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
local7. If this option is not specified, daemon is used as
the default for the local system syslog and local0 is <br>
used while sending a message to the target provided via the
--syslog-target option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file[=file] <br>
Enables logging to a file. If file is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
file name used if file is omitted is /var/log/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/ovs-dpctl.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-target=host:port <br>
Send syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the
system syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-method=method <br>
Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog
daemon. Following forms are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libc, use libc
syslog() function. This is the default behavior. Downside of
using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actu&acirc; <br>
ally sent to the syslog daemon over /dev/log UNIX domain
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file, use
UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify
arbitrary message format with this option. However, rsyslogd
8.9 and older versions use hard <br>
coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket
use. If you want to use arbitrary message format with older
rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to <br>
localhost IP address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; udp:ip:port, use
UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary
message format also with older rsyslogd. When sending syslog
messages over UDP <br>
socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for
example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
the specified UDP port, accidental iptables <br>
rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and
there are some security considerations that apply to UDP
sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints version information to the console.</p>
