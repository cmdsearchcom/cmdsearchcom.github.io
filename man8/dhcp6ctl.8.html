<p>DHCP6CTL(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
DHCP6CTL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dhcp6ctl &acirc; DHCPv6 client and server control
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dhcp6ctl [-C -| -S] [-k keyfile] [-p port] [-s address]
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dhcp6ctl controls the operation of a DHCPv6 process, which
is either dhcp6c or dhcp6s, a DHCPv6 client or a server. By
default, dhcp6ctl controls a client. The type of the <br>
process can also be specified explicitly by the -C or -S
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp6ctl communicates with the
DHCPv6 process over a TCP connection, sending commands
authenticated with digital signatures. Currently, the only
supported authentication algorithm <br>
is HMAC-MD5, which uses a shared secret on each end of the
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options are as
below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Control a DHCPv6 client. This
option is exclusive with the -S option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Control a DHCPv6 server. This
option is exclusive with the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keyfile <br>
Use keyfile to provide the shared secret to communicate with
the process. The default file name used when unspecified is
/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6cctlkey with a client, and <br>
/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6sctlkey with a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Specify port as the listening port of the process. The
default port number used when unspecified is 5546 for a
client, and 5547 for a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s address <br>
Specify address as the listening address of the process. The
default address used when unspecified is ::1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY FILE <br>
Since the operation available with the dhcp6ctl command is
powerful, the communication between the command and dhcp6c
or dhcp6s must be authenticated. The supported algorithm for
<br>
authentication is HMAC-MD5, which requires a shared secret,
and the secret is stored in the key file. The key file must
consist of a single line, in which the secret value is <br>
written in the form of BASE-64 encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Each command specifies a single control operation. Supported
commands are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload This command specifies
the process to reload the configuration file. Existing
bindings, if any, are intact. <br>
remove arguments <br>
This command is only applicable to a server. This specifies
the server to remove a run-time object specified by
arguments from the server. Currently, the only possible <br>
object is one particular IA_NA or IA_PD binding, which is
specified as &acirc;binding IA IA_NA IAID DUID&acirc; or
&acirc;binding IA IA_PD IAID DUID&acirc; where IAID is a
decimal number specify&acirc; <br>
ing the IAID of the IA, and DUID is a DHCP Unique Identifier
of the binding. The format of DUID is the same as that
specified in dhcp6s.conf(5). <br>
start interface ifname <br>
This command is only applicable to a client. It tells the
client to release the current configuration information (if
any) on the interface ifname and restart the DHCPv6 <br>
configuration process on the interface. <br>
stop interface ifname <br>
This command is only applicable to a client. It tells the
client to release the current configuration information (if
any) on the interface ifname. Any timer running for <br>
the interface will be stopped, and no more DHCPv6 messages
will be sent on the interface. The configuration process can
later be restarted by the start command. <br>
stop This command stops the specified process. If the
process is a client, it will release all configuration
information (if any) and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6cctlkey is the default key file to
communicate with a client. <br>
/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6sctlkey is the default key file to
communicate with a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
dhcp6s.conf(5) dhcp6s(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The dhcp6ctl command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6
protocol stack kit.</p>
