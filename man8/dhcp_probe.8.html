<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dhcp_probe attempts to discover DHCP and BootP servers on a
directly-attached Ethernet network. A network administrator
can use this tool to locate unauthorized DHCP and BootP <br>
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program must be run with
root privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program periodically
broadcasts a number of DHCP and BootP request packets out a
single physical interface. Several different kinds of
request packets are sent, as a DHCP or <br>
BootP server may only respond to certain requests, depending
on the server&rsquo;s configuration. Essentially, dhcp_probe
mimics a BootP or DHCP client in a variety of possible <br>
states, attempting to provoke responses from servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After sending each request
packet, dhcp_probe listens for responses. After filtering
out responses that do not appear to be in response to the
probe, and responses from known <br>
DHCP and BootP servers (identified by their IP source
addresses and optionally by their Ethernet source
addresses), it logs any responses from unknown servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, responses from
unknown servers may also be written to a packet capture
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, an external program
may be called each time a response from an unknown server is
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp_probe may not be able to
locate all DHCP and BootP servers; see LIMITATIONS
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As DHCP broadcasts do not
ordinarily cross IP routers, dhcp_probe will locate only
servers that are attached to the same physical network as
the interface specified on the com&acirc; <br>
mand line. Although BootP Relay Agents running on this
network may help the broadcasts cross IP routers, these
agents typically are configured to convert the broadcasts to
uni&acirc; <br>
casts directed to only the well-known DHCP or BootP servers
located on other physical networks. As a result, BootP Relay
Agents will allow your the servers to receive the <br>
requests issued by dhcp_probe, but will not cause remote
unknown servers to hear these requests. Therefore, if you
have multiple physical networks, you may wish to run <br>
dhcp_probe on each of these networks to discover unknown
DHCP and BootP servers on each of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp_probe functions on a single
Ethernet interface specified on the command line; it does
not listen on multiple interfaces. However, if the host has
multiple physical inter&acirc; <br>
faces, you may run an instance of dhcp_probe on each
interface. If your physical interface supports 802.1Q, you
can use that to create a logical interface on each VLAN,
then run <br>
an instance of dhcp_probe on each logical interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp_probe is intended for use
by a network administrator. Before running dhcp_probe on any
network other than one for which you are responsible,
contact that network&rsquo;s adminis&acirc; <br>
trator to learn if it is acceptable for you to run this
software on that network. Running this software may violate
on a network where you don&rsquo;t have permission to do so
may <br>
violate that network&rsquo;s acceptable use policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
dhcp_probe is a product of the Network Systems Group at
Princeton University&rsquo;s Office of Information
Technology, and is available from
http://www.net.princeton.edu/soft&acirc; <br>
ware/dhcp_probe/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presently the product builds and
runs on Solaris 9 on SPARC with gcc. The program relies on
the pcap(3) and libnet(3) libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c config_file <br>
Specifies the configuration file. If not specified, this
defaults to /etc/dhcp_probe.cf. The configuration file is
read at startup, and is re-read whenever a SIGHUP is <br>
received. See dhcp_probe.cf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d debuglevel <br>
Sets the debuglevel variable that controls the amount of
debugging messages generated. If not specified, this
defaults to 0 (no debugging). For a summary of the types of
<br>
messages produced at each debug level, see DEBUG LEVELS
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Specifies that the program
should not fork, but instead remain in the foreground. Only
use this when you are starting the program manually for
testing purposes. When in <br>
the foreground, any messages produced by the program are
written to stderr instead of to syslog(3) or any log_file
you might specify with the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a brief usage
summary, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l log_file <br>
Log messages to the specified file instead of to syslog(3).
(This option is ignored if you also specify the -f option,
as that directs messages to stderr.) The log file <br>
is opened shortly after the program starts. It is closed and
re-opened when the program receives a SIGUSR1 signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o capture_file <br>
When a response packet is received from an unexpected
server, write the packet to the specified file. The file is
opened and truncated shortly after the program starts. <br>
It is closed and re-opened (and truncated) when the program
receives a SIGUSR2 signal. The file is a pcap(3) savefile,
and may be read with any program that understands <br>
the pcap savefile format; e.g. tcpdump(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid_file <br>
Specifies the file that will contain the program&rsquo;s
processid. If not specified, this defaults to
/var/run/dhcp_probe.pid. The pid_file is written shortly
after the pro&acirc; <br>
gram starts, and is removed when the program exits under its
own control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q vlan_id <br>
Specifies that the packets we send should be tagged with an
802.1Q VLAN ID vlan_id. Valid values range from 0 to 4095.
If not specified, the packets we send do not con&acirc; <br>
tain an 802.1Q header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s capture_bufsize <br>
Specifies the size of the buffer that will be used to
capture all the responses (Ethernet frames) to a single
request packet; responses which do not fit are silently <br>
dropped. The value is specified in bytes, and must fit into
your host&rsquo;s range for an int; values outside that
range may result in unpredictable results. If not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, this defaults to 30280, which is enough for twenty
maximum-size Ethernet frames (1514*20). Typical responses
are Ethernet frames ranging from 342-590 bytes, so the <br>
default capture buffer size should hold over 50 of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Enables the &rsquo;socket
receive timeout&rsquo; feature. On some platforms,
dhcp_probe may ignore the response_wait_time (described in
dhcp_probe.cf(5)), instead waiting forever for <br>
a response after it sends a probe packet. As per pcap(3),
this is because the read timeout we pass to pcap_open_live()
is not supported on all platforms. If you <br>
encounter this issue, try enabling our &rsquo;socket receive
timeout&rsquo; feature; it might help. Enabling this feature
causes the program to also set a socket receive timeout on
<br>
the socket underlying the pcap capture; we set this timeout
to the response_wait_time. On some platforms, the
program&rsquo;s socket receive timeout feature does not
work; <br>
instead the program will report that it cannot set the
receive timeout, and will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display the program&rsquo;s
version number, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w cwd Specifies the working
directory; shortly after starting the program changes its
current working directory to this. If not specified, this
defaults to /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface_name <br>
Specifies the name of the interface the program should use;
this argument is required. This must be an Ethernet
interface which is up and has been assigned an IP
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
After initialization, the program enters its main event
loop, in which it remains until you signal the program to
exit with a SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGQUIT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main event loop (a.k.a. the
&quot;probe cycle&quot;) consists of the following actions,
repeated until the program receives a request to quit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Handle any signals that have
been received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Install a pcap(3) filter to
listen for UDP packets destined to the BootP client port
(UDP port 68).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Broadcast a DHCP or BootP
request packet out the specified interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Listen for response_wait_time
milliseconds for any responses received by the pcap(3)
filter. (The response_wait_time defaults to 5000
milliseconds (5 seconds), and <br>
may be changed in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any responses that contains a
bootp_chaddr field not equal to the chaddr used in the probe
is ignored, as are any that have incorrect bootp_htype or
bootp_hlen <br>
fields. These are not responses to our probe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any responses from known DHCP
and BootP servers are ignored. The IP source address for
responses from each known server is declared using a
legal_server statement in <br>
the dhcp_probe.cf(5) file. Any response with an IP source
address that does not appear in a legal_server statement is
treated as an unknown server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Ethernet source address for
responses from each known server is also optionaly declared
using a legal_server_ethersrc statement in the
dhcp_probe.cf(5) file. If <br>
at least one legal_server_ethersrc is specified, then any
response with an Ethernet source address that does not
appear in a legal_server_ethersrc statement is <br>
treated as an unknown server. If no legal_server_ethersrc
statements appear, then the response&rsquo;s Ethernet source
address is not checked. (The legal_server_ethersrc <br>
statement is considered experimental in version 1.3.0, as it
has received only limited testing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each response from an
unknown server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) If the reponse packet
contains a non-zero yiaddr field, and one or more
lease_network_of_concern statements were specified,
determine if the yiaddr value falls <br>
within any of the &quot;Lease Networks of Concern&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) Log a message showing the
response packet&rsquo;s source IP and Ethernet addresses. If
the response packet&rsquo;s yiaddr is non-zero and falls
within a &quot;Lease Networks of <br>
Concern&quot;, the log message also reports that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b) If the -o option was
specified, the packet is also written to a packet capture
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c) If an alert_program_name was
specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) file, that program is
executed, with the following arguments in order: the name of
the calling pro&acirc; <br>
gram (e.g. dhcp_probe), the name of the interface on which
the unexpected response packet was received, the IP source
address of the packet, and the Ethernet <br>
source address of the packet. (We do not wait for the
alert_program_name to complete; it runs in a child
process.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d) If an alert_program_name2 was
specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) file, that program is
executed, with the following required options: <br>
-p the name of the calling program (e.g. dhcp_probe) <br>
-I the name of the interface on which the unexpected
response packet was received <br>
-i the IP source address of the packet <br>
-m and the Ethernet source address of the packet <br>
If the response packet&rsquo;s yiaddr is non-zero and falls
within a &quot;Lease Networks of Concern&quot;, the
following optional options are also passed: <br>
-y the non-zero yiaddr value <br>
(We do not wait for the alert_program_name2 to complete; it
runs in a child process.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Remove the pcap(3) filter
installed earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. If any signals have arrived
requesting that we quit, exit gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Repeat steps 2-6 for each
flavor of DHCP and BootP request packet the program supports
(see PACKET FLAVORS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Handle any signals that have
been received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Sleep for cycle_time seconds.
(The cycle_time defaults to 300 seconds, and and may be
changed in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pcap(3) filter the program
installs normally does not specify that the interface should
be placed into promiscuous mode (although it is possible the
interface is already in <br>
promiscuous mode for some other reason). However, if in the
dhcp_probe.cf(5) file you specify a chaddr or ether_src
value other than the interface&rsquo;s actual hardware
address, <br>
then the pcap filter will specify that the interface should
be placed into promiscuous mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the filter used with
pcap(3) specifies only UDP packets destined to port bootpc
should be collected, on systems where bpf isn&rsquo;t part
of the kernel, pcap(3) must imple&acirc; <br>
ment bpf as part of the application. This can increase the
number of packets that must be passed from the kernel to
user space to be filtered. The program attempts to minimize
<br>
the side-effects of this by removing the pcap(3) filter when
it isn&rsquo;t actually listening for responses. In
particular, the filter is not installed during the time the
program <br>
sleeps between each probe cycle (the cycle_time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do specify an
alert_program_name, take care that the program you specify
is safe for a privileged user to run; it is executed with
the same (i.e. root) privileges as the <br>
calling program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKET FLAVORS <br>
No single request packet is likely to provoke a response
from every possible BootP and DHCP server. Some servers may
only response to either BootP, or DHCP, but not both. Some
<br>
servers may be configured to only respond to a small set of
known clients. Some DHCP servers will only provide leases to
a small set of known clients, but may be willing to <br>
respond (negatively) to unknown clients that request a lease
renewal on an inappropriate IP address. Therefore,
dhcp_probe actually sends not one, but five different flavor
<br>
request packets, in the hopes of provoking responses from a
wider variety of unknown servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packet flavors are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTPREQUEST <br>
This packet is typical of a BootP client requesting an IP
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will typically provoke a
BOOTPREPLY from a BootP server willing to respond to any
BootP client. (BootP servers configured to only respond to a
set of known clients may <br>
not respond.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCPDISOVER (INIT) <br>
This packet is typical of a DHCP client in the INIT
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Message Type specifying DHCPDISCOVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Client Identifier, which is computed by prepending
0x&rsquo;01&rsquo; to the value of chaddr. (The value chaddr
is specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) <br>
file, otherwise it defaults to the interface&rsquo;s
Ethernet address.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This packet will typically
provoke a DHCPOFFER from a DHCP server willing to respond to
any DHCP client. (DHCP servers configured to only offer
leases to a set of known <br>
clients may not respond.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCPREQUEST (SELECTING): <br>
This packet is typical of a DHCP client in the SELECTING
state; i.e. a client which has previously issued a
DHCPDISCOVER, then received a DHCPOFFER from some DHCP
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Message Type specifying DHCPREQUEST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Client Identifier, which is computed by prepending
0x&rsquo;01&rsquo; to the value of chaddr. (The value chaddr
is specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) <br>
file, otherwise it defaults to the interface&rsquo;s
Ethernet address.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Server Identifier specifying server_id, which should be
an IP address that does not correspond to any valid DHCP
Server Identifier on <br>
your network. (The value server_id is specified in the
dhcp_probe.cf(5) file, otherwise it defaults to
10.254.254.254.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Requested IP Address specifying client_ip_address,
which should be an IP address that does not correspond to
any valid IP address on your <br>
network. (The value client_ip_address is specified in the
dhcp_probe.cf(5) file, otherwise it defaults to
172.31.254.254.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This packet occassionally
provokes a response from a broken DHCP server that fails to
respect the DHCP Server Identifier option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCPREQUEST (INIT-REBOOT): <br>
This packet is typical of a DHCP client in the INIT-REBOOT
state; i.e. a client which has obtained a DHCP lease in the
past, is bringing up its IP stack, and hopes to <br>
obtain (or extend) a DHCP lease on the same IP address as in
the past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Message Type specifying DHCPREQUEST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Client Identifier, which is computed by prepending
0x&rsquo;01&rsquo; to the value of chaddr. (The value chaddr
is specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) <br>
file, otherwise it defaults to the interface&rsquo;s
Ethernet address.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Requested IP Address specifying client_ip_address,
which should be an IP address that does not correspond to
any valid IP address on your <br>
network; ideally it should be one that is topologically
inappropriate for your network. (The value client_ip_address
is specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) file, otherwise <br>
it defaults to 172.31.254.254.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Requested IP Address
option is topologically inappropriate for your network, this
packet may provoke a DHCPNAK from any DHCP server that
believes it is authorita&acirc; <br>
tive for the network&rsquo;s IP topology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCPREQUEST (REBINDING) <br>
This packet is typical of a DHCP client in the REBINDING
state; i.e. a client which has obtained a DHCP lease which
is between its DHCP T2 and expiration time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Message Type specifying DHCPREQUEST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options field contains a
DHCP Client Identifier, which is computed by prepending
0x&rsquo;01&rsquo; to the value of chaddr. (The value chaddr
is specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) <br>
file, otherwise it defaults to the interface&rsquo;s
Ethernet address.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ciaddr field contains
client_ip_address, which should be an IP address that does
not correspond to any valid IP address on your network;
ideally it should be one that <br>
is topologically inappropriate for your network. (The value
client_ip_address is specified in the dhcp_probe.cf(5) file,
otherwise it defaults to 172.31.254.254.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of ciaddr is
topologically inappropriate for your network, this packet
will provoke a DHCPNAK from any DHCP server that believes it
is authoritative for the <br>
network&rsquo;s IP topology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the request packets sent by
the program share the following common characteristics:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ethernet Header <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIPLE INTERFACES <br>
Although dhcp_probe only supports monitoring a single
physical interface, you may run an instance of the program
on each physical interface; each monitors a different
physical <br>
network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running multiple copies of
dhcp_probe, be sure to specify a different pid_file for each
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify a log_file and/or
a capture_file, be sure to specify a different one for each
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may specify a different
config_file for each instance. If you don&rsquo;t need to
customize the settings in that file for each instance, you
may use the same configuration file <br>
for all instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have multiple logical
interfaces on the same physical interface, or multiple
logical IP networks running on a single physical network,
there is no need to run multiple <br>
instances of dhcp_probe to monitor each logical interfaces
or logical network. A single instance of the program running
on a physical interface is sufficient to provoke any <br>
servers on that physical network that might be willing to
respond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your physical interface
supports 802.1Q, you can use a single physical interface to
monitor multiple VLANs. Use your operating system to create
a logical interface on each <br>
VLAN, then run an instance of the program on each logical
interface. Since the program is responsible for constructing
Ethernet frame headers, you will probably need to specify
<br>
the -Q option to instruct it to add to outgoing frames an
802.1Q VLAN header with the appropriate VLAN ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The program will respond to a number of signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
If logging to a file, close and re-open it. If the program
is in the middle of a probe cycle, handling the signal is
deferred until the end of the cycle. (Has no effect <br>
if logging to syslog(3) or if the -f option was
specified.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
If capturing to a file, close and re-open it. If the program
is in the middle of a probe cycle, handling the signal is
deferred until the end of the cycle. (Has no <br>
effect if the -o option was not specified.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because re-opening the capture
file causes the file to be truncated and a new pcap(3)
header to be written to it, if you want to save the prior
contents of the capture <br>
file, move the existing capture file aside before sending
the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP Reread the configuration
file. If the program is in the middle of a probe cycle,
handling the signal is deferred until the end of the
cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT <br>
Exit gracefully. If the program is in the middle of a probe
cycle, handling the signal is deferred until the program
finishes sending and receiving responses for the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent flavor request packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEASE NETWORKS OF CONCERN <br>
Most rogue BootP/DHCP servers distribute private IP
addresses to clients, or send DHCPNAK messages to legitimate
clients. Some even more disruptive rogue BootP/DHCP servers
may <br>
distribute IP addresses that fall within your own
networks&rsquo; IP ranges. The &quot;Lease Networks of
Concern&quot; feature is intended to help you identify these
particularly disruptive <br>
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may activate the feature by
specifying the lease_network_of_concern statement in your
configuration file. Use the statement multiple times to
specify all your legitimate <br>
network ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a rogue BootP/DHCP server
is detected, if the rogue&rsquo;s response packet contains a
non-zero yiaddr value, the value is compared to the
&quot;Lease Networks of Concern&quot; you speci&acirc; <br>
fied. If the value falls within any of those network ranges,
the message logged by dhcp_probe is extended to make note of
this, and to report the yiaddr value. Furthermore, if <br>
you are using the alert_program_name2 feature, the alert
program is called with an extra -y yiaddr option so that
alert program can take any additional action desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG LEVELS <br>
The program produces increasingly detailed output as the
debuglevel increases. Under normal circumstances, you can
run at debuglevel 0. Here&rsquo;s roughly what messages are
added <br>
at each debuglevel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Display the IP source (and
Ethernet source) of each unexpected DHCP or BootP response
packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Startup and shutdown notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-fatal errors in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fatal errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 At startup, show some
information about the program&rsquo;s configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Show each time we start and
finish (re-)reading the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show each time we close and
re-open the logfile or capture file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Report on response packets that
could not be parsed (e.g. truncated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Each time we (re-)read the
configuration file, echo the information we obtain from
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 For each parsable response
packet, show the Ethernet source and destination, the IP
source and destination, and indicate when the IP source is a
legal (known) server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 For each probe cycle, show
when the cycle begins and ends, when we write a packet, and
when we begin and end listening for response packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The program was written by Irwin Tillman of Princeton
University&rsquo;s OIT Network Systems Group. It was written
to run on Solaris, relying on the generally-available
pcap(3) and <br>
libnet(3) libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/dhcp_probe.cf <br>
Configuration file read by the program. See
dhcp_probe.cf(5). The name of this file can be overridden by
a command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dhcp_probe.pid <br>
Contains the program&rsquo;s processid. The name of this
file can be overridden by a command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
dhcp_probe is not guaranteed to locate all unknown DHCP and
BootP servers attached to a network. If a BootP server is
configured so it only responds to certain clients (e.g. <br>
those with certain hardware addresses), it will not respond
to the BOOTPREQUEST packet we sent. If a DHCP server is
configured so it only responds to certain clients (e.g.
those <br>
with certain hardware addresses or DHCP Client Identifiers),
it will not respond to the packets we send that mimic DHCP
clients in the INIT state. If a DHCP server is configured
<br>
so it does not send DHCPNAK packets to clients requesting
topologically-inappropriate IP addresses, it will not
respond the packets we send that mimic DHCP clients in the
INIT- <br>
REBOOT and REBINDING states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upshot is that it is
possible that dhcp_probe will be unable to provoke some
BootP and DHCP servers into responding at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flushing out such servers can be
extremely difficult. One approach is to capture all UDP/IP
packet destined to the BootP client port which cross your
network; since most of <br>
these packets are unicast at Layer 2, capturing is only
effective if all such packets must pass by your capture
device&rsquo;s Ethernet interface (e.g. the capture device
is located at <br>
a network choke point, or the network does not involve any
Layer 2 switching). Another approach is to do UDP port
scanning for all devices listening on the BootP server port,
<br>
and assume that those which are listening on that port are
running a BootP or DHCP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malicious BootP or DHCP servers
that forge the IP source address (and possibly the Ethernet
source address) of their responses to match the values
specified by legal_server and <br>
legal_server_ethersrc statements will not be detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The packet capture buffer size is limited; if a single
request packet provokes more responses than will fit into
the buffer, those that do not fit are silently dropped,
without <br>
any diagnostic indicating that the buffer was too small. You
can adjust the size of the packet capture buffer size using
the -s capture_bufsize option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We do not support non-Ethernet
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because (re-)opening a packet
capture file causes the file to be opened for writing (not
appending), the contents of any existing packet capture file
of the same name is lost <br>
when the program starts or receives a SIGUSR2 signal. If the
file&rsquo;s previous contents should be preserved, move the
old file aside before starting the program or sending it a
<br>
SIGUSR2 signal. (This &quot;feature&quot; exists because
opening a pcap(3) savefile always involves writing a pcap
header record to the start of the file, so pcap always opens
the file <br>
using mode &quot;w&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because pcap(3) opens the packet
capture file with a simple fopen(3) without checking to see
if the file already exists, dhcp_probe may be tricked into
overwriting or corrupting <br>
an existing file. As dhcp_probe is run with root privileges,
this is a serious concern. To avoid this problem, if you use
the -o option, ensure that the directory that will <br>
contain the capture file is writable only by root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packet capture file that is
written is unparseable after the first packet. E.g. if read
with tcpdump(8), it reports: tcpdump: pcap_loop: truncated
dump file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On platforms where pcap(3) is
unable to support the timeout argument to pcap_open_live,
the program may not reliably detect responses from DHCP and
BootP servers, or may not <br>
function at all.</p>
