dhcp_probe attempts to discover DHCP and BootP servers on a directly-attached
  Ethernet network. A network administrator can use this tool to locate
  unauthorized DHCP and BootP servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program must be run with root privilege.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program periodically broadcasts a number of DHCP and BootP request packets
  out a single physical interface. Several different kinds of request packets
  are sent, as a DHCP or BootP server may only respond to certain requests,
  depending on the server's configuration. Essentially, dhcp_probe mimics a
  BootP or DHCP client in a variety of possible states, attempting to provoke
  responses from servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After sending each request packet, dhcp_probe listens for responses. After
  filtering out responses that do not appear to be in response to the probe, and
  responses from known DHCP and BootP servers (identified by their IP source
  addresses and optionally by their Ethernet source addresses), it logs any
  responses from unknown servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optionally, responses from unknown servers may also be written to a packet
  capture file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optionally, an external program may be called each time a response from an
  unknown server is received.
<div class="Pp"></div>
dhcp_probe may not be able to locate all DHCP and BootP servers; see LIMITATIONS
  below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As DHCP broadcasts do not ordinarily cross IP routers, dhcp_probe will locate
  only servers that are attached to the same physical network as the interface
  specified on the command line. Although BootP Relay Agents running on this
  network may help the broadcasts cross IP routers, these agents typically are
  configured to convert the broadcasts to unicasts directed to only the
  well-known DHCP or BootP servers located on other physical networks. As a
  result, BootP Relay Agents will allow your the servers to receive the requests
  issued by dhcp_probe, but will not cause remote unknown servers to hear these
  requests. Therefore, if you have multiple physical networks, you may wish to
  run dhcp_probe on each of these networks to discover unknown DHCP and BootP
  servers on each of them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
dhcp_probe functions on a single Ethernet interface specified on the command
  line; it does not listen on multiple interfaces. However, if the host has
  multiple physical interfaces, you may run an instance of dhcp_probe on each
  interface. If your physical interface supports 802.1Q, you can use that to
  create a logical interface on each VLAN, then run an instance of dhcp_probe on
  each logical interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
dhcp_probe is intended for use by a network administrator. Before running
  dhcp_probe on any network other than one for which you are responsible,
  contact that network's administrator to learn if it is acceptable for you to
  run this software on that network. Running this software may violate on a
  network where you don't have permission to do so may violate that network's
  acceptable use policy.

dhcp_probe is a product of the Network Systems Group at Princeton University's
  Office of Information Technology, and is available from
  http://www.net.princeton.edu/software/dhcp_probe/
<div class="Pp"></div>
Presently the product builds and runs on Solaris 9 on SPARC with gcc. The
  program relies on the <b>pcap</b>(3) and <b>libnet</b>(3) libraries.

      you encounter this issue, try enabling our 'socket receive timeout'
      feature; it might help. Enabling this feature causes the program to also
      set a socket receive timeout on the socket underlying the pcap capture; we
      set this timeout to the <i>response_wait_time</i>. On some platforms, the

The <b>pcap</b>(3) filter the program installs normally does not specify that
  the interface should be placed into promiscuous mode (although it is possible
  the interface is already in promiscuous mode for some other reason). However,
  if in the <b>dhcp_probe.cf</b>(5) file you specify a <i>chaddr</i> or
  <i>ether_src</i> value other than the interface's actual hardware address,
  then the pcap filter <i>will</i> specify that the interface should be placed
  into promiscuous mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although the filter used with <b>pcap</b>(3) specifies only UDP packets destined
  to port <i>bootpc</i> should be collected, on systems where <i>bpf</i> isn't
  part of the kernel, <b>pcap</b>(3) must implement <i>bpf</i> as part of the
  application. This can increase the number of packets that must be passed from
  the kernel to user space to be filtered. The program attempts to minimize the
  side-effects of this by removing the <b>pcap</b>(3) filter when it isn't
  actually listening for responses. In particular, the filter is not installed
  during the time the program sleeps between each probe cycle (the
  <i>cycle_time</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do specify an <i>alert_program_name</i>, take care that the program you
  specify is safe for a privileged user to run; it is executed with the same
  (i.e. root) privileges as the calling program.

No single request packet is likely to provoke a response from every possible
  BootP and DHCP server. Some servers may only response to either BootP, or
  DHCP, but not both. Some servers may be configured to only respond to a small
  set of known clients. Some DHCP servers will only provide leases to a small
  set of known clients, but may be willing to respond (negatively) to unknown
  clients that request a lease renewal on an inappropriate IP address.
  Therefore, dhcp_probe actually sends not one, but five different flavor
  request packets, in the hopes of provoking responses from a wider variety of
  unknown servers.

  INTERFACES</a></h1>
Although dhcp_probe only supports monitoring a single physical interface, you
  may run an instance of the program on each physical interface; each monitors a
  different physical network.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When running multiple copies of dhcp_probe, be sure to specify a different
  <i>pid_file</i> for each instance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify a <i>log_file</i> and/or a <i>capture_file</i>, be sure to
  specify a different one for each instance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may specify a different <i>config_file</i> for each instance. If you don't
  need to customize the settings in that file for each instance, you may use the
  same configuration file for all instances.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have multiple logical interfaces on the same physical interface, or
  multiple logical IP networks running on a single physical network, there is no
  need to run multiple instances of dhcp_probe to monitor each logical
  interfaces or logical network. A single instance of the program running on a
  physical interface is sufficient to provoke any servers on that physical
  network that might be willing to respond.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your physical interface supports 802.1Q, you can use a single physical
  interface to monitor multiple VLANs. Use your operating system to create a
  logical interface on each VLAN, then run an instance of the program on each
  logical interface. Since the program is responsible for constructing Ethernet
  frame headers, you will probably need to specify the -Q option to instruct it
  to add to outgoing frames an 802.1Q VLAN header with the appropriate VLAN ID.

The program will respond to a number of signals:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>SIGUSR1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If logging to a file, close and re-open it. If the program
      is in the middle of a probe cycle, handling the signal is deferred until

      the <b>-f</b> option was specified.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>SIGUSR2</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If capturing to a file, close and re-open it. If the

      specified.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Because re-opening the capture file causes the file to be truncated and a
      new <b>pcap</b>(3) header to be written to it, if you want to save the
      prior contents of the capture file, move the existing capture file aside

Most rogue BootP/DHCP servers distribute private IP addresses to clients, or
  send DHCPNAK messages to legitimate clients. Some even more disruptive rogue
  BootP/DHCP servers may distribute IP addresses that fall within your own
  networks' IP ranges. The &quot;Lease Networks of Concern&quot; feature is
  intended to help you identify these particularly disruptive servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may activate the feature by specifying the <b>lease_network_of_concern</b>
  statement in your configuration file. Use the statement multiple times to
  specify all your legitimate network ranges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a rogue BootP/DHCP server is detected, if the rogue's response packet
  contains a non-zero <b>yiaddr</b> value, the value is compared to the
  &quot;Lease Networks of Concern&quot; you specified. If the value falls within
  any of those network ranges, the message logged by <b>dhcp_probe</b> is
  extended to make note of this, and to report the <b>yiaddr</b> value.
  Furthermore, if you are using the <b>alert_program_name2</b> feature, the
  alert program is called with an extra <b>-y yiaddr</b> option so that alert
  program can take any additional action desired.

dhcp_probe is not guaranteed to locate all unknown DHCP and BootP servers
  attached to a network. If a BootP server is configured so it only responds to
  certain clients (e.g. those with certain hardware addresses), it will not
  respond to the BOOTPREQUEST packet we sent. If a DHCP server is configured so
  it only responds to certain clients (e.g. those with certain hardware
  addresses or DHCP Client Identifiers), it will not respond to the packets we
  send that mimic DHCP clients in the INIT state. If a DHCP server is configured
  so it does not send DHCPNAK packets to clients requesting
  topologically-inappropriate IP addresses, it will not respond the packets we
  send that mimic DHCP clients in the INIT-REBOOT and REBINDING states.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The upshot is that it is possible that dhcp_probe will be unable to provoke some
  BootP and DHCP servers into responding at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Flushing out such servers can be extremely difficult. One approach is to capture
  all UDP/IP packet destined to the BootP client port which cross your network;
  since most of these packets are unicast at Layer 2, capturing is only
  effective if <i>all</i> such packets must pass by your capture device's
  Ethernet interface (e.g. the capture device is located at a network choke
  point, or the network does not involve any Layer 2 switching). Another
  approach is to do UDP port scanning for all devices listening on the BootP
  server port, and assume that those which are listening on that port are
  running a BootP or DHCP server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Malicious BootP or DHCP servers that forge the IP source address (and possibly
  the Ethernet source address) of their responses to match the values specified
  by <b>legal_server</b> and <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b> statements will not be
  detected.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The packet capture buffer size is limited; if a single request packet provokes
  more responses than will fit into the buffer, those that do not fit are
  silently dropped, without any diagnostic indicating that the buffer was too
  small. You can adjust the size of the packet capture buffer size using the
  <b>-s</b><i>&#x00A0;capture_bufsize</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We do not support non-Ethernet interfaces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because (re-)opening a packet capture file causes the file to be opened for
  writing (not appending), the contents of any existing packet capture file of
  the same name is lost when the program starts or receives a SIGUSR2 signal. If
  the file's previous contents should be preserved, move the old file aside
  before starting the program or sending it a SIGUSR2 signal. (This
  &quot;feature&quot; exists because opening a <b>pcap</b>(3) savefile always
  involves writing a pcap header record to the start of the file, so pcap always
  opens the file using mode &quot;w&quot;.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because <b>pcap</b>(3) opens the packet capture file with a simple
  <b>fopen</b>(3) without checking to see if the file already exists, dhcp_probe
  may be tricked into overwriting or corrupting an existing file. As dhcp_probe
  is run with root privileges, this is a serious concern. To avoid this problem,
  if you use the <b>-o</b> option, ensure that the directory that will contain
  the capture file is writable only by root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The packet capture file that is written is unparseable after the first packet.
  E.g. if read with <b>tcpdump</b>(8), it reports: <i>tcpdump: pcap_loop:
  truncated dump file</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On platforms where <b>pcap</b>(3) is unable to support the <i>timeout</i>
  argument to <i>pcap_open_live</i>, the program may not reliably detect
  responses from DHCP and BootP servers, or may not function at all.
