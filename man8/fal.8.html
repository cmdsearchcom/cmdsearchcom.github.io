<p>FAL(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual FAL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fal - File Access Listener for DECnet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fal [options] <br>
Options: <br>
[-dvVhmt] [-l logtype] [-a auto-type] [-f &lt;auto-file&gt;]
[-r &lt;virtual-root&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fal is a daemon that serves incoming DAP (Data Access
protocol) connections from remote systems. It enables
transparent file access to files from OpenVMS machines using
standard <br>
DECnet syntax. It should be started at system boot time
(after DECnet has been started) and must be run as root.
<br>
The file names output by fal will adapt depending on the
sytax of files that are requested of it. If VMS-style
filenames are requested then VMS-style filenames will be
returned. <br>
If Unix-style filenames are requested then Unix-style
(native) filenames will be returned. Note that to force fal
to display the contents of a directory with Unix-style names
the <br>
name must end in a slash or have some form of wildcard
character in it. <br>
When returning VMS-style filenames, all names will be
converted to upper case, directories will have .DIR appended
to them and all filenames will have a version number of 1.
In <br>
addition fal will construct a volume and directory syntax
for the directory that will look familiar to VMS users. Of
course it also understands this syntax when files and
direc&acirc; <br>
tories are requested of it. One of the problems with this is
that Unix filenames with non-VMS syntax (eg double dots or
&quot;funny&quot; characters) or files with uppercase letter
in <br>
their names will not be accessible from VMS using VMS
syntax. You must use Unix syntax to access these files
through FAL. <br>
The options below affect the behaviour of fal. If you are
using dnetd then these options should be specified in the
dnetd.conf(5) file. <br>
By default all files sent by fal will be sent in STREAMLF
format. This is configurable by the many command-line
switches detailed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l Set logging options. The following are available: <br>
-lm Log to /dev/mono. (only useful if you have my mono
monitor driver or mdacon and a second monitor) <br>
-le Log to stderr. Use this for debugging or testing
combined with -d. <br>
-ls Log to syslog(3). This is the default if no options are
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Set algorithm for
automatically selecting file types. <br>
-ag Guess file type based on first few bytes <br>
-ae Check file extension against a table <br>
By default all files will be sent/received as STREAMLF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Specify the filename used to check file extensions. Only
valid with -ae. The format if the file is simple: <br>
extension &lt;b/r&gt; &lt;block size&gt;. <br>
In fact, &rsquo;r&rsquo; is more of a comment than an
instruction but it may be used in future to support proper
variable-length record files. <br>
By default an internal table is used with some common file
extensions. It is as follows: <br>
#Generic types <br>
.txt r <br>
.c r <br>
.cc r <br>
.log r <br>
.html r <br>
# VMS types <br>
.com r <br>
.lis r <br>
.bck b 32256 <br>
.save b 8192 <br>
.exe b 512 <br>
.zip b 512 <br>
#Linux types <br>
.tar b 10240 <br>
.gz b 512 <br>
.tgz b 512 <br>
.bz2 b 512 <br>
# End of file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Enable users to override the
two above options with a .fal_auto file in her/his home
directory. This file should contain a single word: guess,
ext or none. Note that -u <br>
and a .fal_auto file takes effect even if no -a option is
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Use the meta-file directory
(normally named .fal) to store file attributes. Metafiles
will override any guessed or checked file attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Instruct FAL for look for
.$ADF$ files created by the NFS Client in TCP/IP for VMS
V5.0+ and use them to get file attributes. This option can
be used with the -m and -a <br>
flags in which case a .$ADF$ takes precedence over a fal
metafile or a guessed file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;virtual root&gt; <br>
Run FAL in a &quot;virtual root&quot;. All file accesses
will be done below this directory rather than the normal
root filesystem. ie access for &quot;/&quot; or
&quot;SYSDISK:[000000]&quot; will start <br>
at the specified directory. Requests for &quot;..&quot; will
be refused. NOTE: This is not a chroot, fal still runs in
the normal filesystem. also note that this will lose the
<br>
ability to access users home directories: all users doing a
&quot;DIR LINUX::*.*&quot; from VMS will see the virtual
root instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Don&rsquo;t fork and run the
background. Use this for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose. The more of these
there are the more verbose fal will be. Don&rsquo;t use more
than one for normal operation because it will seriously
impair performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h -? Displays help for using
the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show the version of fal.</p>
