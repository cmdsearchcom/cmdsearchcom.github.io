<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
puppet-agent - The puppet agent daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Retrieves the client configuration from the puppet master
and applies it to the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This service may be run as a
daemon, run periodically using cron (or something similar),
or run interactively for testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is the main puppet client. Its job is to retrieve the
local machine&Acirc;&acute;s configuration from a remote
server and apply it. In order to successfully communicate
with the remote <br>
server, the client must have a certificate signed by a
certificate authority that the server trusts; the
recommended method for this, at the moment, is to run a
certificate <br>
authority as part of the puppet server (which is the
default). The client will connect and request a signed
certificate, and will continue connecting until it receives
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the client has a signed
certificate, it will retrieve its configuration and apply
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE NOTES <br>
&Acirc;&acute;puppet agent&Acirc;&acute; does its best to
find a compromise between interactive use and daemon use.
Run with no arguments and no configuration, it will go into
the background, attempt to <br>
get a signed certificate, and retrieve and apply its
configuration every 30 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some flags are meant
specifically for interactive use -- in particular,
&Acirc;&acute;test&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;tags&Acirc;&acute; or
&Acirc;&acute;fingerprint&Acirc;&acute; are useful.
&Acirc;&acute;test&Acirc;&acute; enables verbose logging,
causes the daemon to stay in <br>
the foreground, exits if the server&Acirc;&acute;s
configuration is invalid (this happens if, for instance,
you&Acirc;&acute;ve left a syntax error on the server), and
exits after running the configura&acirc; <br>
tion once (rather than hanging around as a long-running
process).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;tags&Acirc;&acute;
allows you to specify what portions of a configuration you
want to apply. Puppet elements are tagged with all of the
class or definition names that contain them, and you <br>
can use the &Acirc;&acute;tags&Acirc;&acute; flag to specify
one of these names, causing only configuration elements
contained within that class or definition to be applied.
This is very useful when you <br>
are testing new configurations -- for instance, if you are
just starting to manage &Acirc;&acute;ntpd&Acirc;&acute;,
you would put all of the new elements into an
&Acirc;&acute;ntpd&Acirc;&acute; class, and call puppet with
<br>
&Acirc;&acute;--tags ntpd&Acirc;&acute;, which would only
apply that small portion of the configuration during your
testing, rather than applying the whole thing.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;fingerprint&Acirc;&acute;
is a one-time flag. In this mode &Acirc;&acute;puppet
agent&Acirc;&acute; will run once and display on the console
(and in the log) the current certificate (or certificate
request) finger&acirc; <br>
print. Providing the &Acirc;&acute;--digest&Acirc;&acute;
option allows to use a different digest algorithm to
generate the fingerprint. The main use is to verify that
before signing a certificate request <br>
on the master, the certificate request the master received
is the same as the one the client sent (to prevent against
man-in-the-middle attacks when signing certificates).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Note that any Puppet setting that&Acirc;&acute;s valid in
the configuration file is also a valid long argument. For
example, &Acirc;&acute;server&Acirc;&acute; is a valid
setting, so you can specify &Acirc;&acute;--server
server&acirc; <br>
name&Acirc;&acute; as an argument. Boolean settings
translate into &Acirc;&acute;--setting&Acirc;&acute; and
&Acirc;&acute;--no-setting&Acirc;&acute; pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the configuration file
documentation at
https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/stable/configuration.html
for the full list of acceptable settings. A commented list
of all <br>
settings can also be generated by running puppet agent with
&Acirc;&acute;--genconfig&Acirc;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--certname <br>
Set the certname (unique ID) of the client. The master reads
this unique identifying string, which is usually set to the
node&Acirc;&acute;s fully-qualified domain name, to
determine <br>
which configurations the node will receive. Use this option
to debug setup problems or implement unusual node
identification schemes. (This is a Puppet setting, and can
go <br>
in puppet.conf.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemonize <br>
Send the process into the background. This is the default.
(This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note
the special &Acirc;&acute;no-&Acirc;&acute; prefix for
boolean settings on the <br>
command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-daemonize <br>
Do not send the process into the background. (This is a
Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special
&Acirc;&acute;no-&Acirc;&acute; prefix for boolean settings
on the command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Enable full debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detailed-exitcodes <br>
Provide transaction information via exit codes. If this is
enabled, an exit code of &Acirc;&acute;2&Acirc;&acute; means
there were changes, an exit code of
&Acirc;&acute;4&Acirc;&acute; means there were failures
during the <br>
transaction, and an exit code of
&Acirc;&acute;6&Acirc;&acute; means there were both changes
and failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--digest <br>
Change the certificate fingerprinting digest algorithm. The
default is SHA256. Valid values depends on the version of
OpenSSL installed, but will likely contain MD5, MD2, <br>
SHA1 and SHA256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable <br>
Disable working on the local system. This puts a lock file
in place, causing &Acirc;&acute;puppet agent&Acirc;&acute;
not to work on the system until the lock file is removed.
This is useful if you <br>
are testing a configuration and do not want the central
configuration to override the local state until everything
is tested and committed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disable can also take an
optional message that will be reported by the
&Acirc;&acute;puppet agent&Acirc;&acute; at the next
disabled run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;puppet
agent&Acirc;&acute; uses the same lock file while it is
running, so no more than one &Acirc;&acute;puppet
agent&Acirc;&acute; process is working at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;puppet
agent&Acirc;&acute; exits after executing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable <br>
Enable working on the local system. This removes any lock
file, causing &Acirc;&acute;puppet agent&Acirc;&acute; to
start managing the local system again (although it will
continue to use its nor&acirc; <br>
mal scheduling, so it might not start for another half
hour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;puppet
agent&Acirc;&acute; exits after executing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fingerprint <br>
Display the current certificate or certificate signing
request fingerprint and then exit. Use the
&Acirc;&acute;--digest&Acirc;&acute; option to change the
digest algorithm used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print this help
message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logdest <br>
Where to send log messages. Choose between
&Acirc;&acute;syslog&Acirc;&acute; (the POSIX syslog
service), &Acirc;&acute;eventlog&Acirc;&acute; (the Windows
Event Log), &Acirc;&acute;console&Acirc;&acute;, or the path
to a log file. If debugging or <br>
verbosity is enabled, this defaults to
&Acirc;&acute;console&Acirc;&acute;. Otherwise, it defaults
to &Acirc;&acute;syslog&Acirc;&acute; on POSIX systems and
&Acirc;&acute;eventlog&Acirc;&acute; on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A path ending with
&Acirc;&acute;.json&Acirc;&acute; will receive structured
output in JSON format. The log file will not have an ending
&Acirc;&acute;]&Acirc;&acute; automatically written to it
due to the appending nature <br>
of logging. It must be appended manually to make the content
valid JSON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--masterport <br>
The port on which to contact the puppet master. (This is a
Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noop Use
&Acirc;&acute;noop&Acirc;&acute; mode where the daemon runs
in a no-op or dry-run mode. This is useful for seeing what
changes Puppet will make without actually executing the
changes. (This is <br>
a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf. Note the
special &Acirc;&acute;no-&Acirc;&acute; prefix for boolean
settings on the command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--onetime <br>
Run the configuration once. Runs a single (normally
daemonized) Puppet run. Useful for interactively running
puppet agent when used in conjunction with the
--no-daemonize <br>
option. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in
puppet.conf. Note the special
&Acirc;&acute;no-&Acirc;&acute; prefix for boolean settings
on the command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test Enable the most common
options used for testing. These are
&Acirc;&acute;onetime&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;verbose&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;ignorecache&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;no-daemonize&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;no-usecacheonfailure&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;detailed-exitcodes&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;no-splay&Acirc;&acute;, <br>
and &Acirc;&acute;show_diff&Acirc;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Turn on verbose reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the puppet version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--waitforcert <br>
This option only matters for daemons that do not yet have
certificates and it is enabled by default, with a value of
120 (seconds). This causes &Acirc;&acute;puppet
agent&Acirc;&acute; to connect <br>
to the server every 2 minutes and ask it to sign a
certificate request. This is useful for the initial setup of
a puppet client. You can turn off waiting for certificates
<br>
by specifying a time of 0. (This is a Puppet setting, and
can go in puppet.conf. Note the special
&Acirc;&acute;no-&Acirc;&acute; prefix for boolean settings
on the command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
$ puppet agent --server puppet.domain.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Puppet agent accepts the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP Restart the puppet agent
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT and SIGTERM <br>
Shut down the puppet agent daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Immediately retrieve and apply configurations from the
puppet master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
Close file descriptors for log files and reopen them. Used
with logrotate.</p>
