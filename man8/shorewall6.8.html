<p style="margin-top: 1em">shorewall6 [trace|debug]
[-options] version [-a]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The shorewall6 utility is used to control the Shoreline
Firewall 6 (Shorewall6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The trace and debug options are used for debugging. See
http://www.shorewall.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm#Trace[1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nolock option prevents the
command from attempting to acquire the Shorewall6 lockfile.
It is useful if you need to include shorewall6 commands in
/etc/shorewall6/started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options control the amount
of output that the command produces. They consist of a
sequence of the letters v and q. If the options are omitted,
the amount of output is <br>
determined by the setting of the VERBOSITY parameter in
shorewall6.conf[2](5). Each v adds one to the effective
verbosity and each q subtracts one from the effective
VERBOSITY. <br>
Alternatively, v may be followed immediately with one of
-1,0,1,2 to specify a specify VERBOSITY. There may be no
white-space between v and the VERBOSITY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options may also include the
letter t which causes all progress messages to be
timestamped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The available commands are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add { interface[:host-list]...
zone | zone host-list } <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.21. Adds a list of hosts or subnets
to a dynamic zone usually used with VPN&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interface argument names an
interface defined in the shorewall6-interfaces[3](5) file. A
host-list is comma-separated list whose elements are host or
network <br>
addresses..if n .sp <br>
Caution <br>
The add command is not very robust. If there are errors in
the host-list, you may see a large number of error messages
yet a subsequent shorewall show zones command will <br>
indicate that all hosts were added. If this happens, replace
add by delete and run the same command again. Then enter the
correct command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.9,
the dynamic_shared zone option (shorewall6-zones[4](5))
allows a single ipset to handle entries for multiple
interfaces. When that option is <br>
specified for a zone, the add command has the alternative
syntax in which the zone name precedes the host-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow address <br>
Re-enables receipt of packets from hosts previously
blacklisted by a drop, logdrop, reject, or logreject
command. Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.10, this command can
also <br>
re-enable addresses blacklisted using the blacklist
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blacklist address [ option ... ]
<br>
Added in Shorewall 5.0.8 and requires
DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=ipset.. in shorewall6.conf[2](5). Causes
packets from the given host or network address to be
dropped, based on the <br>
setting of BLACKLIST in shorewall6.conf[2](5). The address
along with any options are passed to the ipset add
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the disconnect option is
specified in the DYNAMIC_BLACKLISTING setting, then the
effective VERBOSITY determines the amount of information
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the effective
verbosity is &gt; 0, then a message giving the number of
conntrack flows deleted by the command is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the effective
verbosity is &gt; 1, then the conntrack table entries
deleted by the command are also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call function [ parameter ... ]
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.10. Allows you to call a function in
one of the Shorewall libraries or in your compiled script.
function must name the shell function to be called. The <br>
listed parameters are passed to the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function is first searched
for in lib.base, lib.common, lib.cli and lib.cli-std. If it
is not found, the call command is passed to the generated
script to be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check [-e] [-d] [-p] [-r] [-T]
[-i] [directory] <br>
Compiles the configuration in the specified directory and
discards the compiled output script. If no directory is
given, then /etc/shorewall6 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option causes the
compiler to look for a file named capabilities. This file is
produced using the command shorewall6-lite show -f
capabilities &gt; capabilities on a <br>
system with Shorewall6 Lite installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option causes the
compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option causes the
compiler to be profiled via the Perl -wd:DProf command-line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option was added in
Shorewall 4.5.2 and causes the compiler to print the
generated ruleset to standard out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T option was added in
Shorewall 4.4.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be
included with each compiler-generated error and warning
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if
the current line contains alternative input specifications
following a semicolon <br>
(&quot;;&quot;). Such lines will be handled incorrectly if
INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall6.conf(5)[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear [-f] <br>
Clear will remove all rules and chains installed by
Shorewall6. The firewall is then wide open and unprotected.
Existing connections are untouched. Clear is often used to
see <br>
if the firewall is causing connection problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close { open-number | source
dest [ protocol [ port ] ] } <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.5.8. This command closes a temporary
open created by the open command. In the first form, an
open-number specifies the open to be closed. Open numbers
<br>
are displayed in the num column of the output of the
shorewall6 show opens command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the second form of the
command is used, the parameters must match those given in
the earlier open command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compile [-e] [-c] [-d] [-p] [-T]
[-i] [directory] [pathname ] <br>
Compiles the current configuration into the executable file
pathname. If a directory is supplied, Shorewall6 will look
in that directory first for configuration files. If the <br>
pathname is omitted, the file firewall in the VARDIR
(normally /var/lib/shorewall/) is assumed. A pathname of
&rsquo;-&rsquo; causes the compiler to send the generated
script to it&rsquo;s <br>
standard output file. Note that &rsquo;-v-1&rsquo; is
usually specified in this case (e.g., shorewall6 -v-1
compile -- -) to suppress the &rsquo;Compiling...&rsquo;
message normally generated by <br>
/sbin/shorewall6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -e is specified, the
compilation is being performed on a system other than where
the compiled script will run. This option disables certain
configuration options that <br>
require the script to be compiled where it is to be run. The
use of -e requires the presence of a configuration file
named capabilities which may be produced using the <br>
command shorewall6-lite show -f capabilities &gt;
capabilities on a system with Shorewall6 Lite installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option was added in
Shorewall 4.5.17 and causes conditional compilation of a
script. The script specified by pathname (or implied if
pathname is omitted) is compiled <br>
if it doesn&rsquo;t exist or if there is any file in the
directory or in a directory on the CONFIG_PATH that has a
modification time later than the file to be compiled. When
no <br>
compilation is needed, a message is issued and an exit
status of zero is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option causes the
compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option causes the
compiler to be profiled via the Perl -wd:DProf command-line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T option was added in
Shorewall 4.4.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be
included with each compiler-generated error and warning
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if
the current line contains alternative input specifications
following a semicolon <br>
(&quot;;&quot;). Such lines will be handled incorrectly if
INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall6.conf(5)[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete {
interface[:host-list]... zone | zone host-list } <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.21. The delete command reverses the
effect of an earlier add command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interface argument names an
interface defined in the shorewall6-interfaces[3](5) file. A
host-list is comma-separated list whose elements are a host
or network address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.9,
the dynamic_shared zone option (shorewall6-zones[4](5))
allows a single ipset to handle entries for multiple
interfaces. When that option is <br>
specified for a zone, the delete command has the alternative
syntax in which the zone name precedes the host-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable { interface | provider }
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Disables the optional provider
associated with the specified interface or provider. Where
more than one provider share a single network interface,
<br>
a provider name must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.10,
this command may be used with any optional network
interface. interface may be either the logical or physical
name of the interface. The <br>
command removes any routes added from
shorewall6-routes[5](5) and any traffic shaping
configuration for the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drop address <br>
Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be silently
dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump [-x] [-l] [-m] [-c] <br>
Produces a verbose report about the firewall configuration
for the purpose of problem analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -x option causes actual
packet and byte counts to be displayed. Without that option,
these counts are abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option causes any MAC
addresses included in Shorewall6 log messages to be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option causes the rule
number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option causes the route
cache to be dumped in addition to the other routing
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable { interface | provider }
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Enables the optional provider
associated with the specified interface or provider. Where
more than one provider share a single network interface, a
<br>
provider name must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.10,
this command may be used with any optional network
interface. interface may be either the logical or physical
name of the interface. The <br>
command sets /proc entries for the interface, adds any route
specified in shorewall6-routes[5](5) and installs the
interface&rsquo;s traffic shaping configuration, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export [directory1 ]
[user@]system[:directory2 ] <br>
If directory1 is omitted, the current working directory is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows a non-root user to
compile a shorewall6 script and stage it on a system
(provided that the user has access to the system via ssh).
The command is equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/sbin/shorewall6 compile -e
directory1 directory1/firewall &amp;&amp; scp
directory1/firewall directory1/firewall.conf
[user@]system:[directory2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, the
configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is
compiled to a file called firewall in that directory. If
compilation succeeds, then firewall <br>
and firewall.conf are copied to system using scp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forget [ filename ] <br>
Deletes /var/lib/shorewall6/filename and
/var/lib/shorewall6/save. If no filename is given then the
file specified by RESTOREFILE in shorewall6.conf[2](5) is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Displays a syntax summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iptrace ip6tables match
expression <br>
This is a low-level debugging command that causes iptables
TRACE log records to be created. See ip6tables(8) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ip6tables match expression
must be one or more matches that may appear in both the raw
table OUTPUT and raw table PREROUTING chains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The log message destination is
determined by the currently-selected IPv6 logging
backend[6].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list <br>
list is a synonym for show -- please see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logdrop address <br>
Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be logged then
discarded. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the
BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in shorewall6.conf[2] (5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch [-m] [refresh-interval]
<br>
Monitors the log file specified by the LOGFILE option in
shorewall6.conf[2](5) and produces an audible alarm when new
Shorewall6 messages are logged. The -m option causes the
<br>
MAC address of each packet source to be displayed if that
information is available. The refresh-interval specifies the
time in seconds between screen refreshes. You can enter <br>
a negative number by preceding the number with
&quot;--&quot; (e.g., shorewall6 logwatch -- -30). In this
case, when a packet count changes, you will be prompted to
hit any key to <br>
resume screen refreshes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logreject address <br>
Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be logged then
rejected. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the
BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in shorewall6.conf[2] (5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls <br>
ls is a synonym for show -- please see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noiptrace ip6tables match
expression <br>
This is a low-level debugging command that cancels a trace
started by a preceding iptrace command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The iptables match expression
must be one given in the iptrace command being canceled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open source dest [ protocol [
port ] ] <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.8. This command requires that the
firewall be in the started state and that
DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall6.conf (5)[2]. The effect
of the command <br>
is to temporarily open the firewall for connections matching
the parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source and dest parameters
may each be specified as all if you don&rsquo;t wish to
restrict the connection source or destination respectively.
Otherwise, each must contain a <br>
host or network address or a valid DNS name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol may be specified
either as a number or as a name listed in /etc/protocols.
The port may be specified numerically or as a name listed in
/etc/services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reverse the effect of a
successful open command, use the close command with the same
parameters or simply restart the firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: To open the firewall
for SSH connections to address 2001:470:b:227::1, the
command would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shorewall6 open all
2001:470:b:227::1 tcp 22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reverse that command,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shorewall6 close all
2001:470:b:227::1 tcp 22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reenable{ interface | provider }
<br>
Added in Shorewall 4.6.9. This is equivalent to a disable
command followed by an enable command on the specified
interface or provider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh [-n] [-d] [-T] [-i]
[-Ddirectory ] [ chain... ] <br>
All steps performed by restart are performed by refresh with
the exception that refresh only recreates the chains
specified in the command while restart recreates the entire
<br>
Netfilter ruleset.When no chain name is given to the refresh
command, the mangle table is refreshed along with the
blacklist chain (if any). This allows you to modify <br>
/etc/shorewall6/tcrulesand install the changes using
refresh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listed chains are assumed to
be in the filter table. You can refresh chains in other
tables by prefixing the chain name with the table name
followed by &quot;:&quot; (e.g., <br>
nat:net_dnat). Chain names which follow are assumed to be in
that table until the end of the list or until an entry in
the list names another table. Built-in chains such as <br>
FORWARD may not be refreshed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option was added in
Shorewall 4.5.3 causes Shorewall to avoid updating the
routing table(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option was added in
Shorewall 4.5.3 causes the compiler to run under the Perl
debugger.</p>

below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reload is similar to shorewall6
start except that it assumes that the firewall is already
started. Existing connections are maintained. If a directory

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option causes Shorewall6
to avoid updating the routing table(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option causes the
connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack

Only allowed if Shorewall6 is running. The current
configuration is saved in /var/lib/shorewall6/safe-restart

done. <br>
You will then be prompted asking if you want to accept the
new configuration or not. If you answer &quot;n&quot; or if
you fail to answer within 60 seconds (such as when your new
<br>
configuration has disabled communication with your
terminal), the configuration is restored from the saved

look <br>
in that directory first when opening configuration
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0,
you may specify a different timeout value using the -t
option. The numeric timeout may optionally be followed by an
s, m or h suffix (e.g., <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">savesets <br>
Added in shorewall 4.6.8. Performs the same action as the
stop command with respect to saving ipsets (see the
SAVE_IPSETS option in shorewall6.conf[2] (5)). This command
may <br>
be used to proactively save your ipset contents in the event
that a system failure occurs prior to issuing a stop

ip6tables and causes actual packet and byte counts to be
displayed. Without this option, those counts are
abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-f] capabilities <br>
Displays your kernel/ip6tables capabilities. The -f option

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-b] [-x] [-l] [-t
{filter|mangle|nat|raw|rawpost}][ chain... ] <br>
The rules in each chain are displayed using the ip6tables
-Lchain-n -v command. If no chain is given, all of the
chains in the filter table are displayed. The -x option <br>
is passed directly through to ip6tables and causes actual
packet and byte counts to be displayed. Without this option,
those counts are abbreviated. The -t option <br>
specifies the Netfilter table to display. The default is
filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b (&rsquo;brief&rsquo;)
option causes rules which have not been used (i.e. which
have zero packet and byte counts) to be omitted from the
output. Chains with no rules displayed <br>
are also omitted from the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option causes the rule
number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -t option and the chain
keyword are both omitted and any of the listed chains do not
exist, a usage message is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macros <br>
Displays information about each macro defined on the
firewall system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macro macro <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.6. Displays the file that implements
the specified macro (usually
/usr/share/shorewall6/macro.macro).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-x] mangle <br>
Displays the Netfilter mangle table using the command
ip6tables -t mangle -L -n -v.The -x option is passed
directly through to ip6tables and causes actual packet and
byte <br>
counts to be displayed. Without this option, those counts
are abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">marks <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Displays the various fields in
packet marks giving the min and max value (in both decimal
and hex) and the applicable mask (in hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-x] nat <br>
Displays the Netfilter nat table using the command ip6tables
-t nat -L -n -v. The -x option is passed directly through to
ip6tables and causes actual packet and byte <br>
counts to be displayed. Without this option, those counts
are abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opens <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.5.8. Displays the iptables rules in the
&rsquo;dynamic&rsquo; chain created through use of the open
command..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policies <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.4. Displays the applicable policy
between each pair of zones. Note that implicit intrazone
ACCEPT policies are not displayed for zones associated <br>
with a single network where that network doesn&rsquo;t
specify routeback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-x] raw <br>
Displays the Netfilter raw table using the command ip6tables
-t raw -L -n -v. The -x option is passed directly through to
ip6tables and causes actual packet and byte <br>
counts to be displayed. Without this option, those counts
are abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-c] routing <br>
Displays the system&rsquo;s IPv6 routing configuration. The
-c option causes the route cache to be displayed in addition
to the other routing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc <br>
Displays information about queuing disciplines, classes and
filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zones <br>

the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start [-n] [-p] [-d] [-f] [-c]
[-T] [-i] [-C] [ directory ] <br>
Start shorewall6. Existing connections through shorewall6
managed interfaces are untouched. New connections will be
allowed only if they are allowed by the firewall rules or
<br>
policies. If a directory is included in the command,
Shorewall6 will look in that directory first for
configuration files. If -f is specified, the saved
configuration <br>
specified by the RESTOREFILE option in shorewall6.conf[2](5)
will be restored if that saved configuration exists and has
been modified more recently than the files in <br>
/etc/shorewall6. When -f is given, a directory may not be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update: In Shorewall6 4.4.20, a
new LEGACY_FASTSTART option was added to
shorewall6.conf[2](5). When LEGACY_FASTSTART=No, the
modification times of files in /etc/shorewall6 <br>
are compared with that of /var/lib/shorewall6/firewall (the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.5 and is only meaningful when the -f option is
also specified. If the previously-saved configuration is
restored, and if the -C <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop [-f] <br>
Stops the firewall. All existing connections, except those
listed in shorewall6-routestopped[8](5) or permitted by the
ADMINISABSENTMINDED option in shorewall6.conf[2](5), <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.2 and causes the status of each optional or
provider interface to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">try directory [ timeout ] <br>
If Shorewall6 is started then the firewall state is saved to
a temporary saved configuration (/var/lib/shorewall6/.try).
Next, if Shorewall6 is currently started then a <br>
restart command is issued using the specified configuration
directory; otherwise, a start command is performed using the
specified configuration directory. If an error occurs <br>
during the compilation phase of the restart or start , the
command terminates without changing the Shorewall6 state. If
an error occurs during the restart phase, then a <br>
shorewall6 restore is performed using the saved
configuration. If an error occurs during the start phase,
then Shorewall6 is cleared. If the start/ restart succeeds
and a <br>
timeout is specified then a clear or restore is performed
after timeout seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0,
the numeric timeout may optionally be followed by an s, m or
h suffix (e.g., 5m) to specify seconds, minutes or hours
respectively. If the <br>
suffix is omitted, seconds is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update [-d] [-r] [-T] [-a] [-i]
[-A] [ directory ] <br>
Added in Shorewall 4.4.21 and causes the compiler to update
/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf then validate the
configuration. The update will add options not present in
the old <br>
file with their default values, and will move deprecated
options with non-defaults to a deprecated options section at
the bottom of the file. Your existing shorewall.conf <br>
file is renamed shorewall.conf.bak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command was extended over
the years with a set of options that caused additional
configuration updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert an
existing blacklist file into an equivalent blrules file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert an
existing routestopped file into an equivalent stoppedrules
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert existing
tcrules and tos files into an equivalent mangle file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert an
existing notrack file into an equivalent conntrack file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert FORMAT,
SECTION and COMMENT entries into ?FORMAT, ?SECTION and
?COMMENT directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In each case, the old file is
renamed with a .bak suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Shorewall 5.0.0, the options
were eliminated and the update command performs all of the
updates described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important <br>
There are some notable restrictions with the update
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Converted rules will be
appended to the existing file; if there is no existing file
in the CONFIG_PATH, one will be created in the directory
specified in the command <br>
or in the first entry in the CONFIG_PATH (normally
/etc/shorewall6) otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Existing comments in the file
being converted will not be transferred to the output
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. INCLUDEd files will be
expanded inline in the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Columns in the output file
will be separated by a single tab character; there is no
attempt made to otherwise align the columns. <br>
The -a option causes the updated shorewall.conf file to be
annotated with documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option was added in
Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if
the current line contains alternative input specifications
following a semicolon <br>
(&quot;;&quot;). Such lines will be handled incorrectly if
INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[9](5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -A option is included for
compatibility with Shorewall 4.6 and is equivalent to
specifying the -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a description of the other
options, see the check command above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version [-a] <br>
Displays Shorewall6&rsquo;s version. If the -a option is
included, the version of Shorewall will also be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
In general, when a command succeeds, status 0 is returned;
when the command fails, a non-zero status is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status command returns exit
status as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Firewall is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 - Firewall is stopped or
cleared</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 - Unknown state; usually means
that the firewall has never been started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Two environmental variables are recognized by
Shorewall6:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT <br>
When set to 1, causes Std out to be redirected to the file
specified in the STARTUP_LOG option in
shorewall6.conf(5)[7].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SW_LOGGERTAG <br>
Added in Shorewall 5.0.8. When set to a non-empty value,
that value is passed to the logger utility in its -t (--tag)
option.</p>
