<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_ses_microcode - send microcode to a SCSI enclosure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_ses_microcode [--bpw=CS] [--help] [--id=ID] [--in=FILE]
[--length=LEN] [--mode=MO] [--non] [--offset=OFF]
[--skip=SKIP] [--subenc=MS] [--tlength=TLEN] [--verbose]
[--version] <br>
DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility attempts to download microcode to an enclosure
(or one of its sub-enclosures) associated with the DEVICE.
The process for doing this is defined in the SCSI Enclosure
<br>
Services (SES) standards and drafts maintained by the T10
committee.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The process is to send one or
more sequences containing a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command
followed optionally by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command.
The former sends a Download <br>
microcode Control diagnostic page (dpage) and the latter
fetches a Download microcode status dpage which can be
viewed as a report on the former command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default action (i.e. when
the --mode=MO option is not given) is to fetch the Download
microcode status dpage and decode it. This does not require
the microcode (firmware) <br>
itself so the --in=FILE option is not required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most recent reference for
this utility is the draft SCSI Enclosure Services 3 (SES-3)
document T10/2149-D Revision 7 at http://www.t10.org .
Existing standards for SES and <br>
SES-2 are ANSI INCITS 305-1998 and ANSI INCITS 448-2008
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most other support for SES in
this package (apart from downloading microcode) can be found
in the sg_ses utility. Another way of downloading firmware
to a SCSI device is with the <br>
WRITE BUFFER command defined in SPC-4, see the
sg_write_buffer utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bpw=CS <br>
where CS is the chunk size in bytes and should be a multiple
of 4. This will be the maximum number of bytes sent per SEND
DIAGNOSTIC command. So if CS is less than the <br>
effective length of the microcode then multiple SEND
DIAGNOSTIC commands are sent, each taking the next chunk
from the read data and increasing the buffer offset field in
<br>
the Download microcode control dpage by the appropriate
amount. The default is a chunk size of 0 which is
interpreted as a very large number hence only one SEND
DIAGNOSTIC <br>
command will be sent. <br>
The number in CS can optionally be followed by
&quot;,act&quot; or &quot;,activate&quot;. In this case
after the microcode has been successfully sent to the
DEVICE, an additional Download <br>
microcode control dpage with its mode set to &quot;Activate
deferred microcode&quot; [0xf] is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit. If used multiple times
also prints the mode names and their acronyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --id=ID <br>
this option sets the BUFFER ID field in the Download
microcode control dpage. ID is a value between 0 (default)
and 255 inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --in=FILE <br>
read data from file FILE that will be sent with the SEND
DIAGNOSTIC command. If FILE is &rsquo;-&rsquo; then stdin is
read until an EOF is detected (this is the same action as
<br>
--raw). Data is read from the beginning of FILE except in
the case when it is a regular file and the --skip=SKIP
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --length=LEN <br>
where LEN is the length, in bytes, of data to be written to
the device. If not given (and the length cannot be deduced
from --in=FILE or --raw) then defaults to zero. If <br>
the option is given and the length deduced from --in=FILE or
--raw is less (or no data is provided), then bytes of 0xff
are used as fill bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mode=MO <br>
this option sets the MODE. MO is a value between 0 (which is
dmc_status and the default) and 255 inclusive. Alternatively
an abbreviation can be given. See the MODES sec&acirc; <br>
tion below. To list the available mode abbreviations at run
time give an invalid one (e.g. &rsquo;--mode=xxx&rsquo;) or
use the &rsquo;-h&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --non <br>
allow for non-standard implementations that reset their
Download microcode engine after a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
command with the Download microcode status dpage is <br>
sent. When this option is given sending that command and
dpage combination is avoided unless an error has already
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --offset=OFF <br>
this option sets the BUFFER OFFSET field in the Download
microcode control dpage. OFF is a value between 0 (default)
and 2**32-1 . It is a byte offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --skip=SKIP <br>
this option is only active when --in=FILE is given and FILE
is a regular file, rather than stdin. Data is read starting
at byte offset SKIP to the end of file (or the <br>
amount given by --length=LEN). If not given the byte offset
defaults to 0 (i.e. the start of the file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --subenc=SEID <br>
SEID is the subenclosure identify. It defaults to 0 which is
the primary enclosure identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tlength=TLEN <br>
TLEN is the total length in bytes of the microcode to be (or
being) downloaded. It defaults to 0 which is okay in most
cases. This option is only needed when sections of <br>
microcode and being sent in separate invocations of this
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
Following is a list accepted by the MO argument of this
utility. First shown is an acronym followed in square
brackets by the corresponding decimal and hex values that
may also <br>
be given for MO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmc_status [0, 0x0] <br>
Use RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS to fetch the Download
microcode status dpage and print it out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmc_offs [6, 0x6] <br>
Download microcode with offsets and activate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmc_offs_save [7, 0x7] <br>
Download microcode with offsets, save, and activate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmc_offs_defer [14, 0xe] <br>
Download microcode with offsets, save, and defer
activate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">activate_mc [15, 0xf] <br>
Activate deferred microcode. There is no follow-up RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS to fetch the Download microcode status
dpage since the DEVICE might be resetting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from dmc_status, these are
placed in the Download microcode mode field in the Download
microcode control dpage. In the case of dmc_status the
Download microcode status <br>
dpage is fetch with the RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command
and decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHEN THE DOWNLOAD FAILS <br>
Firstly, if it succeeds, this utility should stay silent and
return. Typically vendors will change the
&quot;revision&quot; string (which is 4 characters long)
whenever they release new <br>
firmware. That can be seen in the response to a SCSI INQUIRY
command, for example by using the sg_inq utility. It is
possible that the device needs to be power cycled before the
<br>
new microcode becomes active. Also if mode dmc_offs_defer
[0xe] is used to download the microcode, then another
invocation with activate_mc may be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If something goes wrong, there
will typically be messages printed out by this utility. The
first thing to check is the microcode (firmware) file
itself. Is it designed for the <br>
device model; has it been corrupted, and if downgrading
(i.e. trying to re-instate older firmware), does the vendor
allow that?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting new firmware on a device
is a delicate operation that is not always well defined by
T10&rsquo;s standards and drafts. One might speculate that
they are deliberately vague. In <br>
testing this utility one vendor&rsquo;s interpretation of
the standard was somewhat surprising. The --non option was
added to cope with their interpretation. So if the above
sugges&acirc; <br>
tions don&rsquo;t help, try adding the --non option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This utility can handle a maximum size of 128 MB of
microcode which should be sufficient for most purposes. In a
system that is memory constrained, such large allocations of
mem&acirc; <br>
ory may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user should be aware that
most operating systems have limits on the amount of data
that can be sent with one SCSI command. In Linux this
depends on the pass through mechanism <br>
used (e.g. block SG_IO or the sg driver) and various setting
in sysfs in the Linux lk 2.6/3 series (e.g.
/sys/block/sda/queue/max_sectors_kb). Devices (i.e. logical
units) also <br>
typically have limits on the maximum amount of data they can
handle in one command. These two limitations suggest that
modes containing the word &quot;offset&quot; together with
the <br>
--bpw=CS option are required as firmware files get larger
and larger. And CS can be quite small, for example 4096
bytes, resulting in many SEND DIAGNOSTIC commands being
sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact error from the
non-standard implementation was a sense key of ILLEGAL
REQUEST and an asc/ascq code of 0x26,0x0 which is
&quot;Invalid field in parameter list&quot;. If that is <br>
seen try again with the --non option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Downloading incorrect microcode
into a device has the ability to render that device
inoperable. One would hope that the device vendor verifies
the data before activating it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A long (operating system)
timeout of 7200 seconds is set on each SEND DIAGNOSTIC
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All numbers given with options
are assumed to be decimal. Alternatively numerical values
can be given in hexadecimal preceded by either
&quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot; (or has a trailing
&quot;h&quot; or <br>
&quot;H&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If no microcode/firmware file is given then this utility
fetches and decodes the Download microcode status dpage
which could possibly show another initiator in the process
of <br>
updating the microcode. Even if that is happening, fetching
the status page should not cause any problems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_ses_microcode /dev/sg3 <br>
Download microcode status diagnostic page: <br>
number of secondary subenclosures: 0 <br>
generation code: 0x0 <br>
subenclosure identifier: 0 [primary] <br>
download microcode status: No download microcode operation
in progress [0x0] <br>
download microcode additional status: 0x0 <br>
download microcode maximum size: 1048576 bytes <br>
download microcode expected buffer id: 0x0 <br>
download microcode expected buffer id offset: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sends new
microcode/firmware to an enclosure. Sending a 1.5 MB file in
one command caused the enclosure to lock up temporarily and
did not update the firmware. <br>
Breaking the firmware file into 4 KB chunks (an educated
guess) was more successful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_ses_microcode -b 4k -m
dmc_offs_save -I firmware.bin /dev/sg4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The firmware update occurred in
the following enclosure power cycle. With a modern enclosure
the Extended Inquiry VPD page gives indications in which
situations a firmware <br>
upgrade will take place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_ses_microcode is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
