<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This utility attempts to download microcode to an enclosure (or one of its
  sub-enclosures) associated with the <i>DEVICE</i>. The process for doing this
  is defined in the SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) standards and drafts
  maintained by the T10 committee.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The process is to send one or more sequences containing a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC
  command followed optionally by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. The
  former sends a Download microcode Control diagnostic page (dpage) and the
  latter fetches a Download microcode status dpage which can be viewed as a
  report on the former command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default action (i.e. when the <i>--mode=MO</i> option is not given) is to
  fetch the Download microcode status dpage and decode it. This does not require
  the microcode (firmware) itself so the <i>--in=FILE</i> option is not
  required.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most recent reference for this utility is the draft SCSI Enclosure Services
  3 (SES-3) document T10/2149-D Revision 7 at http://www.t10.org . Existing
  standards for SES and SES-2 are ANSI INCITS 305-1998 and ANSI INCITS 448-2008
  respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most other support for SES in this package (apart from downloading microcode)
  can be found in the sg_ses utility. Another way of downloading firmware to a
  SCSI device is with the WRITE BUFFER command defined in SPC-4, see the
  sg_write_buffer utility.

Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b>, <b>--bpw</b>=<i>CS</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">where <i>CS</i> is the chunk size in bytes and should be a
      multiple of 4. This will be the maximum number of bytes sent per SEND
      DIAGNOSTIC command. So if <i>CS</i> is less than the effective length of
      the microcode then multiple SEND DIAGNOSTIC commands are sent, each taking
      the next chunk from the read data and increasing the buffer offset field
      in the Download microcode control dpage by the appropriate amount. The
      default is a chunk size of 0 which is interpreted as a very large number
      hence only one SEND DIAGNOSTIC command will be sent.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The number in <i>CS</i> can optionally be followed by &quot;,act&quot; or
      &quot;,activate&quot;. In this case after the microcode has been
      successfully sent to the <i>DEVICE</i>, an additional Download microcode
      control dpage with its mode set to &quot;Activate deferred microcode&quot;

Apart from dmc_status, these are placed in the Download microcode mode field in
  the Download microcode control dpage. In the case of dmc_status the Download
  microcode status dpage is fetch with the RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command
  and decoded.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHEN_THE_DOWNLOAD_FAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#WHEN_THE_DOWNLOAD_FAILS">WHEN
  THE DOWNLOAD FAILS</a></h1>
Firstly, if it succeeds, this utility should stay silent and return. Typically
  vendors will change the &quot;revision&quot; string (which is 4 characters
  long) whenever they release new firmware. That can be seen in the response to
  a SCSI INQUIRY command, for example by using the sg_inq utility. It is
  possible that the device needs to be power cycled before the new microcode
  becomes active. Also if mode dmc_offs_defer [0xe] is used to download the
  microcode, then another invocation with activate_mc may be needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If something goes wrong, there will typically be messages printed out by this
  utility. The first thing to check is the microcode (firmware) file itself. Is
  it designed for the device model; has it been corrupted, and if downgrading
  (i.e. trying to re-instate older firmware), does the vendor allow that?
<div class="Pp"></div>
Getting new firmware on a device is a delicate operation that is not always well
  defined by T10's standards and drafts. One might speculate that they are
  deliberately vague. In testing this utility one vendor's interpretation of the
  standard was somewhat surprising. The <i>--non</i> option was added to cope
  with their interpretation. So if the above suggestions don't help, try adding
  the <i>--non</i> option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
This utility can handle a maximum size of 128 MB of microcode which should be
  sufficient for most purposes. In a system that is memory constrained, such
  large allocations of memory may fail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user should be aware that most operating systems have limits on the amount
  of data that can be sent with one SCSI command. In Linux this depends on the
  pass through mechanism used (e.g. block SG_IO or the sg driver) and various
  setting in sysfs in the Linux lk 2.6/3 series (e.g.
  /sys/block/sda/queue/max_sectors_kb). Devices (i.e. logical units) also
  typically have limits on the maximum amount of data they can handle in one
  command. These two limitations suggest that modes containing the word
  &quot;offset&quot; together with the <i>--bpw=CS</i> option are required as
  firmware files get larger and larger. And <i>CS</i> can be quite small, for
  example 4096 bytes, resulting in many SEND DIAGNOSTIC commands being sent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exact error from the non-standard implementation was a sense key of ILLEGAL
  REQUEST and an asc/ascq code of 0x26,0x0 which is &quot;Invalid field in
  parameter list&quot;. If that is seen try again with the <i>--non</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Downloading incorrect microcode into a device has the ability to render that
  device inoperable. One would hope that the device vendor verifies the data
  before activating it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A long (operating system) timeout of 7200 seconds is set on each SEND DIAGNOSTIC
  command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All numbers given with options are assumed to be decimal. Alternatively
  numerical values can be given in hexadecimal preceded by either &quot;0x&quot;
  or &quot;0X&quot; (or has a trailing &quot;h&quot; or &quot;H&quot;).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
If no microcode/firmware file is given then this utility fetches and decodes the
  Download microcode status dpage which could possibly show another initiator in
  the process of updating the microcode. Even if that is happening, fetching the
  status page should not cause any problems:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_ses_microcode /dev/sg3

The following sends new microcode/firmware to an enclosure. Sending a 1.5 MB
  file in one command caused the enclosure to lock up temporarily and did not
  update the firmware. Breaking the firmware file into 4 KB chunks (an educated
  guess) was more successful:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_ses_microcode -b 4k -m dmc_offs_save -I firmware.bin /dev/sg4
<div class="Pp"></div>
The firmware update occurred in the following enclosure power cycle. With a
  modern enclosure the Extended Inquiry VPD page gives indications in which
  situations a firmware upgrade will take place.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT

The exit status of sg_ses_microcode is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
