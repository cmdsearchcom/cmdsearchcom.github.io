PAM, pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to <b>Linux-PAM</b>. For
  more information the reader is directed to the <b>Linux-PAM system
  administrators' guide</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Linux-PAM</b> is a system of libraries that handle the authentication tasks
  of applications (services) on the system. The library provides a stable
  general interface (Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege
  granting programs (such as <b>login</b>(1) and <b>su</b>(1)) defer to to
  perform standard authentication tasks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the
  authentication is dynamically configurable. In other words, the system
  administrator is free to choose how individual service-providing applications
  will authenticate users. This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of
  the single <b>Linux-PAM</b> configuration file /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively,
  the configuration can be set by individual configuration files located in the
  /etc/pam.d/ directory. The presence of this directory will cause
  <b>Linux-PAM</b> to <i>ignore</i>/etc/pam.conf.
<div class="Pp"></div>
From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is
  provided, it is not of primary importance to understand the internal behavior
  of the <b>Linux-PAM</b> library. The important point to recognize is that the
  configuration file(s) <i>define</i> the connection between applications (
  <b>services</b>) and the pluggable authentication modules ( <b>PAM</b>s) that
  perform the actual authentication tasks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Linux-PAM</b> separates the tasks of <i>authentication</i> into four
  independent management groups: <b>account</b> management;
  <b>auth</b>entication management; <b>password</b> management; and
  <b>session</b> management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these
  groups in the configuration file.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a typical user's
  request for a restricted service:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>account</b> - provide account verification types of service: has the user's
  password expired?; is this user permitted access to the requested service?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>auth</b>entication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials.
  Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the user must
  satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your password. Not all
  authentications are of this type, there exist hardware based authentication
  schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable
  modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for more standard approaches to
  authentication - such is the flexibility of <b>Linux-PAM</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>password</b> - this group's responsibility is the task of updating
  authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly coupled to
  those of the <b>auth</b> group. Some authentication mechanisms lend themselves
  well to being updated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based
  access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement password.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>session</b> - this group of tasks cover things that should be done prior to a
  service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such tasks include the
  maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of the user's home directory. The
  <b>session</b> management group is important as it provides both an opening
  and closing hook for modules to affect the services available to a user.
