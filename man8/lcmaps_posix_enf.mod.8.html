<p>LCMAPS_POSIX_ENF(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
LCMAPS_POSIX_ENF(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lcmaps_posix_enf.mod - LCMAPS plugin to switch user
identity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lcmaps_posix_enf.mod [-maxuid number of uids] [-maxpgid
number of primary gids] [-maxsgid number of secondary
gids]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Posix Enforcement plugin will enforce (apply) the
gathered credentials that are stacked in the datastructure
of the Plugin Manager. The plugin will get the credential
infor&acirc; <br>
mation that is gathered by one or more Acquisition plugins.
This implies that at least one Acquisition should have been
run prior to this Enforcement. All of the gathered
infor&acirc; <br>
mation will be checked by looking into the
&rsquo;passwd&rsquo; file of the system (FIXME:
shouldn&rsquo;t that be getpwent(2)?). These files have
information about all registered system account <br>
and its user groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Posix Enforcement plugin
does not check whether the secondary groups have the primary
UID as a member, so it is possible to end up with more group
memberships than what is <br>
defined in the group database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The (BSD/POSIX) functions
setreuid(2), setregid(2) and setgroups(2) are used to change
the privileges of the process from root to that of a local
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-maxuid number of uids <br>
In principle, this will set the maximum number of allowed
UIDs that this plugin will handle, but at the moment only
the first UID found will be enforced; the others will <br>
discarded. By setting the value to a maximum there will be a
failure raised when the amount of UIDs exceed the set
maximum. Without this value the plugin will continue <br>
and will enforce only the first found value in the
credential data structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxpgid number of primary gids
<br>
This will set the maximum number of allowed Primary GIDs
that this plugin will handle, similar to -maxuid. Also here
only the first primary GID found will be taken into <br>
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxsgid number of secondary
gids <br>
This will set the maximum allowed Secondary GIDs that this
plugin will handle. This number is limited by the system
(NGROUPS) and is usually 32. If the plugin cannot de&acirc;
<br>
termine the system value, it limits itself to 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining options are
considered dangerous, as they have the potential to allow a
client process to gain root privileges. The use of these
options is strongly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-set_only_euid {yes|no} <br>
The result of setting this option to &rsquo;yes&rsquo; is
that only the effective uid is set. In other words, it is
still possible to regain root (uid) privileges for the
process. <br>
This is definitely undesirable if this module is used from a
process like the gatekeeper, since it would be possible for
user jobs to get root privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-set_only_egid {yes|no} <br>
Analogue to the previous option the result of setting this
option to &rsquo;yes&rsquo; is that only the effective
(primary) gid is set. In other words, it is still possible
to regain <br>
root (gid) privileges for the process. This is definitely
undesirable if this module is used from a process like the
gatekeeper, since it would be possible for user jobs <br>
to get root privileges. Possibly this option should be set
if the module is used by gridFTP, since this service does
not spawn user jobs and has to regain root pivileges <br>
at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS <br>
Success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL <br>
Failure.</p>
