The optional <i>path</i> argument(s) can be used to specify mount points or
  device files which identify XFS filesystems. The output of the individual
  <b>xfs_quota</b> commands will then be restricted to the set of filesystems
  specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manual page is divided into two sections - firstly, information for users
  of filesystems with quota enabled, and the <b>xfs_quota</b> commands of
  interest to such users; and then information which is useful only to
  administrators of XFS filesystems using quota and the quota commands which
  allow modifications to the quota system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that common to almost all of the individual commands described below are
  the options for specifying which quota types are of interest - user quota
  (<b>-u</b>), group quota (<b>-g</b>), and/or project quota (<b>-p</b>). Also,
  several commands provide options to operate on &quot;blocks used&quot;
  (<b>-b</b>), &quot;inodes used&quot; (<b>-i</b>), and/or &quot;realtime blocks
  used&quot; (<b>-r</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many commands also have extensive online help. Use the <b>help</b> command for
  more details on any command.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="QUOTA_OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#QUOTA_OVERVIEW">QUOTA
  OVERVIEW</a></h1>
In most computing environments, disk space is not infinite. The quota subsystem
  provides a mechanism to control usage of disk space. Quotas can be set for
  each individual user on any/all of the local filesystems. The quota subsystem
  warns users when they exceed their allotted limit, but allows some extra space
  for current work (hard limit/soft limit). In addition, XFS filesystems with
  limit enforcement turned off can be used as an effective disk usage accounting
  system.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Users'_View_of_Disk_Quotas"><a class="selflink" href="#Users'_View_of_Disk_Quotas">Users'
  View of Disk Quotas</a></h2>
To most users, disk quotas are either of no concern or a fact of life that
  cannot be avoided. There are two possible quotas that can be imposed - a limit
  can be set on the amount of space a user can occupy, and there may be a limit
  on the number of files (inodes) he can own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>quota</b> command provides information on the quotas that have been set
  by the system administrators and current usage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are four numbers for each limit: current usage, soft limit (quota), hard
  limit, and time limit. The soft limit is the number of 1K-blocks (or files)
  that the user is expected to remain below. The hard limit cannot be exceeded.
  If a user's usage reaches the hard limit, further requests for space (or
  attempts to create a file) fail with the &quot;Quota exceeded&quot; (EDQUOT)
  error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a user exceeds the soft limit, the timer is enabled. Any time the quota
  drops below the soft limits, the timer is disabled. If the timer pops, the
  particular limit that has been exceeded is treated as if the hard limit has
  been reached, and no more resources are allocated to the user. The only way to
  reset this condition, short of turning off limit enforcement or increasing the
  limit, is to reduce usage below quota. Only the superuser (i.e. a sufficiently
  capable process) can set the time limits and this is done on a per filesystem
  basis.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Surviving_When_the_Quota_Limit_Is_Reached"><a class="selflink" href="#Surviving_When_the_Quota_Limit_Is_Reached">Surviving
  When the Quota Limit Is Reached</a></h2>
In most cases, the only way for a user to recover from over-quota conditions is
  to abort whatever activity is in progress on the filesystem that has reached
  its limit, remove sufficient files to bring the limit back below quota, and
  retry the failed program.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
However, if a user is in the editor and a write fails because of an over quota
  situation, that is not a suitable course of action. It is most likely that
  initially attempting to write the file has truncated its previous contents, so
  if the editor is aborted without correctly writing the file, not only are the
  recent changes lost, but possibly much, or even all, of the contents that
  previously existed.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
There are several possible safe exits for a user caught in this situation. He
  can use the editor shell escape command to examine his file space and remove
  surplus files. Alternatively, using <b>sh</b>(1), he can suspend the editor,
  remove some files, then resume it. A third possibility is to write the file to
  some other filesystem (perhaps to a file on <i>/tmp</i>) where the user's
  quota has not been exceeded. Then after rectifying the quota situation, the
  file can be moved back to the filesystem it belongs on.

  ADMINISTRATION</a></h1>
The XFS quota system differs to that of other filesystems in a number of ways.
  Most importantly, XFS considers quota information as filesystem metadata and
  uses journaling to provide a higher level guarantee of consistency. As such,
  it is administered differently, in particular:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>quotacheck</b> command has no effect on XFS
      filesystems. The first time quota accounting is turned on (at mount time),
      XFS does an automatic quotacheck internally; afterwards, the quota system
      will always be completely consistent until quotas are manually turned
    off.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There is no need for quota file(s) in the root of the XFS
      filesystem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">XFS distinguishes between quota accounting and limit
      enforcement. Quota accounting must be turned on at the time of mounting
      the XFS filesystem. However, it is possible to turn on/off limit
      enforcement any time quota accounting is turned on. The &quot;quota&quot;
      option to the <b>mount</b> command turns on both (user) quota accounting
      and enforcement. The &quot;uqnoenforce&quot; option must be used to turn
      on user accounting with limit enforcement disabled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Turning on quotas on the root filesystem is slightly
      different from the above. For IRIX XFS, refer to <b>quotaon</b>(1M). For
      Linux XFS, the quota mount flags must be passed in with the
      &quot;rootflags=&quot; boot parameter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It is useful to use the <b>state</b> to monitor the XFS
      quota subsystem at various stages - it can be used to see if quotas are

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIRECTORY_TREE_QUOTA"><a class="selflink" href="#DIRECTORY_TREE_QUOTA">DIRECTORY
  TREE QUOTA</a></h1>
The project quota mechanism in XFS can be used to implement a form of directory
  tree quota, where a specified directory and all of the files and
  subdirectories below it (i.e. a tree) can be restricted to using a subset of
  the available space in the filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A managed tree must be setup initially using the <b>-s</b> option to the
  <b>project</b> command. The specified project name or identifier is matched to
  one or more trees defined in <i>/etc/projects</i>, and these trees are then
  recursively descended to mark the affected inodes as being part of that tree.
  This process sets an inode flag and the project identifier on every file in
  the affected tree. Once this has been done, new files created in the tree will
  automatically be accounted to the tree based on their project identifier. An
  attempt to create a hard link to a file in the tree will only succeed if the
  project identifier matches the project identifier for the tree. The
  <b>xfs_io</b> utility can be used to set the project ID for an arbitrary file,
  but this can only be done by a privileged user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A previously setup tree can be cleared from project quota control through use of
  the <b>project -C</b> option, which will recursively descend the tree,
  clearing the affected inodes from project quota control.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, the <b>project -c</b> option can be used to check whether a tree is
  setup, it reports nothing if the tree is correct, otherwise it reports the
  paths of inodes which do not have the project ID of the rest of the tree, or
  if the inode flag is not set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Option <b>-d</b> can be used to limit recursion level (-1 is infinite, 0 is top
  level only, 1 is first level ... ). Option <b>-p</b> adds possibility to
  specify project paths in command line without a need for <i>/etc/projects</i>
  to exist. Note that if projects file exists then it is also used.

XFS implements delayed allocation (aka. allocate-on-flush) and this has
  implications for the quota subsystem. Since quota accounting can only be done
  when blocks are actually allocated, it is possible to issue (buffered) writes
  into a file and not see the usage immediately updated. Only when the data is
  actually written out, either via one of the kernels flushing mechanisms, or
  via a manual <b>sync</b>(2), will the usage reported reflect what has actually
  been written.

In addition, the XFS allocation mechanism will always reserve the maximum amount
  of space required before proceeding with an allocation. If insufficient space
  for this reservation is available, due to the block quota limit being reached
  for example, this may result in the allocation failing even though there is
  sufficient space. Quota enforcement can thus sometimes happen in situations
  where the user is under quota and the end result of some operation would still
  have left the user under quota had the operation been allowed to run its
  course. This additional overhead is typically in the range of tens of blocks.

Both of these properties are unavoidable side effects of the way XFS operates,
  so should be kept in mind when assigning block limits.

Quota support for filesystems with realtime subvolumes is not yet implemented,
  nor is the quota warning mechanism (the Linux <b>warnquota</b>(8) tool can be
  used to provide similar functionality on that platform).
