<p>xfs_quota(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
xfs_quota(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfs_quota - manage use of quota on XFS filesystems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfs_quota [ -x ] [ -p prog ] [ -c cmd ] ... [ -d project ]
... [ path ... ] <br>
xfs_quota -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfs_quota is a utility for reporting and editing various
aspects of filesystem quota.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options to xfs_quota
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cmd xfs_quota commands may be
run interactively (the default) or as arguments on the
command line. Multiple -c arguments may be given. The
commands are run in the sequence <br>
given, then the program exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prog Set the program name for
prompts and some error messages, the default value is
xfs_quota.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Enable expert mode. All of
the administrative commands (see the ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS
section below) which allow modifications to the quota system
are available only <br>
in expert mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d project <br>
Project names or numeric identifiers may be specified with
this option, which restricts the output of the individual
xfs_quota commands to the set of projects speci&acirc; <br>
fied. Multiple -d arguments may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the version number and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional path argument(s)
can be used to specify mount points or device files which
identify XFS filesystems. The output of the individual
xfs_quota commands will then be <br>
restricted to the set of filesystems specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page is divided into
two sections - firstly, information for users of filesystems
with quota enabled, and the xfs_quota commands of interest
to such users; and then <br>
information which is useful only to administrators of XFS
filesystems using quota and the quota commands which allow
modifications to the quota system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that common to almost all
of the individual commands described below are the options
for specifying which quota types are of interest - user
quota (-u), group quota (-g), <br>
and/or project quota (-p). Also, several commands provide
options to operate on &quot;blocks used&quot; (-b),
&quot;inodes used&quot; (-i), and/or &quot;realtime blocks
used&quot; (-r).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many commands also have
extensive online help. Use the help command for more details
on any command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUOTA OVERVIEW <br>
In most computing environments, disk space is not infinite.
The quota subsystem provides a mechanism to control usage of
disk space. Quotas can be set for each individual user <br>
on any/all of the local filesystems. The quota subsystem
warns users when they exceed their allotted limit, but
allows some extra space for current work (hard limit/soft
limit). <br>
In addition, XFS filesystems with limit enforcement turned
off can be used as an effective disk usage accounting
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users&rsquo; View of Disk Quotas
<br>
To most users, disk quotas are either of no concern or a
fact of life that cannot be avoided. There are two possible
quotas that can be imposed - a limit can be set on the <br>
amount of space a user can occupy, and there may be a limit
on the number of files (inodes) he can own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quota command provides
information on the quotas that have been set by the system
administrators and current usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four numbers for each
limit: current usage, soft limit (quota), hard limit, and
time limit. The soft limit is the number of 1K-blocks (or
files) that the user is <br>
expected to remain below. The hard limit cannot be exceeded.
If a user&rsquo;s usage reaches the hard limit, further
requests for space (or attempts to create a file) fail with
the <br>
&quot;Quota exceeded&quot; (EDQUOT) error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user exceeds the soft
limit, the timer is enabled. Any time the quota drops below
the soft limits, the timer is disabled. If the timer pops,
the particular limit that <br>
has been exceeded is treated as if the hard limit has been
reached, and no more resources are allocated to the user.
The only way to reset this condition, short of turning off
<br>
limit enforcement or increasing the limit, is to reduce
usage below quota. Only the superuser (i.e. a sufficiently
capable process) can set the time limits and this is done on
a <br>
per filesystem basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Surviving When the Quota Limit
Is Reached <br>
In most cases, the only way for a user to recover from
over-quota conditions is to abort whatever activity is in
progress on the filesystem that has reached its limit,
remove <br>
sufficient files to bring the limit back below quota, and
retry the failed program. <br>
However, if a user is in the editor and a write fails
because of an over quota situation, that is not a suitable
course of action. It is most likely that initially
attempting to <br>
write the file has truncated its previous contents, so if
the editor is aborted without correctly writing the file,
not only are the recent changes lost, but possibly much, or
<br>
even all, of the contents that previously existed. <br>
There are several possible safe exits for a user caught in
this situation. He can use the editor shell escape command
to examine his file space and remove surplus files.
Alter&acirc; <br>
natively, using sh(1), he can suspend the editor, remove
some files, then resume it. A third possibility is to write
the file to some other filesystem (perhaps to a file on <br>
/tmp) where the user&rsquo;s quota has not been exceeded.
Then after rectifying the quota situation, the file can be
moved back to the filesystem it belongs on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER COMMANDS <br>
print Lists all paths with devices/project identifiers. The
path list can come from several places - the command line,
the mount table, and the /etc/projects file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">df See the free command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quota [ -g | -p | -u ] [ -bir ]
[ -hnNv ] [ -f file ] [ ID | name ] ... <br>
Show individual usage and limits, for a single user name or
numeric user ID. The -h option reports in a
&quot;human-readable&quot; format similar to the df(1)
command. The -n <br>
option reports the numeric IDs rather than the name. The -N
option omits the header. The -v option outputs verbose
information. The -f option sends the output to file <br>
instead of stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">free [ -bir ] [ -hN ] [ -f file
] <br>
Reports filesystem usage, much like the df(1) utility. It
can show usage for blocks, inode, and/or realtime block
space, and shows used, free, and total available. If <br>
project quota are in use (see the DIRECTORY TREE QUOTA
section below), it will also report utilisation for those
projects (directory trees). The -h option reports in a <br>
&quot;human-readable&quot; format. The -N option omits the
header. The -f option outputs the report to file instead of
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [ command ] <br>
Online help for all commands, or one specific command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Exit xfs_quota.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q See the quit command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUOTA ADMINISTRATION <br>
The XFS quota system differs to that of other filesystems in
a number of ways. Most importantly, XFS considers quota
information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to
<br>
provide a higher level guarantee of consistency. As such, it
is administered differently, in particular:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The quotacheck command has no
effect on XFS filesystems. The first time quota accounting
is turned on (at mount time), XFS does an automatic
quotacheck internally; after&acirc; <br>
wards, the quota system will always be completely consistent
until quotas are manually turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. There is no need for quota
file(s) in the root of the XFS filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. XFS distinguishes between
quota accounting and limit enforcement. Quota accounting
must be turned on at the time of mounting the XFS
filesystem. However, it is possible <br>
to turn on/off limit enforcement any time quota accounting
is turned on. The &quot;quota&quot; option to the mount
command turns on both (user) quota accounting and
enforcement. <br>
The &quot;uqnoenforce&quot; option must be used to turn on
user accounting with limit enforcement disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Turning on quotas on the root
filesystem is slightly different from the above. For IRIX
XFS, refer to quotaon(1M). For Linux XFS, the quota mount
flags must be passed in <br>
with the &quot;rootflags=&quot; boot parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. It is useful to use the state
to monitor the XFS quota subsystem at various stages - it
can be used to see if quotas are turned on, and also to
monitor the space occupied <br>
by the quota system itself..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. There is a mechanism built
into xfsdump that allows quota limit information to be
backed up for later restoration, should the need arise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Quota limits cannot be set
before turning on quotas on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. XFS filesystems keep quota
accounting on the superuser (user ID zero), and the tool
will display the superuser&rsquo;s usage information.
However, limits are never enforced on <br>
the superuser (nor are they enforced for group and project
ID zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. XFS filesystems perform quota
accounting whether the user has quota limits or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. XFS supports the notion of
project quota, which can be used to implement a form of
directory tree quota (i.e. to restrict a directory tree to
only being able to use up a <br>
component of the filesystems available space; or simply to
keep track of the amount of space used, or number of inodes,
within the tree).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS <br>
path [ N ] <br>
Lists all paths with devices/project identifiers or set the
current path to the Nth list entry (the current path is used
by many of the commands described here, it identi&acirc;
<br>
fies the filesystem toward which a command is directed). The
path list can come from several places - the command line,
the mount table, and the /etc/projects file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">report [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] [
-ahntlLNU ] [ -f file ] <br>
Report filesystem quota information. This reports all quota
usage for a filesystem, for the specified quota type (u/g/p
and/or blocks/inodes/realtime). It reports blocks <br>
in 1KB units by default. The -h option reports in a
&quot;human-readable&quot; format similar to the df(1)
command. The -f option outputs the report to file instead of
stdout. The <br>
-a option reports on all filesystems. By default, outputs
the name of the user/group/project. If no name is defined
for a given ID, outputs the numeric ID instead. The -n <br>
option outputs the numeric ID instead of the name. The -L
and -U options specify lower and upper ID bounds to report
on. If upper/lower bounds are specified, then by <br>
default only the IDs will be displayed in output; with the
-l option, a lookup will be performed to translate these IDs
to names. The -N option reports information without <br>
the header line. The -t option performs a terse report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">state [ -gpu ] [ -av ] [ -f file
] <br>
Report overall quota state information. This reports on the
state of quota accounting, quota enforcement, and the number
of extents being used by quota metadata within <br>
the filesystem. The -f option outputs state information to
file instead of stdout. The -a option reports state on all
filesystems and not just the current path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit [ -g | -p | -u ] bsoft=N |
bhard=N | isoft=N | ihard=N | rtbsoft=N | rtbhard=N -d | id
| name <br>
Set quota block limits (bhard/bsoft), inode count limits
(ihard/isoft) and/or realtime block limits
(rtbhard/rtbsoft). The -d option (defaults) can be used to
set the <br>
default value that will be used, otherwise a specific
user/group/project name or numeric identifier must be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timer [ -g | -p | -u ] [ -bir ]
value <br>
Allows the quota enforcement timeout (i.e. the amount of
time allowed to pass before the soft limits are enforced as
the hard limits) to be modified. The current timeout <br>
setting can be displayed using the state command. The value
argument is a number of seconds, but units of
&rsquo;minutes&rsquo;, &rsquo;hours&rsquo;,
&rsquo;days&rsquo;, and &rsquo;weeks&rsquo; are also
understood (as <br>
are their abbreviations &rsquo;m&rsquo;, &rsquo;h&rsquo;,
&rsquo;d&rsquo;, and &rsquo;w&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warn [ -g | -p | -u ] [ -bir ]
value -d | id | name <br>
Allows the quota warnings limit (i.e. the number of times a
warning will be send to someone over quota) to be viewed and
modified. The -d option (defaults) can be used to <br>
set the default time that will be used, otherwise a specific
user/group/project name or numeric identifier must be
specified. NOTE: this feature is not currently imple&acirc;
<br>
mented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable [ -gpu ] [ -v ] <br>
Switches on quota enforcement for the filesystem identified
by the current path. This requires the filesystem to have
been mounted with quota enabled, and for accounting <br>
to be currently active. The -v option (verbose) displays the
state after the operation has completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable [ -gpu ] [ -v ] <br>
Disables quota enforcement, while leaving quota accounting
active. The -v option (verbose) displays the state after the
operation has completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off [ -gpu ] [ -v ] <br>
Permanently switches quota off for the filesystem identified
by the current path. Quota can only be switched back on
subsequently by unmounting and then mounting again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove [ -gpu ] [ -v ] <br>
Remove any space allocated to quota metadata from the
filesystem identified by the current path. Quota must not be
enabled on the filesystem, else this operation will <br>
report an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump [ -g | -p | -u ] [ -f file
] <br>
Dump out quota limit information for backup utilities,
either to standard output (default) or to a file. This is
only the limits, not the usage information, of course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore [ -g | -p | -u ] [ -f
file ] <br>
Restore quota limits from a backup file. The file must be in
the format produced by the dump command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quot [ -g | -p | -u ] [ -bir ] [
-acnv ] [ -f file ] <br>
Summarize filesystem ownership, by user, group or project.
This command uses a special XFS &quot;bulkstat&quot;
interface to quickly scan an entire filesystem and report
usage <br>
information. This command can be used even when filesystem
quota are not enabled, as it is a full-filesystem scan (it
may also take a long time...). The -a option dis&acirc; <br>
plays information on all filesystems. The -c option displays
a histogram instead of a report. The -n option displays
numeric IDs rather than names. The -v option displays <br>
verbose information. The -f option send the output to file
instead of stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">project [ -cCs [ -d depth ] [ -p
path ] id | name ] <br>
The -c, -C, and -s options allow the directory tree quota
mechanism to be maintained. -d allows to limit recursion
level when processing project directories and -p allows <br>
to specify project paths at command line ( instead of
/etc/projects ). All options are discussed in detail
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORY TREE QUOTA <br>
The project quota mechanism in XFS can be used to implement
a form of directory tree quota, where a specified directory
and all of the files and subdirectories below it (i.e. a
<br>
tree) can be restricted to using a subset of the available
space in the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A managed tree must be setup
initially using the -s option to the project command. The
specified project name or identifier is matched to one or
more trees defined in <br>
/etc/projects, and these trees are then recursively
descended to mark the affected inodes as being part of that
tree. This process sets an inode flag and the project
identifier <br>
on every file in the affected tree. Once this has been done,
new files created in the tree will automatically be
accounted to the tree based on their project identifier. An
<br>
attempt to create a hard link to a file in the tree will
only succeed if the project identifier matches the project
identifier for the tree. The xfs_io utility can be used to
<br>
set the project ID for an arbitrary file, but this can only
be done by a privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A previously setup tree can be
cleared from project quota control through use of the
project -C option, which will recursively descend the tree,
clearing the affected inodes from <br>
project quota control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the project -c option
can be used to check whether a tree is setup, it reports
nothing if the tree is correct, otherwise it reports the
paths of inodes which do not have <br>
the project ID of the rest of the tree, or if the inode flag
is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -d can be used to limit
recursion level (-1 is infinite, 0 is top level only, 1 is
first level ... ). Option -p adds possibility to specify
project paths in command line <br>
without a need for /etc/projects to exist. Note that if
projects file exists then it is also used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Enabling quota enforcement on an XFS filesystem (restrict a
user to a set amount of space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># mount -o uquota /dev/xvm/home
/home <br>
# xfs_quota -x -c &rsquo;limit bsoft=500m bhard=550m
tanya&rsquo; /home <br>
# xfs_quota -x -c report /home</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling project quota on an XFS
filesystem (restrict files in log file directories to only
using 1 gigabyte of space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># mount -o prjquota /dev/xvm/var
/var <br>
# echo 42:/var/log &gt;&gt; /etc/projects <br>
# echo logfiles:42 &gt;&gt; /etc/projid <br>
# xfs_quota -x -c &rsquo;project -s logfiles&rsquo; /var
<br>
# xfs_quota -x -c &rsquo;limit -p bhard=1g logfiles&rsquo;
/var</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above without a need for
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># rm -f /etc/projects
/etc/projid <br>
# mount -o prjquota /dev/xvm/var /var <br>
# xfs_quota -x -c &rsquo;project -s -p /var/log 42&rsquo;
/var <br>
# xfs_quota -x -c &rsquo;limit -p bhard=1g 42&rsquo;
/var</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
XFS implements delayed allocation (aka. allocate-on-flush)
and this has implications for the quota subsystem. Since
quota accounting can only be done when blocks are actually
<br>
allocated, it is possible to issue (buffered) writes into a
file and not see the usage immediately updated. Only when
the data is actually written out, either via one of the <br>
kernels flushing mechanisms, or via a manual sync(2), will
the usage reported reflect what has actually been
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the XFS allocation
mechanism will always reserve the maximum amount of space
required before proceeding with an allocation. If
insufficient space for this reserva&acirc; <br>
tion is available, due to the block quota limit being
reached for example, this may result in the allocation
failing even though there is sufficient space. Quota
enforcement can <br>
thus sometimes happen in situations where the user is under
quota and the end result of some operation would still have
left the user under quota had the operation been allowed
<br>
to run its course. This additional overhead is typically in
the range of tens of blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both of these properties are
unavoidable side effects of the way XFS operates, so should
be kept in mind when assigning block limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Quota support for filesystems with realtime subvolumes is
not yet implemented, nor is the quota warning mechanism (the
Linux warnquota(8) tool can be used to provide similar <br>
functionality on that platform).</p>
