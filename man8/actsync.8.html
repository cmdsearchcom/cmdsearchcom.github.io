<p>ACTSYNC(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual ACTSYNC(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
actsync, actsyncd - synchronize newsgroups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
actsync [-b hostid] [-d hostid] [-g max] [-i ignore_file]
<br>
[-I hostid] [-k] [-l hostid] [-m] [-n name] <br>
[-o fmt] [-p min_%_unchg] [-q hostid] [-s size] <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsyncd [-x] actsync.cfg
[debug_level [debug_outfmt] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Actsync(8) permits one to synchronize, compare or merge two
active(5) files. With this utility one may add, change or
remove newsgroups on the local news server to make it
simi&acirc; <br>
lar to the list the newsgroups found on another system or
file. The synchronization need not be exact. Local
differences in newsgroup lists may be maintained and
preserved. <br>
Certain newsgroup errors may be detected and optionally
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several reasons to run
actsync(8) (or actsyncd(8)), on a periodic basis. Among the
reasons are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A control message to add, change
or remove a newsgroup may fail to reach your site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your control.ctl(5) is out of
date or incomplete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">News articles for a new
newsgroup arrive ahead (sometimes days ahead) of the control
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control messages may be forged,
thus bypassing the restrictions found in control.ctl(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your active(5) file may have
been trashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either host1 or host2 begin
with a &lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;, then they assumed to be a
name of a file containing information in the active(5)
format. The getlist(1) utility may be <br>
used to obtain copy a remote system&rsquo;s active file.
Newsgroup information from a file may be treated as if it
was obtained from a host. In this man page host1 and host2
are <br>
called hosts, even though they may be file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a host argument does not
begin with &lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;, is assumed to be a hostname
or Internet address. In this case, actsync(8) will attempt
to use the NNTP protocol to obtain <br>
a copy of the the specified system&rsquo;s active file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless how the active file
information is obtained, the actions of actsync(8) remain
the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only one host is specified,
it is assumed to be host2. If host1, is not specified, it
assumed to be the default local NNTP server as specified by
the NNTPSERVER environment <br>
variable, or by the server value found in inn.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newsgroup synchronization by
default, involves all newsgroups found on both hosts. One
may also synchronize on a subset of newsgroups by directing
actsync(8) to ignore cer&acirc; <br>
tain newsgroups from both systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actsyncd(8) daemon provides
a convenient interface to configure and run actsync(8). If a
host is not initially reachable, the daemon will thrice
retry 3 times, waiting 5 <br>
minutes before each set of 3 retries. This daemon runs in
the foreground, sending output to standard output and
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -x flag is given to
actsyncd(8), then a ctlinndxexec will be used instead of a
ctlinndreload to load the newly modified active file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration filename for
the daemon is given in the actsync.cfg argument. The
actsync.cfg file is required to have 4 lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host=host2 <br>
spool=/var/spool/news <br>
ignore_file=ignore_file <br>
flags=actsyncd (8) options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword must start at the
beginning of the line, and there may be no whitespace before
the &lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; character. Blank lines are
ignored. Comments start with &lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo;
and are <br>
ignored. All other lines may produce undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host config file line refers
to the host2 value to sync off of. The spool config file
lines determines where top the news spool tree is to be
found. The ignore_file config <br>
file line names the ignore file to be used by actsync(8).
The flags config file line refers to all flags that you wish
to pass to actsync(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -i ignore_file
option, the -o format option and the -S spool_dir option
should not be given in the flags= line because they are
automatically taken care of by act&acirc; <br>
syncd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options to actsync(8) are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b hostid <br>
This flag causes actsync(8) to ignore newsgroups with
&lsquo;&lsquo;bork.bork.bork&rsquo;&rsquo; style names. That
is, newsgroups whose last 3 components are identical. For
example, the follow&acirc; <br>
ing newsgroups have bork style names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alt.helms.dork.dork.dork <br>
alt.auto.accident.sue.sue.sue <br>
alt.election.vote.vote.vote</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value hostid determines on
which hosts this action is performed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 neither host <br>
1 local default server <br>
2 remove server <br>
12 both servers <br>
21 both servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -b 0, no bork
newsgroups are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d hostid <br>
This flag causes actsync(8) to ignore newsgroups that have
all numeric path components. The hostid value is interpreted
the same as in -b. For example, the following <br>
newsgroups have numeric path components:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alt.prime.chongo.23209 <br>
391581.times.2.to_the.216193.power.-1 <br>
99.bottles.of.treacle.on.the.wall <br>
linfield.class.envio_bio.101.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newsgroups directory of a
newsgroups with a all numeric component could conflict with
an article from another group. For example, the directory
for the first news&acirc; <br>
group listed above is the same path as article number 23209
from the newsgroup:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alt.prime.chongo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -d 0, all numeric
newsgroups from both hosts will be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g max Ignore any newsgroup with
more than max levels. For example, -g 6 would ignore:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">alt.feinstien.votes.to.trash.freedom.of.speech
<br>
alt.senator.exon.enemy.of.the.internet <br>
alt.crypto.export.laws.dumb.dumb.dumb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but would not ignore:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">alt.feinstien.acts.like.a.republican
<br>
alt.exon.admendment <br>
alt.crypto.export.laws</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If max is 0, then the max level
feature is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the max level
feature is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i ignore_file <br>
The ignore_file allows one to have a fine degree of control
over which newsgroups are ignored. It contains a set of
rules that specifies which newsgroups will be checked <br>
and which will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, these rules apply to
both hosts. This can be modified by using the -I hostid
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, all newsgroups are
checked. If no ignore_file if specified, or if the ignore
file contains no rule lines, all newsgroups will be
checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines, and text after a
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; are considered comments and
are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rule lines consist of tokens
separated by whitespace. Rule lines may be one of two
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c newsgroup [type ...] <br>
i newsgroup [type ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the rule begins with a c then
the rule requests certain newsgroups to be checked. If the
rule begins with an i then the rule requests certain
newsgroups to be ignored. <br>
The newsgroup field may be a specific newsgroup, or a
wildmat(3) pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more types are
specified, then the rule applies to the newsgroup only if is
of the specified type. Types refer to the 4th field of the
active(5) file. A type <br>
may be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y <br>
n <br>
m <br>
j <br>
x <br>
=group.name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike active files, the
group.name may be a newsgroup name or a wildmat(3) pattern.
Also, &lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;&lsquo;=*&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For given rule line may, one may
not repeat a given pattern type. For example, one may not
have more than one type that begins with
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo;, per line. However, one may
<br>
achieve the effect of multiple &lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo;
types by using multiple rule lines for the same group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, all newsgroups are
candidates to be checked. If an ignore file is used, each
newsgroup in turn is checked against the ignore file. If
multiple lines match a <br>
given newsgroup, the last line in the ignore file is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, consider the
following ignore file lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i *.general <br>
c *.general m <br>
i nsa.general</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newsgroup: ba.general would
be ignored if it was not moderated. The newsgroup:
mod.general would be checked if it was moderated. The
newsgroup: nsa.general would be <br>
ignored even if it was moderated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I hostid <br>
This flag restricts which hosts, the ignore file applies.
The hostid value is interpreted the same as in -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag may be useful in
conjustion with the -m merge flag. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync -i actsync.ign -I 2 -m
host1 host2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will keep all newsgroups
currently on host1. It will also will only compare host1
groups with non-ignored newsgroups from host2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -I 12, newsgroups
from both hosts to be ignored per the -I hostid flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k By default, any newsgroup on
host1 that is in error will be considered for removal. This
causes actsync(8) simply ignore such newsgroups. This flag,
in combination with <br>
-m will prevent any newsgroup from being scheduled for
removal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l hostid <br>
Flag problem newsgroups of type
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; from host1 or host2 as errors.
The hostid value is interpreted the same as in -b.
Newsgroups of type &lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; are
newsgroups active <br>
entries that have 4th field that begins with
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo;. I.e., a newsgroup that is
equivalent to another newsgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A newsgroup that is equivalent
to itself, or that is in a equivalence chain that loops
around to itself is a problem. A newsgroup that is in a
chain that is longer than <br>
16 is a problem group. A newsgroup that is equivalent to a
non-existent newsgroup is a problem. A newsgroup that is
equivalent to a newsgroup that is has a error of some <br>
kind a problem. However, a newsgroup that is equivalent to
an ignored newsgroup is not a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, problem newsgroups
from both hosts are marked as errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Merge newsgroups instead of
sync. By default, if a newsgroup exists on host1 but not
host2, it will be scheduled to be removed. This flag
disables this process, permit&acirc; <br>
ting newsgroups unique to host1 to be kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name <br>
Newsgroups that are created, are created via the ctlinnd(8)
command. By default, the creator name used is actsync. This
flag changes the creator name to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o fmt <br>
Determine the output / action format of this utility. The
fmt may one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a output in active(5) format,
<br>
a1 output in active(5) format, <br>
and output host1 non-error ignored groups <br>
ak output in active(5) format, but use host2 <br>
hi &amp; low (2nd &amp; 3rd active fields) values <br>
for any newsgroup being created <br>
aK output in active(5) format, but use host2 <br>
hi &amp; low (2nd &amp; 3rd active fields) values <br>
for all newsgroups found in host2 <br>
a1k output in active(5) format, but use host2 <br>
hi &amp; low (2nd &amp; 3rd active fields) values <br>
for any newsgroup being created, <br>
and output host1 non-error ignored groups <br>
a1K output in active(5) format, but use host2 <br>
hi &amp; low (2nd &amp; 3rd active fields) values <br>
for all newsgroups found in host2, <br>
and output host1 non-error ignored groups <br>
ak1 same as a1k <br>
aK1 same as a1K <br>
c output in ctlinnd(8) format <br>
x no output, directly exec ctlinnd(8) commands <br>
xi no output, directly exec ctlinnd(8) commands, <br>
in an interactive mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The a, a1, ak, aK, a1k, a1K, ak1
and aK1 style formats allow one to form a new active file
instead of producing ctlinnd(8) commands. They use hi &amp;
low values of <br>
0000000000 and 0000000001 respectively for newsgroups that
are created. The ak and aK variants change the the hi &amp;
low (2nd &amp; 3rd active fields). In the case of ak, <br>
newsgroups created take their hi &amp; low values from
host2. In the case of aK, all newsgroups found on host2 take
their hi &amp; low values from host2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The c format produces ctlinnd(8)
commands. No actions are taken because actsync(8) simply
prints ctlinnd(8) commands on standard output. The sync (or
merge if -m) with <br>
host2 may be accomplished by piping this output into sh(1).
A paranoid person might prefer to use x or xi in case a
newsgroup name or type contains bogus characters that <br>
might be interpreted by sh(1). Even so, this output format
is useful to let you see how host1 may be synced (or merge)
with host2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sync (or merge if -m) may be
accomplished directly by use of the x. With this format,
actsync(8) uses the execl(2) system call to directly
executes ctlinnd(8) com&acirc; <br>
mands. Because of the exec, there is no risk of bogus
newsgroups containing bogus characters causing a shell to do
bogus (or dangerous) things. The output of such execs <br>
may be seen of the verbosity level is at least 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actsync(8) utility will
pause for 4 seconds before each command is executed if -o x
is selected. See the -z sec flag below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xi format interactively
prompts on standard output and reads directives on standard
input. One may pick and choose changes using this
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken when
producing active(5) formatted output. One should check to be
sure that actsync(8) exited with a zero status prior to
using such output. Also <br>
one should realize that such output will not contain lines
ignored by the -i ignore_file process even if -p 100 is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, -o c is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p min_%_unchg <br>
By default, the actsync(8) utility has safeguards against
performing massive changes. If fewer than min_%_unchg
percent of the non-ignored lines from host1 remain <br>
unchanged, no actions (output, execution, etc.) are
performed and actsync(8) exits with a non-zero exit status.
The min_%_unchg may be a floating point value such as <br>
66.666.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A change is considered a host1
line that was found to be in error, was removed, was added
or was changed. Changing the 2nd or 3rd active fields via
-oak or -o aK are not <br>
considered changes by -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To force actsync(8) to accept
any amount of change, use the -p 0 option. To force
actsync(8) to reject any changes, use the -p 100 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken when
producing active(5) formatted output. One should check to be
sure that actsync(8) exited with a zero status prior to
using such output. Also <br>
one should realize that such output will not contain lines
ignored by the -i ignore_file process even if -p 100 is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, 96% of the lines not
ignored in host1 must be unchanged. That is, by default, -p
90 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q hostid <br>
By default, all newsgroup errors are reported on standard
errors. This flag quiets errors from host1 or host2. The
hostid value is interpreted the same as in -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size <br>
If size&gt;0, then ignore newsgroups with names longer than
size, and ignore newsgroups equivalenced to names longer
than size. Length checking is perform on both the local <br>
and remote hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, size is 0 and thus
no length checking is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S spool_dir <br>
For each new newsgroup (i.e., selected groups found on host2
that were not found on host), the newsgroup directory under
spool_dir will be examined. If this newsgroup <br>
directory exists, then the hi &amp; low (2nd &amp; 3rd
active fields) values of the active entry will be changed to
reflect the range articles found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is only useful with -o
a, -o a1, -o ak, -o aK, -o alk, -o alK, -o ak1 or -o aK1.
The -S spool_dir will override any hi &amp; low (2nd &amp;
3rd active fields) values <br>
that would normally have been used. This is an important and
very much recommended option as it will prevent article
number collisions on newsgroups that have been <br>
removed previous but still have unexpired articles in
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t hostid <br>
Ignore improper newsgroups with only a top component from
host1 or host2. The hostid value is interpreted the same as
in -b. The following newsgroups are considered <br>
proper newsgroups for top only names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control <br>
general <br>
junk <br>
test <br>
to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following
newsgroup names are improper because they only contain a top
level component:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dole_for_pres <br>
dos <br>
microsoft <br>
windoes95</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, all improper top
level only newsgroups from the remote ( -t 2 ) are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T This flag causes host2
newsgroups from new hierarchies to be ignored. Normally if
only host2 has the newsgroup chongo.was.here then it will be
created for host1. However <br>
if host1 does not have any &rsquo;chongo.*&rsquo; newsgroups
and this flag is given, then chongo.was.here will be ignored
and will not be created on host1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose_lvl <br>
No default, actsync(8) is not verbose. This flag controls
the verbosity level as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 no debug or status reports
(default) <br>
1 print summary, <br>
if work was needed or done <br>
2 print actions, exec output &amp; summary, <br>
if work was needed or done <br>
3 print actions, exec output &amp; summary <br>
4 full debug output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z sec If -o x is selected,
actsync(8) will pause for sec seconds before each command is
executed. This helps prevent innd(8) from being busyed-out
if a large number of <br>
ctlinnd(8) commands are needed. One can disable this
sleeping by using -z 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, actsync(8) will
pause for 4 seconds before each command is executed if -o x
is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Determine the difference (but don&rsquo;t change anything)
between your newsgroup set and uunet&rsquo;s set:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync news.uu.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above, with full debug
and progress reports:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync -v 4 news.uu.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Force a site to have the same
newsgroups some other site:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync -o x master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may be useful to sync a
slave site to its master, or to sync internal site to a
gateway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compare your site with uunet,
disregarding local groups and certain local differences with
uunet. Produce a report if any differences were
encountered:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync -v 2 -i actsync.ign

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># host to sync off of (host2)
<br>
host=news.uu.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># location of the ignore file
<br>
ignore_file=/usr/local/news/actsync.ign</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># where nwes articles are kept
<br>
spool=/var/spool/news</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># actsync(8) flags <br>
# <br>
# Automatic execs, report if something was done, <br>
# otherwise don&rsquo;t say anything, don&rsquo;t report
<br>
# uunet active file problems, just ignore <br>
# the effect entries. <br>
flags=-o x -v 2 -q 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then by running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsyncd
/usr/local/news/actsync.cfg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One may produce a trial
actsyncd(8) run without changing anything on the server by
supplying the debug_level arg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsyncd
/usr/local/news/actsync.cfg 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debug_level causes
actsyncd(8) to run actsync(8) with an -v debug_level
(overriding any -v flag on the flags line), prevents any
changes from being made to the active(5) <br>
file, writes a new active file to standard output and writes
debug messages to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the debug_outfmt arg is also
given to actsyncd(8) then the data written to standard
output will be in -o fBdebug_outfmt instead of in -o a1
format. The following /bin/sh com&acirc; <br>
mand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsyncd
/usr/local/news/actsync.cfg 4 c &gt;cmd 2&gt;dbg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will operate in debug mode, not
change the active(5) file, write ctlinnd(8) style commands
to cmd and write debug statements to dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To check only the major
hierarchies against news.uu,net, use the following
actsync.ign file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># by default, ignore everything
<br>
i *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># check the major groups <br>
c comp.* <br>
c gnu.* <br>
c sci.* <br>
c alt.* <br>
c misc.* <br>
c news.* <br>
c rec.* <br>
c soc.* <br>
c talk.*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync -i actsync.ign
news.uu.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine the differences
between your old active and your current default server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync
/usr/local/news/active.old -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To report but not fix any
newsgroup problems with the current active file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync - -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To detect any newsgroup errors
on your local server, and to remove any *.bork.bork.bork
style silly newsgroup names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync -b 2 - -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The active file produced by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync ... flags ... -o x
erehwon.honey.edu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actsync ... flags ... -o c
erehwon.honey.edu | sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is effectively the same as the
active file produced by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctlinnd pause &rsquo;running
actsync&rsquo; <br>
rm -f active.new <br>
actsync ... flags ... -o a1 erehwon.honey.edu &gt;
active.new <br>
rm -f active.old <br>
ln active active.old <br>
mv active.new active <br>
ctlinnd reload active &rsquo;running actsync&rsquo; <br>
ctlinnd go &rsquo;running actsync&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be noted that the
above &rsquo;pause&rsquo;, &rsquo;actsync&rsquo;,
&rsquo;reload&rsquo; and &rsquo;go&rsquo; method is faster.
However, in order to avoid article number collisions on
newsgroups that have been <br>
removed previous but still have unexpired articles in them,
it is very much recommended that the -S spool_dir be used
with any of the -oa* flags. Thus, a much better and safer
<br>
version of the above would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctlinnd pause &rsquo;running
actsync&rsquo; <br>
rm -f active.new <br>
actsync ... flags ... -o a1 -S /var/spool/news
erehwon.honey.edu &gt; active.new <br>
rm -f active.old <br>
ln active active.old <br>
mv active.new active <br>
ctlinnd reload active &rsquo;running actsync&rsquo; <br>
ctlinnd go &rsquo;running actsync&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above process is similar to
what actsyncd(8) does by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION <br>
Careless use of this tool may result in the addition change
or removal of newsgroups that you don&rsquo;t want. You
should avoid using the x output format until you are sure it
will <br>
do what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number of innd(8) servers will
corrupt the active file when lots of newgroups and rmgroups
are performed. This is not a actsync(8) bug, it is a server
bug. Using the pause, <br>
actsync, reload and go method noted above is much more
likely to avoid this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If a newsgroup appears multiple times, actsync(8) will treat
all copies as errors. However, if the group is marked for
removal, only one rmgroup will be issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timeout for ctlinnd(8)
commands is fixed at 30 seconds when running in
&lsquo;&lsquo;x&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;xi&rsquo;&rsquo; output format. Perhaps the
timeout value should be controlled via a command line <br>
option?</p>
