<p>TRACEPATH(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual: iputils
TRACEPATH(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tracepath, tracepath6 - traces path to a network host
discovering MTU along this path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tracepath [-n] [-b] [-l pktlen] [-m max_hops] [-p port]
destination</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
It traces path to destination discovering MTU along this
path. It uses UDP port port or some random port. It is
similar to traceroute, only does not require superuser
privi&acirc; <br>
leges and has no fancy options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracepath6 is good replacement
for traceroute6 and classic example of application of Linux
error queues. The situation with IPv4 is worse, because
commercial IP routers do not <br>
return enough information in ICMP error messages. Probably,
it will change, when they will be updated. For now it uses
Van Jacobson&rsquo;s trick, sweeping a range of UDP ports to
<br>
maintain trace history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n Print primarily IP addresses numerically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Print both of host names and
IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Sets the initial packet
length to pktlen instead of 65535 for tracepath or 128000
for tracepath6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Set maximum hops (or maximum
TTLs) to max_hops instead of 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Sets the initial destination
port to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
root@mops:~ # tracepath6 3ffe:2400:0:109::2 <br>
1?: [LOCALHOST] pmtu 1500 <br>
1: dust.inr.ac.ru 0.411ms <br>
2: dust.inr.ac.ru asymm 1 0.390ms pmtu 1480 <br>
2: 3ffe:2400:0:109::2 463.514ms reached <br>
Resume: pmtu 1480 hops 2 back 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first column shows TTL of
the probe, followed by colon. Usually value of TTL is
obtained from reply from network, but sometimes reply does
not contain necessary information <br>
and we have to guess it. In this case the number is followed
by ?.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second column shows the
network hop, which replied to the probe. It is either
address of router or word [LOCALHOST], if the probe was not
sent to the network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of line shows
miscellaneous information about path to the correspinding
network hop. As rule it contains value of RTT. Additionally,
it can show Path MTU, when it <br>
changes. If the path is asymmetric or the probe finishes
before it reach prescribed hop, difference between number of
hops in forward and backward direction is shown following
<br>
keyword async. This information is not reliable. F.e. the
third line shows asymmetry of 1, it is because the first
probe with TTL of 2 was rejected at the first hop due to
Path <br>
MTU Discovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last line summarizes
information about all the path to the destination, it shows
detected Path MTU, amount of hops to the destination and our
guess about amount of hops from <br>
the destination to us, which can be different when the path
is asymmetric.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
traceroute(8), traceroute6(8), ping(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
tracepath was written by Alexey Kuznetsov
&lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
No security issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This lapidary deserves to be
elaborated. tracepath is not a privileged program, unlike
traceroute, ping and other beasts of this kind. tracepath
may be executed by everyone who <br>
has some access to network, enough to send UDP datagrams to
investigated destination using given port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
tracepath is part of iputils package and the latest versions
are available in source form at
http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-current.tar.bz2.</p>
