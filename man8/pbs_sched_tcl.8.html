<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbs_sched_tcl - pbs Tcl scheduler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pbs_sched [-a alarm] [-b file] [-d home] [-i file] [-L
logfile] [-p file] [-S port] [-t file] [-v] [-c file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pbs_sched program runs in conjunction with the PBS
server. It queries the server about the state of PBS and
communicates with pbs_mom to get information about the
status of <br>
running jobs, memory available etc. It then makes decisions
as to what jobs to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbs_sched must be executed with
root permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a alarm This specifies the time in seconds to wait for a
schedule run to finish. If a script takes too long to
finish, an alarm signal is sent, and the scheduler is <br>
restarted. If a core file does not exist in the current
directory, abort() is called and a core file is generated.
The default for alarm is 180 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b file This specifies the
&quot;body&quot; file. The file given is read into memory
once at program start or after the program receives a SIGHUP
and executed each time the sched&acirc; <br>
uler is awakened by the server. If this option is not given,
the file &quot;sched_tcl&quot; in the directory
PBS_HOME/sched_priv is read for the body code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d home This specifies the PBS
home directory, PBS_HOME. The current working directory of
the scheduler is PBS_HOME/sched_priv. If this option is not
given, PBS_HOME <br>
defaults to $PBS_SERVER_HOME as defined during the PBS build
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file This specifies the
&quot;initialize&quot; file. The file given is executed once
before the main processing loop is entered. If this option
is not given, no initialization <br>
code is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L logfile Specifies an absolute
path name of the file to use as the log file. If not
specified, the scheduler will open a file named for the
current date in the <br>
PBS_HOME/sched_logs directory (see the -d option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file This specifies the
&quot;print&quot; file. Any output from the Tcl code which
is written to standard out or standard error will be written
to this file. If this option is <br>
not given, the file used will be
PBS_HOME/sched_priv/sched_out. See the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S port This specifies the port
to use. If this option is not given, the default port for
the PBS scheduler is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t file This specifies the
&quot;terminator&quot; file. If a QUIT command is sent from
the server, this code is executed before the scheduler
exits. If this option is not given, <br>
no special termination handling is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This puts the scheduler into
&quot;verbose&quot; mode. Any errors will be shown no matter
what this may be set to, but some &quot;uninteresting&quot;
events may be logged by using <br>
this flag. An example is a message each time the server
contacts the scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file Specify a configuration
file, see description below. If this is a relative file name
it will be relative to PBS_HOME/sched_priv, see the -d
option. If the -c <br>
option is not supplied, pbs_sched will not attempt to open a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options that specify file
names may be absolute or relative. If they are relative,
their root directory will be PBS_HOME/sched_priv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
This version of the scheduler requires knowledge of the Tcl
language. A set of functions to communicate with the PBS
server and resource monitor have been added to those
nor&acirc; <br>
mally available with Tcl. All these calls will set the Tcl
variable &quot;pbs_errno&quot; to a value to indicate if an
error occured. In all cases, the value &quot;0&quot; means
no error. If a <br>
call to a Resource Monitor function is made, any error value
will come from the system supplied errno variable. If the
function call communicates with the PBS Server, any error
<br>
value will come from the error number returned by the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openrm host ?port? <br>
Creates a connection to the PBS Resource Monitor on host
using port as the port number or the standard port for the
resource monitor if it is not given. A connection han&acirc;
<br>
dle is returned. If the open is successful, this will be a
non-negative integer. If not, an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">closerm connection <br>
The parameter connection is a handle to a resource monitor
which was previously returned from openrm. This connection
is closed. Nothing is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">downrm connection <br>
Sends a command to the connected resource monitor to
shutdown. Nothing is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configrm connection filename
<br>
Sends a command to the connected resource monitor to read
the configuration file given by filename. If this is
successful, a &quot;0&quot; is returned, otherwise,
&quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addreq connection request <br>
A resource request is sent to the connected resource
monitor. If this is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is returned,
otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getreq connection <br>
One resource request response from the connected resource
monitor is returned. If an error occurred or there are no
more responses, an empty string is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allreq request <br>
A resource request is sent to all connected resource
monitors. The number of streams acted upon is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flushreq <br>
All resource requests previously sent to all connected
resource monitors are flushed out to the network. Nothing is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">activereq <br>
The connection number of the next stream with something to
read is returned. If there is nothing to read from any of
the connections, a negative number is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fullresp flag <br>
Evaluates flag as a boolean value and sets the response mode
used by getreq to full if flag evaluates to
&quot;true&quot;. The full return from a resource monitor
includes the orig&acirc; <br>
inal request followed by an equal sign followed by the
response. The default situation is only to return the
response following the equal sign. If a script needs to
&quot;see&quot; <br>
the entire line, this function may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsstatserv <br>
The server is sent a status request for information about
the server itself. If the request succeeds, a list with
three elements is returned, otherwise an empty string is
<br>
returned. The first element is the server&rsquo;s name. The
second is a list of attributes. The third is the
&quot;text&quot; associated with the server (usually
blank).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsstatjob <br>
The server is sent a status request for information about
the all jobs resident within the server. If the request
succeeds, a list is returned, otherwise an empty string <br>
is returned. The list contains an entry for each job. Each
element is a list with three elements. The first is the
job&rsquo;s jobid. The second is a list of attributes. The
<br>
attribute names which specify resources will have a name of
the form &quot;Resource_List:name&quot; where
&quot;name&quot; is the resource name. The third is the
&quot;text&quot; associated with the <br>
job (usually blank).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsstatque <br>
The server is sent a status request for information about
all queues resident within the server. If the request
succeeds, a list is returned, otherwise an empty string is
<br>
returned. The list contains an entry for each queue. Each
element is a list with three elements. This first is the
queue&rsquo;s name. The second is a list of attributes
sim&acirc; <br>
ilar to pbsstatjob. The third is the &quot;text&quot;
associated with the queue (usually blank).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsstatnode <br>
The server is sent a status request for information about
all nodes defined within the server. If the request
succeeds, a list is returned, otherwise an empty string is
<br>
returned. The list contains an entry for each node. Each
element is a list with three elements. This first is the
nodes&rsquo;s name. The second is a list of attributes
simi&acirc; <br>
lar to pbsstatjob. The third is the &quot;text&quot;
associated with the node (usually blank).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsselstat <br>
The server is sent a status request for information about
the all runnable jobs resident within the server. If the
request succeeds, a list similar to pbsstatjob is <br>
returned, otherwise an empty string is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsrunjob jobid ?location? <br>
Run the job given by jobid at the location given by
location. If location is not given, the default location is
used. If this is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is returned,
otherwise, <br>
&quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsasyrunjob jobid ?location?
<br>
Run the job given by jobid at the location given by location
without waiting for a positive response that the job has
actually started. If location is not given, the <br>
default location is used. If this is successful, a
&quot;0&quot; is returned, otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsrerunjob jobid <br>
Re-runs the job given by jobid. If this is successful, a
&quot;0&quot; is returned, otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsdeljob jobid <br>
Delete the job given by jobid. If this is successful, a
&quot;0&quot; is returned, otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsholdjob jobid <br>
Place a hold on the job given by jobid. If this is
successful, a &quot;0&quot; is returned, otherwise,
&quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsmovejob jobid ?location? <br>
Move the job given by jobid to the location given by
location. If location is not given, the default location is
used. If this is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is returned,
other&acirc; <br>
wise, &quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsqenable queue <br>
Set the &quot;enabled&quot; attribute for the queue given by
queue to true. If this is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is
returned, otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsqdisable queue <br>
Set the &quot;enabled&quot; attribute for the queue given by
queue to false. If this is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is
returned, otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsqstart queue <br>
Set the &quot;started&quot; attribute for the queue given by
queue to true. If this is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is
returned, otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsqstop queue <br>
Set the &quot;started&quot; attribute for the queue given by
queue to false. If this is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is
returned, otherwise, &quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsalterjob jobid attribute_list
<br>
Alter the attributes for a job specified by jobid. The
parameter attribute_list is the list of attributes to be
altered. There can be more than one. Each attribute
con&acirc; <br>
sists of a list of three elements. The first is the name,
the second the resource and the third is the new value. If
the alter is successful, a &quot;0&quot; is returned,
other&acirc; <br>
wise, &quot;-1&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsrescquery resource_list <br>
Obtain information about the resources specified by
resource_list. This will be a list of strings. If the
request succeeds, a list with the same number of elements as
<br>
resource_list is returned. Each element in this list will be
a list with four numbers. The numbers specify available,
allocated, reserved, and down in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsrescreserve resource_id
resource_list <br>
Make (or extend) a reservation for the resources specified
by resource_list which will be given as a list of strings.
The parameter resource_id is a number which provides <br>
a unique identifier for a reservation being tracked by the
server. If resource_id is given as &quot;0&quot;, a new
reservation is created. In this case, a new identifier is
gener&acirc; <br>
ated and returned by the function. If an old identifier is
used, that same number will be returned. The Tcl variable
&quot;pbs_errno&quot; will be set to indicate the success or
<br>
failure of the reservation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsrescrelease resource_id <br>
The reservation specified by resource_id is released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two following commands are
not normally used by the scheduler. They are included here
because there could be a need for a scheduler to contact a
server other than the one <br>
which it normally communicates with. Also, these commands
are used by the Tcl tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsconnect ?server? <br>
Make a connection to the named server or the default server
if a parameter is not given. Only one connection to a server
is allowed at any one time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbsdisconnect <br>
Disconnect from the currently connected server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above Tcl functions use PBS
interface library calls for communication with the server
and the PBS resource monitor library to communicate with
pbs_mom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datetime ?day? ?time? <br>
The number of arguments used determine the type of date to
be calculated. With no arguments, the current POSIX date is
returned. This is an integer in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With one argument there are two
possible formats. The first is a 12 (or more) character
string specifying a complete date in the following format:
<br>
YYMMDDhhmmss</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All characters must be digits.
The year (YY) is given by the first two (or more) characters
and is the number of years since 1900. The month (MM) is the
number of the <br>
month [01-12]. The day (DD) is the day of the month [01-32].
The hour (hh) is the hour of the day [00-23]. The minute
(mm) is minutes after the hour [00-59]. The second <br>
(ss) is seconds after the minute [00-59]. The POSIX date for
the given date/time is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second option with one
argument is a relative time. The format for this is <br>
HH:MM:SS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With hours (HH), minutes (MM)
and seconds (SS) being separated by colons &quot;:&quot;.
The number returned in this case will be the number of
seconds in the interval specified, not <br>
an absolute POSIX date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With two arguments a relative
date is calculated. The first argument specifies a day of
the week and must be one of the following strings:
&quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Mon&quot;, &quot;Tue&quot;,
&quot;Wed&quot;, <br>
&quot;Thr&quot;, &quot;Fri&quot;, or &quot;Sat&quot;. The
second argument is a relative time as given above. The POSIX
date calculated will be the day of the week given which
follows the current day, <br>
and the time given in the second argument. For example, if
the current day was Monday, and the two arguments were
&quot;Fri&quot; and &quot;04:30:00&quot;, the date
calculated would be the <br>
POSIX date for the Friday following the current Monday, at
four-thirty in the morning. If the day specified and the
current day are the same, the current day is used, not <br>
the day one week later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strftime format time <br>
This function calls the POSIX function strftime(). It
requires two arguments. The first is a format string. The
format conventions are the same as those for the POSIX <br>
function strftime(). The second argument is POSIX calendar
time in second as returned by datetime. It returns a string
based on the format given. This gives the ability <br>
to extract information about a time, or format it for
printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tcl interpreter is started
at program initialization and after a reset (the receipt of
a SIGHUP signal). It is not deleted between scheduling runs
so variables which are set <br>
in one can be accessed later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;initialize&quot; and
&quot;terminator&quot; files are run with no supplied
connection to the server. This means that none of the above
functions which talk to the server will work unless <br>
pbsconnect is called first. The &quot;body&quot; file is run
with a connection to the server already established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
A configuration file may be specified with the -c option.
This file may be used to specify the hosts (servers) which
are allowed to connect to pbs_sched. The hosts are
speci&acirc; <br>
fied in the configuration file in a manor identical to that
used in pbs_mom. There is one line per host with the syntax:
<br>
$clienthost hostname <br>
where clienthost and hostname are separated by white
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two host names are always
allowed to connection to pbs_sched, &quot;localhost&quot;
and the name returned to pbs_sched by the system call
gethostname(). These names need not be specified <br>
in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file must be
&quot;secure&quot;. It must be owned by a user id and group
id less than 10 and not be world writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PBS_SERVER_HOME/sched_priv <br>
the default directory for configuration files, typically
(/usr/spool/pbs)/sched_priv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal Handling <br>
A C based scheduler will handle the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP The server will close and
reopen its log file and reread the config file if one
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGALRM <br>
If the site supplied scheduling module exceeds the time
limit, the Alarm will cause the scheduler to attempt to core
dump and restart itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT and SIGTERM <br>
Will result in an orderly shutdown of the scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other signals have the
default action installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Upon normal termination, an exit status of zero is
returned.</p>
