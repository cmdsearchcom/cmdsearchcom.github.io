The <b>pbs_sched</b> program runs in conjunction with the PBS server. It queries
  the server about the state of PBS and communicates with <b>pbs_mom</b> to get
  information about the status of running jobs, memory available etc. It then
  makes decisions as to what jobs to run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
pbs_sched must be executed with root permission.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-a alarm</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This specifies the time in seconds to wait for a schedule
      run to finish. If a script takes too long to finish, an alarm signal is
      sent, and the scheduler is restarted. If a core file does not exist in the
      current directory, <b>abort()</b> is called and a core file is generated.
      The default for <i>alarm</i> is 180 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-b file</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This specifies the &quot;body&quot; file. The file given is
      read into memory once at program start or after the program receives a
      SIGHUP and executed each time the scheduler is awakened by the server. If
      this option is not given, the file &quot;sched_tcl&quot; in the directory
      PBS_HOME/sched_priv is read for the body code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-d home</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This specifies the PBS home directory, PBS_HOME. The
      current working directory of the scheduler is PBS_HOME/sched_priv. If this
      option is not given, PBS_HOME defaults to $PBS_SERVER_HOME as defined
      during the PBS build procedure.</dd>

      option is not given, no initialization code is executed.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-L logfile</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies an absolute path name of the file to use as the

    option).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-p file</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This specifies the &quot;print&quot; file. Any output from
      the Tcl code which is written to standard out or standard error will be
      written to this file. If this option is not given, the file used will be

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      scheduler exits. If this option is not given, no special termination
      handling is done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      errors will be shown no matter what this may be set to, but some

The options that specify file names may be absolute or relative. If they are
  relative, their root directory will be PBS_HOME/sched_priv.

This version of the scheduler requires knowledge of the Tcl language. A set of
  functions to communicate with the PBS server and resource monitor have been
  added to those normally available with Tcl. All these calls will set the Tcl
  variable &quot;pbs_errno&quot; to a value to indicate if an error occured. In
  all cases, the value &quot;0&quot; means no error. If a call to a Resource
  Monitor function is made, any error value will come from the system supplied
  <b>errno</b> variable. If the function call communicates with the PBS Server,
  any error value will come from the error number returned by the server.

The two following commands are not normally used by the scheduler. They are

<dl class="Bl-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">datetime ?day? ?time?</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of arguments used determine the type of date to
      be calculated. With no arguments, the current POSIX date is returned. This
      is an integer in seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With one argument there are two possible formats. The first is a 12 (or
      more) character string specifying a complete date in the following format:
    <pre>
YYMMDDhhmmss
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    </pre>
    All characters must be digits. The year (YY) is given by the first two (or
      more) characters and is the number of years since 1900. The month (MM) is
      the number of the month [01-12]. The day (DD) is the day of the month
      [01-32]. The hour (hh) is the hour of the day [00-23]. The minute (mm) is
      minutes after the hour [00-59]. The second (ss) is seconds after the
      minute [00-59]. The POSIX date for the given date/time is returned.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The second option with one argument is a relative time. The format for this
      is
    <pre>
HH:MM:SS
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    </pre>
    With hours (HH), minutes (MM) and seconds (SS) being separated by colons
      &quot;:&quot;. The number returned in this case will be the number of
      seconds in the interval specified, not an absolute POSIX date.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With two arguments a relative date is calculated. The first argument
      specifies a day of the week and must be one of the following strings:
      &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Mon&quot;, &quot;Tue&quot;, &quot;Wed&quot;,
      &quot;Thr&quot;, &quot;Fri&quot;, or &quot;Sat&quot;. The second argument
      is a relative time as given above. The POSIX date calculated will be the
      day of the week given which follows the current day, and the time given in
      the second argument. For example, if the current day was Monday, and the
      two arguments were &quot;Fri&quot; and &quot;04:30:00&quot;, the date
      calculated would be the POSIX date for the Friday following the current
      Monday, at four-thirty in the morning. If the day specified and the
      current day are the same, the current day is used, not the day one week
      later.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">This function calls the POSIX function <i>strftime().</i>
      It requires two arguments. The first is a format string. The format
      conventions are the same as those for the POSIX function strftime(). The
      second argument is POSIX calendar time in second as returned by
      <i>datetime.</i> It returns a string based on the format given. This gives

Two host names are always allowed to connection to pbs_sched,

  gethostname(). These names need not be specified in the configuration file.
