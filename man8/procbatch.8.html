<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
procbatch - Process an INN funnel file or innfeed-dropped
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
procbatch [-hquv] [-c [-s spooldir]] [-d outdir] [-e peer]
[-m [-t backlogdir]] batchfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
procbatch will take an INN funnel or innfeed-dropped file
and split it up by host for direct processing with innfeed
or innxmit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While funnel files will normally
only be of interest after a crash, innfeed may drop articles
for a variety of reasons, not all of which indicate a
fundamental problem. For <br>
example, innfeed may drop articles when started and stopped
in quick succession while INN processes a large number of
control messages (a temporary indisposition), or when INN
<br>
feeds it articles for a site that isn&rsquo;t in
innfeed.conf (a misconfiguration).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every running innfeed opens a
file named innfeed-dropped.&lt;id&gt;, which should normally
always be zero length and deleted on exit. If there are
non-zero length files, innfeed has <br>
dropped some articles, and those dropped article files have
to be processed or those articles will never be sent to
peers. Though news.daily automatically process these files
<br>
(invoking procbatch), it is also possible to do that
manually. First make sure that the file doesn&rsquo;t
correspond to a currently running innfeed, for example by
calling &quot;ctlinnd <br>
flush innfeed!&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An INN funnel file, or an
innfeed-dropped file, will usually be of the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathname message-id peer1 peer2
peer3 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where pathname can alternatively
be a storage API token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">procbatch will break this file
up into files named peer1.tmp, peer2.tmp, peer3.tmp, etc. of
the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathname message-id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These tape files will be sorted
and stripped of duplicate entries. Simply renaming them to
peer1, peer2, peer3, etc. in a running innfeed&rsquo;s
backlog directory will cause them to <br>
be picked up automatically by innfeed every
backlog-newfile-period seconds (as set in in innfeed.conf).
Use the -m flag to have procbatch rename and move them into
place <br>
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running procbatch, you may
want to make sure that every generated backlog file has a
corresponding &quot;.lock&quot; file. Otherwise, innfeed
doesn&rsquo;t have that site configured as a <br>
peer, meaning your innfeed.conf may need fixing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Check for the existence of an article before writing
references to it to the tape files. Currently, this option
can only be used with a tradspool article store. Using it
<br>
with any other spool format will lead to all articles being
dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d outdir <br>
Put the output file(s) into the directory outdir (defaults
to pathtmp as set in inn.conf). When also specifying -m, the
temporary output files will still be put here before <br>
being moved into their final location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e peer <br>
Only process entries for peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a short help
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Directly append to tape files
in innfeed&rsquo;s backlog directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode: only display
error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s spooldir <br>
Use spooldir as the location of the article spool (defaults
to patharticles as set in inn.conf). This option has an
effect only on a tradspool storage system when also <br>
specifying -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t backlogdir <br>
Use backlogdir as the location of the innfeed backlog
directory (the directory where the created tape files will
be put). Defaults to pathspool/innfeed. This option has an
<br>
effect only when also specifying -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Unlink the input batchfile
after processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Add verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Take the file innfeed-dropped.B012345, process its lines
appending to tapefiles in innfeed&rsquo;s backlog directory,
and remove it when done. Be verbose while doing so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">procbatch -umv
innfeed-dropped.B012345</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go through
innfeed-dropped.B012345 saving entries for &quot;peer1&quot;
in /tmp/peer1.tmp, but only if the articles are still
available in the local tradspool:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">procbatch -e peer1 -d /tmp -c
innfeed-dropped.B012345</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
procbatch should be able to check for the existence of
articles with any kind of article store, possibly using
grephistory.</p>
