<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ip rule manipulates rules in the routing policy database
control the route selection algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Classic routing algorithms used
in the Internet make routing decisions based only on the
destination address of packets (and in theory, but not in
practice, on the TOS field).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some circumstances we want to
route packets differently depending not only on destination
addresses, but also on other packet fields: source address,
IP protocol, transport <br>
protocol ports or even packet payload. This task is called
&rsquo;policy routing&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To solve this task, the
conventional destination based routing table, ordered
according to the longest match rule, is replaced with a
&rsquo;routing policy database&rsquo; (or RPDB), which <br>
selects routes by executing some set of rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each policy routing rule
consists of a selector and an action predicate. The RPDB is
scanned in order of decreasing priority. The selector of
each rule is applied to {source <br>
address, destination address, incoming interface, tos,
fwmark} and, if the selector matches the packet, the action
is performed. The action predicate may return with success.
In <br>
this case, it will either give a route or failure indication
and the RPDB lookup is terminated. Otherwise, the RPDB
program continues with the next rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Semantically, the natural action
is to select the nexthop and the output device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At startup time the kernel
configures the default RPDB consisting of three rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Priority: 0, Selector: match
anything, Action: lookup routing table local (ID 255). The
local table is a special routing table containing high
priority control routes for <br>
local and broadcast addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Priority: 32766, Selector:
match anything, Action: lookup routing table main (ID 254).
The main table is the normal routing table containing all
non-policy routes. This <br>
rule may be deleted and/or overridden with other ones by the
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Priority: 32767, Selector:
match anything, Action: lookup routing table default (ID
253). The default table is empty. It is reserved for some
post-processing if no previ&acirc; <br>
ous default rules selected the packet. This rule may also be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each RPDB entry has additional
attributes. F.e. each rule has a pointer to some routing
table. NAT and masquerading rules have an attribute to
select new IP address to trans&acirc; <br>
late/masquerade. Besides that, rules have some optional
attributes, which routes have, namely realms. These values
do not override those contained in the routing tables. They
<br>
are only used if the route did not select any
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The RPDB may contain rules of
the following types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unicast - the rule prescribes to
return the route found in the routing table referenced by
the rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blackhole - the rule prescribes
to silently drop the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unreachable - the rule
prescribes to generate a &rsquo;Network is
unreachable&rsquo; error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prohibit - the rule prescribes
to generate &rsquo;Communication is administratively
prohibited&rsquo; error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nat - the rule prescribes to
translate the source address of the IP packet into some
other value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip rule add - insert a new
rule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip rule delete - delete a
rule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type TYPE (default) <br>
the type of this rule. The list of valid types was given in
the previous subsection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from PREFIX <br>
select the source prefix to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to PREFIX <br>
select the destination prefix to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iif NAME <br>
select the incoming device to match. If the interface is
loopback, the rule only matches packets originating from
this host. This means that you may create separate <br>
routing tables for forwarded and local packets and, hence,
completely segregate them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oif NAME <br>
select the outgoing device to match. The outgoing interface
is only available for packets originating from local sockets
that are bound to a device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tos TOS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsfield TOS <br>
select the TOS value to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwmark MARK <br>
select the fwmark value to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">priority PREFERENCE <br>
the priority of this rule. Each rule should have an
explicitly set unique priority value. The options preference
and order are synonyms with priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">table TABLEID <br>
the routing table identifier to lookup if the rule selector
matches. It is also possible to use lookup instead of
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realms FROM/TO <br>
Realms to select if the rule matched and the routing table
lookup succeeded. Realm TO is only used if the route did not
select any realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nat ADDRESS <br>
The base of the IP address block to translate (for source
addresses). The ADDRESS may be either the start of the block
of NAT addresses (selected by NAT routes) or <br>
a local host address (or even zero). In the last case the
router does not translate the packets, but masquerades them
to this address. Using map-to instead of nat <br>
means the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Changes to the RPDB
made with these commands do not become active immediately.
It is assumed that after a script finishes a batch of
updates, it flushes <br>
the routing cache with ip route flush cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip rule flush - also dumps all
the deleted rules. <br>
This command has no arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip rule show - list rules <br>
This command has no arguments. The options list or lst are
synonyms with show.</p>
