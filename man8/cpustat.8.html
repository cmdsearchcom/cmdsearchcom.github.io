<p>CPUSTAT(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual CPUSTAT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cpustat - a tool to measure CPU utilization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cpustat [ options ] [delay [count]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cpustat is a program that dumps the CPU utilization of
current running tasks (that is, processes or kernel
threads). cpustat is useful to monitor the activity of long
lived pro&acirc; <br>
cesses in a system, such as daemons, kernel threads as well
as typical user processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpustat shows only the tasks
that have measured any change in their CPU activity between
each sample interval (as indicated by an increment in the
CPU tick count stats of utime <br>
and stime in /proc/$pid/stat). cpustat thus only reports
activity of busy tasks that are still alive at the time of
each sample snapshot and hence will not account for very
<br>
short lived processes that exist between each sample
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each running task that has
consumed some CPU during the sample time, the following
information is displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Heading Description <br>
%CPU Total CPU used (in percent) <br>
%USR CPU used in user space (in percent) <br>
%SYS CPU used in system (kernel) space (in percent) <br>
PID Process ID <br>
S Process State <br>
CPU CPU used by the process at time of sampling. <br>
Time Total CPU time used by the process since it <br>
started. <br>
Task Process command line information (from process <br>
cmdline or comm fields)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpustat was designed to try and
minimize the CPU overhead of process statistics gathering
and reporting. It is therefore ideal for small embedded
devices where CPU is limited <br>
where measuring CPU utilisation may affect the overall CPU
statistics. For this reason, it is not as complex as tools
such as top(1) that have a more feature rich user
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROCESS STATE CODES <br>
R Running <br>
S Sleeping <br>
D Waiting, Disk Sleep <br>
T Stopped <br>
t Tracing stopped <br>
W Paging <br>
X or x Dead <br>
K Wakekill <br>
W Waking <br>
P Parked</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
cpustat options are as follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a calculate CPU utilisation
based on all CPUs. For example, if a process is using 100%
of 1 CPU and the system has 4 CPUs, then the utilisation
will show as 25%. The <br>
default is to show utilisation on a per CPU basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c get command information from
process comm field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d strip directory basename off
command information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D compute and show the
distribution of CPU utilisation by task and by CPU. <br>
By task, this breaks the CPU utilisation of each task into
20 ranges from minimum to the maximum and shows the count of
tasks found at in that paricular utilisation range. <br>
Useful to see any outliers and to characterize the typical
per task usage of the CPU. <br>
By CPU, this shows the user and system CPU utilisation by
per CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g show grand total of CPU
utilisation statistics at the end of the run. This is the
total cumulatave CPU used by each process, averaged over the
entire run duration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h show help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i ignore cpustat in the
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l show long (full) command
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n task_count <br>
only display the first task_count number of top tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PID only display process that
matches the given PID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q run quietly, only really
makes sense with -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r csv_file <br>
output gathered data in a comma separated values file. This
can be then imported and graphed using your favourite open
source spread sheet. The %CPU utilisation (system <br>
and user) for each process at each sample time is output
into a table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s show short command
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S show time stamp. If the -r
option is used then an extra column appears in the CSV
output file with the time of day for each sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t threshold <br>
ignore samples where the CPU usage delta per second less
than the given threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T calculate total CPU
utilisation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x show extra CPU related
statistics, namely: CPU load average over 1, 5 and 10
minutes, CPU frequency (average of all online CPU
frequencies), number of CPUs online.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X run in curses based
&quot;top&quot; like mode; this will make cpustat consume
more CPU cycles as it adds on more display handling
overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
cpustat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump CPU stats every second
until stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpustat -n 20 60</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump the top 20 CPU consuming
tasks every 60 seconds until stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpustat 10 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump CPU stats every 10 seconds
just 5 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpustat -x -D -a 1 300</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gather stats every second for 5
minutes with extra CPU stats and show CPU utilisation
distributions per task and per CPU at the end of the run.
Also, scale CPU utilisation <br>
by the number of CPUs so that 100% utilisation means 100% of
all CPUs rather than 100% of 1 CPU.</p>
