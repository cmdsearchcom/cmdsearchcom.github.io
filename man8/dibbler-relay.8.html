<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dibbler-relay - a portable DHCPv6 relay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dibbler-relay is a portable implementation of the DHCPv6
relay. DHCPv6 relays are proxies, which allow one server to
support links, which server is not directly connected to.
<br>
There are ports available for Linux 2.4/2.6 systems as well
as MS Windows XP and 2003. They are freely available under
GNU GPL version 2 (or later) license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dibbler-relay [ run | start | stop | status ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
run - starts relay in the console. Relay can be closed using
ctrl-c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start - starts relay in daemon
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop - stops running relay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status - shows status of the
relay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Relay forwards DHCPv6 messages between interfaces. Messages
from client are encapsulated and forwarded as RELAY_FORW
messages. Replies from server are received as RELAY_REPL
mes&acirc; <br>
sage. After decapsulation, they are being sent back to
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is vital to inform server,
where this relayed message was received. DHCPv6 does this
using interface-id option. This identifier must be unique.
Otherwise relays will get con&acirc; <br>
fused when they will receive reply from server. Note that
this id does not need to be alligned with system interface
id (ifindex). Think about it as &quot;ethernet segment
identifier&quot; <br>
if you are using Ethernet network or as &quot;bss
identifier&quot; if you are using 802.11 network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s assume this case:
relay has 2 interfaces: eth0 and eth1. Clients are located
on the eth1 network. Relay should receive data on that
interface using well-known <br>
ALL_DHCP_RELAYS_AND_SERVER multicast address (ff02::1:2).
Relay also listens on its global address 2000::123. Packets
received on the eth1 should be forwarded on the eth0
inter&acirc; <br>
face, also using multicast address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log-level 8 <br>
log-mode short</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface eth0 { <br>
server multicast yes <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface eth1 { <br>
client multicast yes <br>
client unicast 2000::123 <br>
interface-id 1000 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is another exmaple. This
time messages should be forwarded from eth1 and eth3 to the
eth0 interface (using multicast) and to the eth2 interface
(using server&rsquo;s global <br>
address 2000::546). Also clients must use multicasts (the
default approach):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface eth0 { <br>
server multicast yes <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface eth2 { <br>
server unicast 2000::456 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface eth1 { <br>
client multicast yes <br>
interface-id 1000 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iface eth3 { <br>
client multicast yes <br>
interface-id 1001 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
All files are created in the /var/lib/dibbler directory.
During operation, Dibbler saves various file in that
directory. Dibbler relay reads /etc/dibbler/relay.conf file.
Log <br>
file is named client.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
This implementation aims at conformance to the following
standards:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC 3315 DHCP for IPv6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC 3736 Stateless DHCPv6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Bugs are tracked with bugzilla, available at
http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/. If you belive you have found a
bug, don&rsquo;t hesitate to report it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Dibbler was developed as master thesis on the Technical
University of Gdansk by Tomasz Mrugalski and Marek
Senderski. Currently Marek has not enough free time, so this
project is <br>
being developed by Tomasz Mrugalski. Author can be reached
at thomson@klub.com.pl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
There are dibbler-server(8) and dibbler-client(8) manual
pages available. You are also advised to take a look at
project website located at http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/. As
far as <br>
authors know, this is the only Windows DHCPv6 stateful
implementation available and the only one with relay
support. It is also one of two freely available under Linux.
The other <br>
Linux implementation is available at
http://dhcpv6.sourceforge.net, but it is rather outdated and
seems not being actively developed.</p>
