<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fastrm - quickly remove a set of files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fastrm [ -d ] [ -e ] [ -uN ] [ -sM ] [ -cI ]
base_directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fastrm reads a list of files, one per line, from its
standard input and removes them. If a file is not an
absolute pathname, it is taken relative to the directory
specified on <br>
the command line. The base_directory parameter must be a
simple absolute pathname &acirc; that is, it must not
contain any &lsquo;&lsquo;/./&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;/../&rsquo;&rsquo; references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fastrm is designed to be faster
than the typical &lsquo;&lsquo;| xargs rm&rsquo;&rsquo;
pipeline. For example, fastrm will usually chdir(2) into a
directory before removing files from it. If the input <br>
is sorted, this means that most files to be removed will be
simple names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fastrm assumes that its input is
valid and that it is safe to just do an unlink(2) call for
each item to be removed. As a safety measure, if fastrm is
run by root it will first <br>
stat(2) the item to make sure that it is not a directory
before unlinking it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d If the &lsquo;&lsquo;-d&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is used then
no files are removed. Instead a list of the files to be
removed, in debug form, is printed on the standard output.
Each line contains <br>
either the current directory of fastrm at the time it would
do the unlink, and then the path name it would pass to
unlink(2) as two fields separated by white space and a <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;, or the absolute path name (a
single field) of files it would unlink using the absolute
path name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e If the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-e&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is used, fastrm will
treat an empty input file (stdin) as an error. This is most
useful when fastrm is last in a pipeline after a preceding
sort(1) as <br>
if the sort fails, there will usually be no output to become
input of fastrm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u If the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-u&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is used, then fastrm
makes further assumptions about its work environment; in
particular, that there are no symbolic links in the target
tree. This <br>
flag also suggests that it is probably faster to reference
the path &lsquo;&lsquo;../../../&rsquo;&rsquo; rather than
start from the root and come down. (Note that this probably
isn&rsquo;t true on <br>
systems that have a namei cache, which usually holds
everything except &lsquo;&lsquo;..&rsquo;&rsquo;). The
optional N is an integer that specifies the maximum number
of &lsquo;&lsquo;..&rsquo;&rsquo; segments to use <br>
&acirc; paths that would use more than this use the absolute
path name (from the root) instead. If the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-u&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is given without a
value, &lsquo;&lsquo;-u1&rsquo;&rsquo; is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s If the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-s&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is used, then fastrm
will perform the unlinks from one directory &acirc; that is
when a group of files in one directory appear in the input
consecutively &acirc; in <br>
the order that the files appear in the directory from which
they are to be removed. The intent of this flag is that on
systems that have a per-process directory cache, <br>
finding files in the directory should be faster. It can have
smaller benefits on other systems. The optional M is an
integer that specifies the number of files that must <br>
be going to be removed from one directory before the files
will be ordered. If the &lsquo;&lsquo;-s&rsquo;&rsquo; flag
is given without a value, &lsquo;&lsquo;-s5&rsquo;&rsquo; is
assumed. When the directory reorder&acirc; <br>
ing is in use fastrm will avoid attempting to unlink files
that it can&rsquo;t see in the directory, which can speed it
appreciably when many of the file names have already been
<br>
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c The
&lsquo;&lsquo;-c&rsquo;&rsquo; flag may be given to instruct
fastrm when it should chdir(2). If the number of files to be
unlinked from a directory is at least I then fastrm will
chdir and <br>
unlink the files from in the directory. Otherwise it will
build a path relative to its current directory. If
&lsquo;&lsquo;-c&rsquo;&rsquo; is given without the optional
integer I then &lsquo;&lsquo;-c1&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
is assumed, which will cause fastrm to always use chdir. If
&lsquo;&lsquo;-c&rsquo;&rsquo; is not used at all, then
&lsquo;&lsquo;-c3&rsquo;&rsquo; is assumed. Use
&lsquo;&lsquo;-c0&rsquo;&rsquo; to prevent fastrm from ever
using chdir(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a -r There are also
&lsquo;&lsquo;-a&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;-r&rsquo;&rsquo; options, which do nothing at
all, except allow you to say &lsquo;&lsquo;fastrm
-usa&rsquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;&lsquo;fastrm -ussr&rsquo;&rsquo;
or &lsquo;&lsquo;fastrm -user&rsquo;&rsquo;. These happen to
often be <br>
convenient sets of options to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Fastrm exits with a status of zero if there were no
problems, or one if something went wrong. Attempting to
remove a file that does not exist is not considered a
problem. If <br>
the program exits with a non-zero status, it is probably a
good idea to feed the list of files into an
&lsquo;&lsquo;xargs rm&rsquo;&rsquo; pipeline.</p>
