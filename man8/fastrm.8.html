fastrm - quickly remove a set of files
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>fastrm</b> [ <b>-d</b> ] [ <b>-e</b> ] [ <b>-u</b><i>N</i> ] [
  <b>-s</b><i>M</i> ] [ <b>-c</b><i>I</i> ] <i>base_directory</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>Fastrm</i> reads a list of files, one per line, from its standard input and
  removes them. If a file is not an absolute pathname, it is taken relative to
  the directory specified on the command line. The <i>base_directory</i>
  parameter must be a simple absolute pathname &#x2014; that is, it must not
  contain any ``/./'' or ``/../'' references.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Fastrm</i> is designed to be faster than the typical
  ``|&#x00A0;xargs&#x00A0;rm'' pipeline. For example, <i>fastrm</i> will usually
  <i>chdir</i>(2) into a directory before removing files from it. If the input
  is sorted, this means that most files to be removed will be simple names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Fastrm</i> assumes that its input is valid and that it is safe to just do an
  <i>unlink</i>(2) call for each item to be removed. As a safety measure, if
  <i>fastrm</i> is run by root it will first <i>stat</i>(2) the item to make
  sure that it is not a directory before unlinking it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the ``<b>-d</b>'' flag is used then no files are
      removed. Instead a list of the files to be removed, in debug form, is
      printed on the standard output. Each line contains either the current
      directory of <i>fastrm</i> at the time it would do the unlink, and then
      the path name it would pass to <i>unlink</i>(2) as two fields separated by
      white space and a ``/'', or the absolute path name (a single field) of
      files it would unlink using the absolute path name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the ``<b>-e</b>'' flag is used, <i>fastrm</i> will treat
      an empty input file ( <b>stdin</b>) as an error. This is most useful when
      <i>fastrm</i> is last in a pipeline after a preceding <b>sort</b>(1) as if
      the sort fails, there will usually be no output to become input of
      <i>fastrm</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-u</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the ``<b>-u</b>'' flag is used, then <i>fastrm</i> makes
      further assumptions about its work environment; in particular, that there
      are no symbolic links in the target tree. This flag also suggests that it
      is probably faster to reference the path <i>``../../../''</i> rather than
      start from the root and come down. (Note that this probably isn't true on
      systems that have a namei cache, which usually holds everything except
      <i>``..''</i>). The optional <i>N</i> is an integer that specifies the
      maximum number of <i>``..''</i> segments to use &#x2014; paths that would
      use more than this use the absolute path name (from the root) instead. If
      the ``-u'' flag is given without a value, ``-u1'' is assumed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the ``<b>-s</b>'' flag is used, then <i>fastrm</i> will
      perform the unlinks from one directory &#x2014; that is when a group of
      files in one directory appear in the input consecutively &#x2014; in the
      order that the files appear in the directory from which they are to be
      removed. The intent of this flag is that on systems that have a
      per-process directory cache, finding files in the directory should be
      faster. It can have smaller benefits on other systems. The optional
      <i>M</i> is an integer that specifies the number of files that must be
      going to be removed from one directory before the files will be ordered.
      If the `` <b>-s</b>'' flag is given without a value, ``<b>-s5</b>'' is
      assumed. When the directory reordering is in use <i>fastrm</i> will avoid
      attempting to unlink files that it can't see in the directory, which can
      speed it appreciably when many of the file names have already been
      removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The ``<b>-c</b>'' flag may be given to instruct
      <i>fastrm</i> when it should <i>chdir</i>(2). If the number of files to be
      unlinked from a directory is at least <i>I</i> then <i>fastrm</i> will
      <i>chdir</i> and unlink the files from in the directory. Otherwise it will
      build a path relative to its current directory. If `` <b>-c</b>'' is given
      without the optional integer <i>I</i> then `` <b>-c1</b>'' is assumed,
      which will cause <i>fastrm</i> to always use <i>chdir</i>. If ``
      <b>-c</b>'' is not used at all, then `` <b>-c3</b>'' is assumed. Use ``
      <b>-c0</b>'' to prevent <i>fastrm</i> from ever using
    <i>chdir</i>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a -r</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There are also ``-a'' and ``-r'' options, which do nothing
      at all, except allow you to say ``fastrm -usa'' ``fastrm -ussr'' or
      ``fastrm -user''. These happen to often be convenient sets of options to
      use.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<i>Fastrm</i> exits with a status of zero if there were no problems, or one if
  something went wrong. Attempting to remove a file that does not exist is not
  considered a problem. If the program exits with a non-zero status, it is
  probably a good idea to feed the list of files into an ``xargs&#x00A0;rm''
  pipeline.
