<p>DPKG-WWW(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
DPKG-WWW(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpkg-www, dpkg-www-installer - WWW Debian package
browser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
http://&lt;hostname&gt;/cgi-bin/dpkg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A typical Debian system can have hundreds installed packages
and thousands available for installation. Information about
installed and available packages can usually be obtained
<br>
with the dpkg(1) command, but navigating through the package
dependencies and the documentation files can be a very
frustrating and time-consuming task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the dpkg-www cgi you can
instead browse Debian packages info with a WEB browser,
following package dependencies and locating documentation
(man pages, Info files, READMEs, <br>
and so on) with a few mouse clicks. If you have superuser
privileges you can even install, upgrade or remove packages
from your WEB browser. The output provided by dpkg-www is
<br>
basically that of dpkg with the addition of HREF&rsquo;s for
packages dependencies and documentation files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cgi program can take an
optional query argument which can be given in the URL or
entered in the query field of the html form. This can
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;empty&gt; <br>
list concisely all installed packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* (asterisk) <br>
list concisely all installed and available packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;list of packages&gt; <br>
list concisely the requested packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;wilcard expession&gt; <br>
list concisely all packages whose name matches the
expression, for example &lsquo;*image*&rsquo; will find all
packages which contain the string &lsquo;image&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;package&gt; <br>
list verbosely a package and, if the package is installed,
all its files. If the package is not installed and the WEB
installation is enabled you can install it by click&acirc;
<br>
ing on the &lsquo;Install&rsquo; button. If the package is
installed you can remove it or upgrade to a new version, if
available, by clicking on the respective buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;absolute pathname&gt; <br>
list all the packages owners of a file. This can be used for
example to find which package installed a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/&lt;regexp&gt; <br>
list all the packages owners of a file. The regexp form can
be used to find which packages own a non installed file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;field&gt;=&lt;value&gt; <br>
list all the packages with control field matching value. If
the field name is omitted the value is searched in any
control field. The default search is a case-insensitive <br>
fixed substring match but it can be changed with the
GREP_DCTRL_OPTS option in the config file. This feature
works only if the grep-dctrl package is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? (question mark) <br>
show a concise help about the cgi usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;space&gt; (a single space)
<br>
print only the input form, for use from window-manager
menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration <br>
dpkg-www can be configured by the local system administrator
via the optional /etc/dpkg-www.conf file. This file is a
simple Bourne shell (/bin/sh) script that defines some or
<br>
all the following variables (defaults are used if the file
doesn&rsquo;t exist, or doesn&rsquo;t define the
variable):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_BUTTONS <br>
If this option is enabled dpkw-www will add a small
&lsquo;install&rsquo; check-button for each package shown in
the package list. Default is 0 (disabled) because the
resulting inter&acirc; <br>
face is not very nice. The use of this option is therefore
not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALL_BUTTON <br>
If this option is set the &lsquo;Install&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Upgrade&rsquo; and &lsquo;Remove&rsquo; buttons will
be added to the verbose info of a package. By clicking on
these button you will start the <br>
installation of removal the package as described in the
section WEB Installation. Since this option can potentially
introduce security holes it is disabled (0) by <br>
default. Use at your own risk. If the variable is set to
&quot;top&quot; the button will be located before the file
list, default is the bottom of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHOW_LOCAL_FILES <br>
If this variable is set, dpkg-www will use file:/ style
URL&rsquo;s to access html files -- bypassing the cgi
script. This is faster on slow machines. Default is not
defined, <br>
which means use local files for connection from localhost
and http:// URL&rsquo;s for remote connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_PACKAGE_VERSION <br>
If this variable is set, dpkg-www will check if a newer
version of an installed package is available. On slow
machines you may want to set this option to false since it
<br>
can considerably slow down the execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST_UNAVAILABLE <br>
This option enables listing also unavailable packages in the
packages list. Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST_DOCUMENTATION <br>
This option enables the display of references to documents
registered with install-docs(8) to the detailed package
info, providing a quick path to relevant package docu&acirc;
<br>
mentation. Unfortunately this feature is not totally
reliable because currently there is no way to find documents
registered by a package with install-docs and the search
<br>
is done with an ugly hack. Hopefully things will change in
woody. This option is enabled (1) by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORCE_SSH_PASSWD <br>
This option forces ssh passwd prompt for package
installation on a remote host even if an ssh agent holds the
private key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GREP_DCTRL_OPTS <br>
These options are passed to grep-dctrl(1) when doing a query
by field. Default is &quot;-i&quot; for case-insensitive
fixed substring match. See grep-dctrl(1) for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DPKG Command providing the
dpkg(1) query functionalities. This can be dpkg or dlocate ,
or auto . Default is auto, meaning that the cgi will use
dlocate if installed, other&acirc; <br>
wise revert to dpkg which should always be available on a
Debian system. By specifying this option you can force the
use of one of the two program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAN Manpage to HTML translation
command. Can be dwww , man2html or auto . Default is auto,
meaning that the cgi will use man2thml if installed,
otherwise revert to dwww . By <br>
specifying this option you can force the use of one of the
two program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBIAN_CONTENTS <br>
Optional list of one or more Contents-xxx.gz files mapping
each file available in the Debian GNU/Linux system to the
package from which it originates. If available these <br>
files are used to find the owner packages of non installed
files. This can be useful for quickly finding the package to
install when a needed command is missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BGCOLOR <br>
background color of the HTML body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG internal option used only
for debugging. Disabled by default since it is useless for
normal users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DWWW_PATH <br>
path on webserver to dwww cgi-bin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INFO2WWW_PATH <br>
path on webserver to info2www cgi-bin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is an exaple
/etc/dpkg-www.conf file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Enable install check-buttons

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Enable cgi debugging. Not

# DEBUG=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cgi access <br>
The information provided by dpkg-www and the ability to
install or remove packages also remotely can potentially
give useful information to crackers and open security holes.
For <br>
these reasons access to this cgi program should be allowed
only from localhost and trusted hosts or domains.
Unfortunately this configuration is dependent on the
particular <br>
installed WEB server. The dpkg-www package configures the
apache server, if installed, to allow access only from
localhost. Other WEB servers must be configured manually by
the <br>
system administrator to restrict access to trusted hosts. If
you administer many Debian system on a local network you may
want to enable access to the cgi from your network and <br>
browse packages on any host from any other machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WEB installation <br>
If this option is enabled in the /etc/dpkg-www.conf file,
the &lsquo;Install&rsquo;, &lsquo;Upgrade&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Remove&rsquo; buttons are added to the info page of
installed or uninstalled packages. By <br>
clicking on this button the system administrator, or more
precisely any user who has the ability to become system
administrator (since you don&rsquo;t want to run a web
browser as <br>
root!), will be able to install or remove a package on the
fly, provided he has properly configured his browser for WEB
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For security reasons the
installation is done entirely from the browser side, so that
you don&rsquo;t need to gain root privileges from the cgi
program which is run on the server. The <br>
only thing done on the server is to generate an installation
request which is downloaded to the browser for the
execution, which is started under control of the user and
with his <br>
privileges. The real installation is done by a small helper
script run from the user&rsquo;s browser when a document
with content-type
&lsquo;application/dpkg-www-installer&rsquo; is received
<br>
from the web server. The helper script opens an XTerm on the
user&rsquo;s display and runs a script which becomes
superuser, after asking the root password, and execs an
apt-get com&acirc; <br>
mand to install the requested packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The WEB browser must have been
configured to handle the above content-type by running the
command &quot;/usr/sbin/dpkg-www-installer -x -f
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;&quot;, which must obviously intalled also
on <br>
the client side if installing from remote. If the dpkg-www
package is not installed on the browser client you can
simply copy the script /usr/sbin/dpkg-www-installer and hope
it <br>
works...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can configure your Netscape.
browser from the Navigator -&gt; Application menu of the
Preferences window. You must add a new item with MIME type
&quot;application/dpkg-www-install&acirc; <br>
er&quot; and application &quot;/usr/sbin/dpkg-www-installer
-x -f &rsquo;%s&rsquo;&quot;. This should add the following
line to your Netscape mailcap file:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">application/dpkg-www-installer;/usr/sbin/dpkg-www-installer
-x -f &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dpkg-www WEB installation
has been successfully tested only with Netscape. With other
WEB browsers it is untested and it may not work
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to be able to install
the packages the user must known the root password asked for
&lsquo;su root&rsquo; when installing on the local server,
or have the ability to ssh as root to <br>
the remote host when installing from a remote client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the security point of view,
executing a WEB installation is functionally equivalent to
opening a shell in an XTerm, becoming superuser after having
supplied the proper pass&acirc; <br>
word and running apt-get as root to install or remove the
required packages. Starting this from the WEB could be
potentially vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, but
since it <br>
requires a password on the client it seems quite safe. If
you are really paranoid connect to a secure server from an
SSL-enabled browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dpkg-www WEB installation is
not intended to replace the normal use of apt-get from the
shell. It is provided only as a shortcut to allow the
installation of a package after <br>
having located it with the browser without needing to open a
root shell and run apt-get manually. For normal package
maintenance and system upgrade the use of apt-get from the
<br>
shell is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/dpkg-www.conf <br>
Configuration file for dpkg-www. It is not necessary for
this file to exist, there are sensible defaults for
everything.</p>
