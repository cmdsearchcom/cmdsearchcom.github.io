<p>DNSSEC-KEYMGR(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-KEYMGR(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-keymgr - Ensures correct DNSKEY coverage for a zone
based on a defined policy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-keymgr [-K directory] [-c file] [-f] [-k] [-q] [-v]
[-z] [-g path] [-r path] [-s path] [zone...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnssec-keymgr is a high level Python wrapper to facilitate
the key rollover process for zones handled by BIND. It uses
the BIND commands for manipulating DNSSEC key metadata: <br>
dnssec-keygen and dnssec-settime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSSEC policy can be read from a
configuration file (default /etc/dnssec-policy.conf), from
which the key parameters, publication and rollover schedule,
and desired coverage <br>
duration for any given zone can be determined. This file may
be used to define individual DNSSEC policies on a per-zone
basis, or to set a default policy used for all zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dnssec-keymgr runs, it
examines the DNSSEC keys for one or more zones, comparing
their timing metadata against the policies for those zones.
If key settings do not conform <br>
to the DNSSEC policy (for example, because the policy has
been changed), they are automatically corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A zone policy can specify a
duration for which we want to ensure the key correctness
(coverage). It can also specify a rollover period
(roll-period). If policy indicates that a <br>
key should roll over before the coverage period ends, then a
successor key will automatically be created and added to the
end of the key series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If zones are specified on the
command line, dnssec-keymgr will examine only those zones.
If a specified zone does not already have keys in place,
then keys will be generated for <br>
it according to policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If zones are not specified on
the command line, then dnssec-keymgr will search the key
directory (either the current working directory or the
directory set by the -K option), and <br>
check the keys for all the zones represented in the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is expected that this tool
will be run automatically and unattended (for example, by
cron).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c file <br>
If -c is specified, then the DNSSEC policy is read from
file. (If not specified, then the policy is read from
/etc/dnssec-policy.conf; if that file doesn&rsquo;t exist, a
built-in <br>
global default policy is used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Force: allow updating of key events even if they are already
in the past. This is not recommended for use with zones in
which keys have already been published. However, if a <br>
set of keys has been generated all of which have publication
and activation dates in the past, but the keys have not been
published in a zone as yet, then this option can be <br>
used to clean them up and turn them into a proper series of
keys with appropriate rollover intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g keygen-path <br>
Specifies a path to a dnssec-keygen binary. Used for
testing. See also the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Print the dnssec-keymgr help summary and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K directory <br>
Sets the directory in which keys can be found. Defaults to
the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
Only apply policies to KSK keys. See also the -z option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Quiet: suppress printing of dnssec-keygen and
dnssec-settime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r randomdev <br>
Specifies a path to a file containing random data. This is
passed to the dnssec-keygen binary using its -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s settime-path <br>
Specifies a path to a dnssec-settime binary. Used for
testing. See also the -g option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Print the dnssec-keymgr version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z <br>
Only apply policies to ZSK keys. See also the -k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICY CONFIGURATION <br>
The dnssec-policy.conf file can specify three kinds of
policies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Policy classes
(policy name { ... };) can be inherited by zone policies or
other policy classes; these can be used to create sets of
different security profiles. For example, <br>
a policy class normal might specify 1024-bit key sizes, but
a class extra might specify 2048 bits instead; extra would
be used for zones that had unusually high security <br>
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Algorithm
policies: (algorithm-policy algorithm { ... }; ) override
default per-algorithm settings. For example, by default,
RSASHA256 keys use 2048-bit key sizes for both <br>
KSK and ZSK. This can be modified using algorithm-policy,
and the new key sizes would then be used for any key of type
RSASHA256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Zone policies:
(zone name { ... }; ) set policy for a single zone by name.
A zone policy can inherit a policy class by including a
policy option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options that can be specified in
policies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">algorithm <br>
The key algorithm. If no policy is defined, the default is
RSASHA256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">coverage <br>
The length of time to ensure that keys will be correct; no
action will be taken to create new keys to be activated
after this time. This can be represented as a number of <br>
seconds, or as a duration using human-readable units
(examples: &quot;1y&quot; or &quot;6 months&quot;). A
default value for this option can be set in algorithm
policies as well as in policy <br>
classes or zone policies. If no policy is configured, the
default is six months.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory <br>
Specifies the directory in which keys should be stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key-size <br>
Specifies the number of bits to use in creating keys. Takes
two arguments: keytype (eihter &quot;zsk&quot; or
&quot;ksk&quot;) and size. A default value for this option
can be set in algorithm <br>
policies as well as in policy classes or zone policies. If
no policy is configured, the default is 1024 bits for DSA
keys and 2048 for RSA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyttl <br>
The key TTL. If no policy is defined, the default is one
hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post-publish <br>
How long after inactivation a key should be deleted from the
zone. Note: If roll-period is not set, this value is
ignored. Takes two arguments: keytype (eihter
&quot;zsk&quot; or <br>
&quot;ksk&quot;) and a duration. A default value for this
option can be set in algorithm policies as well as in policy
classes or zone policies. The default is one month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pre-publish <br>
How long before activation a key should be published. Note:
If roll-period is not set, this value is ignored. Takes two
arguments: keytype (either &quot;zsk&quot; or
&quot;ksk&quot;) and a <br>
duration. A default value for this option can be set in
algorithm policies as well as in policy classes or zone
policies. The default is one month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">roll-period <br>
How frequently keys should be rolled over. Takes two
arguments: keytype (eihter &quot;zsk&quot; or
&quot;ksk&quot;) and a duration. A default value for this
option can be set in algorithm <br>
policies as well as in policy classes or zone policies. If
no policy is configured, the default is one year for
ZSK&rsquo;s. KSK&rsquo;s do not roll over by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standby <br>
Not yet implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMAINING WORK <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Enable scheduling of KSK rollovers using the
-P sync and -D sync options to dnssec-keygen and
dnssec-settime. Check the parent zone (as in dnssec-checkds)
to determine when <br>
it&rsquo;s safe for the key to roll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Allow
configuration of standby keys and use of the REVOKE bit, for
keys that use RFC 5011 semantics.</p>
