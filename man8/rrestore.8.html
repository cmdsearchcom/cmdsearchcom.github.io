<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The restore command performs the inverse function of
dump(8). A full backup of a file system may be restored and
subsequent incremental backups layered on top of it. Single
<br>
files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or
partial backups. Restore works across a network; to do this
see the -f flag described below. Other arguments to the <br>
command are file or directory names specifying the files
that are to be restored. Unless the -h flag is specified
(see below), the appearance of a directory name refers to
the <br>
files and (recursively) subdirectories of that
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exactly one of the following
flags is required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C This mode allows comparison
of files from a dump. Restore reads the backup and compares
its contents with files present on the disk. It first
changes its working direc&acirc; <br>
tory to the root of the filesystem that was dumped and
compares the tape with the files in its new current
directory. See also the -L flag described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This mode allows interactive
restoration of files from a dump. After reading in the
directory information from the dump, restore provides a
shell like interface that <br>
allows the user to move around the directory tree selecting
files to be extracted. The available commands are given
below; for those commands that require an argument, the <br>
default is the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add [arg] <br>
The current directory or specified argument is added to the
list of files to be extracted. If a directory is specified,
then it and all its descendants are added <br>
to the extraction list (unless the -h flag is specified on
the command line). Files that are on the extraction list are
prepended with a &acirc;*&acirc; when they are listed by
<br>
ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd arg Change the current
working directory to the specified argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete [arg] <br>
The current directory or specified argument is deleted from
the list of files to be extracted. If a directory is
specified, then it and all its descendants are <br>
deleted from the extraction list (unless the -h flag is
specified on the command line). The most expedient way to
extract most of the files from a directory is to <br>
add the directory to the extraction list and then delete
those files that are not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extract <br>
All files on the extraction list are extracted from the
dump. Restore will ask which volume the user wishes to
mount. The fastest way to extract a few files is to <br>
start with the last volume and work towards the first
volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help List a summary of the
available commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls [arg] <br>
List the current or specified directory. Entries that are
directories are appended with a &acirc;/&acirc;. Entries
that have been marked for extraction are prepended with a
<br>
&acirc;*&acirc;. If the verbose flag is set, the inode
number of each entry is also listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwd Print the full pathname of
the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Restore immediately exits,
even if the extraction list is not empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setmodes <br>
All directories that have been added to the extraction list
have their owner, modes, and times set; nothing is extracted
from the dump. This is useful for cleaning <br>
up after a restore has been prematurely aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
The sense of the -v flag is toggled. When set, the verbose
flag causes the ls command to list the inode numbers of all
entries. It also causes restore to print out <br>
information about each file as it is extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P file <br>
Restore creates a new Quick File Access file file from an
existing dump file without restoring its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Restore requests a particular
tape of a multi-volume set on which to restart a full
restore (see the -r flag below). This is useful if the
restore has been interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Restore (rebuild) a file
system. The target file system should be made pristine with
mke2fs(8), mounted, and the user cd&rsquo;d into the
pristine file system before starting <br>
the restoration of the initial level 0 backup. If the level
0 restores successfully, the -r flag may be used to restore
any necessary incremental backups on top of the <br>
level 0. The -r flag precludes an interactive file
extraction and can be detrimental to one&rsquo;s health (not
to mention the disk) if not used carefully. An example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mke2fs /dev/sda1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount /dev/sda1 /mnt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd /mnt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore rf /dev/st0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that restore leaves a file
restoresymtable in the root directory to pass information
between incremental restore passes. This file should be
removed when the last <br>
incremental has been restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restore, in conjunction with
mke2fs(8) and dump(8), may be used to modify file system
parameters such as size or block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The names of the specified
files are listed if they occur on the backup. If no file
argument is given, the root directory is listed, which
results in the entire content of <br>
the backup being listed, unless the -h flag has been
specified. Note that the -t flag replaces the function of
the old dumpdir(8) program. See also the -X option
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The named files are read from
the given media. If a named file matches a directory whose
contents are on the backup and the -h flag is not specified,
the directory is <br>
recursively extracted. The owner, modification time, and
mode are restored (if possible). If no file argument is
given, the root directory is extracted, which results in
<br>
the entire content of the backup being extracted, unless the
-h flag has been specified. See also the -X option
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following additional options may be specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a In -i or -x mode, restore
does ask the user for the volume number on which the files
to be extracted are supposed to be (in order to minimise the
time by reading only the <br>
interesting volumes). The -a option disables this behaviour
and reads all the volumes starting with 1. This option is
useful when the operator does not know on which vol&acirc;
<br>
ume the files to be extracted are and/or when he prefers the
longer unattended mode rather than the shorter interactive
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A archive_file <br>
Read the table of contents from archive_file instead of the
media. This option can be used in combination with the -t,
-i, or -x options, making it possible to check <br>
whether files are on the media without having to mount the
media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
The number of kilobytes per dump record. If the -b option is
not specified, restore tries to determine the media block
size dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Normally, restore will try to
determine dynamically whether the dump was made from an old
(pre-4.4) or new format file system. The -c flag disables
this check, and only <br>
allows reading a dump in the old format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d The -d (debug) flag causes
restore to print debug information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D filesystem <br>
The -D flag allows the user to specify the filesystem name
when using restore with the -C option to check the
backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Read the backup from file; file may be a special device file
like /dev/st0 (a tape drive), /dev/sda1 (a disk drive), an
ordinary file, or - (the standard input). If the <br>
name of the file is of the form host:file or user@host:file,
restore reads from the named file on the remote host using
rmt(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F script <br>
Run script at the beginning of each tape. The device name
and the current volume number are passed on the command
line. The script must return 0 if restore should continue
<br>
without asking the user to change the tape, 1 if restore
should continue but ask the user to change the tape. Any
other exit code will cause restore to abort. For security
<br>
reasons, restore reverts back to the real user ID and the
real group ID before running the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Extract the actual directory,
rather than the files that it references. This prevents
hierarchical restoration of complete subtrees from the
dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H hash_size <br>
Use a hashtable having the specified number of entries for
storing the directories entries instead of a linked list.
This hashtable will considerably speed up inode <br>
lookups (visible especially in interactive mode when
adding/removing files from the restore list), but at the
price of much more memory usage. The default value is 1,
<br>
meaning no hashtable is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Use Kerberos authentication
when contacting the remote tape server. (Only available if
this options was enabled when restore was compiled.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l When doing remote restores,
assume the remote file is a regular file (instead of a tape
device). If you&rsquo;re restoring a remote compressed file,
you will need to specify <br>
this option or restore will fail to access it correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L limit <br>
The -L flag allows the user to specify a maximal number of
miscompares when using restore with the -C option to check
the backup. If this limit is reached, restore will <br>
abort with an error message. A value of 0 (the default
value) disables the check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Extract by inode numbers
rather than by file name. This is useful if only a few files
are being extracted, and one wants to avoid regenerating the
complete pathname to the <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Enables the multi-volume
feature (for reading dumps made using the -M option of
dump). The name specified with -f is treated as a prefix and
restore tries to read in <br>
sequence from &lt;prefix&gt;001, &lt;prefix&gt;002 etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N The -N flag causes restore to
perform a full execution as requested by one of -i, -R, -r,
t or x command without actually writing any file on
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o The -o flag causes restore to
automatically restore the current directory permissions
without asking the operator whether to do so in one of -i or
-x modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q file <br>
Use the file file in order to read tape position as stored
using the dump Quick File Access mode, in one of -i, -x or
-t mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended to set up the
st driver to return logical tape positions rather than
physical before calling dump/restore with parameter -Q.
Since not all tape devices <br>
support physical tape positions those tape devices return an
error during dump/restore when the st driver is set to the
default physical setting. Please see the st(4) man <br>
page, option MTSETDRVBUFFER , or the mt(1) man page, on how
to set the driver to return logical tape positions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before calling restore with
parameter -Q, always make sure the st driver is set to
return the same type of tape position used during the call
to dump. Otherwise restore <br>
may be confused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used when
restoring from local or remote tapes (see above) or from
local or remote files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s fileno <br>
Read from the specified fileno on a multi-file tape. File
numbering starts at 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T directory <br>
The -T flag allows the user to specify a directory to use
for the storage of temporary files. The default value is
/tmp. This flag is most useful when restoring files <br>
after having booted from a floppy. There might be little or
no space on the floppy filesystem, but another source of
space might exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u When creating certain types
of files, restore may generate a warning diagnostic if they
already exist in the target directory. To prevent this, the
-u (unlink) flag causes <br>
restore to remove old entries before attempting to create
new ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Normally restore does its
work silently. The -v (verbose) flag causes it to type the
name of each file it treats preceded by its file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Enables reading multi-volume
non-tape mediums like CDROMs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X filelist <br>
Read list of files to be listed or extracted from the text
file filelist in addition to those specified on the command
line. This can be used in conjunction with the -t or <br>
-x commands. The file filelist should contain file names
separated by newlines. filelist may be an ordinary file or -
(the standard input).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Do not ask the user whether
to abort the restore in the event of an error. Always try to
skip over the bad block(s) and continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The 4.3BSD option syntax is
implemented for backward compatibility but is not documented
here.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Complains if it gets a read error. If y has been specified,
or the user responds y, restore will attempt to continue the
restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a backup was made using more
than one tape volume, restore will notify the user when it
is time to mount the next volume. If the -x or -i flag has
been specified, restore will <br>
also ask which volume the user wishes to mount. The fastest
way to extract a few files is to start with the last volume,
and work towards the first volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are numerous consistency
checks that can be listed by restore. Most checks are
self-explanatory or can &acirc;never happen&acirc;. Common
errors are given below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converting to new file system
format <br>
A dump tape created from the old file system has been
loaded. It is automatically converted to the new file system
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;filename&gt;: not found on
tape <br>
The specified file name was listed in the tape directory,
but was not found on the tape. This is caused by tape read
errors while looking for the file, and from using a <br>
dump tape created on an active file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expected next file
&lt;inumber&gt;, got &lt;inumber&gt; <br>
A file that was not listed in the directory showed up. This
can occur when using a dump created on an active file
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incremental dump too low <br>
When doing an incremental restore, a dump that was written
before the previous incremental dump, or that has too low an
incremental level has been loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incremental dump too high <br>
When doing an incremental restore, a dump that does not
begin its coverage where the previous incremental dump left
off, or that has too high an incremental level has been <br>
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tape read error while restoring
&lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tape read error while skipping
over inode &lt;inumber&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tape read error while trying to
resynchronize <br>
A tape (or other media) read error has occurred. If a file
name is specified, its contents are probably partially
wrong. If an inode is being skipped or the tape is trying
<br>
to resynchronize, no extracted files have been corrupted,
though files may not be found on the tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resync restore, skipped
&lt;num&gt; blocks <br>
After a dump read error, restore may have to resynchronize
itself. This message lists the number of blocks that were
skipped over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Restore exits with zero status on success. Tape errors are
indicated with an exit code of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When doing a comparison of files
from a dump, an exit code of 2 indicates that some files
were modified or deleted since the dump was made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If the following environment variable exists it will be
utilized by restore:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAPE If no -f option was
specified, restore will use the device specified via TAPE as
the dump device. TAPE may be of the form tapename,
host:tapename or user@host:tapename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR The directory given in
TMPDIR will be used instead of /tmp to store temporary
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RMT The environment variable RMT
will be used to determine the pathname of the remote rmt(8)
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSH Restore uses the contents of
this variable to determine the name of the remote shell
command to use when doing a network restore (rsh, ssh etc.).
If this variable is not <br>
set, rcmd(3) will be used, but only root will be able to do
a network restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/st0 <br>
the default tape drive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/rstdir* <br>
file containing directories on the tape</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/rstmode* <br>
owner, mode, and time stamps for directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./restoresymtable <br>
information passed between incremental restores</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
dump(8), mount(8), mke2fs(8), rmt(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Restore can get confused when doing incremental restores
from dumps that were made on active file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A level 0 dump must be done
after a full restore. Because restore runs in user code, it
has no control over inode allocation; thus a full dump must
be done to get a new set of <br>
directories reflecting the new inode numbering, even though
the content of the files is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The temporary files /tmp/rstdir*
and /tmp/rstmode* are generated with a unique name based on
the date of the dump and the process ID (see mktemp(3)),
except when -r or -R is <br>
used. Because -R allows you to restart a -r operation that
may have been interrupted, the temporary files should be the
same across different processes. In all other cases, the
<br>
files are unique because it is possible to have two
different dumps started at the same time, and separate
operations shouldn&rsquo;t conflict with each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do a network restore, you
have to run restore as root or use a remote shell
replacement (see RSH variable). This is due to the previous
security history of dump and restore. <br>
( restore is written to be setuid root, but we are not
certain all bugs are gone from the code - run setuid at your
own risk.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of restores in -i or
-x modes (unless -o option is in use), restore will ask the
operator whether to set the permissions on the current
directory. If the operator con&acirc; <br>
firms this action, the permissions on the directory from
where restore was launched will be replaced by the
permissions on the dumped root inode. Although this
behaviour is not <br>
really a bug, it has proven itself to be confusing for many
users, so it is recommended to answer &rsquo;no&rsquo;,
unless you&rsquo;re performing a full restore and you do
want to restore the <br>
permissions on &rsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be underlined that
because it runs in user code, restore , when run with the -C
option, sees the files as the kernel presents them, whereas
dump sees all the files on a <br>
given filesystem. In particular, this can cause some
confusion when comparing a dumped filesystem a part of which
is hidden by a filesystem mounted on top of it.</p>
