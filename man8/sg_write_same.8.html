<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Send the SCSI WRITE SAME (10, 16 or 32 byte) command to <i>DEVICE</i>. This
  command writes the given block <i>NUM</i> times to consecutive blocks on the
  <i>DEVICE</i> starting at logical block address <i>LBA</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SBC-3 revision 35d introduced a &quot;no data-out buffer&quot; (NDOB) bit which,
  if set, bypasses the requirement to send a single block of data to the
  <i>DEVICE</i> together with the command. Only WRITE SAME (16 and 32 byte)
  support the NDOB bit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The length of the block to be written multiple times is obtained from either the
  <i>LEN</i> argument, or the length of the given input file <i>IF</i>, or by
  calling READ CAPACITY(16) on <i>DEVICE</i>. The contents of the block to be
  written are obtained from the input file <i>IF</i> or zeros are used. If READ
  CAPACITY(16) is called (which implies <i>IF</i> was not given) and the PROT_EN
  bit is set then an extra 8 bytes (i.e. more than the logical block size) of
  0xff are sent. If READ CAPACITY(16) fails then READ CAPACITY(10) is used to
  determine the block size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If neither <i>--10</i>, <i>--16</i> nor <i>--32</i> is given then WRITE SAME(10)
  is sent unless one of the following conditions is met. If <i>LBA</i> (plus
  <i>NUM</i>) exceeds 32 bits, <i>NUM</i> exceeds 65535, or the <i>--unmap</i>
  option is given then WRITE SAME(16) is sent. The <i>--10</i>, <i>--16</i> and
  <i>--32</i> options are mutually exclusive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In SBC-3 revision 26 the UNMAP and ANCHOR bits were added to the WRITE SAME (10)
  command. Since the UNMAP bit has been in WRITE SAME (16) and WRITE SAME (32)
  since SBC-3 revision 18, the lower of the two (i.e. WRITE SAME (16)) is the
  default when the <i>--unmap</i> option is given. To send WRITE SAME (10) use
  the <i>--10</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Take care:</b> The WRITE SAME(10, 16 and 32) commands interpret a <i>NUM</i>
  of zero as write to the end of <i>DEVICE</i>. This utility defaults <i>NUM</i>
  to 1 . The WRITE SAME commands have no IMMED bit so if <i>NUM</i> is large (or
  zero) then an invocation of this utility could take a long time, potentially
  as long as a FORMAT UNIT command. In such situations the command timeout value
  <i>TO</i> may need to be increased from its default value of 60 seconds. In
  SBC-3 revision 26 the WSNZ (write same no zero) bit was added to the Block
  Limits VPD page [0xB0]. If set the WRITE SAME commands will not accept a
  <i>NUM</i> of zero. The same SBC-3 revision added the &quot;Maximum Write Same
  Length&quot; field to the Block Limits VPD page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Logical Block Provisioning VPD page [0xB2] contains the LBWS and LBW10 bits.
  If LBWS is set then WRITE SAME (16) supports the UNMAP bit. If LBWS10 is set
  then WRITE SAME (10) supports the UNMAP bit. If either LBWS or LBWS10 is set
  and the WRITE SAME (32) is supported then WRITE SAME (32) supports the UNMAP
  bit. This is as of SBC-3 revision 26.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a precaution against an accidental 'sg_write_same /dev/sda' (for example)
  overwriting LBA 0 on /dev/sda with zeros, at least one of the <i>--in=IF</i>,
  <i>--lba=LBA</i> or <i>--num=NUM</i> options must be given. Obviously this
  utility can destroy a lot of user data so check the options carefully.

Logical block provisioning is a new term introduced in SBC-3 revision 25 for the
  ability to mark blocks as unused. It is closely related to the ATA DATA SET
  MANAGEMENT command with the &quot;Trim&quot; bit set. For large storage
  arrays, it is a way to provision less physical storage than the READ CAPACITY
  command reports is available, potentially allocating more physical storage
  when WRITE commands require it. For flash memory it is a way of potentially
  saving power (and perhaps access time) when it is known large sections (or
  almost all) of the flash memory is not in use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for logical block provisioning is indicated by the LBPME bit being set
  in the READ CAPACITY(16) command response (see the sg_readcap utility). That
  implies at least one of the UNMAP or WRITE SAME(16) commands is implemented.
  If the UNMAP command is implemented then the &quot;Maximum unmap LBA
  count&quot; and &quot;Maximum unmap block descriptor count&quot; fields in the
  Block Limits VPD page should both be greater than zero. The READ CAPACITY(16)
  command response also contains a LBPRZ bit which if set means that if unmapped
  blocks are read then zeros will be returned for the data (and if protection
  information is active, 0xff bytes are returned for that). In SBC-3 revision 27
  the same LBPRZ bit was added to the Logical Block Provisioning VPD page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In SBC-3 revision 25 the LBPU and ANC_SUP bits where added to the Logical Block
  Provisioning VPD page. When LBPU is set it indicates that the device supports
  the UNMAP command (see the sg_unmap utility). When the ANC_SUP bit is set it
  indicates the device supports anchored LBAs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the UNMAP bit is set in the cdb then the data out buffer is also sent.
  Additionally the data section of that data out buffer should be full of 0x0
  bytes while the data protection block, 8 bytes at the end if present, should
  be set to 0xff bytes. If these conditions are not met and the LBPRZ bit is set
  then the UNMAP bit is ignored and the data out buffer is written to the
  <i>DEVICE</i> as if the UNMAP bit was zero. In the absence of the
  <i>--in=IF</i> option, this utility will attempt build a data out buffer that
  meets the requirements for the UNMAP bit in the cdb to be acted on by the
  <i>DEVICE</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Logical blocks may also be unmapped by the SCSI UNMAP and FORMAT UNIT commands
  (see the sg_unmap and sg_format utilities).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Various numeric arguments (e.g. <i>LBA</i>) may include multiplicative suffixes
  or be given in hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in
  the sg3_utils(8) man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Linux at this time the sg driver does not support cdb sizes greater than 16
  bytes. Hence a device node like /dev/sg1 which is associated with the sg
  driver will fail with this utility if the <i>--32</i> option is given (or
  implied by other options). The bsg driver with device nodes like
  /dev/bsg/6:0:0:1 does support cdb sizes greater than 16 bytes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
The exit status of sg_write_same is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
  sg3_utils(8) man page.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
One simple usage is to write blocks of zero from (and including) a given LBA:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_write_same --lba=0x1234 --num=63 /dev/sdc
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since <i>--xferlen=LEN</i> has not been given, then this utility will call the
  READ CAPACITY command on /dev/sdc to determine the number of bytes in a
  logical block. Let us assume that is 512 bytes. Since <i>--in=IF</i> is not
  given a block of zeros is assumed. So 63 blocks of zeros (each block
  containing 512 bytes) will be written from (and including) LBA 0x1234 . Note
  that only one block of zeros is passed to the SCSI WRITE SAME command in the
  data out buffer (as required by SBC-3).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A similar example follows but in this case the blocks are &quot;unmapped&quot;
  (&quot;trimmed&quot; in ATA speak) rather than zeroed:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_write_same --unmap -L 0x1234 -n 63 /dev/sdc
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if the LBPRZ bit in the READ CAPACITY(16) response is set (i.e. LPPRZ
  is an acronym for logical block provisioning read zeros) then these two
  examples do the same thing, at least seen from the point of view of subsequent
  reads.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This utility can also be used to write protection information (PI) on disks
  formatted with a protection type greater than zero. PI is 8 bytes of extra
  data appended to the user data of a logical block: the first two bytes are a
  CRC (the &quot;guard&quot;), the next two bytes are the &quot;application
  tag&quot; and the last four bytes are the &quot;reference tag&quot;. With
  protection types 1 and 2 if the application tag is 0xffff then the guard
  should not be checked (against the user data).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this example we assume the logical block size (of the user data) is 512 bytes
  and the disk has been formatted with protection type 1. Since we are going to
  modify LBA 2468 then we take a copy of it first:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512 of=2468.bin count=1
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following command line sets the user data to zeros and the PI to 8 0xFF
  bytes on LBA 2468:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_write_same --lba=2468 /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reading back that block should be successful because the application tag is
  0xffff which suppresses the guard (CRC) check (which would otherwise be
  wrong):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now an attempt is made to create a binary file with zeros in the user data,
  0x0000 in the application tag and 0xff bytes in the other two PI fields. It is
  awkward to create 0xff bytes in a file (in Unix) as the &quot;tr&quot; command
  below shows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=512 of=ud.bin
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 tr &quot;\000&quot; &quot;\377&quot; &lt; /dev/zero | dd bs=1 of=ff_s.bin
  count=8
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 cat ud.bin ff_s.bin &gt; lb.bin
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=2 seek=514 conv=notrunc of=lb.bin
<div class="Pp"></div>
The resulting file can be viewed with 'hexdump -C lb.bin' and should contain 520
  bytes. Now that file can be written to LBA 2468 as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_write_same --lba=2468 wrprotect=3 --in=lb.bin /dev/sdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note the <i>--wrprotect=3</i> rather than being set to 1, since we want the
  WRITE SAME command to succeed even though the PI data now indicates the user
  data is corrupted. When an attempt is made to read the LBA, an error should
  occur:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1
<div class="Pp"></div>
dd errors are not very expressive, if dmesg is checked there should be a line
  something like this: &quot;[sdb] Add. Sense: Logical block guard check
  failed&quot;. The block can be corrected by doing a &quot;sg_write_same
  --lba=1234 /dev/sdb&quot; again or restoring the original contents of that
  LBA:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 dd if=2468.bin bs=512 seek=2468 of=/dev/sdb conv=notrunc count=1
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hopefully the dd command would never try to truncate the output file when it is
  a block device.
