<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_write_same - send SCSI WRITE SAME command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_write_same [--10] [--16] [--32] [--anchor] [--grpnum=GN]
[--help] [--in=IF] [--lba=LBA] [--lbdata] [--pbdata]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Send the SCSI WRITE SAME (10, 16 or 32 byte) command to
DEVICE. This command writes the given block NUM times to
consecutive blocks on the DEVICE starting at logical block
<br>
address LBA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SBC-3 revision 35d introduced a
&quot;no data-out buffer&quot; (NDOB) bit which, if set,
bypasses the requirement to send a single block of data to
the DEVICE together with the command. <br>
Only WRITE SAME (16 and 32 byte) support the NDOB bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The length of the block to be
written multiple times is obtained from either the LEN
argument, or the length of the given input file IF, or by
calling READ CAPACITY(16) on <br>
DEVICE. The contents of the block to be written are obtained
from the input file IF or zeros are used. If READ
CAPACITY(16) is called (which implies IF was not given) and
the <br>
PROT_EN bit is set then an extra 8 bytes (i.e. more than the
logical block size) of 0xff are sent. If READ CAPACITY(16)
fails then READ CAPACITY(10) is used to determine the <br>
block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither --10, --16 nor --32
is given then WRITE SAME(10) is sent unless one of the
following conditions is met. If LBA (plus NUM) exceeds 32
bits, NUM exceeds 65535, or the <br>
--unmap option is given then WRITE SAME(16) is sent. The
--10, --16 and --32 options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In SBC-3 revision 26 the UNMAP
and ANCHOR bits were added to the WRITE SAME (10) command.
Since the UNMAP bit has been in WRITE SAME (16) and WRITE
SAME (32) since SBC-3 revision <br>
18, the lower of the two (i.e. WRITE SAME (16)) is the
default when the --unmap option is given. To send WRITE SAME
(10) use the --10 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Take care: The WRITE SAME(10, 16
and 32) commands interpret a NUM of zero as write to the end
of DEVICE. This utility defaults NUM to 1 . The WRITE SAME
commands have no IMMED <br>
bit so if NUM is large (or zero) then an invocation of this
utility could take a long time, potentially as long as a
FORMAT UNIT command. In such situations the command timeout
<br>
value TO may need to be increased from its default value of
60 seconds. In SBC-3 revision 26 the WSNZ (write same no
zero) bit was added to the Block Limits VPD page [0xB0]. If
<br>
set the WRITE SAME commands will not accept a NUM of zero.
The same SBC-3 revision added the &quot;Maximum Write Same
Length&quot; field to the Block Limits VPD page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Logical Block Provisioning
VPD page [0xB2] contains the LBWS and LBW10 bits. If LBWS is
set then WRITE SAME (16) supports the UNMAP bit. If LBWS10
is set then WRITE SAME <br>
(10) supports the UNMAP bit. If either LBWS or LBWS10 is set
and the WRITE SAME (32) is supported then WRITE SAME (32)
supports the UNMAP bit. This is as of SBC-3 revision 26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a precaution against an
accidental &rsquo;sg_write_same /dev/sda&rsquo; (for
example) overwriting LBA 0 on /dev/sda with zeros, at least
one of the --in=IF, --lba=LBA or --num=NUM options <br>
must be given. Obviously this utility can destroy a lot of
user data so check the options carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --10 <br>
send a SCSI WRITE SAME (10) command to DEVICE. The ability
to set the --unmap (and --anchor) options to this command
was added in SBC-3 revision 26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --16 <br>
send a SCSI WRITE SAME (16) command to DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --32 <br>
send a SCSI WRITE SAME (32) command to DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --anchor <br>
sets the ANCHOR bit in the cdb. Introduced in SBC-3 revision
22. That draft requires the --unmap option to also be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --grpnum=GN <br>
sets the &rsquo;Group number&rsquo; field to GN. Defaults to
a value of zero. GN should be a value between 0 and 31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --in=IF <br>
read data (binary) from file named IF and use it as the data
out buffer for the SCSI WRITE SAME command. The length of
the data out buffer is --xferlen=LEN or, if that is <br>
not given, the length of the IF file. If IF is &quot;-&quot;
then stdin is read. If this option is not given then 0x00
bytes are used as fill with the length of the data out
buffer <br>
obtained from --xferlen=LEN or by calling READ CAPACITY(16
or 10). If the response to READ CAPACITY(16) has the PROT_EN
bit set then data out buffer size is modified <br>
accordingly with the last 8 bytes set to 0xff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lba=LBA <br>
where LBA is the logical block address to start the WRITE
SAME command. Defaults to lba 0 which is a dangerous block
to overwrite on a disk that is in use. Assumed to be <br>
in decimal unless prefixed with &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or has a
trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --lbdata <br>
sets the LBDATA bit in the WRITE SAME cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --ndob <br>
sets the NDOB bit in the WRITE SAME (16 and 32 byte)
commands. Default is to clear this bit. When this option is
given then --in=IF is not allowed and --xferlen=LEN can <br>
only be given if LEN is 0 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --num=NUM <br>
where NUM is the number of blocks, starting at LBA, to write
the data out buffer to. The default value for NUM is 1. The
value corresponds to the &rsquo;Number of logical <br>
blocks&rsquo; field in the WRITE SAME cdb. Note that a value
of 0 in NUM is interpreted as write the data out buffer on
every block starting at LBA to the end of the DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pbdata <br>
sets the PBDATA bit in the WRITE SAME cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout=TO <br>
where TO is the command timeout value in seconds. The
default value is 60 seconds. If NUM is large (or zero) a
WRITE SAME command may require considerably more time than
<br>
60 seconds to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --unmap <br>
sets the UNMAP bit in the WRITE SAME(10, 16 and 32) cdb. See
UNMAP section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
output version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wrprotect=WPR <br>
sets the &quot;Write protect&quot; field in the WRITE SAME
cdb to WPR. The default value is zero. WPR should be a value
between 0 and 7. When WPR is 1 or greater, and the
disk&rsquo;s <br>
protection type is 1 or greater, then 8 extra bytes of
protection information are expected or generated (to place
in the command&rsquo;s data out buffer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --xferlen=LEN <br>
where LEN is the data out buffer length. Defaults to the
length of the IF file or, if that is not given, then the
READ CAPACITY(16 or 10) command is used to find the
&rsquo;Log&acirc; <br>
ical block length in bytes&rsquo;. That figure may be
increased by 8 bytes if the DEVICE&rsquo;s protection type
is 1 or greater and the WRPROTECT field (see
--wrprotect=WPR) is 1 or <br>
greater. If both this option and the IF option are given and
LEN exceeds the length of the IF file then LEN is the data
out buffer length with zeros used as pad bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNMAP <br>
Logical block provisioning is a new term introduced in SBC-3
revision 25 for the ability to mark blocks as unused. It is
closely related to the ATA DATA SET MANAGEMENT command <br>
with the &quot;Trim&quot; bit set. For large storage arrays,
it is a way to provision less physical storage than the READ
CAPACITY command reports is available, potentially
allocating more <br>
physical storage when WRITE commands require it. For flash
memory it is a way of potentially saving power (and perhaps
access time) when it is known large sections (or almost <br>
all) of the flash memory is not in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for logical block
provisioning is indicated by the LBPME bit being set in the
READ CAPACITY(16) command response (see the sg_readcap
utility). That implies at least one <br>
of the UNMAP or WRITE SAME(16) commands is implemented. If
the UNMAP command is implemented then the &quot;Maximum
unmap LBA count&quot; and &quot;Maximum unmap block
descriptor count&quot; fields <br>
in the Block Limits VPD page should both be greater than
zero. The READ CAPACITY(16) command response also contains a
LBPRZ bit which if set means that if unmapped blocks are
<br>
read then zeros will be returned for the data (and if
protection information is active, 0xff bytes are returned
for that). In SBC-3 revision 27 the same LBPRZ bit was added
to <br>
the Logical Block Provisioning VPD page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In SBC-3 revision 25 the LBPU
and ANC_SUP bits where added to the Logical Block
Provisioning VPD page. When LBPU is set it indicates that
the device supports the UNMAP command <br>
(see the sg_unmap utility). When the ANC_SUP bit is set it
indicates the device supports anchored LBAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the UNMAP bit is set in the
cdb then the data out buffer is also sent. Additionally the
data section of that data out buffer should be full of 0x0
bytes while the data pro&acirc; <br>
tection block, 8 bytes at the end if present, should be set
to 0xff bytes. If these conditions are not met and the LBPRZ
bit is set then the UNMAP bit is ignored and the data out
<br>
buffer is written to the DEVICE as if the UNMAP bit was
zero. In the absence of the --in=IF option, this utility
will attempt build a data out buffer that meets the
requirements <br>
for the UNMAP bit in the cdb to be acted on by the
DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical blocks may also be
unmapped by the SCSI UNMAP and FORMAT UNIT commands (see the
sg_unmap and sg_format utilities).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Various numeric arguments (e.g. LBA) may include
multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the
&quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Linux at this time the sg
driver does not support cdb sizes greater than 16 bytes.
Hence a device node like /dev/sg1 which is associated with
the sg driver will fail with this <br>
utility if the --32 option is given (or implied by other
options). The bsg driver with device nodes like
/dev/bsg/6:0:0:1 does support cdb sizes greater than 16
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_write_same is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
One simple usage is to write blocks of zero from (and
including) a given LBA:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same --lba=0x1234
--num=63 /dev/sdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since --xferlen=LEN has not been
given, then this utility will call the READ CAPACITY command
on /dev/sdc to determine the number of bytes in a logical
block. Let us assume that <br>
is 512 bytes. Since --in=IF is not given a block of zeros is
assumed. So 63 blocks of zeros (each block containing 512
bytes) will be written from (and including) LBA 0x1234 .
<br>
Note that only one block of zeros is passed to the SCSI
WRITE SAME command in the data out buffer (as required by
SBC-3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar example follows but in
this case the blocks are &quot;unmapped&quot;
(&quot;trimmed&quot; in ATA speak) rather than zeroed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same --unmap -L 0x1234
-n 63 /dev/sdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the LBPRZ bit in
the READ CAPACITY(16) response is set (i.e. LPPRZ is an
acronym for logical block provisioning read zeros) then
these two examples do the same <br>
thing, at least seen from the point of view of subsequent
reads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can also be used to
write protection information (PI) on disks formatted with a
protection type greater than zero. PI is 8 bytes of extra
data appended to the user <br>
data of a logical block: the first two bytes are a CRC (the
&quot;guard&quot;), the next two bytes are the
&quot;application tag&quot; and the last four bytes are the
&quot;reference tag&quot;. With protec&acirc; <br>
tion types 1 and 2 if the application tag is 0xffff then the
guard should not be checked (against the user data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example we assume the
logical block size (of the user data) is 512 bytes and the
disk has been formatted with protection type 1. Since we are
going to modify LBA 2468 <br>
then we take a copy of it first:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512
of=2468.bin count=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command line sets
the user data to zeros and the PI to 8 0xFF bytes on LBA
2468:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same --lba=2468
/dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading back that block should
be successful because the application tag is 0xffff which
suppresses the guard (CRC) check (which would otherwise be
wrong):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512
of=/dev/null count=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now an attempt is made to create
a binary file with zeros in the user data, 0x0000 in the
application tag and 0xff bytes in the other two PI fields.
It is awkward to create 0xff <br>
bytes in a file (in Unix) as the &quot;tr&quot; command
below shows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=512
of=ud.bin <br>
tr &quot; 00&quot; &quot;377&quot; &lt; /dev/zero | dd bs=1
of=ff_s.bin count=8 <br>
cat ud.bin ff_s.bin &gt; lb.bin <br>
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=2 seek=514 conv=notrunc
of=lb.bin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting file can be viewed
with &rsquo;hexdump -C lb.bin&rsquo; and should contain 520
bytes. Now that file can be written to LBA 2468 as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same --lba=2468
wrprotect=3 --in=lb.bin /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the --wrprotect=3 rather
than being set to 1, since we want the WRITE SAME command to
succeed even though the PI data now indicates the user data
is corrupted. When an <br>
attempt is made to read the LBA, an error should occur:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512
of=/dev/null count=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd errors are not very
expressive, if dmesg is checked there should be a line
something like this: &quot;[sdb] Add. Sense: Logical block
guard check failed&quot;. The block can be cor&acirc; <br>
rected by doing a &quot;sg_write_same --lba=1234
/dev/sdb&quot; again or restoring the original contents of
that LBA:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=2468.bin bs=512 seek=2468
of=/dev/sdb conv=notrunc count=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hopefully the dd command would
never try to truncate the output file when it is a block
device.</p>
