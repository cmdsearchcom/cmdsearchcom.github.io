<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tftpd - Trivial File Transfer Protocol server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
in.tftpd [options...] directory...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tftpd is a server for the Trivial File Transfer Protocol.
The TFTP protocol is extensively used to support remote
booting of diskless devices. The server is normally started
by <br>
inetd, but can also run standalone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--ipv4, -4 <br>
Connect with IPv4 only, even if IPv6 support was compiled
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipv6, -6 <br>
Connect with IPv6 only, if compiled in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --listen <br>
Run the server in standalone (listen) mode, rather than run
from inetd. In listen mode, the --timeout option is ignored,
and the --address option can be used to specify a <br>
specific local address or port to listen to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foreground, -L <br>
Similar to --listen but do not detach from the foreground
process. Implies --listen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--address [address][:port], -a
[address][:port] <br>
Specify a specific address and port to listen to when called
with the --listen or --foreground option. The default is to
listen to the tftp port specified in /etc/ser&acirc; <br>
vices on all local addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note: Numeric IPv6
adresses must be enclosed in square brackets to avoid
ambiguity with the optional port information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create, -c <br>
Allow new files to be created. By default, tftpd will only
allow upload of files that already exist. Files are created
with default permissions allowing anyone to read <br>
or write them, unless the --permissive or --umask options
are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--secure, -s <br>
Change root directory on startup. This means the remote host
does not need to pass along the directory as part of the
transfer, and may add security. When --secure is <br>
specified, exactly one directory should be specified on the
command line. The use of this option is recommended for
security as well as compatibility with some boot ROMs <br>
which cannot be easily made to include a directory name in
its request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user username, -u username
<br>
Specify the username which tftpd will run as; the default is
&quot;nobody&quot;. The user ID, group ID, and (if possible
on the platform) the supplementary group IDs will be set to
<br>
the ones specified in the system permission database for
this username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--umask umask, -U umask <br>
Sets the umask for newly created files to the specified
value. The default is zero (anyone can read or write) if the
--permissive option is not specified, or inherited <br>
from the invoking process if --permissive is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--permissive, -p <br>
Perform no additional permissions checks above the normal
system-provided access controls for the user specified via
the --user option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile pidfile, -P pidfile
<br>
When run in standalone mode, write the process ID of the
listening server into pidfile. On normal termination
(SIGTERM or SIGINT) the pid file is automatically
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout timeout, -t timeout
<br>
When run from inetd this specifies how long, in seconds, to
wait for a second connection before terminating the server.
inetd will then respawn the server when another <br>
request comes in. The default is 900 (15 minutes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retransmit timeout, -T timeout
<br>
Determine the default timeout, in microseconds, before the
first packet is retransmitted. This can be modified by the
client if the timeout or utimeout option is negoti&acirc;
<br>
ated. The default is 1000000 (1 second.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--map-file remap-file, -m
remap-file <br>
Specify the use of filename remapping. The remap-file is a
file containing the remapping rules. See the section on
filename remapping below. This option may not be com&acirc;
<br>
piled in, see the output of in.tftpd -V to verify whether or
not it is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose, -v <br>
Increase the logging verbosity of tftpd. This flag can be
specified multiple times for even higher verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbosity value <br>
Set the verbosity value to value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refuse tftp-option, -r
tftp-option <br>
Indicate that a specific RFC 2347 TFTP option should never
be accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--blocksize max-block-size, -B
max-block-size <br>
Specifies the maximum permitted block size. The permitted
range for this parameter is from 512 to 65464. Some embedded
clients request large block sizes and yet do not <br>
handle fragmented packets correctly; for these clients, it
is recommended to set this value to the smallest MTU on your
network minus 32 bytes (20 bytes for IP, 8 for UDP, <br>
and 4 for TFTP; less if you use IP options on your network.)
For example, on a standard Ethernet (MTU 1500) a value of
1468 is reasonable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--port-range port:port, -R
port:port <br>
Force the server port number (the Transaction ID) to be in
the specified range of port numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version, -V <br>
Print the version number and configuration to standard
output, then exit gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC 2347 OPTION NEGOTIATION <br>
This version of tftpd supports RFC 2347 option negotation.
Currently implemented options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blksize (RFC 2348) <br>
Set the transfer block size to anything less than or equal
to the specified option. This version of tftpd can support
any block size up to the theoretical maximum of <br>
65464 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blksize2 (nonstandard) <br>
Set the transfer block size to anything less than or equal
to the specified option, but restrict the possible responses
to powers of 2. The maximum is 32768 bytes (the <br>
largest power of 2 less than or equal to 65464.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsize (RFC 2349) <br>
Report the size of the file that is about to be transferred.
This version of tftpd only supports the tsize option for
binary (octet) mode transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout (RFC 2349) <br>
Set the time before the server retransmits a packet, in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utimeout (nonstandard) <br>
Set the time before the server retransmits a packet, in
microseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollover (nonstandard) <br>
Set the block number to resume at after a block number
rollover. The default and recommended value is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --refuse option can be used
to disable specific options; this may be necessary to work
around bugs in specific TFTP client implementations. For
example, some TFTP clients <br>
have been found to request the blksize option, but crash
with an error if they actually get the option accepted by
the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILENAME REMAPPING <br>
The --mapfile option specifies a file which contains
filename remapping rules. Each non-comment line (comments
begin with hash marks, #) contains an operation, specified
below; <br>
a regex, a regular expression in the style of egrep; and
optionally a replacement pattern. The operation indicated by
operation is performed if the regex matches all or part of
<br>
the filename. Rules are processed from the top down, and by
default, all rules are processed even if there is a
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation can be any
combination of the following letters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Replace the substring matched
by regex by the replacement pattern. The replacement pattern
may contain escape sequences; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Repeat this rule until it no
longer matches. This is always used with r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Match the regex
case-insensitively. By default it is case sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e If this rule matches, end rule
processing after executing the rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s If this rule matches, start
rule processing over from the very first rule after
executing this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a If this rule matches, refuse
the request and send an access denied error to the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G This rule applies to GET (RRQ)
requests only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P This rule applies to PUT (WRQ)
requests only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ Inverse the sense of this
rule, i.e. execute the operation only if the regex
doesn&rsquo;t match. Cannot used together with r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following escape sequences
are recognized as part of the replacement pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entire string matched by the
regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 to 9 <br>
The strings matched by each of the first nine parenthesized
subexpressions, ... , of the regex pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i The IP address of the
requesting host, in dotted-quad notation (e.g.
192.0.2.169).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IP address of the requesting
host, in hexadecimal notation (e.g. C00002A9).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">\ Literal backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192 <br>
Literal whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Turns all subsequent letters
to upper case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns all subsequent letters to
lower case. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cancels the effect of U or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the mapping file is changed,
you need to send SIGHUP to any outstanding tftpd
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
The use of TFTP services does not require an account or
password on the server system. Due to the lack of
authentication information, tftpd will allow only publicly
readable <br>
files (o+r) to be accessed, unless the --permissive option
is specified. Files may be written only if they already
exist and are publicly writable, unless the --create option
is <br>
specified. Note that this extends the concept of
&lsquo;&lsquo;public&rsquo;&rsquo; to include all users on
all hosts that can be reached through the network; this may
not be appropriate on all sys&acirc; <br>
tems, and its implications should be considered before
enabling TFTP service. Typically, some kind of firewall or
packet-filter solution should be employed. If appropriately
<br>
compiled (see the output of in.tftpd --version) tftpd will
query the hosts_access(5) database for access control
information. This may be slow; sites requiring maximum
perfor&acirc; <br>
mance may want to compile without this option and rely on
firewalling or kernel-based packet filters instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server should be set to run
as the user with the lowest possible privilege; please see
the --user flag. It is probably a good idea to set up a
specific user account for <br>
tftpd, rather than letting it run as &quot;nobody&quot;, to
guard against privilege leaks between applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to files can, and should,
be restricted by invoking tftpd with a list of directories
by including pathnames as server program arguments on the
command line. In this case <br>
access is restricted to files whole names are prefixed by
one of the given directories. If possible, it is recommended
that the --secure flag is used to set up a chroot()
envi&acirc; <br>
ronment for the server to run in once a connection has been
set up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the filename remapping
(--mapfile flag) support can be used to provide a limited
amount of additional access control.</p>
