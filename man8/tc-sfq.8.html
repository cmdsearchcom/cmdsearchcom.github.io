<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Stochastic Fairness Queueing is a classless queueing
discipline available for traffic control with the tc(8)
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SFQ does not shape traffic but
only schedules the transmission of packets, based on
&rsquo;flows&rsquo;. The goal is to ensure fairness so that
each flow is able to send data in turn, thus <br>
preventing any single flow from drowning out the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may in fact have some
effect in mitigating a Denial of Service attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SFQ is work-conserving and
therefore always delivers a packet if it has one
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHM <br>
On enqueueing, each packet is assigned to a hash bucket,
based on the packets hash value. This hash value is either
obtained from an external flow classifier (use tc filter to
<br>
set them), or a default internal classifier if no external
classifier has been configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the internal classifier is
used, sfq uses</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i) Source address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(ii) Destination address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(iii) Source and Destination
port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If these are available. SFQ
knows about ipv4 and ipv6 and also UDP, TCP and ESP. Packets
with other protocols are hashed based on the 32bits
representation of their destination <br>
and source. A flow corresponds mostly to a TCP/IP
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these buckets should
represent a unique flow. Because multiple flows may get
hashed to the same bucket, sfqs internal hashing algorithm
may be perturbed at configurable <br>
intervals so that the unfairness lasts only for a short
while. Perturbation may however cause some inadvertent
packet reordering to occur. After linux-3.3, there is no
packet <br>
reordering problem, but possible packet drops if rehashing
hits one limit (number of flows or packets per flow)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dequeuing, each hashbucket
with data is queried in a round robin fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before linux-3.3, the compile
time maximum length of the SFQ is 128 packets, which can be
spread over at most 128 buckets of 1024 available. In case
of overflow, tail-drop is <br>
performed on the fullest bucket, thus maintaining
fairness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After linux-3.3, maximum length
of SFQ is 65535 packets, and divisor limit is 65536. In case
of overflow, tail-drop is performed on the fullest bucket,
unless headdrop was <br>
requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
divisor <br>
Can be used to set a different hash table size, available
from kernel 2.6.39 onwards. The specified divisor must be a
power of two and cannot be larger than 65536. <br>
Default value: 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit Upper limit of the SFQ.
Can be used to reduce the default length of 127 packets.
After linux-3.3, it can be raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">depth Limit of packets per flow
(after linux-3.3). Default to 127 and can be lowered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perturb <br>
Interval in seconds for queue algorithm perturbation.
Defaults to 0, which means that no perturbation occurs. Do
not set too low for each perturbation may cause some <br>
packet reordering or losses. Advised value: 60 This value
has no effect when external flow classification is used. Its
better to increase divisor value to lower risk of <br>
hash collisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quantum <br>
Amount of bytes a flow is allowed to dequeue during a round
of the round robin process. Defaults to the MTU of the
interface which is also the advised value and the
mini&acirc; <br>
mum value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flows After linux-3.3, it is
possible to change the default limit of flows. Default value
is 127</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headdrop <br>
Default SFQ behavior is to perform tail-drop of packets from
a flow. You can ask a headdrop instead, as this is known to
provide a better feedback for TCP flows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redflowlimit <br>
Configure the optional RED module on top of each SFQ flow.
Random Early Detection principle is to perform packet marks
or drops in a probabilistic way. (man tc-red for <br>
details about RED) <br>
redflowlimit configures the hard limit on the real (not
average) queue size per SFQ flow in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min Average queue size at which
marking becomes a possibility. Defaults to max /3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max At this average queue size,
the marking probability is maximal. Defaults to redflowlimit
/4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">probability <br>
Maximum probability for marking, specified as a floating
point number from 0.0 to 1.0. Default value is 0.02</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avpkt Specified in bytes. Used
with burst to determine the time constant for average queue
size calculations. Default value is 1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">burst Used for determining how
fast the average queue size is influenced by the real queue
size. <br>
Default value is : <br>
(2 * min + max) / (3 * avpkt)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ecn RED can either
&rsquo;mark&rsquo; or &rsquo;drop&rsquo;. Explicit
Congestion Notification allows RED to notify remote hosts
that their rate exceeds the amount of bandwidth available.
Non-ECN <br>
capable hosts can only be notified by dropping a packet. If
this parameter is specified, packets which indicate that
their hosts honor ECN will only be marked and not <br>
dropped, unless the queue size hits depth packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">harddrop <br>
If average flow queue size is above max bytes, this
parameter forces a drop instead of ecn marking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE <br>
To attach to device ppp0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tc qdisc add dev ppp0 root
sfq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that SFQ, like all
non-shaping (work-conserving) qdiscs, is only useful if it
owns the queue. This is the case when the link speed equals
the actually available <br>
bandwidth. This holds for regular phone modems, ISDN
connections and direct non-switched ethernet links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most often, cable modems and DSL
devices do not fall into this category. The same holds for
when connected to a switch and trying to send data to a
congested segment also con&acirc; <br>
nected to the switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, the effective
queue does not reside within Linux and is therefore not
available for scheduling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Embed SFQ in a classful qdisc to
make sure it owns the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to use external
classifiers with sfq, for example to hash traffic based only
on source/destination ip addresses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tc filter add ... flow hash
keys src,dst perturb 30 divisor 1024</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the given divisor
should match the one used by sfq. If you have changed the
sfq default of 1024, use the same value for the flow hash
filter, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of sfq with optional RED
mode :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent
1:1 handle 10: sfq limit 3000 flows 512 divisor 16384 <br>
redflowlimit 100000 min 8000 max 60000 probability 0.20 ecn
