<b>parprouted</b> - Proxy ARP IP bridging daemon

parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy ARP bridging. Unlike
  standard bridging, proxy ARP bridging allows to bridge Ethernet networks
  behind wireless nodes. Normal L2 bridging does not work between wireless nodes
  because wireless does not know about MAC addresses used in the wired Ethernet
  networks. Also this daemon is useful for making transparent firewalls.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The daemon listens for incoming ARP requests, and in case the location of the
  requested IP address is unknown, forwards them to other interfaces, as well as
  updates kernel ARP table with the received replies. When necessary, the daemon
  generates an ARP reply itself, which causes the stations to send traffic to
  the host daemon is running on. By automatically adding appropriate /32 routes
  to Linux kernel IP routing table for the hosts learned via ARP, daemon ensures
  that the Linux kernel will be able to route the packets to the destination
  host when it receives them without any need routing/subnetting manually.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All routes entered by the daemon have a metric of 50.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unless you use <b>-p</b> switch, all entries in the ARP table will be refreshed
  (rechecked by sending ARP requests) every 50 seconds. This keeps them from
  being expired by kernel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally it takes about 60 ms for a bridge to update all its tables and start
  sending packets to the destination.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REQUIREMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#REQUIREMENTS">REQUIREMENTS</a></h1>
This daemon can be used for unicast traffic only. I.e., DHCP is not supported.
  Use software such as dhcrelay to &quot;bridge&quot; DHCP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should have an IP address assigned on all of your interfaces that you do
  bridging on. There is no need for this address to be from the same networks as
  the bridged networks. Any dummy address will do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The system should have correct default route.
<div class="Pp"></div>
parprouted requires &quot;ip&quot; program from iproute2 tools to be installed
  in /sbin. If it is installed in another location, please replace
  &quot;/sbin/ip&quot; occurances in the source with the correct path. As well
  you should have proc filesystem mounted in /proc because the daemon uses
  /proc/net/arp.
<div class="Pp"></div>
parprouted is designed for and tested only with Linux 2.4.x kernels.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The list of interfaces to do bridging on should be given via the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The daemon accepts the following switches:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-d</b>, which stands for debugging. If you run it in debugging mode the
  daemon will not go to background and will print additional debugging
  information to stdout/stderr.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p</b>, which makes all ARP entries to be permanent. This will also result in
  that ARP tables will not be refreshed by ARP pings.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
To bridge between wlan0 and eth0: <b>parprouted eth0 wlan0</b>
