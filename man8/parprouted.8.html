<p>PARPROUTED(8) Proxy ARP Bridging Daemon
PARPROUTED(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
parprouted - Proxy ARP IP bridging daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
parprouted [-d] [-p] interface [interface]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy
ARP bridging. Unlike standard bridging, proxy ARP bridging
allows to bridge Ethernet networks behind wireless nodes.
<br>
Normal L2 bridging does not work between wireless nodes
because wireless does not know about MAC addresses used in
the wired Ethernet networks. Also this daemon is useful for
<br>
making transparent firewalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon listens for incoming
ARP requests, and in case the location of the requested IP
address is unknown, forwards them to other interfaces, as
well as updates kernel ARP <br>
table with the received replies. When necessary, the daemon
generates an ARP reply itself, which causes the stations to
send traffic to the host daemon is running on. By
automat&acirc; <br>
ically adding appropriate /32 routes to Linux kernel IP
routing table for the hosts learned via ARP, daemon ensures
that the Linux kernel will be able to route the packets to
the <br>
destination host when it receives them without any need
routing/subnetting manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All routes entered by the daemon
have a metric of 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you use -p switch, all
entries in the ARP table will be refreshed (rechecked by
sending ARP requests) every 50 seconds. This keeps them from
being expired by kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally it takes about 60 ms
for a bridge to update all its tables and start sending
packets to the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
This daemon can be used for unicast traffic only. I.e., DHCP
is not supported. Use software such as dhcrelay to
&quot;bridge&quot; DHCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should have an IP address
assigned on all of your interfaces that you do bridging on.
There is no need for this address to be from the same
networks as the bridged networks. <br>
Any dummy address will do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system should have correct
default route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parprouted requires
&quot;ip&quot; program from iproute2 tools to be installed
in /sbin. If it is installed in another location, please
replace &quot;/sbin/ip&quot; occurances in the source with
the <br>
correct path. As well you should have proc filesystem
mounted in /proc because the daemon uses /proc/net/arp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parprouted is designed for and
tested only with Linux 2.4.x kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The list of interfaces to do bridging on should be given via
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon accepts the following
switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, which stands for debugging.
If you run it in debugging mode the daemon will not go to
background and will print additional debugging information
to stdout/stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, which makes all ARP entries
to be permanent. This will also result in that ARP tables
will not be refreshed by ARP pings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
To bridge between wlan0 and eth0: parprouted eth0 wlan0</p>
