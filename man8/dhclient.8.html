<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client, <b>dhclient</b>, provides a means
  for configuring one or more network interfaces using the Dynamic Host
  Configuration Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or if these protocols fail, by
  statically assigning an address.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#OPERATION">OPERATION</a></h1>
The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a central server which maintains a
  list of IP addresses which may be assigned on one or more subnets. A DHCP
  client may request an address from this pool, and then use it on a temporary
  basis for communication on network. The DHCP protocol also provides a
  mechanism whereby a client can learn important details about the network to
  which it is attached, such as the location of a default router, the location
  of a name server, and so on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two versions of the DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. At startup the
  client may be started for one or the other via the <b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b>
  options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On startup, <b>dhclient</b> reads the dhclient.conf for configuration
  instructions. It then gets a list of all the network interfaces that are
  configured in the current system. For each interface, it attempts to configure
  the interface using the DHCP protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and server restarts,
  <b>dhclient</b> keeps a list of leases it has been assigned in the
  dhclient.leases file. On startup, after reading the dhclient.conf file,
  <b>dhclient</b> reads the dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about
  what leases it has been assigned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a new lease is acquired, it is appended to the end of the dhclient.leases
  file. In order to prevent the file from becoming arbitrarily large, from time
  to time <b>dhclient</b> creates a new dhclient.leases file from its in-core
  lease database. The old version of the dhclient.leases file is retained under
  the name <i>dhclient.leases~</i> until the next time <b>dhclient</b> rewrites
  the database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Old leases are kept around in case the DHCP server is unavailable when
  <b>dhclient</b> is first invoked (generally during the initial system boot
  process). In that event, old leases from the dhclient.leases file which have
  not yet expired are tested, and if they are determined to be valid, they are
  used until either they expire or the DHCP server becomes available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A mobile host which may sometimes need to access a network on which no DHCP
  server exists may be preloaded with a lease for a fixed address on that
  network. When all attempts to contact a DHCP server have failed,
  <b>dhclient</b> will try to validate the static lease, and if it succeeds,
  will use that lease until it is restarted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A mobile host may also travel to some networks on which DHCP is not available
  but BOOTP is. In that case, it may be advantageous to arrange with the network
  administrator for an entry on the BOOTP database, so that the host can boot
  quickly on that network rather than cycling through the list of old leases.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINE"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINE">COMMAND
  LINE</a></h1>
The names of the network interfaces that <b>dhclient</b> should attempt to
  configure may be specified on the command line. If no interface names are
  specified on the command line <b>dhclient</b> will normally identify all
  network interfaces, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and
  attempt to configure each interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is also possible to specify interfaces by name in the dhclient.conf file. If
  interfaces are specified in this way, then the client will only configure
  interfaces that are either specified in the configuration file or on the
  command line, and will ignore all other interfaces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The client normally prints no output during its startup sequence. It can be made
  to emit verbose messages displaying the startup sequence events until it has
  acquired an address by supplying the <b>-v</b> command line argument. In
  either case, the client logs messages using the <b>syslog(3)</b> facility.

  <dd class="It-tag">Force <b>dhclient</b> to run as a foreground process.
      Normally the DHCP client will run in the foreground until is has

      network interfaces to configure. On laptop computers and other computers
      with hot-swappable I/O buses, it is possible that a broadcast interface
      may be added after system startup. This flag can be used to cause the
      client not to exit when it doesn't find any such interfaces. The
      <b>omshell(1)</b> program can then be used to notify the client when a
      network interface has been added or removed, so that the client can
      attempt to configure an IP address on that interface.

    Normally, if <b>dhclient</b> was compiled with libcap-ng support,
      <b>dhclient</b> drops most capabilities immediately upon startup. While
      more secure, this greatly restricts the additional actions that hooks in
      <b>dhclient-script (8)</b> can take. (For example, any daemons that
      <b>dhclient-script (8)</b> starts or restarts will inherit the restricted
      capabilities as well, which may interfere with their correct operation.)
      Thus, the <b>-nc</b> option can be used to prevent <b>dhclient</b> from
      dropping capabilities.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The syntax of the <b>dhclient.conf(5)</b> file is discussed separately.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OMAPI"><a class="selflink" href="#OMAPI">OMAPI</a></h1>
The DHCP client provides some ability to control it while it is running, without
  stopping it. This capability is provided using OMAPI, an API for manipulating
  remote objects. OMAPI clients connect to the client using TCP/IP,
  authenticate, and can then examine the client's current status and make
  changes to it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Rather than implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user programs
  should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself. Dhcpctl is a wrapper that handles
  some of the housekeeping chores that OMAPI does not do automatically. Dhcpctl
  and OMAPI are documented in <b>dhcpctl(3)</b> and <b>omapi(3)</b>. Most things
  you'd want to do with the client can be done directly using the
  <b>omshell(1)</b> command, rather than having to write a special program.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_CONTROL_OBJECT"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_CONTROL_OBJECT">THE
  CONTROL OBJECT</a></h1>
The control object allows you to shut the client down, releasing all leases that
  it holds and deleting any DNS records it may have added. It also allows you to
  pause the client - this unconfigures any interfaces the client is using. You
  can then restart it, which causes it to reconfigure those interfaces. You
  would normally pause the client prior to going into hibernation or sleep on a
  laptop computer. You would then resume it after the power comes back. This
  allows PC cards to be shut down while the computer is hibernating or sleeping,
  and then reinitialized to their previous state once the computer comes out of
  hibernation or sleep.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The control object has one attribute - the state attribute. To shut the client
  down, set its state attribute to 2. It will automatically do a DHCPRELEASE. To
  pause it, set its state attribute to 3. To resume it, set its state attribute
  to 4.

<div class="Pp"></div>
This client was substantially modified and enhanced by Elliot Poger for use on
  Linux while he was working on the MosquitoNet project at Stanford.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The current version owes much to Elliot's Linux enhancements, but was
  substantially reorganized and partially rewritten by Ted Lemon so as to use
  the same networking framework that the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP server
  uses. Much system-specific configuration code was moved into a shell script so
  that as support for more operating systems is added, it will not be necessary
  to port and maintain system-specific configuration code to these operating
  systems - instead, the shell script can invoke the native tools to accomplish
  the same purpose.</div>
