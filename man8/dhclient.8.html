<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client, dhclient,
provides a means for configuring one or more network
interfaces using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,
BOOTP proto&acirc; <br>
col, or if these protocols fail, by statically assigning an
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a central server
which maintains a list of IP addresses which may be assigned
on one or more subnets. A DHCP client may request an <br>
address from this pool, and then use it on a temporary basis
for communication on network. The DHCP protocol also
provides a mechanism whereby a client can learn important
<br>
details about the network to which it is attached, such as
the location of a default router, the location of a name
server, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two versions of the
DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. At startup the client may
be started for one or the other via the -4 or -6
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup, dhclient reads the
dhclient.conf for configuration instructions. It then gets a
list of all the network interfaces that are configured in
the current system. For <br>
each interface, it attempts to configure the interface using
the DHCP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to keep track of leases
across system reboots and server restarts, dhclient keeps a
list of leases it has been assigned in the dhclient.leases
file. On startup, after <br>
reading the dhclient.conf file, dhclient reads the
dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
it has been assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a new lease is acquired, it
is appended to the end of the dhclient.leases file. In order
to prevent the file from becoming arbitrarily large, from
time to time dhclient <br>
creates a new dhclient.leases file from its in-core lease
database. The old version of the dhclient.leases file is
retained under the name dhclient.leases~ until the next time
<br>
dhclient rewrites the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old leases are kept around in
case the DHCP server is unavailable when dhclient is first
invoked (generally during the initial system boot process).
In that event, old leases <br>
from the dhclient.leases file which have not yet expired are
tested, and if they are determined to be valid, they are
used until either they expire or the DHCP server becomes
<br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A mobile host which may
sometimes need to access a network on which no DHCP server
exists may be preloaded with a lease for a fixed address on
that network. When all attempts to <br>
contact a DHCP server have failed, dhclient will try to
validate the static lease, and if it succeeds, will use that
lease until it is restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A mobile host may also travel to
some networks on which DHCP is not available but BOOTP is.
In that case, it may be advantageous to arrange with the
network administrator for an <br>
entry on the BOOTP database, so that the host can boot
quickly on that network rather than cycling through the list
of old leases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE <br>
The names of the network interfaces that dhclient should
attempt to configure may be specified on the command line.
If no interface names are specified on the command line <br>
dhclient will normally identify all network interfaces,
eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and
attempt to configure each interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to specify
interfaces by name in the dhclient.conf file. If interfaces
are specified in this way, then the client will only
configure interfaces that are <br>
either specified in the configuration file or on the command
line, and will ignore all other interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The client normally prints no
output during its startup sequence. It can be made to emit
verbose messages displaying the startup sequence events
until it has acquired an address <br>
by supplying the -v command line argument. In either case,
the client logs messages using the syslog(3) facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-4 Use the DHCPv4 protocol to obtain an IPv4 address and
configuration parameters. This is the default and cannot be
combined with -6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Use the DHCPv6 protocol to
obtain whatever IPv6 addresses are available along with
configuration parameters. It cannot be combined with -4. The
-S -T -P -N and -D argu&acirc; <br>
ments provide more control over aspects of the DHCPv6
processing. Note: it is not recommended to mix queries of
different types together or even to share the lease file
<br>
between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Try to get a lease once. On
failure exit with code 2. In DHCPv6 this sets the maximum
duration of the initial exchange to timeout (from
dhclient.conf with a default of <br>
sixty seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Force dhclient to run as a
foreground process. Normally the DHCP client will run in the
foreground until is has configured an interface at which
time it will revert to <br>
running in the background. This option is useful when
running the client under a debugger, or when running it out
of inittab on System V systems. This implies -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nw Become a daemon immediately
(nowait) rather than waiting until an an IP address has been
acquired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet at startup, this is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enable verbose log
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Continue running even if no
broadcast interfaces were found. Normally DHCP client will
exit if it isn&rsquo;t able to identify any network
interfaces to configure. On laptop <br>
computers and other computers with hot-swappable I/O buses,
it is possible that a broadcast interface may be added after
system startup. This flag can be used to cause <br>
the client not to exit when it doesn&rsquo;t find any such
interfaces. The omshell(1) program can then be used to
notify the client when a network interface has been added or
<br>
removed, so that the client can attempt to configure an IP
address on that interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nc Do not drop
capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, if dhclient was
compiled with libcap-ng support, dhclient drops most
capabilities immediately upon startup. While more secure,
this greatly restricts the addi&acirc; <br>
tional actions that hooks in dhclient-script (8) can take.
(For example, any daemons that dhclient-script (8) starts or
restarts will inherit the restricted capabilities <br>
as well, which may interfere with their correct operation.)
Thus, the -nc option can be used to prevent dhclient from
dropping capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -nc option is ignored if
dhclient was not compiled with libcap-ng support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Set the BOOTP broadcast flag
in request packets so servers will always broadcast
replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I
&lt;dhcp-client-identifier&gt; <br>
Specify the dhcp-client-identifier option to send to the
DHCP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H &lt;host-name&gt; <br>
Specify the host-name option to send to the DHCP server. The
host-name string only contains the client&rsquo;s hostname
prefix, to which the server will append the
ddns-domain&acirc; <br>
name or domain-name options, if any, to derive the fully
qualified domain name of the client. The -H option cannot be
used with the -F option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt; <br>
Specify the fqdn.fqdn option to send to the DHCP server.
This option cannot be used with the -H option. The fqdn.fqdn
option must specify the complete domain name of the <br>
client host, which the server may use for dynamic DNS
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V
&lt;vendor-class-identifier&gt; <br>
Specify the vendor-class-identifier option to send to the
DHCP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R
&lt;option&gt;[,&lt;option&gt;...] <br>
Specify the list of options the client is to request from
the server. The option list must be a single string
consisting of option names separated by at least one command
<br>
and optional space characters. The default option list
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subnet-mask, broadcast-address,
time-offset, routers, <br>
domain-search, domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name,
<br>
nis-domain, nis-servers, ntp-servers, interface-mtu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R option does not append
options to the default request, it overrides the default
request list. Keep this in mind if you want to request an
additional option besides the <br>
default request list. You will have to specify all option
names for the -R parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timeout &lt;timeout&gt; <br>
Specify the time after which dhclient will decide that no
DHCP servers can be contacted when no responses have been
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not configure any
interfaces. This is most likely to be useful in combination
with the -w flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e VAR=value <br>
Define additional environment variables for the environment
where dhclient-script executes. You may specify multiple -e
options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Release the current lease and
stop the running DHCP client as previously recorded in the
PID file. When shutdown via this method dhclient-script will
be executed with the <br>
specific reason for calling the script set. The client
normally doesn&rsquo;t release the current lease as this is
not required by the DHCP protocol but some cable ISPs
require <br>
their clients to notify the server if they wish to release
an assigned IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Stop the running DHCP client
without releasing the current lease. Kills existing dhclient
process as previously recorded in the PID file. When
shutdown via this method <br>
dhclient-script will be executed with the specific reason
for calling the script set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port-number <br>
The UDP port number on which the DHCP client should listen
and transmit. If unspecified, dhclient uses the default port
of 68. This is mostly useful for debugging pur&acirc; <br>
poses. If a different port is specified on which the client
should listen and transmit, the client will also use a
different destination port - one less than the speci&acirc;
<br>
fied port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s server-addr <br>
Specify the server IP address or fully qualified domain name
to use as a destination for DHCP protocol messages before
dhclient has acquired an IP address. Normally, <br>
dhclient transmits these messages to 255.255.255.255 (the IP
limited broadcast address). Overriding this is mostly useful
for debugging purposes. This feature is not <br>
supported in DHCPv6 (-6) mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g relay <br>
Set the giaddr field of all packets to the relay IP address
simulating a relay agent. This is for testing pruposes only
and should not be expected to work in any consis&acirc; <br>
tent or useful way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options available for DHCPv6
mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Use Information-request to
get only stateless configuration parameters (i.e., without
address). This implies -6. It also doesn&rsquo;t rewrite the
lease database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Ask for IPv6 temporary
addresses, one set per -T flag. This implies -6 and also
disables the normal address query. See -N to restore it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Enable IPv6 prefix
delegation. This implies -6 and also disables the normal
address query. See -N to restore it. Note only one requested
interface is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D LL or LLT <br>
Override the default when selecting the type of DUID to use.
By default, DHCPv6 dhclient creates an identifier based on
the link-layer address (DUID-LL) if it is running <br>
in stateless mode (with -S, not requesting an address), or
it creates an identifier based on the link-layer address
plus a timestamp (DUID-LLT) if it is running in state&acirc;
<br>
ful mode (without -S, requesting an address). -D overrides
this default, with a value of either LL or LLT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Restore normal address query
for IPv6. This implies -6. It is used to restore normal
operation after using -T or -P.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifying default file
locations: The following options can be used to modify the
locations a client uses for it&rsquo;s files. They can be
particularly useful if, for example, <br>
/var/lib/dhclient or /var/run have not been mounted when the
DHCP client is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cf config-file <br>
Path to the client configuration file. If unspecified, the
default /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf is used. See
dhclient.conf(5) for a description of this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lf lease-file <br>
Path to the lease database file. If unspecified, the default
/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases is used. See
dhclient.leases(5) for a description of this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pf pid-file <br>
Path to the process ID file. If unspecified, the default
/var/run/dhclient.pid is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pid <br>
Option to disable writing pid files. By default the program
will write a pid file. If the program is invoked with this
option it will not attempt to kill any existing <br>
client processes even if invoked with -r or -x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sf script-file <br>
Path to the network configuration script invoked by dhclient
when it gets a lease. If unspecified, the default
/usr/sbin/dhclient-script is used. See dhclient-script(8)
<br>
for a description of this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The syntax of the dhclient.conf(5) file is discussed
separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OMAPI <br>
The DHCP client provides some ability to control it while it
is running, without stopping it. This capability is provided
using OMAPI, an API for manipulating remote objects. <br>
OMAPI clients connect to the client using TCP/IP,
authenticate, and can then examine the client&rsquo;s
current status and make changes to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rather than implementing the
underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user programs should use
the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself. Dhcpctl is a wrapper that
handles some of the house&acirc; <br>
keeping chores that OMAPI does not do automatically. Dhcpctl
and OMAPI are documented in dhcpctl(3) and omapi(3). Most
things you&rsquo;d want to do with the client can be done
<br>
directly using the omshell(1) command, rather than having to
write a special program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONTROL OBJECT <br>
The control object allows you to shut the client down,
releasing all leases that it holds and deleting any DNS
records it may have added. It also allows you to pause the
client <br>
- this unconfigures any interfaces the client is using. You
can then restart it, which causes it to reconfigure those
interfaces. You would normally pause the client prior to
<br>
going into hibernation or sleep on a laptop computer. You
would then resume it after the power comes back. This allows
PC cards to be shut down while the computer is
hibernat&acirc; <br>
ing or sleeping, and then reinitialized to their previous
state once the computer comes out of hibernation or
sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control object has one
attribute - the state attribute. To shut the client down,
set its state attribute to 2. It will automatically do a
DHCPRELEASE. To pause it, set its <br>
state attribute to 3. To resume it, set its state attribute
to 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables may be defined to
override the builtin defaults for file locations. Note that
use of the related command-line options will ignore the
corre&acirc; <br>
sponding environment variable settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH_DHCLIENT_CONF <br>
The dhclient.conf configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH_DHCLIENT_DB <br>
The dhclient.leases database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH_DHCLIENT_PID <br>
The dhclient PID file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH_DHCLIENT_SCRIPT <br>
The dhclient-script file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/sbin/dhclient-script, /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf,
/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases, /var/run/dhclient.pid,
/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases~.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
dhclient(8) has been written for Internet Systems Consortium
by Ted Lemon in cooperation with Vixie Enterprises. To learn
more about Internet Systems Consortium, see <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This client was substantially
modified and enhanced by Elliot Poger for use on Linux while
he was working on the MosquitoNet project at Stanford.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current version owes much to
Elliot&rsquo;s Linux enhancements, but was substantially
reorganized and partially rewritten by Ted Lemon so as to
use the same networking framework <br>
that the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP server uses. Much
system-specific configuration code was moved into a shell
script so that as support for more operating systems is <br>
added, it will not be necessary to port and maintain
system-specific configuration code to these operating
systems - instead, the shell script can invoke the native
tools to <br>
accomplish the same purpose.</p>
