<p>DUENDE(8) duende DUENDE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
duende - run a child process as a daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
duende makes a given child process a daemon. The standard
output and standard error of the child process is logged via
syslog() with a priority of LOG_ALERT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
duende [options] child_process [ arguments passed onto child
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILS <br>
When duende is invoked, it spawns two processes. In addition
to spawning the daemonized child process, duende also spawns
a process which reads and logs the standard output of <br>
the daemonized process. The parent process stays alive so as
to monitor the daemonized process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duende requires a blank
directory named /etc/maradns/logger to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should the parent duende process
a HUP signal, duende will restart the child process. Should
the daemonized or logging process received an untrapped HUP
signal or exit with an <br>
exit code of 8, duende will restart the process. Should the
daemonized or logging process exit for any other reason,
duende will send the logger process a TERM signal and exit.
<br>
Should the duende parent process receive a TERM or INT
signal, duende sends all of its children TERM signals, then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The duende process must be
started as the superuser; this is because Duende&rsquo;s
intended child processes (maradns and zoneserver) need to
bind to privileged ports, and because <br>
duende uses a setuid() call to change the user ID of the
logging process to the user with ID 66.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Most of the above behaviour can be configured by command
line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c|--chroot directory <br>
The log helper process will change its directory and root to
this location. This defaults to /etc/maradns/logger .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i|--ident string <br>
The log helper process will use this string to identify the
process when sending messages to syslog. This defaults to
log-help .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p|--pid filename <br>
If this argument is present, the duende parent process will
store its pid in this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u|--uid integer <br>
The log helper process will drop its user id to this. This
value defaults to 66.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g|--gid integer <br>
The log helper process will drop its group id to this. This
value defaults to 66.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r|--restart_on integer <br>
The log helper process will restart the child process if it
exists with this status code. This defaults to 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
duende uses the syslog() facility to log the standard output
of the program that it invokes. The name of the program (in
other words, the &quot;ident&quot; given to openlog())
defaults to <br>
log-helper but can be overridden with the --ident argument.
All messages created by the child process are sent to
syslog() with a priority of LOG_ALERT and a
&quot;facility&quot; of <br>
LOG_DAEMON (daemon.info in /etc/syslog.conf). Should duende
itself encounter an error, it will send messages to syslog()
with a priority of LOG_ALERT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the directory
/etc/maradns/logger, while used by duende, is not used to
store any log messages. That is unless, for some reason, one
configures syslog to store messages <br>
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Using duende to start maradns, where the mararc file is
/etc/mararc.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duende maradns -f
/etc/mararc.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using duende to start
zoneserver, where the mararc file is /etc/mararc.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duende zoneserver -f
/etc/mararc.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Duende assumes that all of its children are well-behaved,
eating their vegetables, going to bed when told, and
terminating when receiving a TERM signal.</p>
