<p>SFDISK(8) System Administration SFDISK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sfdisk - partition table manipulator for Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sfdisk [options] device <br>
sfdisk -s [partition]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sfdisk has four (main) uses: list the size of a partition,
list the partitions on a device, check the partitions on a
device, and - very dangerous - repartition a device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sfdisk doesn&rsquo;t understand
the GUID Partition Table (GPT) format and it is not designed
for large partitions. In these cases use the more advanced
GNU parted(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that sfdisk does not align
partitions to block device I/O limits. This functionality is
provided by fdisk(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List sizes <br>
sfdisk -s partition gives the size of partition in blocks.
This may be useful in connection with programs like
mkswap(8). Here partition is usually something like
/dev/hda1 or <br>
/dev/sdb12, but may also be an entire disk, like
/dev/xda.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk -s /dev/hda9 <br>
81599</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the partition argument is
omitted, sfdisk will list the sizes of all block devices,
and the total:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk -s <br>
/dev/hda: 208896 <br>
/dev/hdb: 1025136 <br>
/dev/hdc: 1031063 <br>
/dev/sda: 8877895 <br>
/dev/sdb: 1758927 <br>
total: 12901917 blocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List partitions <br>
The second type of invocation: sfdisk -l device will list
the partitions on the specified device. If the device
argument is omitted, the partitions on all block devices are
<br>
listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk -l /dev/hdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disk /dev/hdc: 16 heads, 63
sectors, 2045 cylinders <br>
Units = cylinders of 516096 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes,
counting from 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device Boot Start End #cyls
#blocks Id System <br>
/dev/hdc1 0+ 406 407- 205096+ 83 Linux native <br>
/dev/hdc2 407 813 407 205128 83 Linux native <br>
/dev/hdc3 814 2044 1231 620424 83 Linux native <br>
/dev/hdc4 0 - 0 0 0 Empty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trailing - and + signs
indicate that rounding has taken place, and that the actual
value is slightly less or more. To see the exact values, ask
for a listing with sectors as <br>
unit (-u S).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check partitions <br>
The third type of invocation: sfdisk -V device will apply
various consistency checks to the partition tables on
device. It prints &lsquo;OK&rsquo; or complains. The -V
option can be used <br>
together with -l. In a shell script one might use sfdisk -V
-q device which only returns a status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create partitions <br>
The fourth type of invocation: sfdisk device will cause
sfdisk to read the specification for the desired
partitioning of device from standard input, and then to
change the parti&acirc; <br>
tion tables on that block device. Thus it is possible to use
sfdisk from a shell script. When sfdisk determines that its
standard input is a terminal, it will be conversa&acirc;
<br>
tional; otherwise it will abort on any error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL - ONE
TYPING MISTAKE AND ALL YOUR DATA IS LOST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a precaution, one can save
the sectors changed by sfdisk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk /dev/hdd -O
hdd-partition-sectors.save <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, if you discover that you
did something stupid before anything else has been written
to the block device, it may be possible to recover the old
situation with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk /dev/hdd -I
hdd-partition-sectors.save</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This is not the same as saving
the old partition table: a readable version of the old
partition table can be saved using the -d option. However,
if you create logical parti&acirc; <br>
tions, the sectors describing them are located somewhere on
block device, possibly on sectors that were not part of the
partition table before. Thus, the information the -O <br>
option saves is not a binary version of the output of
-d.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v, --version <br>
Print version number of sfdisk and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a usage message and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --list-types <br>
Print the recognized types (system Id&rsquo;s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --show-size <br>
List the size of a partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --show-geometry <br>
List the kernel&rsquo;s idea of the geometry of the
indicated block device(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --show-pt-geometry <br>
List the geometry of the indicated block devices guessed by
looking at the partition table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List the partitions of a device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dump <br>
Dump the partitions of a device in a format that is usable
as input to sfdisk. For example, <br>
% sfdisk -d /dev/hda &gt; hda.out <br>
% sfdisk /dev/hda &lt; hda.out <br>
will correct the bad last extended partition that the OS/2
fdisk creates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verify <br>
Test whether partitions seem correct. (See the third
invocation type above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --increment <br>
Number cylinders etc. starting from 1 instead of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N number <br>
Change only the single partition indicated. For example:
<br>
% sfdisk /dev/hdb -N5 <br>
,,,* <br>
will make the fifth partition on /dev/hdb bootable
(&lsquo;active&rsquo;) and change nothing else. (Probably
this fifth partition is called /dev/hdb5, but you are free
to call it <br>
something else, like &lsquo;/my_equipment/disks/2/5&rsquo;
or so).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --activate number <br>
Make the indicated partition(s) active, and all others
inactive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --id number [Id] <br>
If no Id argument given: print the partition Id of the
indicated partition. If an Id argument is present: change
the type (Id) of the indicated partition to the given <br>
value. This option has two longer forms, --print-id and
--change-id. For example: <br>
% sfdisk --print-id /dev/hdb 5 <br>
6 <br>
% sfdisk --change-id /dev/hdb 5 83 <br>
OK <br>
first reports that /dev/hdb5 has Id 6, and then changes that
into 83.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unit letter <br>
Interpret the input and show the output in the units
specified by letter. This letter can be one of S, C, B or M,
meaning Sectors, Cylinders, Blocks and Megabytes, <br>
respectively. The default is cylinders, at least when the
geometry is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --show-extended <br>
Also list non-primary extended partitions on output, and
expect descriptors for them on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --cylinders cylinders <br>
Specify the number of cylinders, possibly overriding what
the kernel thinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --heads heads <br>
Specify the number of heads, possibly overriding what the
kernel thinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --sectors sectors <br>
Specify the number of sectors, possibly overriding what the
kernel thinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Do what I say, even if it is stupid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --Linux <br>
Do not complain about things irrelevant for Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --DOS <br>
For DOS-compatibility: waste a little space. (More
precisely: if a partition cannot contain sector 0, e.g.
because that is the MBR of the device, or contains the
parti&acirc; <br>
tion table of an extended partition, then sfdisk would make
it start the next sector. However, when this option is given
it skips to the start of the next track, wasting <br>
for example 33 sectors (in case of 34 sectors/track), just
like certain versions of DOS do.) Certain Disk Managers and
boot loaders (such as OSBS, but not LILO or the <br>
OS/2 Boot Manager) also live in this empty space, so maybe
you want this option if you use one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --DOS-extended <br>
Take the starting sector numbers of &quot;inner&quot;
extended partitions to be relative to the starting cylinder
boundary of the outer one (like some versions of DOS do),
rather <br>
than relative to the actual starting sector (like Linux
does). (The fact that there is a difference here means that
one should always let extended partitions start at <br>
cylinder boundaries if DOS and Linux should interpret the
partition table in the same way. Of course one can only know
where cylinder boundaries are when one knows what <br>
geometry DOS will use for this block device.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--IBM, --leave-last <br>
Certain IBM diagnostic programs assume that they can use the
last cylinder on a device for disk-testing purposes. If you
think you might ever run such programs, use this <br>
option to tell sfdisk that it should not allocate the last
cylinder. Sometimes the last cylinder contains a bad sector
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Go through all the motions,
but do not actually write to block device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --re-read <br>
Only execute the BLKRRPART ioctl (to make the kernel re-read
the partition table). This can be useful for checking in
advance that the final BLKRRPART will be successful, <br>
and also when you changed the partition table &lsquo;by
hand&rsquo; (e.g., using dd from a backup). If the kernel
complains (&lsquo;device busy for revalidation (usage =
2)&rsquo;) then some&acirc; <br>
thing still uses the device, and you still have to unmount
some file system, or say swapoff to some swap partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-reread <br>
When starting a repartitioning of a block device, sfdisk
checks that this device is not mounted, or in use as a swap
device, and refuses to continue if it is. This option <br>
suppresses the test. (On the other hand, the -f option would
force sfdisk to continue even when this test fails.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--in-order <br>
Caution, see warning section. To be documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--not-in-order <br>
Caution, see warning section. To be documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inside-outer <br>
Caution, see warning section. Chaining order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--not-inside-outer <br>
Caution, see warning section. Chaining order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nested <br>
Caution, see warning section. Every partition is contained
in the surrounding partitions and is disjoint from all
others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chained <br>
Caution, see warning section. Every data partition is
contained in the surrounding partitions and disjoint from
all others, but extended partitions may lie outside
(inso&acirc; <br>
far as allowed by
all_logicals_inside_outermost_extended).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--onesector <br>
Caution, see warning section. All data partitions are
mutually disjoint; extended partitions each use one sector
only (except perhaps for the outermost one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O file <br>
Just before writing the new partition, output the sectors
that are going to be overwritten to file (where hopefully
file resides on another block device, or on a floppy).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file <br>
After destroying your filesystems with an unfortunate sfdisk
command, you would have been able to restore the old
situation if only you had preserved it using the -O
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEORY <br>
Block 0 of a block device (the Master Boot Record) contains
among other things four partition descriptors. The
partitions described here are called primary partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A partition descriptor has 6
fields: <br>
struct partition { <br>
unsigned char bootable; /* 0 or 0x80 */ <br>
hsc begin_hsc; <br>
unsigned char id; <br>
hsc end_hsc; <br>
unsigned int starting_sector; <br>
unsigned int nr_of_sectors; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two hsc fields indicate
head, sector and cylinder of the begin and the end of the
partition. Since each hsc field only takes 3 bytes, only 24
bits are available, which does <br>
not suffice for big block devices (say &gt; 8GB). In fact,
due to the wasteful representation (that uses a byte for the
number of heads, which is typically 16), problems already
<br>
start with 0.5GB. However Linux does not use these fields,
and problems can arise only at boot time, before Linux has
been started. For more details, see the lilo
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each partition has a type, its
&lsquo;Id&rsquo;, and if this type is 5 or f
(&lsquo;extended partition&rsquo;) the starting sector of
the partition again contains 4 partition descriptors. MSDOS
only <br>
uses the first two of these: the first one an actual data
partition, and the second one again an extended partition
(or empty). In this way one gets a chain of extended
parti&acirc; <br>
tions. Other operating systems have slightly different
conventions. Linux also accepts type 85 as equivalent to 5
and f - this can be useful if one wants to have extended
par&acirc; <br>
titions under Linux past the 1024 cylinder boundary, without
DOS FDISK hanging. (If there is no good reason, you should
just use 5, which is understood by other systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Partitions that are not primary
or extended are called logical. Often, one cannot boot from
logical partitions (because the process of finding them is
more involved than just <br>
looking at the MBR). Note that of an extended partition only
the Id and the start are used. There are various conventions
about what to write in the other fields. One should not <br>
try to use extended partitions for data storage or swap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FORMAT <br>
sfdisk reads lines of the form <br>
&lt;start&gt; &lt;size&gt; &lt;id&gt; &lt;bootable&gt;
&lt;c,h,s&gt; &lt;c,h,s&gt; <br>
where each line fills one partition descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fields are separated by
whitespace, or comma or semicolon possibly followed by
whitespace; initial and trailing whitespace is ignored.
Numbers can be octal, decimal or hexadeci&acirc; <br>
mal, decimal is default. When a field is absent or empty, a
default value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;c,h,s&gt; parts can (and
probably should) be omitted - sfdisk computes them from
&lt;start&gt; and &lt;size&gt; and the block device geometry
as given by the kernel or specified using the <br>
-H, -S, -C flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bootable is specified as [*|-],
with as default not-bootable. (The value of this field is
irrelevant for Linux - when Linux runs it has been booted
already - but might play a <br>
role for certain boot loaders and for other operating
systems. For example, when there are several primary DOS
partitions, DOS assigns C: to the first among these that is
<br>
bootable.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Id is given in hex, without the
0x prefix, or is [E|S|L|X], where L (LINUX_NATIVE (83)) is
the default, S is LINUX_SWAP (82), E is EXTENDED_PARTITION
(5), and X is LINUX_EXTENDED <br>
(85).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of start is
the first nonassigned sector/cylinder/...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of size is as
much as possible (until next partition or
end-of-device).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, for the four partitions
inside an extended partition, the defaults are: Linux
partition, Extended partition, Empty, Empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But when the -N option (change a
single partition only) is given, the default for each field
is its previous value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &rsquo;+&rsquo; can be
specified instead of a number for size, which means as much
as possible. This is useful with the -N option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The command <br>
sfdisk /dev/hdc &lt;&lt; EOF <br>
0,407 <br>
,407 <br>
; <br>
; <br>
EOF <br>
will partition /dev/hdc just as indicated above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command <br>
sfdisk /dev/hdb &lt;&lt; EOF <br>
,3,L <br>
,60,L <br>
,19,S <br>
,,E <br>
,130,L <br>
,130,L <br>
,130,L <br>
,,L <br>
EOF <br>
will partition /dev/hdb into two Linux partitions of 3 and
60 cylinders, a swap space of 19 cylinders, and an extended
partition covering the rest. Inside the extended partition
<br>
there are four Linux logical partitions, three of 130
cylinders and one covering the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -x option, the number
of input lines must be a multiple of 4: you have to list the
two empty partitions that you never want using two blank
lines. Without the -x option, <br>
you give one line for the partitions inside a extended
partition, instead of four, and terminate with end-of-file
(^D). (And sfdisk will assume that your input line
represents <br>
the first of four, that the second one is extended, and the
3rd and 4th are empty.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION WARNINGS <br>
The options marked with caution in the manual page are
dangerous. For example not all functionality is completely
implemented, which can be a reason for unexpected
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS 6.x WARNING <br>
The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the
first sector of the data area of the partition, and treats
this information as more reliable than the information in
<br>
the partition table. DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear
the first 512 bytes of the data area of a partition whenever
a size change occurs. DOS FORMAT will look at this extra
<br>
information even if the /U flag is given -- we consider this
a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bottom line is that if you
use sfdisk to change the size of a DOS partition table
entry, then you must also use dd to zero the first 512 bytes
of that partition before using <br>
DOS FORMAT to format the partition. For example, if you were
using sfdisk to make a DOS partition table entry for
/dev/hda1, then (after exiting sfdisk and rebooting Linux so
<br>
that the partition table information is valid) you would use
the command &quot;dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1 bs=512
count=1&quot; to zero the first 512 bytes of the partition.
BE EXTREMELY <br>
CAREFUL if you use the dd command, since a small typo can
make all of the data on your block device useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, you should
always use an OS-specific partition table program. For
example, you should make DOS partitions with the DOS FDISK
program and Linux partitions with <br>
the Linux sfdisk program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRDOS WARNINGS <br>
Stephen Tweedie reported (930515): &lsquo;Most reports of
superblock corruption turn out to be due to bad
partitioning, with one filesystem overrunning the start of
the next and cor&acirc; <br>
rupting its superblock. I have even had this problem with
the supposedly-reliable DRDOS. This was quite possibly due
to DRDOS-6.0&rsquo;s FDISK command. Unless I created a blank
<br>
track or cylinder between the DRDOS partition and the
immediately following one, DRDOS would happily stamp all
over the start of the next partition. Mind you, as long as I
keep <br>
a little free device space after any DRDOS partition, I
don&rsquo;t have any other problems with the two coexisting
on the one drive.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A. V. Le Blanc writes in
README.efdisk: &lsquo;Dr. DOS 5.0 and 6.0 has been reported
to have problems cooperating with Linux, and with this
version of efdisk in particular. This <br>
efdisk sets the system type to hexadecimal 81. Dr. DOS seems
to confuse this with hexadecimal 1, a DOS code. If you use
Dr. DOS, use the efdisk command &rsquo;t&rsquo; to change
the system <br>
code of any Linux partitions to some number less than
hexadecimal 80; I suggest 41 and 42 for the
moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A. V. Le Blanc writes in his
README.fdisk: &lsquo;DR-DOS 5.0 and 6.0 are reported to have
difficulties with partition ID codes of 80 or more. The
Linux &lsquo;fdisk&rsquo; used to set the system <br>
type of new partitions to hexadecimal 81. DR-DOS seems to
confuse this with hexadecimal 1, a DOS code. The values 82
for swap and 83 for file systems should not cause problems
<br>
with DR-DOS. If they do, you may use the &lsquo;fdisk&rsquo;
command &lsquo;t&rsquo; to change the system code of any
Linux partitions to some number less than hexadecimal 80; I
suggest 42 and 43 for <br>
the moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, it seems that only 4
bits are significant for the DRDOS FDISK, so that for
example 11 and 21 are listed as DOS 2.0. However, DRDOS
itself seems to use the full byte. I <br>
have not been able to reproduce any corruption with DRDOS or
its fdisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are too many options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no support for non-DOS
partition types.</p>
