<p>MDMON(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual MDMON(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mdmon - monitor MD external metadata arrays</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mdmon [--all] [--takeover] [--foreground] CONTAINER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
The 2.6.27 kernel brings the ability to support external
metadata arrays. External metadata implies that user space
handles all updates to the metadata. The kernel&rsquo;s
responsi&acirc; <br>
bility is to notify user space when a &quot;metadata
event&quot; occurs, like disk failures and clean-to-dirty
transitions. The kernel, in important cases, waits for user
space to take <br>
action on these notifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Metadata updates: <br>
To service metadata update requests a daemon, mdmon, is
introduced. Mdmon is tasked with polling the sysfs namespace
looking for changes in array_state, sync_action, and per
<br>
disk state attributes. When a change is detected it calls a
per metadata type handler to make modifications to the
metadata. The following actions are taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array_state - inactive <br>
Clear the dirty bit for the volume and let the array be
stopped</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array_state - write pending <br>
Set the dirty bit for the array and then set array_state to
active. Writes are blocked until userspace writes
active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array_state - active-idle <br>
The safe mode timer has expired so set array state to clean
to block writes to the array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array_state - clean <br>
Clear the dirty bit for the volume</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array_state - read-only <br>
This is the initial state that all arrays start at. mdmon
takes one of the three actions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1/ Transition the array to
read-auto keeping the dirty bit clear if the metadata
handler determines that the array does not need resyncing or
other modification</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2/ Transition the array to
active if the metadata handler determines a resync or some
other manipulation is necessary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3/ Leave the array read-only if
the volume is marked to not be monitored; for example, the
metadata version has been set to
&quot;external:-dev/md127&quot; instead of <br>
&quot;external:/dev/md127&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync_action - resync-to-idle
<br>
Notify the metadata handler that a resync may have
completed. If a resync process is idled before it completes
this event allows the metadata handler to checkpoint <br>
resync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync_action - recover-to-idle
<br>
A spare may have completed rebuilding so tell the metadata
handler about the state of each disk. This is the metadata
handler&rsquo;s opportunity to clear any &quot;out-of- <br>
sync&quot; bits and clear the volume&rsquo;s degraded
status. If a recovery process is idled before it completes
this event allows the metadata handler to checkpoint
recov&acirc; <br>
ery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;disk&gt;/state - faulty <br>
A disk failure kicks off a series of events. First, notify
the metadata handler that a disk has failed, and then notify
the kernel that it can unblock writes that <br>
were dependent on this disk. After unblocking the kernel
this disk is set to be removed+ from the member array.
Finally the disk is marked failed in all other <br>
member arrays in the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Note This behavior differs
slightly from native MD arrays where removal is reserved for
a mdadm --remove event. In the external metadata case the
container holds <br>
the final reference on a block device and a mdadm --remove
&lt;container&gt; &lt;victim&gt; call is still required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Containers: <br>
External metadata formats, like DDF, differ from the native
MD metadata formats in that they define a set of disks and a
series of sub-arrays within those disks. MD metadata in <br>
comparison defines a 1:1 relationship between a set of block
devices and a RAID array. For example to create 2 arrays at
different RAID levels on a single set of disks, MD
meta&acirc; <br>
data requires the disks be partitioned and then each array
can be created with a subset of those partitions. The
supported external formats perform this disk carving
internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Container devices simply hold
references to all member disks and allow tools like mdmon to
determine which active arrays belong to which container.
Some array management com&acirc; <br>
mands like disk removal and disk add are now only valid at
the container level. Attempts to perform these actions on
member arrays are blocked with error messages like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;mdadm: Cannot remove disks
from a &Acirc;&acute;member&Acirc;&acute; array, perform
this operation on the parent container&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Containers are identified in
/proc/mdstat with a metadata version string
&quot;external:&lt;metadata name&gt;&quot;. Member devices
are identified by &quot;external:/&lt;container
device&gt;/&lt;member <br>
index&gt;&quot;, or &quot;external:-&lt;container
device&gt;/&lt;member index&gt;&quot; if the array is to
remain readonly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
CONTAINER <br>
The container device to monitor. It can be a full path like
/dev/md/container, or a simple md device name like
md127.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foreground <br>
Normally, mdmon will fork and continue in the background.
Adding this option will skip that step and run mdmon in the
foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--takeover <br>
This instructs mdmon to replace any active mdmon which is
currently monitoring the array. This is primarily used late
in the boot process to replace any mdmon which was <br>
started from an initramfs before the root filesystem was
mounted. This avoids holding a reference on that initramfs
indefinitely and ensures that the pid and sock files <br>
used to communicate with mdmon are in a standard place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all This tells mdmon to find
any active containers and start monitoring each of them if
appropriate. This is normally used with --takeover late in
the boot sequence. A sepa&acirc; <br>
rate mdmon process is started for each container as the
--all argument is over-written with the name of the
container. To allow for containers with names longer than 5
<br>
characters, this argument can be arbitrarily extended, e.g.
to --all-active-arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that <br>
mdmon is automatically started by mdadm when needed and so
does not need to be considered when working with RAID
arrays. The only times it is run other than by mdadm is <br>
when the boot scripts need to restart it after mounting the
new root filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">START UP AND SHUTDOWN <br>
As mdmon needs to be running whenever any filesystem on the
monitored device is mounted there are special considerations
when the root filesystem is mounted from an mdmon
moni&acirc; <br>
tored device. Note that in general mdmon is needed even if
the filesystem is mounted read-only as some filesystems can
still write to the device in those circumstances, for <br>
example to replay a journal after an unclean shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the array is assembled by
the initramfs code, mdadm will automatically start mdmon as
required. This means that mdmon must be installed on the
initramfs and there must be a <br>
writable filesystem (typically tmpfs) in which mdmon can
create a .pid and .sock file. The particular filesystem to
use is given to mdmon at compile time and defaults to <br>
/run/mdadm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This filesystem must persist
through to shutdown time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the final root filesystem
has be instantiated (usually with pivot_root) mdmon should
be run with --all --takeover so that the mdmon running from
the initramfs can be <br>
replaced with one running in the main root, and so the
memory used by the initramfs can be released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At shutdown time, mdmon should
not be killed along with other processes. Also as it holds a
file (socket actually) open in /dev (by default) it will not
be possible to unmount <br>
/dev if it is a separate filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
mdmon --all-active-arrays --takeover <br>
Any mdmon which is currently running is killed and a new
instance is started. This should be run during in the boot
sequence if an initramfs was used, so that any mdmon running
<br>
from the initramfs will not hold the initramfs active.</p>
