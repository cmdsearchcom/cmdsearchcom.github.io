<p>GENERICUPS(8) NUT Manual GENERICUPS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
genericups - Driver for contact-closure UPS equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the specific features of the
genericups driver. For information about the core driver,
see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
This driver supports hardware from many different
manufacturers as it only uses the very simplest of signaling
schemes. Contact closure refers to a kind of interface where
basic <br>
high/low signals are provided to indicate status. This kind
of UPS can only report line power and battery status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you will only
get the essentials in ups.status: OL, OB, and LB. Anything
else requires a smarter UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CABLING <br>
Cabling is different for every kind of UPS. See the table
below for information on what is known to work with a given
UPS type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following settings in the
ups.conf(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstype=type <br>
Required. Configures the driver for a specific kind of UPS.
See the UPS Types section below for more information on
which entries are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mfr=string <br>
Optional. The very nature of a generic UPS driver sometimes
means that the stock manufacturer data has no relation to
the actual hardware that is attached. With the mfr <br>
setting, you can change the value that is seen by clients
that monitor this UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">model=string <br>
Optional. This is like mfr above, but it overrides the model
string instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serial=string <br>
Optional. This is like mfr above and intended to record the
identification string of the UPS. It is titled
&quot;serial&quot; because usually this string is referred
to as the serial <br>
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sdtime=value <br>
Optional. The driver will sleep for this many seconds after
setting the shutdown signal. This is necessary for some
hardware which requires a sustained level to activate the
<br>
shutdown sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior of the
driver is to exit immediately. If this doesn&acirc;t
reliably trigger a shutdown in your UPS hardware, use this
setting to give it more time to react.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
very large values for sdtime may create warnings from
upsdrvctl if it gets tired of waiting for the driver to
return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS <br>
You may override the values for CP, OL, LB, and SD by
defining them in the ups.conf(5) after the upstype
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to set the cable
power to DTR and the low battery value to DCD, it would look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CP = DTR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LB = DCD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recognized values for input
lines are CTS, DCD, and RNG. Recognized values for output
lines are DTR, RTS, and ST. See below for more about what
these signals mean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These values may be negated for
active low signals. That is, &quot;LB=-DCD&quot; recognizes
a low battery condition when DCD is not held high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPE INFORMATION <br>
The essence of a UPS definition in this driver is how it
uses the serial lines that are available. These are the
abbreviations you will see below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OL <br>
On line (no power failure) (opposite of OB - on battery)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LB <br>
Low battery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SD <br>
Shutdown load</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CP <br>
Cable power (must be present for cable to have valid
reading)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CTS <br>
Clear to Send. Received from the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RTS <br>
Ready to Send. Sent by the PC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DCD <br>
Data Carrier Detect. Received from the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RNG <br>
Ring indicate. Received from the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DTR <br>
Data Terminal Ready. Sent by the PC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ST <br>
Send a BREAK on the transmit data line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;-&quot; in front of a
signal name (like -RNG) means that the indicated condition
is signaled with an active low signal. For example,
[LB=-RNG] means the battery is low when the <br>
ring indicate line goes low, and that the battery is OK when
that line is held high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMILAR MODELS <br>
Many different UPS companies make models with similar
interfaces. The RUPS cable seems to be especially popular in
the &quot;power strip&quot; variety of UPS found in office
supply stores. <br>
If your UPS works with an entry in the table above, but the
model or manufacturer information don&acirc;t match,
don&acirc;t despair. You can fix that easily by using the
mfr and model <br>
variables documented above in your ups.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTING COMPATIBILITY <br>
If your UPS isn&acirc;t listed above, you can try going
through the list until you find one that works. There is a
lot of cable and interface reuse in the UPS world, and you
may find a <br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do this, first make sure
nothing important is plugged into the outlets on the UPS, as
you may inadvertently switch it off. Definitely make sure
that the computer you&acirc;re using <br>
is not plugged into that UPS. Plug in something small like a
lamp so you know when power is being supplied to the
outlets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, you can either attempt to
make an educated guess based on the documentation your
manufacturer has provided (if any), or just start going down
the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 1 <br>
Pick a driver to try from the list (genericups -h) and go to
step 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 2 <br>
Start the driver with the type you want to try -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">genericups -x upstype=n
/dev/port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let upsd sync up (watch the
syslog), and then run upsc to see what it found. If the
STATUS is right (should be OL for on line), continue to Step
3, otherwise go back to step 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can run
genericups in debug mode -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">genericups -DDDDD -x upstype=n
/dev/port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode it will be running
in the foreground and continuously display the line and
battery status of the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 3 <br>
Disconnect the UPS from the wall/mains power. This is
easiest if you have a switched outlet in between it and the
wall, but you can also just pull the plug to test. The lamp
<br>
should stay lit, and the status should switch to
&quot;OB&quot;. If the lamp went out or the status
didn&acirc;t go to &quot;OB&quot; within about 15 seconds,
go to Step 1. Otherwise, continue to Step 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 4 <br>
At this point, we know that OL and OB work. If nothing else
beyond this point works, you at least know what your OL/OB
value should be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait for the UPS to start
complaining about a low battery. Depending on the size of
your UPS battery and the lamp&acirc;s bulb, this could take
awhile. It should start complaining <br>
audibly at some point. When this happens, STATUS should show
&quot;OB LB&quot; within 15 seconds. If not, go to Step 1,
otherwise continue to Step 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 5 <br>
So far: OL works, OB works, and LB works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the UPS running on battery,
run the genericups driver with the -k switch to shut it
down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">genericups -x upstype=n -k
/dev/port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the UPS turns off the lamp,
you&acirc;re done. At this point, you have verified that the
shutdown sequence actually does what you want. You can start
using the genericups driver <br>
with this type number for normal operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should use your findings to
add a section to your ups.conf. Here is a quick example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[myups] <br>
driver = genericups <br>
port = /dev/ttyS0 <br>
upstype = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the port and upstype
values to match your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEW SUPPORT <br>
If the above testing sequence fails, you will probably need
to create a new entry to support your hardware. All UPS
types are determined from the table in the genericups.h file
<br>
in the source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a standard 9 pin serial port,
there are 6 lines that are used as the standard
&quot;high/low&quot; signal levels. 4 of them are incoming
(to the PC, from the UPS), and the other 2 are <br>
outgoing (to the UPS, from the PC). The other 3 are the
receive/transmit lines and the ground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that many manufacturers
remap pins within the cable. If you have any doubts, a quick
check with a multimeter should confirm whether the cable is
straight-through or not. <br>
Another thing to keep in mind is that some cables have
electronics in them to do special things. Some have
resistors and transistors on board to change behavior
depending on <br>
what&acirc;s being supplied by the PC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFIC MODEL NOTES <br>
These have been contributed by users of this driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Centralion CL series may
power down the load if the driver starts up with the UPS
running on battery as the default line settings contain the
shutdown sequence. - Neil Muller</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tripp-Lite Internet Office
700 must be used with the black 73-0844 cable instead of the
gray 73-0743 cable. This entry should work with any of their
models with the Lan 2.2 <br>
interface - see the sticker by the DB9 connector on the UPS.
- Stephen Brown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type 5 should work with the
Tripp-Lite Lan 2.1 interface and the 73-0724 cable. This was
tested with the OmniSmart 675 PNP on Red Hat 7.2. - Q
Giese</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Types 7 and 10 should both work
with the PhoenixTec A1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is no way to reliably detect a contact-closure UPS.
This means the driver will start up happily even if no UPS
is detected. It also means that if the connection between
the <br>
UPS and computer is interrupted, you may not be able to
sense this in software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most contact-closure UPSes will
not power down the load if the line power is present. This
can create a race when using slave upsmon(8) systems. See
the upsmon(8) man page for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The solution to both of these
problems is to upgrade to a smart protocol UPS of some kind
that allows detection and proper load cycling on
command.</p>
