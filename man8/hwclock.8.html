<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hwclock - query or set the hardware clock (RTC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hwclock [function] [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hwclock is a tool for accessing the Hardware Clock. You can
display the current time, set the Hardware Clock to a
specified time, set the Hardware Clock from the System Time,
or <br>
set the System Time from the Hardware Clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also run hwclock
periodically to add or subtract time from the Hardware Clock
to compensate for systematic drift (where the clock
consistently loses or gains time at a <br>
certain rate when left to run).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTIONS <br>
You need exactly one of the following options to tell
hwclock what function to perform:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --show <br>
Read the Hardware Clock and print the time on standard
output. The time shown is always in local time, even if you
keep your Hardware Clock in Coordinated Universal Time. <br>
See the --utc option. Showing the Hardware Clock time is the
default when no function is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set Set the Hardware Clock to
the time given by the --date option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --hctosys <br>
Set the System Time from the Hardware Clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also set the kernel&rsquo;s
timezone value to the local timezone as indicated by the TZ
environment variable and/or /usr/share/zoneinfo, as tzset(3)
would interpret them. The <br>
obsolete tz_dsttime field of the kernel&rsquo;s timezone
value is set to DST_NONE. (For details on what this field
used to mean, see settimeofday(2).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a good option to use in
one of the system startup scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --systohc <br>
Set the Hardware Clock to the current System Time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--systz <br>
Set the kernel&rsquo;s timezone and reset the System Time
based on the current timezone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system time is only reset on
the first call after boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local timezone is taken to
be what is indicated by the TZ environment variable and/or
/usr/share/zoneinfo, as tzset(3) would interpret them. The
obsolete tz_dsttime <br>
field of the kernel&rsquo;s timezone value is set to
DST_NONE. (For details on what this field used to mean, see
settimeofday(2).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an alternate option to
--hctosys that does not read the hardware clock, and may be
used in system startup scripts for recent 2.6 kernels where
you know the System <br>
Time contains the Hardware Clock time. If the Hardware Clock
is already in UTC, it is not reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--adjust <br>
Add or subtract time from the Hardware Clock to account for
systematic drift since the last time the clock was set or
adjusted. See discussion below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--getepoch <br>
Print the kernel&rsquo;s Hardware Clock epoch value to
standard output. This is the number of years into AD to
which a zero year value in the Hardware Clock refers. For
exam&acirc; <br>
ple, if you are using the convention that the year counter
in your Hardware Clock contains the number of full years
since 1952, then the kernel&rsquo;s Hardware Clock epoch
<br>
value must be 1952.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This epoch value is used
whenever hwclock reads or sets the Hardware Clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--setepoch <br>
Set the kernel&rsquo;s Hardware Clock epoch value to the
value specified by the --epoch option. See the --getepoch
option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--predict <br>
Predict what the RTC will read at time given by the --date
option based on the adjtime file. This is useful for example
if you need to set an RTC wakeup time to distant <br>
future and want to account for the RTC drift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --compare <br>
Periodically compare the Hardware Clock to the System Time
and output the difference every 10 seconds. This will also
print the frequency offset and tick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display the version of hwclock and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The first two options apply to just a few specific
functions, the others apply to most functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=date_string <br>
You need this option if you specify the --set or --predict
functions, otherwise it is ignored. It specifies the time to
which to set the Hardware Clock, or the time for <br>
which to predict the Hardware Clock reading. The value of
this option is an argument to the date(1) program. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hwclock --set
--date=&quot;2011-08-14 16:45:05&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument must be in local
time, even if you keep your Hardware Clock in Coordinated
Universal time. See the --utc option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--epoch=year <br>
Specifies the year which is the beginning of the Hardware
Clock&rsquo;s epoch, that is the number of years into AD to
which a zero value in the Hardware Clock&rsquo;s year
counter <br>
refers. It is used together with the --setepoch option to
set the kernel&rsquo;s idea of the epoch of the Hardware
Clock, or otherwise to specify the epoch for use with direct
<br>
ISA access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, on a Digital Unix
machine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hwclock --setepoch
--epoch=1952</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --utc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--localtime <br>
Indicates that the Hardware Clock is kept in Coordinated
Universal Time or local time, respectively. It is your
choice whether to keep your clock in UTC or local time, <br>
but nothing in the clock tells which you&rsquo;ve chosen. So
this option is how you give that information to hwclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify the wrong one of
these options (or specify neither and take a wrong default),
both setting and querying of the Hardware Clock will be
messed up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify neither --utc nor
--localtime, the default is whichever was specified the last
time hwclock was used to set the clock (i.e. hwclock was
successfully run <br>
with the --set, --systohc, or --adjust options), as recorded
in the adjtime file. If the adjtime file doesn&rsquo;t
exist, the default is UTC time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noadjfile <br>
Disables the facilities provided by /etc/adjtime. hwclock
will not read nor write to that file with this option.
Either --utc or --localtime must be specified when using
<br>
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--adjfile=filename <br>
Overrides the default /etc/adjtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --rtc=filename <br>
Overrides the default /dev file name, which is /dev/rtc on
many platforms but may be /dev/rtc0, /dev/rtc1, and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--directisa <br>
This option is meaningful only on an ISA machine or an Alpha
(which implements enough of ISA to be, roughly speaking, an
ISA machine for hwclock&rsquo;s purposes). For other <br>
machines, it has no effect. This option tells hwclock to use
explicit I/O instructions to access the Hardware Clock.
Without this option, hwclock will try to use the <br>
/dev/rtc device (which it assumes to be driven by the RTC
device driver). If it is unable to open the device (for
reading), it will use the explicit I/O instructions
any&acirc; <br>
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--badyear <br>
Indicates that the Hardware Clock is incapable of storing
years outside the range 1994-1999. There is a problem in
some BIOSes (almost all Award BIOSes made between <br>
4/26/94 and 5/31/95) wherein they are unable to deal with
years after 1999. If one attempts to set the year-of-century
value to something less than 94 (or 95 in some <br>
cases), the value that actually gets set is 94 (or 95).
Thus, if you have one of these machines, hwclock cannot set
the year after 1999 and cannot use the value of the <br>
clock as the true time in the normal way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compensate for this (without
your getting a BIOS update, which would definitely be
preferable), always use --badyear if you have one of these
machines. When hwclock <br>
knows it&rsquo;s working with a brain-damaged clock, it
ignores the year part of the Hardware Clock value and
instead tries to guess the year based on the last calibrated
date <br>
in the adjtime file, by assuming that date is within the
past year. For this to work, you had better do a hwclock
--set or hwclock --systohc at least once a year!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Though hwclock ignores the year
value when it reads the Hardware Clock, it sets the year
value when it sets the clock. It sets it to 1995, 1996,
1997, or 1998, whichever <br>
one has the same position in the leap year cycle as the true
year. That way, the Hardware Clock inserts leap days where
they belong. Again, if you let the Hardware Clock <br>
run for more than a year without setting it, this scheme
could be defeated and you could end up losing a day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hwclock warns you that you
probably need --badyear whenever it finds your Hardware
Clock set to 1994 or 1995.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--srm This option is equivalent
to --epoch=1900 and is used to specify the most common epoch
on Alphas with SRM console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arc This option is equivalent
to --epoch=1980 and is used to specify the most common epoch
on Alphas with ARC console (but Ruffians have epoch
1900).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--jensen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--funky-toy <br>
These two options specify what kind of Alpha machine you
have. They are invalid if you don&rsquo;t have an Alpha and
are usually unnecessary if you do, because hwclock should
<br>
be able to determine by itself what it&rsquo;s running on,
at least when /proc is mounted. (If you find you need one of
these options to make hwclock work, contact the main&acirc;
<br>
tainer to see if the program can be improved to detect your
system automatically. Output of &lsquo;hwclock
--debug&rsquo; and &lsquo;cat /proc/cpuinfo&rsquo; may be of
interest.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option --jensen means you are
running on a Jensen model. And --funky-toy means that on
your machine one has to use the UF bit instead of the UIP
bit in the Hardware Clock <br>
to detect a time transition. &quot;Toy&quot; in the option
name refers to the Time Of Year facility of the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test Do everything except
actually updating the Hardware Clock or anything else. This
is useful, especially in conjunction with --debug, in
learning about hwclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Display a lot of information about what hwclock is doing
internally. Some of its function is complex and this output
can help you understand how the program works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES Clocks in a Linux System
<br>
There are two main clocks in a Linux system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Hardware Clock: This is a
clock that runs independently of any control program running
in the CPU and even when the machine is powered off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On an ISA system, this clock is
specified as part of the ISA standard. The control program
can read or set this clock to a whole second, but the
control program can also detect <br>
the edges of the 1 second clock ticks, so the clock actually
has virtually infinite precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This clock is commonly called
the hardware clock, the real time clock, the RTC, the BIOS
clock, and the CMOS clock. Hardware Clock, in its
capitalized form, was coined for use <br>
by hwclock because all of the other names are inappropriate
to the point of being misleading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So for example, some non-ISA
systems have a few real time clocks with only one of them
having its own power domain. A very low power external I2C
or SPI clock chip might be used <br>
with a backup battery as the hardware clock to initialize a
more functional integrated real-time clock which is used for
most other purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The System Time: This is the
time kept by a clock inside the Linux kernel and driven by a
timer interrupt. (On an ISA machine, the timer interrupt is
part of the ISA standard). <br>
It has meaning only while Linux is running on the machine.
The System Time is the number of seconds since 00:00:00
January 1, 1970 UTC (or more succinctly, the number of
seconds <br>
since 1969). The System Time is not an integer, though. It
has virtually infinite precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The System Time is the time that
matters. The Hardware Clock&rsquo;s basic purpose in a Linux
system is to keep time when Linux is not running. You
initialize the System Time to the <br>
time from the Hardware Clock when Linux starts up, and then
never use the Hardware Clock again. Note that in DOS, for
which ISA was designed, the Hardware Clock is the only real
<br>
time clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important that the System
Time not have any discontinuities such as would happen if
you used the date(1L) program to set it while the system is
running. You can, however, <br>
do whatever you want to the Hardware Clock while the system
is running, and the next time Linux starts up, it will do so
with the adjusted time from the Hardware Clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Linux kernel maintains a
concept of a local timezone for the system. But don&rsquo;t
be misled -- almost nobody cares what timezone the kernel
thinks it is in. Instead, programs <br>
that care about the timezone (perhaps because they want to
display a local time for you) almost always use a more
traditional method of determining the timezone: They use the
TZ <br>
environment variable and/or the /usr/share/zoneinfo
directory, as explained in the man page for tzset(3).
However, some programs and fringe parts of the Linux kernel
such as <br>
filesystems use the kernel timezone value. An example is the
vfat filesystem. If the kernel timezone value is wrong, the
vfat filesystem will report and set the wrong time&acirc;
<br>
stamps on files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hwclock sets the kernel timezone
to the value indicated by TZ and/or /usr/share/zoneinfo when
you set the System Time using the --hctosys option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timezone value actually
consists of two parts: 1) a field tz_minuteswest indicating
how many minutes local time (not adjusted for DST) lags
behind UTC, and 2) a field tz_dst&acirc; <br>
time indicating the type of Daylight Savings Time (DST)
convention that is in effect in the locality at the present
time. This second field is not used under Linux and is
always <br>
zero. (See also settimeofday(2).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users access and setuid <br>
Sometimes, you need to install hwclock setuid root. If you
want users other than the superuser to be able to display
the clock value using the direct ISA I/O method, install it
<br>
setuid root. If you have the /dev/rtc interface on your
system or are on a non-ISA system, there&rsquo;s probably no
need for users to use the direct ISA I/O method, so
don&rsquo;t bother.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any case, hwclock will not
allow you to set anything unless you have the superuser real
uid. (This is restriction is not necessary if you
haven&rsquo;t installed setuid root, but <br>
it&rsquo;s there for now).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How hwclock Accesses the
Hardware Clock <br>
hwclock uses many different ways to get and set Hardware
Clock values. The most normal way is to do I/O to the device
special file /dev/rtc, which is presumed to be driven by
<br>
the rtc device driver. However, this method is not always
available. For one thing, the rtc driver is a relatively
recent addition to Linux. Older systems don&rsquo;t have it.
<br>
Also, though there are versions of the rtc driver that work
on DEC Alphas, there appear to be plenty of Alphas on which
the rtc driver does not work (a common symptom is hwclock
<br>
hanging). Moreover, recent Linux systems have more generic
support for RTCs, even systems that have more than one, so
you might need to override the default by specifying <br>
/dev/rtc0 or /dev/rtc1 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On older systems, the method of
accessing the Hardware Clock depends on the system
hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On an ISA system, hwclock can
directly access the &quot;CMOS memory&quot; registers that
constitute the clock, by doing I/O to Ports 0x70 and 0x71.
It does this with actual I/O instruc&acirc; <br>
tions and consequently can only do it if running with
superuser effective userid. (In the case of a Jensen Alpha,
there is no way for hwclock to execute those I/O
instructions, <br>
and so it uses instead the /dev/port device special file,
which provides almost as low-level an interface to the I/O
subsystem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a really poor method of
accessing the clock, for all the reasons that user space
programs are generally not supposed to do direct I/O and
disable interrupts. Hwclock <br>
provides it because it is the only method available on ISA
and Alpha systems which don&rsquo;t have working rtc device
drivers available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On an m68k system, hwclock can
access the clock via the console driver, via the device
special file /dev/tty1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hwclock tries to use /dev/rtc.
If it is compiled for a kernel that doesn&rsquo;t have that
function or it is unable to open /dev/rtc (or the
alternative special file you&rsquo;ve defined on <br>
the command line) hwclock will fall back to another method,
if available. On an ISA or Alpha machine, you can force
hwclock to use the direct manipulation of the CMOS registers
<br>
without even trying /dev/rtc by specifying the --directisa
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Adjust Function <br>
The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate. However,
much of its inaccuracy is completely predictable - it gains
or loses the same amount of time every day. This is called
<br>
systematic drift. hwclock&rsquo;s &quot;adjust&quot;
function lets you make systematic corrections to correct the
systematic drift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It works like this: hwclock
keeps a file, /etc/adjtime, that keeps some historical
information. This is called the adjtime file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose you start with no
adjtime file. You issue a hwclock --set command to set the
Hardware Clock to the true current time. Hwclock creates the
adjtime file and records in it <br>
the current time as the last time the clock was calibrated.
5 days later, the clock has gained 10 seconds, so you issue
another hwclock --set command to set it back 10 seconds.
<br>
Hwclock updates the adjtime file to show the current time as
the last time the clock was calibrated, and records 2
seconds per day as the systematic drift rate. 24 hours go
by, <br>
and then you issue a hwclock --adjust command. Hwclock
consults the adjtime file and sees that the clock gains 2
seconds per day when left alone and that it has been left
alone <br>
for exactly one day. So it subtracts 2 seconds from the
Hardware Clock. It then records the current time as the last
time the clock was adjusted. Another 24 hours goes by and
<br>
you issue another hwclock --adjust. Hwclock does the same
thing: subtracts 2 seconds and updates the adjtime file with
the current time as the last time the clock was
adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every time you calibrate (set)
the clock (using --set or --systohc), hwclock recalculates
the systematic drift rate based on how long it has been
since the last calibration, how <br>
long it has been since the last adjustment, what drift rate
was assumed in any intervening adjustments, and the amount
by which the clock is presently off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A small amount of error creeps
in any time hwclock sets the clock, so it refrains from
making an adjustment that would be less than 1 second. Later
on, when you request an <br>
adjustment again, the accumulated drift will be more than a
second and hwclock will do the adjustment then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is good to do a hwclock
--adjust just before the hwclock --hctosys at system startup
time, and maybe periodically while the system is running via
cron.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The adjtime file, while named
for its historical purpose of controlling adjustments only,
actually contains other information for use by hwclock in
remembering information from <br>
one invocation to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the adjtime file
is, in ASCII:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line 1: 3 numbers, separated by
blanks: 1) systematic drift rate in seconds per day,
floating point decimal; 2) Resulting number of seconds since
1969 UTC of most recent adjust&acirc; <br>
ment or calibration, decimal integer; 3) zero (for
compatibility with clock(8)) as a decimal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line 2: 1 number: Resulting
number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent calibration.
Zero if there has been no calibration yet or it is known
that any previous calibration <br>
is moot (for example, because the Hardware Clock has been
found, since that calibration, not to contain a valid time).
This is a decimal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line 3: &quot;UTC&quot; or
&quot;LOCAL&quot;. Tells whether the Hardware Clock is set
to Coordinated Universal Time or local time. You can always
override this value with options on the hwclock <br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use an adjtime file that
was previously used with the clock(8) program with
hwclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Hardware Clock
Synchronization By the Kernel <br>
You should be aware of another way that the Hardware Clock
is kept synchronized in some systems. The Linux kernel has a
mode wherein it copies the System Time to the Hardware <br>
Clock every 11 minutes. This is a good mode to use when you
are using something sophisticated like ntp to keep your
System Time synchronized. (ntp is a way to keep your System
<br>
Time synchronized either to a time server somewhere on the
network or to a radio clock hooked up to your system. See
RFC 1305).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mode (we&rsquo;ll call it
&quot;11 minute mode&quot;) is off until something turns it
on. The ntp daemon xntpd is one thing that turns it on. You
can turn it off by running anything, <br>
including hwclock --hctosys, that sets the System Time the
old fashioned way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your system runs with 11
minute mode on, don&rsquo;t use hwclock --adjust or hwclock
--hctosys. You&rsquo;ll just make a mess. It is acceptable
to use a hwclock --hctosys at startup <br>
time to get a reasonable System Time until your system is
able to set the System Time from the external source and
start 11 minute mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ISA Hardware Clock Century value
<br>
There is some sort of standard that defines CMOS memory Byte
50 on an ISA machine as an indicator of what century it is.
hwclock does not use or set that byte because there are <br>
some machines that don&rsquo;t define the byte that way, and
it really isn&rsquo;t necessary anyway, since the
year-of-century does a good job of implying which century it
is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a bona fide use for
a CMOS century byte, contact the hwclock maintainer; an
option may be appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this section is only
relevant when you are using the &quot;direct ISA&quot;
method of accessing the Hardware Clock. ACPI provides a
standard way to access century values, when <br>
they are supported by the hardware.</p>
