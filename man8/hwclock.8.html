<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>hwclock</b> is a tool for accessing the Hardware Clock. You can display the
  current time, set the Hardware Clock to a specified time, set the Hardware
  Clock from the System Time, or set the System Time from the Hardware Clock.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also run <b>hwclock</b> periodically to add or subtract time from the
  Hardware Clock to compensate for systematic drift (where the clock
  consistently loses or gains time at a certain rate when left to run).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
You need exactly one of the following options to tell <b>hwclock</b> what
  function to perform:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r</b>,<b>&#x00A0;--show</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Read the Hardware Clock and print the time on standard
      output. The time shown is always in local time, even if you keep your
      Hardware Clock in Coordinated Universal Time. See the <b>--utc</b> option.
      Showing the Hardware Clock time is the default when no function is
      specified.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The local timezone is taken to be what is indicated by the TZ environment

      see <b>settimeofday</b>(2).)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is an alternate option to <b>--hctosys</b> that does not read the
      hardware clock, and may be used in system startup scripts for recent 2.6

  <dd class="It-tag">You need this option if you specify the <b>--set</b> or

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--badyear</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Indicates that the Hardware Clock is incapable of storing
      years outside the range 1994-1999. There is a problem in some BIOSes
      (almost all Award BIOSes made between 4/26/94 and 5/31/95) wherein they
      are unable to deal with years after 1999. If one attempts to set the
      year-of-century value to something less than 94 (or 95 in some cases), the
      value that actually gets set is 94 (or 95). Thus, if you have one of these
      machines, <b>hwclock</b> cannot set the year after 1999 and cannot use the
      value of the clock as the true time in the normal way.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To compensate for this (without your getting a BIOS update, which would
      definitely be preferable), always use <b>--badyear</b> if you have one of
      these machines. When <b>hwclock</b> knows it's working with a
      brain-damaged clock, it ignores the year part of the Hardware Clock value
      and instead tries to guess the year based on the last calibrated date in
      the adjtime file, by assuming that date is within the past year. For this
      to work, you had better do a <b>hwclock --set</b> or <b>hwclock
      --systohc</b> at least once a year!
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Though <b>hwclock</b> ignores the year value when it reads the Hardware
      Clock, it sets the year value when it sets the clock. It sets it to 1995,
      1996, 1997, or 1998, whichever one has the same position in the leap year
      cycle as the true year. That way, the Hardware Clock inserts leap days
      where they belong. Again, if you let the Hardware Clock run for more than
      a year without setting it, this scheme could be defeated and you could end
      up losing a day.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>hwclock</b> warns you that you probably need <b>--badyear</b> whenever it

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Clocks_in_a_Linux_System"><a class="selflink" href="#Clocks_in_a_Linux_System">Clocks
  in a Linux System</a></h1>
There are two main clocks in a Linux system:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>The Hardware Clock:</b> This is a clock that runs independently of any
  control program running in the CPU and even when the machine is powered off.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On an ISA system, this clock is specified as part of the ISA standard. The
  control program can read or set this clock to a whole second, but the control
  program can also detect the edges of the 1 second clock ticks, so the clock
  actually has virtually infinite precision.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This clock is commonly called the hardware clock, the real time clock, the RTC,
  the BIOS clock, and the CMOS clock. Hardware Clock, in its capitalized form,
  was coined for use by <b>hwclock</b> because all of the other names are
  inappropriate to the point of being misleading.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So for example, some non-ISA systems have a few real time clocks with only one
  of them having its own power domain. A very low power external I2C or SPI
  clock chip might be used with a backup battery as the hardware clock to
  initialize a more functional integrated real-time clock which is used for most
  other purposes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>The System Time:</b> This is the time kept by a clock inside the Linux kernel
  and driven by a timer interrupt. (On an ISA machine, the timer interrupt is
  part of the ISA standard). It has meaning only while Linux is running on the
  machine. The System Time is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1,
  1970 UTC (or more succinctly, the number of seconds since 1969). The System
  Time is not an integer, though. It has virtually infinite precision.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The System Time is the time that matters. The Hardware Clock's basic purpose in
  a Linux system is to keep time when Linux is not running. You initialize the
  System Time to the time from the Hardware Clock when Linux starts up, and then
  never use the Hardware Clock again. Note that in DOS, for which ISA was
  designed, the Hardware Clock is the only real time clock.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is important that the System Time not have any discontinuities such as would
  happen if you used the <b>date</b>(1L) program to set it while the system is
  running. You can, however, do whatever you want to the Hardware Clock while
  the system is running, and the next time Linux starts up, it will do so with
  the adjusted time from the Hardware Clock.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A Linux kernel maintains a concept of a local timezone for the system. But don't
  be misled -- almost nobody cares what timezone the kernel thinks it is in.
  Instead, programs that care about the timezone (perhaps because they want to
  display a local time for you) almost always use a more traditional method of
  determining the timezone: They use the TZ environment variable and/or the
  <i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i> directory, as explained in the man page for
  <b>tzset</b>(3). However, some programs and fringe parts of the Linux kernel
  such as filesystems use the kernel timezone value. An example is the vfat
  filesystem. If the kernel timezone value is wrong, the vfat filesystem will
  report and set the wrong timestamps on files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>hwclock</b> sets the kernel timezone to the value indicated by TZ and/or
  <i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i> when you set the System Time using the
  <b>--hctosys</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The timezone value actually consists of two parts: 1) a field tz_minuteswest
  indicating how many minutes local time (not adjusted for DST) lags behind UTC,
  and 2) a field tz_dsttime indicating the type of Daylight Savings Time (DST)
  convention that is in effect in the locality at the present time. This second
  field is not used under Linux and is always zero. (See also
  <b>settimeofday</b>(2).)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Users_access_and_setuid"><a class="selflink" href="#Users_access_and_setuid">Users
  access and setuid</a></h1>
Sometimes, you need to install <b>hwclock</b> setuid root. If you want users
  other than the superuser to be able to display the clock value using the
  direct ISA I/O method, install it setuid root. If you have the /dev/rtc
  interface on your system or are on a non-ISA system, there's probably no need
  for users to use the direct ISA I/O method, so don't bother.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In any case, hwclock will not allow you to set anything unless you have the
  superuser real uid. (This is restriction is not necessary if you haven't
  installed setuid root, but it's there for now).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="How_hwclock_Accesses_the_Hardware_Clock"><a class="selflink" href="#How_hwclock_Accesses_the_Hardware_Clock">How
  hwclock Accesses the Hardware Clock</a></h1>
<b>hwclock</b> uses many different ways to get and set Hardware Clock values.
  The most normal way is to do I/O to the device special file /dev/rtc, which is
  presumed to be driven by the rtc device driver. However, this method is not
  always available. For one thing, the rtc driver is a relatively recent
  addition to Linux. Older systems don't have it. Also, though there are
  versions of the rtc driver that work on DEC Alphas, there appear to be plenty
  of Alphas on which the rtc driver does not work (a common symptom is hwclock
  hanging). Moreover, recent Linux systems have more generic support for RTCs,
  even systems that have more than one, so you might need to override the
  default by specifying <i>/dev/rtc0</i> or <i>/dev/rtc1</i> instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On older systems, the method of accessing the Hardware Clock depends on the
  system hardware.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On an ISA system, <b>hwclock</b> can directly access the &quot;CMOS memory&quot;
  registers that constitute the clock, by doing I/O to Ports 0x70 and 0x71. It
  does this with actual I/O instructions and consequently can only do it if
  running with superuser effective userid. (In the case of a Jensen Alpha, there
  is no way for <b>hwclock</b> to execute those I/O instructions, and so it uses
  instead the /dev/port device special file, which provides almost as low-level
  an interface to the I/O subsystem).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is a really poor method of accessing the clock, for all the reasons that
  user space programs are generally not supposed to do direct I/O and disable
  interrupts. Hwclock provides it because it is the only method available on ISA
  and Alpha systems which don't have working rtc device drivers available.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On an m68k system, <b>hwclock</b> can access the clock via the console driver,
  via the device special file /dev/tty1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>hwclock</b> tries to use /dev/rtc. If it is compiled for a kernel that
  doesn't have that function or it is unable to open /dev/rtc (or the
  alternative special file you've defined on the command line) <b>hwclock</b>
  will fall back to another method, if available. On an ISA or Alpha machine,
  you can force <b>hwclock</b> to use the direct manipulation of the CMOS
  registers without even trying <i>/dev/rtc</i> by specifying the
  <b>--directisa</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="The_Adjust_Function"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Adjust_Function">The
  Adjust Function</a></h1>
The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate. However, much of its inaccuracy
  is completely predictable - it gains or loses the same amount of time every
  day. This is called systematic drift. <b>hwclock</b>'s &quot;adjust&quot;
  function lets you make systematic corrections to correct the systematic drift.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It works like this: <b>hwclock</b> keeps a file, <i>/etc/adjtime</i>, that keeps
  some historical information. This is called the adjtime file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose you start with no adjtime file. You issue a <i>hwclock --set</i> command
  to set the Hardware Clock to the true current time. <b>Hwclock</b> creates the
  adjtime file and records in it the current time as the last time the clock was
  calibrated. 5 days later, the clock has gained 10 seconds, so you issue
  another <i>hwclock --set</i> command to set it back 10 seconds. <b>Hwclock</b>
  updates the adjtime file to show the current time as the last time the clock
  was calibrated, and records 2 seconds per day as the systematic drift rate. 24
  hours go by, and then you issue a <i>hwclock --adjust</i> command.
  <b>Hwclock</b> consults the adjtime file and sees that the clock gains 2
  seconds per day when left alone and that it has been left alone for exactly
  one day. So it subtracts 2 seconds from the Hardware Clock. It then records
  the current time as the last time the clock was adjusted. Another 24 hours
  goes by and you issue another <i>hwclock --adjust</i>. <b>Hwclock</b> does the
  same thing: subtracts 2 seconds and updates the adjtime file with the current
  time as the last time the clock was adjusted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Every time you calibrate (set) the clock (using <i>--set</i> or
  <i>--systohc</i>), <b>hwclock</b> recalculates the systematic drift rate based
  on how long it has been since the last calibration, how long it has been since
  the last adjustment, what drift rate was assumed in any intervening
  adjustments, and the amount by which the clock is presently off.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A small amount of error creeps in any time <b>hwclock</b> sets the clock, so it
  refrains from making an adjustment that would be less than 1 second. Later on,
  when you request an adjustment again, the accumulated drift will be more than
  a second and <b>hwclock</b> will do the adjustment then.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is good to do a <i>hwclock --adjust</i> just before the <i>hwclock
  --hctosys</i> at system startup time, and maybe periodically while the system
  is running via cron.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The adjtime file, while named for its historical purpose of controlling
  adjustments only, actually contains other information for use by hwclock in
  remembering information from one invocation to the next.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of the adjtime file is, in ASCII:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Line 1: 3 numbers, separated by blanks: 1) systematic drift rate in seconds per
  day, floating point decimal; 2) Resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of
  most recent adjustment or calibration, decimal integer; 3) zero (for
  compatibility with <b>clock</b>(8)) as a decimal integer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Line 2: 1 number: Resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent
  calibration. Zero if there has been no calibration yet or it is known that any
  previous calibration is moot (for example, because the Hardware Clock has been
  found, since that calibration, not to contain a valid time). This is a decimal
  integer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Line 3: &quot;UTC&quot; or &quot;LOCAL&quot;. Tells whether the Hardware Clock
  is set to Coordinated Universal Time or local time. You can always override
  this value with options on the <b>hwclock</b> command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use an adjtime file that was previously used with the <b>clock</b>(8)
  program with <b>hwclock</b>.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Automatic_Hardware_Clock_Synchronization_By_the_Kernel"><a class="selflink" href="#Automatic_Hardware_Clock_Synchronization_By_the_Kernel">Automatic
  Hardware Clock Synchronization By the Kernel</a></h1>
You should be aware of another way that the Hardware Clock is kept synchronized
  in some systems. The Linux kernel has a mode wherein it copies the System Time
  to the Hardware Clock every 11 minutes. This is a good mode to use when you
  are using something sophisticated like ntp to keep your System Time
  synchronized. (ntp is a way to keep your System Time synchronized either to a
  time server somewhere on the network or to a radio clock hooked up to your
  system. See RFC 1305).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This mode (we'll call it &quot;11 minute mode&quot;) is off until something
  turns it on. The ntp daemon xntpd is one thing that turns it on. You can turn
  it off by running anything, including <i>hwclock --hctosys</i>, that sets the
  System Time the old fashioned way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If your system runs with 11 minute mode on, don't use <i>hwclock --adjust</i> or
  <i>hwclock --hctosys</i>. You'll just make a mess. It is acceptable to use a
  <i>hwclock --hctosys</i> at startup time to get a reasonable System Time until
  your system is able to set the System Time from the external source and start
  11 minute mode.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ISA_Hardware_Clock_Century_value"><a class="selflink" href="#ISA_Hardware_Clock_Century_value">ISA
  Hardware Clock Century value</a></h1>
There is some sort of standard that defines CMOS memory Byte 50 on an ISA
  machine as an indicator of what century it is. <b>hwclock</b> does not use or
  set that byte because there are some machines that don't define the byte that
  way, and it really isn't necessary anyway, since the year-of-century does a
  good job of implying which century it is.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you have a bona fide use for a CMOS century byte, contact the <b>hwclock</b>
  maintainer; an option may be appropriate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this section is only relevant when you are using the &quot;direct
  ISA&quot; method of accessing the Hardware Clock. ACPI provides a standard way
  to access century values, when they are supported by the hardware.
