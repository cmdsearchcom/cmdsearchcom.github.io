<p>udpsvd(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual udpsvd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
udpsvd - UDP/IP service daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
udpsvd [-hpvv] [-u user] [-l name] [-i dir|-x cdb] [-t sec]
host port prog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
udpsvd creates an UDP/IP socket, binds it to the address
host:port, and listens on the socket for incoming
datagrams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a datagram is available on
the socket, udpsvd conditionally starts a program, with
standard input reading from the socket, and standard output
redirected to standard error, to <br>
handle this, and possibly more datagrams. udpsvd does not
start the program if another program that it has started
before still is running. If the program exits, udpsvd again
<br>
listens to the socket until a new datagram is available. If
there are still datagrams available on the socket, the
program is restarted immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">udpsvd optionally checks for
special intructions depending on the IP address or hostname
of the client sending the datagram which not yet was handled
by a running program, see <br>
ipsvd-instruct(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTENTION: <br>
UDP is a connectionless protocol. Most programs that handle
user datagrams, such as talkd(8), keep running after
receiving a datagram, and process subsequent datagrams sent
to <br>
the socket until a timeout is reached. udpsvd only checks
special instructions for a datagram that causes a startup of
the program; not if a program handling datagrams already
<br>
is running. It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to restrict
access through special instructions when using such a
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, it makes
perfectly sense with programs like tftpd(8), that fork to
establish a separate connection to the client when receiving
the datagram. In general it&rsquo;s <br>
adequate to set up special instructions for programs that
support being run by tcpwrapper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
host host either is a hostname, or a dotted-decimal IP
address, or 0. If host is 0, udpsvd accepts datagrams to any
local IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port udpsvd accepts datagrams to
host:port. port may be a name from /etc/services or a
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prog prog consists of one or
more arguments. udpsvd normally runs prog to handle a
datagram, and possibly more, that is sent to the socket, if
there is no program that was <br>
started before by udpsvd still running and handling
datagrams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i dir read instructions for
handling new connections from the instructions directory
dir. See ipsvd-instruct(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x cdb read instructions for
handling new connections from the constant database cdb. The
constant database normally is created from an instructions
directory by running ipsvd- <br>
cdb(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t sec timeout. This option only
takes effect if the -i option is given. While checking the
instructions directory, check the time of last access of the
file that matches the <br>
clients address or hostname if any, discard and remove the
file if it wasn&rsquo;t accessed within the last sec
seconds; udpsvd does not discard or remove a file if the
user&rsquo;s <br>
write permission is not set, for those files the timeout is
disabled. Default is 0, which means that the timeout is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l name <br>
local hostname. Do not look up the local hostname in DNS,
but use name as hostname. By default udpsvd looks up the
local hostname once at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u [:]user[:group] <br>
drop permissions. Set uid and gid to the user&rsquo;s uid
and gid, as found in /etc/passwd, before running prog. If
user is followed by a colon and a group, set the gid to <br>
group&rsquo;s gid, as found in /etc/group, instead of
user&rsquo;s gid. If group consists of a colon-separated
list of group names, set the group ids of all listed groups.
If user <br>
is prefixed with a colon, the user and all group arguments
are interpreted as uid and gids respectively, and not looked
up in the password or group file. All supplemen&acirc; <br>
tary groups are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Look up the client&rsquo;s
hostname in DNS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p paranoid. After looking up
the client&rsquo;s hostname in DNS, look up the IP addresses
in DNS for that hostname, and forget the hostname if none of
the addresses match the <br>
client&rsquo;s IP address. You should set this option if you
use hostname based instructions. The -p option implies the
-h option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose. Print verbose
messages to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv more verbose. Print more
verbose messages to standard output.</p>
