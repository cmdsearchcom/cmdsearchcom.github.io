<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dump - ext2/3/4 filesystem backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dump [-level#] [-ackMnqSuv] [-A file] [-B records] [-b
blocksize] [-d density] [-D file] [-e inode numbers] [-E
file] [-f file] [-F script] [-h level] [-I nr errors]

[-zcompression level] files-to-dump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump [-W | -w]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dump examines files on an ext2/3/4 filesystem and determines
which files need to be backed up. These files are copied to
the given disk, tape or other storage medium for safe <br>
keeping (see the -f option below for doing remote backups).
A dump that is larger than the output medium is broken into
multiple volumes. On most media the size is determined by
<br>
writing until an end-of-media indication is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On media that cannot reliably
return an end-of-media indication (such as some cartridge
tape drives), each volume is of a fixed size; the actual
size is determined by specifying <br>
cartridge media, or via the tape size, density and/or block
count options below. By default, the same output file name
is used for each volume after prompting the operator to <br>
change media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files-to-dump is either a
mountpoint of a filesystem or a list of files and
directories to be backed up as a subset of a filesystem. In
the former case, either the path to a <br>
mounted filesystem or the device of an unmounted filesystem
can be used. In the latter case, certain restrictions are
placed on the backup: -u is not allowed, the only dump level
<br>
that is supported is 0 and all the files and directories
must reside on the same filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported by dump:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-level# <br>
The dump level (any integer). A level 0, full backup,
specified by -0 guarantees the entire file system is copied
(but see also the -h option below). A level number above
<br>
0, incremental backup, tells dump to copy all files new or
modified since the last dump of a lower level. The default
level is 0. Historically only levels 0 to 9 were <br>
usable in dump, this version is able to understand any
integer as a dump level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &acirc;auto-size&acirc;.
Bypass all tape length calculations, and write until an
end-of-media indication is returned. This works best for
most modern tape drives, and is the default. <br>
Use of this option is particularly recommended when
appending to an existing tape, or using a tape drive with
hardware compression (where you can never be sure about the
<br>
compression ratio).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A archive_file <br>
Archive a dump table-of-contents in the specified
archive_file to be used by restore(8) to determine whether a
file is in the dump file that is being restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
The number of kilobytes per dump record. The default
blocksize is 10, unless the -d option has been used to
specify a tape density of 6250BPI or more, in which case the
<br>
default blocksize is 32. Th maximal value is 1024. Note
however that, since the IO system slices all requests into
chunks of MAXBSIZE (which can be as low as 64kB), you <br>
can experience problems with dump(8) and restore(8) when
using a higher value, depending on your kernel and/or libC
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B records <br>
The number of 1 kB blocks per volume. Not normally required,
as dump can detect end-of-media. When the specified size is
reached, dump waits for you to change the volume. <br>
This option overrides the calculation of tape size based on
length and density. If compression is on this limits the
size of the compressed output per volume. Multiple <br>
values may be given as a single argument separated by
commas. Each value will be used for one dump volume in the
order listed; if dump creates more volumes than the
num&acirc; <br>
ber of values given, the last value will be used for the
remaining volumes. This is useful for filling up already
partially filled media (and then continuing with full <br>
size volumes on empty media) or mixing media of different
sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Change the defaults for use
with a cartridge tape drive, with a density of 8000 bpi, and
a length of 1700 feet. Specifying a cartridge drive
overrides the end-of-media <br>
detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d density <br>
Set tape density to density. The default is 1600BPI.
Specifying a tape density overrides the end-of-media
detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D file <br>
Set the path name of the file storing the information about
the previous full and incremental dumps. The default
location is /etc/dumpdates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e inodes <br>
Exclude inodes from the dump. The inodes parameter is a
comma separated list of inode numbers (you can use stat(1)
to find the inode number for a file or directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E file <br>
Read list of inodes to be excluded from the dump from the
text file file. The file file should be an ordinary file
containing inode numbers separated by newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Write the backup to file; file may be a special device file
like /dev/st0 (a tape drive), /dev/rsd1c (a floppy disk
drive), an ordinary file, or - (the standard output). <br>
Multiple file names may be given as a single argument
separated by commas. Each file will be used for one dump
volume in the order listed; if the dump requires more
vol&acirc; <br>
umes than the number of names given, the last file name will
used for all remaining volumes after prompting for media
changes. If the name of the file is of the form <br>
host:file or user@host:file dump writes to the named file on
the remote host (which should already exist, dump
doesn&rsquo;t create a new remote file) using rmt(8). The
default <br>
path name of the remote rmt(8) program is /etc/rmt; this can
be overridden by the environment variable RMT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F script <br>
Run script at the end of each tape (except for the last
one). The device name and the current volume number are
passed on the command line. The script must return 0 if <br>
dump should continue without asking the user to change the
tape, 1 if dump should continue but ask the user to change
the tape. Any other exit code will cause dump to <br>
abort. For security reasons, dump reverts back to the real
user ID and the real group ID before running the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h level <br>
Honor the user nodump flag UF_NODUMP only for dumps at or
above the given level. The default honor level is 1, so that
incremental backups omit such files but full back&acirc;
<br>
ups retain them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I nr errors <br>
By default, dump will ignore the first 32 read errors on the
file system before asking for operator intervention. You can
change this using this flag to any value. This is <br>
useful when running dump on an active filesystem where read
errors simply indicate an inconsistency between the mapping
and dumping passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A value of 0 means that all read
errors will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jcompression level <br>
Compress every block to be written on the tape using bzlib
library. This option will work only when dumping to a file
or pipe or, when dumping to a tape drive, if the tape <br>
drive is capable of writing variable length blocks. You will
need at least the 0.4b24 version of restore in order to
extract compressed tapes. Tapes written using compres&acirc;
<br>
sion will not be compatible with the BSD tape format. The
(optional) parameter specifies the compression level bzlib
will use. The default compression level is 2. If the <br>
optional parameter is specified, there should be no white
space between the option letter and the parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Use Kerberos authentication
to talk to remote tape servers. (Only available if this
option was enabled when dump was compiled.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L label <br>
The user-supplied text string label is placed into the dump
header, where tools like restore(8) and file(8) can access
it. Note that this label is limited to be at most <br>
LBLSIZE (currently 16) characters, which must include the
terminating .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m If this flag is specified,
dump will optimise the output for inodes having been changed
but not modified since the last dump (&rsquo;changed&rsquo;
and &rsquo;modified&rsquo; have the meaning <br>
defined in stat(2) ). For those inodes, dump will save only
the metadata, instead of saving the entire inode contents.
Inodes which are either directories or have been <br>
modified since the last dump are saved in a regular way.
Uses of this flag must be consistent, meaning that either
every dump in an incremental dump set have the flag, or <br>
no one has it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use this option, be aware
that many programs that unpack files from archives (e.g.
tar, rpm, unzip, dpkg) may set files&rsquo; mtimes to dates
in the past. Files <br>
installed in this way may not be dumped correctly using
&quot;dump -m&quot; if the modified mtime is earlier than
the previous level dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tapes written using such
&rsquo;metadata only&rsquo; inodes will not be compatible
with the BSD tape format or older versions of restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Enable the multi-volume
feature. The name specified with f is treated as a prefix
and dump writes in sequence to &lt;prefix&gt;001,
&lt;prefix&gt;002 etc. This can be useful when <br>
dumping to files on an ext2/3/4 partition, in order to
bypass the 2GB file size limitation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Whenever dump requires
operator attention, notify all operators in the group
operator by means similar to a wall(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Make dump abort immediately
whenever operator attention is required, without prompting
in case of write errors, tape changes etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q file <br>
Enable the Quick File Access support. Tape positions for
each inode are stored into the file file which is used by
restore (if called with parameter -Q and the filename) <br>
to directly position the tape at the file restore is
currently working on. This saves hours when restoring single
files from large backups, saves the tapes and the
drive&rsquo;s <br>
head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended to set up the
st driver to return logical tape positions rather than
physical before calling dump/restore with parameter -Q.
Since not all tape devices <br>
support physical tape positions those tape devices return an
error during dump/restore when the st driver is set to the
default physical setting. Please see the st(4) man <br>
page, option MTSETDRVBUFFER , or the mt(1) man page, on how
to set the driver to return logical tape positions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before calling restore with
parameter -Q, always make sure the st driver is set to
return the same type of tape position used during the call
to dump. Otherwise restore <br>
may be confused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used when
dumping to local tapes (see above) or to local files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s feet <br>
Attempt to calculate the amount of tape needed at a
particular density. If this amount is exceeded, dump prompts
for a new tape. It is recommended to be a bit conservative
<br>
on this option. The default tape length is 2300 feet.
Specifying the tape size overrides end-of-media
detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Size estimate. Determine the
amount of space that is needed to perform the dump without
actually doing it, and display the estimated number of bytes
it will take. This is <br>
useful with incremental dumps to determine how many volumes
of media will be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T date <br>
Use the specified date as the starting time for the dump
instead of the time determined from looking in
/etc/dumpdates . The format of date is the same as that of
<br>
ctime(3) followed by an rfc822 timezone specification:
either a plus or minus sign followed by two digits for the
number of hours and two digits for the minutes. For <br>
example, -0800 for eight hours west of Greenwich or +0230
for two hours and a half east of Greenwich. This timezone
offset takes into account daylight savings time (if <br>
applicable to the timezone): UTC offsets when daylight
savings time is in effect will be different than offsets
when daylight savings time is not in effect. For backward
<br>
compatibility, if no timezone is specified, a local time is
assumed. This option is useful for automated dump scripts
that wish to dump over a specific period of time. <br>
The -T option is mutually exclusive from the -u option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Update the file
/etc/dumpdates after a successful dump. The format of
/etc/dumpdates is readable by people, consisting of one free
format record per line: filesystem name, <br>
increment level and ctime(3) format dump date followed by a
rfc822 timezone specification (see the -u option for
details). If no timezone offset is specified, times are <br>
interpreted as local. Whenever the file is written, all
dates in the file are converted to the local time zone,
without changing the UTC times. There may be only one entry
<br>
per filesystem at each level. The file /etc/dumpdates may be
edited to change any of the fields, if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v The -v (verbose) makes dump
to print extra information which could be helpful in debug
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Dump tells the operator what
file systems need to be dumped. This information is gleaned
from the files /etc/dumpdates and /etc/fstab. The -W option
causes dump to print <br>
out, for all file systems in /etc/dumpdates , and recognized
file systems in /etc/mtab and /etc/fstab. the most recent
dump date and level, and highlights those that <br>
should be dumped. If the -W option is set, all other options
are ignored, and dump exits immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Is like -W, but prints only
recognized filesystems in /etc/mtab and /etc/fstab which
need to be dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Compress every block to be
written to the tape using the lzo library. This
doesn&rsquo;t compress as well as the zlib library but
it&rsquo;s much faster. This option will work only <br>
when dumping to a file or pipe or, when dumping to a tape
drive, if the tape drive is capable of writing variable
length blocks. You will need at least the 0.4b34 version
<br>
of restore in order to extract compressed tapes. Tapes
written using compression will not be compatible with the
BSD tape format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zcompression level <br>
Compress every block to be written on the tape using zlib
library. This option will work only when dumping to a file
or pipe or, when dumping to a tape drive, if the tape <br>
drive is capable of writing variable length blocks. You will
need at least the 0.4b22 version of restore in order to
extract compressed tapes. Tapes written using compres&acirc;
<br>
sion will not be compatible with the BSD tape format. The
(optional) parameter specifies the compression level zlib
will use. The default compression level is 2. If the <br>
optional parameter is specified, there should be no white
space between the option letter and the parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump requires operator
intervention on these conditions: end of tape, end of dump,
tape write error, tape open error or disk read error (if
there is more than a threshold of nr <br>
errors). In addition to alerting all operators implied by
the -n key, dump interacts with the operator on dump&rsquo;s
control terminal at times when dump can no longer proceed,
or if <br>
something is grossly wrong. All questions dump poses must be
answered by typing &acirc;yes&acirc; or &acirc;no&acirc;,
appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since making a dump involves a
lot of time and effort for full dumps, dump checkpoints
itself at the start of each tape volume. If writing that
volume fails for some reason, dump <br>
will, with operator permission, restart itself from the
checkpoint after the old tape has been rewound and removed,
and a new tape has been mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump tells the operator what is
going on at periodic intervals, including usually low
estimates of the number of blocks to write, the number of
tapes it will take, the time to <br>
completion, and the time to the tape change. The output is
verbose, so that others know that the terminal controlling
dump is busy, and will be for some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the event of a catastrophic
disk event, the time required to restore all the necessary
backup tapes or files to disk can be kept to a minimum by
staggering the incremental <br>
dumps. An efficient method of staggering incremental dumps
to minimize the number of tapes follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc; Always start with a
level 0 backup, for example: <br>
/sbin/dump -0u -f /dev/st0 /usr/src</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should be done at set
intervals, say once a month or once every two months, and on
a set of fresh tapes that is saved forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc; After a level 0, dumps
of active file systems are taken on a daily basis, with this
sequence of dump levels: <br>
3 2 5 4 7 6 9 8 9 9 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the daily dumps, it should
be possible to use a fixed number of tapes for each day,
used on a weekly basis. Each week, a level 1 dump is taken,
and the daily Hanoi <br>
sequence repeats beginning with 3. For weekly dumps, another
fixed set of tapes per dumped file system is used, also on a
cyclical basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After several months or so, the
daily and weekly tapes should get rotated out of the dump
cycle and fresh tapes brought in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another backup strategy is the
Tower of Hanoi sequence, which reuses older tapes in a way
that for newer dates the available restore points are more
frequent, then for older <br>
dates (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme for
additional information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The 4.3BSD option syntax is
implemented for backward compatibility but is not documented
here.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TAPE If no -f option was specified, dump will use the device
specified via TAPE as the dump device. TAPE may be of the
form tapename, host:tapename, or user@host:tapename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RMT The environment variable RMT
will be used to determine the pathname of the remote rmt(8)
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSH Dump uses the contents of
this variable to determine the name of the remote shell
command to use when doing remote backups (rsh, ssh etc.). If
this variable is not set, <br>
rcmd(3) will be used, but only root will be able to do
remote backups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Many, and verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The format of the /etc/dumpdates file has changed in release
0.4b34, however, the file will be read correctly with either
pre-0.4b34 or 0.4b34 and later versions of dump provided
<br>
that the machine on which dump is run did not change
timezones (which should be a fairly rare occurrence).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Dump exits with zero status on success. Startup errors are
indicated with an exit code of 1; abnormal termination is
indicated with an exit code of 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It might be considered a bug that this version of dump can
only handle ext2/3/4 filesystems. Specifically, it does not
work with FAT filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fewer than 32 read errors
(change this with -I) on the filesystem are ignored. If
noticing read errors is important, the output from dump can
be parsed to look for lines that <br>
contain the text &rsquo;read error&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a read error occurs, dump
prints out the corresponding physical disk block and sector
number and the ext2/3/4 logical block number. It
doesn&rsquo;t print out the corresponding <br>
file name or even the inode number. The user has to use
debugfs(8), commands ncheck and icheck to translate the
ext2blk number printed out by dump into an inode number,
then into <br>
a file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each reel requires a new
process, so parent processes for reels already written just
hang around until the entire tape is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The estimated number of tapes is
not correct if compression is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It would be nice if dump knew
about the dump sequence, kept track of the tapes scribbled
on, told the operator which tape to mount when, and provided
more assistance for the <br>
operator running restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump cannot do remote backups
without being run as root, due to its security history.
Presently, it works if you set it setuid (like it used to
be), but this might constitute a <br>
security risk. Note that you can set RSH to use a remote
shell program instead.</p>
