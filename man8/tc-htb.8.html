<p>HTB(8) Linux HTB(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
HTB - Hierarchy Token Bucket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tc qdisc ... dev dev ( parent classid | root) [ handle
major: ] htb [ default minor-id ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc class ... dev dev parent
major:[minor] [ classid major:minor ] htb rate rate [ ceil
rate ] burst bytes [ cburst bytes ] [ prio priority ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
HTB is meant as a more understandable and intuitive
replacement for the CBQ qdisc in Linux. Both CBQ and HTB
help you to control the use of the outbound bandwidth on a
given <br>
link. Both allow you to use one physical link to simulate
several slower links and to send different kinds of traffic
on different simulated links. In both cases, you have to
<br>
specify how to divide the physical link into simulated links
and how to decide which simulated link to use for a given
packet to be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike CBQ, HTB shapes traffic
based on the Token Bucket Filter algorithm which does not
depend on interface characteristics and so does not need to
know the underlying bandwidth <br>
of the outgoing interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHAPING ALGORITHM <br>
Shaping works as documented in tc-tbf (8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSIFICATION <br>
Within the one HTB instance many classes may exist. Each of
these classes contains another qdisc, by default
tc-pfifo(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When enqueueing a packet, HTB
starts at the root and uses various methods to determine
which class should receive the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the absence of uncommon
configuration options, the process is rather easy. At each
node we look for an instruction, and then go to the class
the instruction refers us to. If <br>
the class found is a barren leaf-node (without children), we
enqueue the packet there. If it is not yet a leaf node, we
do the whole thing over again starting from that node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following actions are
performed, in order at each node we visit, until one sends
us to another node, or terminates the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i) Consult filters attached to
the class. If sent to a leafnode, we are done. Otherwise,
restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(ii) If none of the above
returned with an instruction, enqueue at this node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This algorithm makes sure that a
packet always ends up somewhere, even while you are busy
building your configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINK SHARING ALGORITHM <br>
FIXME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QDISC <br>
The root of a HTB qdisc class tree has the following
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parent major:minor | root <br>
This mandatory parameter determines the place of the HTB
instance, either at the root of an interface or within an
existing class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">handle major: <br>
Like all other qdiscs, the HTB can be assigned a handle.
Should consist only of a major number, followed by a colon.
Optional, but very useful if classes will be generated <br>
within this qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default minor-id <br>
Unclassified traffic gets sent to the class with this
minor-id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSES <br>
Classes have a host of parameters to configure their
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parent major:minor <br>
Place of this class within the hierarchy. If attached
directly to a qdisc and not to another class, minor can be
omitted. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classid major:minor <br>
Like qdiscs, classes can be named. The major number must be
equal to the major number of the qdisc to which it belongs.
Optional, but needed if this class is going to have <br>
children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prio priority <br>
In the round-robin process, classes with the lowest priority
field are tried for packets first. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rate rate <br>
Maximum rate this class and all its children are guaranteed.
Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ceil rate <br>
Maximum rate at which a class can send, if its parent has
bandwidth to spare. Defaults to the configured rate, which
implies no borrowing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">burst bytes <br>
Amount of bytes that can be burst at ceil speed, in excess
of the configured rate. Should be at least as high as the
highest burst of all children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cburst bytes <br>
Amount of bytes that can be burst at &rsquo;infinite&rsquo;
speed, in other words, as fast as the interface can transmit
them. For perfect evening out, should be equal to at most
one <br>
average packet. Should be at least as high as the highest
cburst of all children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Due to Unix timing constraints, the maximum ceil rate is not
infinite and may in fact be quite low. On Intel, there are
100 timer events per second, the maximum rate is that rate
<br>
at which &rsquo;burst&rsquo; bytes are sent each timer tick.
From this, the minimum burst size for a specified rate can
be calculated. For i386, a 10mbit rate requires a 12
kilobyte burst <br>
as 100*12kb*8 equals 10mbit.</p>
