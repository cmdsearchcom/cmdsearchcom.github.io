<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sendinpaths - Send Usenet Path: statistics via e-mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sendinpaths [-cdhn] [-k keep-days] [-r report-days] [address
[address ...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sendinpaths checks pathlog/path for ninpaths dump files,
finds dump files generated in the past report-days days,
makes sure they are valid by running ninpaths on each one
and <br>
making sure the exit status is zero, and passes them to
ninpaths to generate a cumulative report. By default, that
report is mailed to the e-mail addresses configured at the
<br>
beginning of this script (by default, only one address is
configured: &lt;top1000@anthologeek.net&gt;) in order to
supply the TOP1000 project with useful statistics. See <br>
&lt;http://top1000.anthologeek.net/&gt; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When finished, sendinpaths
deletes all dump files in pathlog/path that are older than
keep-days days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on how to
set up ninpaths, see ninpaths(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c When this flag is used, the report is also e-mailed,
besides the default submission addresses or those given as
command-line arguments, to the newsmaster&rsquo;s address
set at <br>
configure time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enables debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Gives usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keep-days <br>
After having processed dump files, sendinpaths removes those
that are older than keep-days days. The default is 0, that
is to say to remove all dump files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting keep-days to another
value can be useful for debugging purpose because it permits
to keep a few dump files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Don&rsquo;t e-mail the
report; instead, just print it to standard output.
Don&rsquo;t delete old dump files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r report-days <br>
Process dump files generated during the last report-days
days. The default is 32, that is to say to process all the
dump files that have been generated during the last 32 <br>
days (if, of course, they have not been deleted yet by a
previous run of sendinpaths according to the value set by
the -k flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address ... <br>
E-mail the report to the mentioned address or addresses,
instead of the default one. Several addresses can be used,
separated by whitespace (sending the e-mail to your own <br>
e-mail address can be useful for debugging purpose, to check
that everything works fine). For instance, for two
addresses:</p>
