<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tcpick is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track
tcp streams and saves the data captured in different files,
each for every connection, or displays them in the terminal
<br>
in different formats (hexdump, printable charachters,
raw...) Useful for picking files in a passive way. It is
useful to keep track of what users of a network are doing,
and is <br>
usable with textmode tools like grep, sed, awk. Happy data
hunting :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASE OPTIONS <br>
-i --interface interface <br>
listen on selected interface, (i.e. ppp0 or eth0). If option
-i is omitted, tcpick is able to select the first open
interface (usually a ethernet card).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r --readfile <br>
reads raw packets from a file written with tcpdump -w
instead of using a network device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;filter&quot; <br>
This is the filter for the capturer engine. You can set it
in the same way of setting the tcpdump(1) filter. Read
tcpdump(1) manpage for other explanations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Displays host names instead
of ip addresses. Warning: for every new ip grabbed a dns
query will be generated! Use it carefully on high-traffic
network devices!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C --colors <br>
Uses terminal colors: very nice! It should help you to read
the output of tcpick</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D number --dirs number <br>
Create directories to store sniffed sessions. When a
directory contains number sessions, a new one will be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e count <br>
Exits when count packets have been sniffed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E number <br>
Exit when number sniffed connections are detected as
&quot;CLOSED&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ef number <br>
Exit when the first number connections are detected as
&quot;CLOSED&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F1 -F2 --filenaming 1|2 <br>
Choose the filenaming system. <br>
-F1 : tcpick_clientip_serverip.side.dat <br>
(side means clnt, serv or both) <br>
-F2 : tcpick_connectionnumber_clientip_serverip.side.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Shows source and destination
ip and port; shows tcp flags as letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Displays a short help
summary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Don&rsquo;t put the network
interface in promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might
be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Suppresses the &quot;status
of the connection&quot; banner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--separator <br>
Add a separator for the payloads displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Adds timestamp in
hour:minutes:seconds:microseconds format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-td Like -t with date timestamp
in day-month-year format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T number <br>
Track number connections. It could be very useful on a
high-traffic network device. If number is not specified, it
will be set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tf number <br>
Track only the first number connections; the following will
be discarded. If number is not specified, it will be set to
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbosity <br>
Quite unuseful, yet. Set verbosity level. Actually there are
not really many extra messages to display, this means it is
enabled by default (-v1). Set verbosity level to <br>
0 to suppress extra messages (-v0) except error messages.
Set verbosity level to 5 to display debug messages (-v5).
There are not other verbosity levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X timeout <br>
Connections are considered EXPIRED when there is no traffic
for at least timeout seconds. Default is 600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Displays the tcpick version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY THE DATA IN THE TCP
PACKETS <br>
These options are prefixed by -y and are useful to display
in various ways the content of the packet sniffed (the data,
called payload), once it arrives at the listening
inter&acirc; <br>
face. In that way the tcp duplicates will be not discarded
and the packets will not be reordered, but displayed
&quot;as is&quot;. If you want a fully acknowledged stream,
see the -w and <br>
-b set of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yH View data in
hexadecimal-spaced mode (for the hexdump see -yx and -yX
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yP Shows data contained in the
tcp packets. Non-printable charachters are transformed in
dots: &quot;.&quot;. Newline character is preserved. This is
the best way, in my opinion to <br>
show data like HTTP requests, IRC communication, SMTP stuff
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yR Displays all kind of
charachters, printable and non printable. If something
binary is transmitted, the effect will probably be like
watching with &quot;cat&quot; at a gzipped file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yx Shows all data after the
header in hexadecimal dump of 16 bytes per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yX Shows all data after the
header in hexadecimal and ascii dump with 16 bytes per
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yU Shows all data after the
header, but Unprintable charachters are displayed as
hexadecimal values between a &quot;&lt;&quot; and a
&quot;&gt;&quot; symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REBUILD AND WRITE THE TCP STREAM
TO FILE <br>
The prefix for these options is -w. The TCP stream that has
been sniffed with these options will be written to file
named: <br>

client_&lt;ip_client&gt;_&lt;ip_server&gt;_&lt;port_server&gt;.tcpick
and <br>

server_&lt;ip_client&gt;_&lt;ip_server&gt;_&lt;port_server&gt;.tcpick
<br>
With the u flag of the -w option (i.e. -wRu) both client and
server data will be written to a unique file named in that
way: <br>

&lt;ip_client&gt;_&lt;ip_server&gt;_&lt;port_server&gt;.tcpick
<br>
If you use the additional flag b of the -w option (i.e.
-wPub), in the file will be written this banner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[client|server] offset
before:offset after (lenght of rebuilded segment)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to distinguish between client
and server data. <br>
The flow is rebuilded, reordered and the duplicates are
dropped. In that way it is possible to sniff entire files
transmitted via ftp without data corruption (you can see
this <br>
with md5sum). If no argument is given to -w the data will be
written like -wR You can decide to write only client or
server data by setting the flag <br>
C (output only client data) and S (output only server data)
to the -w set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wR This is the preferred
option: data will be written without any changes. Useful for
sniffing binary or compressed files. <br>
(-wRC only the client, -wRS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wP Unprintable charachters are
written like dots. <br>
(-wPC only the client, -wPS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wU Unprintable charachters are
displayed as hexadecimal values between a &quot;&lt;&quot;
and a &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol. <br>
(-wPC only the client, -wPS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wH The flow is written in
hexadecimal-spaced mode. <br>
(-wHC only the client, -wHS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY THE REBUILDED TCP STREAM
<br>
The prefix for these options is -b. This set of options is
very useful if you want to redirect the sniffed flow to
anoter program with a pipe, and there should be no data
cor&acirc; <br>
ruption. Of course the most useful is -bR to show the data
as they are (raw). A very useful feature is the flag C
(output only client data) and S (output only server data).
<br>
I.e.: -bRC will display only the data from the client in raw
mode; in that way you can put them in a file with a pipe
redirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sub-options are quite the
same of the -y set, so you have:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bH hex-spaced <br>
(-bHC only the client, -bHS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bP unprintable displayed as
dots <br>
(-bPC only the client, -bPS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bR raw mode <br>
(-bRC only the client, -bRS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bU unprintable as &lt;hex&gt;.
<br>
(-bUC only the client, -bUS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bx hexdump <br>
(-bxC only the client, -bxS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bU hexdump + ascii <br>
(-bXC only the client, -bXS only the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-PC --pipe client <br>
This is an alias for -bRC -S -v0 -Tf1 -Ef1. With this option
you are able to track only the first connection (-T1)
matched by tcpick and data are displayed as raw. Only <br>
data from the client are put on stdout. All messages and
banners are suppressed, except error messages (-S -v0), so
this option is particulary useful to download an entire <br>
fully rebuilded and acknowledged connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-PS --pipe server <br>
This is an alias for -bRS -S -v0 -Tf1 -Ef1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
how to display the connection status: <br>
# tcpick -i eth0 -C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display the payload and packet
headers: <br>
# tcpick -i eth0 -C -yP -h -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display client data only of the
first smtp connection: <br>
# tcpick -i eth0 -C -bCU -T1 &quot;port 25&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download a file passively: <br>
# tcpick -i eth0 -wR &quot;port ftp-data&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log http data in unique files
(client and server mixed together): <br>
# tcpick -i eth0 &quot;port 80&quot; -wRub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redirect the first connection to
a software: <br>
# tcpick -i eth0 --pipe client &quot;port 80&quot; | gzip
&gt; http_response.gz <br>
# tcpick -i eth0 --pipe server &quot;port 25&quot; | nc
foobar.net 25</p>
