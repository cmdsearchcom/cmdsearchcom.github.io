<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge. It
  is a large program with very many facilities. For a full specification, see
  the reference manual. This man page contains only a description of the command
  line options. It has been automatically generated from the reference manual
  source, hopefully without too much mangling.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like other MTAs, Exim replaces Sendmail, and is normally called by user agents
  (MUAs) using the path <i>/usr/sbin/sendmail</i> when they submit messages for
  delivery (some operating systems use <i>/usr/lib/sendmail</i>). This path is
  normally set up as a symbolic link to the Exim binary. It may also be used by
  boot scripts to start the Exim daemon. Many of Exim's command line options are
  compatible with Sendmail so that it can act as a drop-in replacement.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEFAULT_ACTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFAULT_ACTION">DEFAULT
  ACTION</a></h1>
If no options are present that require a specific action (such as starting the
  daemon or a queue runner, testing an address, receiving a message in a
  specific format, or listing the queue), and there are no arguments on the
  command line, Exim outputs a brief message about itself and exits.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, if there is at least one command line argument, <b>-bm</b> (accept a
  local message on the standard input, with the arguments specifying the
  recipients) is assumed. Thus, for example, if Exim is installed in
  <i>/usr/sbin</i>, you can send a message from the command line like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /usr/sbin/exim4 -i &lt;recipient-address(es)&gt;
<br/>
 &lt;message content, including all the header lines&gt;
<br/>
 CTRL-D
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-i</b> option prevents a line containing just a dot from terminating the
  message. Only an end-of-file (generated by typing CTRL-D if the input is from
  a terminal) does so.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SETTING_OPTIONS_BY_PROGRAM_NAME"><a class="selflink" href="#SETTING_OPTIONS_BY_PROGRAM_NAME">SETTING

If an Exim binary is called using one of the names listed in this section
  (typically via a symbolic link), certain options are assumed.

      <b>rmail</b> is used as an interface by some UUCP systems. The <b>-i</b>
      option specifies that a dot on a line by itself does not terminate a

      called with the <b>-bi</b> option.</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bd</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option runs Exim as a daemon, awaiting incoming SMTP
      connections. Usually the <b>-bd</b> option is combined with the
      <b>-q</b>&lt; <i>time</i>&gt; option, to specify that the daemon should
      also initiate periodic queue runs.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-bd</b> option can be used only by an admin user. If either of the
      <b>-d</b> (debugging) or <b>-v</b> (verifying) options are set, the daemon
      does not disconnect from the controlling terminal. When running this way,
      it can be stopped by pressing ctrl-C.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By default, Exim listens for incoming connections to the standard SMTP port
      on all the host's running interfaces. However, it is possible to listen on
      other ports, on multiple ports, and only on specific interfaces.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When a listening daemon is started without the use of <b>-oX</b> (that is,
      without overriding the normal configuration), it writes its process id to
      a file called /var/run/exim4/exim.pid. This location can be overridden by
      setting PID_FILE_PATH in Local/Makefile. The file is written while Exim is
      still running as root.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <b>-oX</b> is used on the command line to start a listening daemon, the
      process id is not written to the normal pid file path. However, <b>-oP</b>
      can be used to specify a path on the command line if a pid file is
      required.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The SIGHUP signal can be used to cause the daemon to re-execute itself. This
      should be done whenever Exim's configuration file, or any file that is
      incorporated into it by means of the <b>.include</b> facility, is changed,
      and also whenever a new version of Exim is installed. It is not necessary
      to do this when other files that are referenced from the configuration
      (for example, alias files) are changed, because these are reread each time
      they are used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bdf</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option has the same effect as <b>-bd</b> except that
      it never disconnects from the controlling terminal, even when no debugging
      is specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-be</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Run Exim in expansion testing mode. Exim discards its root
      privilege, to prevent ordinary users from using this mode to read
      otherwise inaccessible files. If no arguments are given, Exim runs
      interactively, prompting for lines of data. Otherwise, it processes each
      argument in turn.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If Exim was built with USE_READLINE=yes in Local/Makefile, it tries to load
      the <b>libreadline</b> library dynamically whenever the <b>-be</b> option
      is used without command line arguments. If successful, it uses the
      readline() function, which provides extensive line-editing facilities, for
      reading the test data. A line history is supported.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Long expansion expressions can be split over several lines by using
      backslash continuations. As in Exim's run time configuration, white space
      at the start of continuation lines is ignored. Each argument or data line
      is passed through the string expansion mechanism, and the result is
      output. Variable values from the configuration file (for example,
      <i>$qualify_domain</i>) are available, but no message-specific values
      (such as <i>$message_exim_id</i>) are set, because no message is being
      processed (but see <b>-bem</b> and <b>-Mset</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Note</b>: If you use this mechanism to test lookups, and you change the
      data files or databases you are using, you must exit and restart Exim
      before trying the same lookup again. Otherwise, because each Exim process
      caches the results of lookups, you will just get the same result as
      before.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bem</b> &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option operates like <b>-be</b> except that it must be
      followed by the name of a file. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -bem /tmp/testmessage
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The file is read as a message (as if receiving a locally-submitted non-SMTP
      message) before any of the test expansions are done. Thus,
      message-specific variables such as <i>$message_size</i> and
      <i>$header_from:</i> are available. However, no <i>Received:</i> header is
      added to the message. If the <b>-t</b> option is set, recipients are read
      from the headers in the normal way, and are shown in the
      <i>$recipients</i> variable. Note that recipients cannot be given on the
      command line, because further arguments are taken as strings to expand
      (just like <b>-be</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bF</b> &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is the same as <b>-bf</b> except that it
      assumes that the filter being tested is a system filter. The additional
      commands that are available only in system filters are recognized.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bf</b> &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option runs Exim in user filter testing mode; the file
      is the filter file to be tested, and a test message must be supplied on
      the standard input. If there are no message-dependent tests in the filter,
      an empty file can be supplied.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you want to test a system filter file, use <b>-bF</b> instead of
      <b>-bf</b>. You can use both <b>-bF</b> and <b>-bf</b> on the same
      command, in order to test a system filter and a user filter in the same
      run. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -bF /system/filter -bf /user/filter &lt;/test/message
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is helpful when the system filter adds header lines or sets filter
      variables that are used by the user filter.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the test filter file does not begin with one of the special lines
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     # Exim filter
    <br/>
     # Sieve filter
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    it is taken to be a normal .forward file, and is tested for validity under
      that interpretation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The result of an Exim command that uses <b>-bf</b>, provided no errors are
      detected, is a list of the actions that Exim would try to take if
      presented with the message for real. More details of filter testing are
      given in the separate document entitled <i>Exim's interfaces to mail
      filtering</i>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When testing a filter file, the envelope sender can be set by the <b>-f</b>
      option, or by a &quot;From &quot; line at the start of the test message.
      Various parameters that would normally be taken from the envelope
      recipient address of the message can be set by means of additional command
      line options (see the next four options).</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bh</b> &lt;<i>IP address</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option runs a fake SMTP session as if from the given
      IP address, using the standard input and output. The IP address may
      include a port number at the end, after a full stop. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -bh 10.9.8.7.1234
    <br/>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When an IPv6 address is given, it is converted into canonical form. In the
      case of the second example above, the value of <i>$sender_host_address</i>
      after conversion to the canonical form is
      fe80:0000:0000:0a00:20ff:fe86:a061.5678.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Comments as to what is going on are written to the standard error file.
      These include lines beginning with &quot;LOG&quot; for anything that would
      have been logged. This facility is provided for testing configuration
      options for incoming messages, to make sure they implement the required
      policy. For example, you can test your relay controls using <b>-bh</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Warning 1</b>: You can test features of the configuration that rely on
      ident (RFC 1413) information by using the <b>-oMt</b> option. However,
      Exim cannot actually perform an ident callout when testing using
      <b>-bh</b> because there is no incoming SMTP connection.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Warning 2</b>: Address verification callouts are also skipped when
      testing using <b>-bh</b>. If you want these callouts to occur, use
      <b>-bhc</b> instead.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Messages supplied during the testing session are discarded, and nothing is
      written to any of the real log files. There may be pauses when DNS (and
      other) lookups are taking place, and of course these may time out. The
      <b>-oMi</b> option can be used to specify a specific IP interface and port
      if this is important, and <b>-oMaa</b> and <b>-oMai</b> can be used to set
      parameters as if the SMTP session were authenticated.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>exim_checkaccess</i> utility is a &quot;packaged&quot; version of
      <b>-bh</b> whose output just states whether a given recipient address from
      a given host is acceptable or not.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Features such as authentication and encryption, where the client input is
      not plain text, cannot easily be tested with <b>-bh</b>. Instead, you
      should use a specialized SMTP test program such as <b>swaks</b>.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">This debugging option causes Exim to scan the given file or
      directory (depending on the used scanner interface), using the malware
      scanning framework. The option of <b>av_scanner</b> influences this
      option, so if <b>av_scanner</b>'s value is dependent upon an expansion
      then the expansion should have defaults which apply to this invocation.
      ACLs are not invoked, so if <b>av_scanner</b> references an ACL variable
      then that variable will never be populated and <b>-bmalware</b> will fail.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Exim will have changed working directory before resolving the filename, so
      using fully qualified pathnames is advisable. Exim will be running as the
      Exim user when it tries to open the file, rather than as the invoking
      user. This option requires admin privileges.

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bnq</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, Exim automatically qualifies unqualified
      addresses (those without domains) that appear in messages that are
      submitted locally (that is, not over TCP/IP). This qualification applies
      both to addresses in envelopes, and addresses in header lines. Sender
      addresses are qualified using <b>qualify_domain</b>, and recipient
      addresses using <b>qualify_recipient</b> (which defaults to the value of
      <b>qualify_domain</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Sometimes, qualification is not wanted. For example, if <b>-bS</b> (batch
      SMTP) is being used to re-submit messages that originally came from remote
      hosts after content scanning, you probably do not want to qualify
      unqualified addresses in header lines. (Such lines will be present only if
      you have not enabled a header syntax check in the appropriate ACL.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-bnq</b> option suppresses all qualification of unqualified addresses
      in messages that originate on the local host. When this is used,
      unqualified addresses in the envelope provoke errors (causing message
      rejection) and unqualified addresses in header lines are left alone.</dd>

      (in this case 25 minutes), the size of the message (2.9K), the unique
      local identifier for the message, and the message sender, as contained in
      the envelope. For bounce messages, the sender address is empty, and
      appears as &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;. If the message was submitted locally by
      an untrusted user who overrode the default sender address, the user's
      login name is shown in parentheses before the sender address.

  <dd class="It-tag">This option is for testing retry rules, and it must be
      followed by up to three arguments. It causes Exim to look for a retry rule
      that matches the values and to write it to the standard output. For
      example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -brt bach.comp.mus.example
    <br/>
     Retry rule: *.comp.mus.example F,2h,15m; F,4d,30m;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     The first argument, which is required, can be a complete address in the
      form <i>local_part@domain</i>, or it can be just a domain name. If the
      second argument contains a dot, it is interpreted as an optional second
      domain name; if no retry rule is found for the first argument, the second
      is tried. This ties in with Exim's behaviour when looking for retry rules
      for remote hosts - if no rule is found that matches the host, one that
      matches the mail domain is sought. Finally, an argument that is the name
      of a specific delivery error, as used in setting up retry rules, can be
      given. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -brt haydn.comp.mus.example quota_3d

      must be followed by a single argument, consisting of either a local part

      it might appear.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bS</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is used for batched SMTP input, which is an
      alternative interface for non-interactive local message submission. A
      number of messages can be submitted in a single run. However, despite its
      name, this is not really SMTP input. Exim reads each message's envelope
      from SMTP commands on the standard input, but generates no responses. If
      the caller is trusted, or <b>untrusted_set_sender</b> is set, the senders
      in the SMTP MAIL commands are believed; otherwise the sender is always the
      caller of Exim.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The message itself is read from the standard input, in SMTP format (leading
      dots doubled), terminated by a line containing just a single dot. An error
      is provoked if the terminating dot is missing. A further message may then
      follow.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As for other local message submissions, the contents of incoming batch SMTP
      messages can be checked using the non-SMTP ACL. Unqualified addresses are
      automatically qualified using <b>qualify_domain</b> and
      <b>qualify_recipient</b>, as appropriate, unless the <b>-bnq</b> option is
      used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Some other SMTP commands are recognized in the input. HELO and EHLO act as
      RSET; VRFY, EXPN, ETRN, and HELP act as NOOP; QUIT quits, ignoring the
      rest of the standard input.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If any error is encountered, reports are written to the standard output and
      error streams, and Exim gives up immediately. The return code is 0 if no
      error was detected; it is 1 if one or more messages were accepted before
      the error was detected; otherwise it is 2.

      Some user agents use this interface as a way of passing locally-generated
      messages to the MTA.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In this usage, if the caller of Exim is trusted, or
      <b>untrusted_set_sender</b> is set, the senders of messages are taken from
      the SMTP MAIL commands. Otherwise the content of these commands is ignored
      and the sender is set up as the calling user. Unqualified addresses are

      used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-bs</b> option is also used to run Exim from <i>inetd</i>, as an
      alternative to using a listening daemon. Exim can distinguish the two
      cases by checking whether the standard input is a TCP/IP socket. When Exim
      is called from <i>inetd</i>, the source of the mail is assumed to be
      remote, and the comments above concerning senders and qualification do not
      apply. In this situation, Exim behaves in exactly the same way as it does
      when receiving a message via the listening daemon.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">This option runs Exim in address testing mode, in which

      fails, and the caller is not an admin user, no details of the failure are
      output, because these might contain sensitive information such as
      usernames and passwords for database lookups.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each address is handled as if it were the recipient address of a message
      (compare the <b>-bv</b> option). It is passed to the routers and the
      result is written to the standard output. However, any router that has
      <b>no_address_test</b> set is bypassed. This can make <b>-bt</b> easier to
      use for genuine routing tests if your first router passes everything to a
      scanner program.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The return code is 2 if any address failed outright; it is 1 if no address
      failed outright but at least one could not be resolved for some reason.
      Return code 0 is given only when all addresses succeed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Note</b>: When actually delivering a message, Exim removes duplicate
      recipient addresses after routing is complete, so that only one delivery
      takes place. This does not happen when testing with <b>-bt</b>; the full
      results of routing are always shown.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Warning</b>: <b>-bt</b> can only do relatively simple testing. If any of
      the routers in the configuration makes any tests on the sender address of
      a message, you can use the <b>-f</b> option to set an appropriate sender
      when running <b>-bt</b> tests. Without it, the sender is assumed to be the
      calling user at the default qualifying domain. However, if you have set up
      (for example) routers whose behaviour depends on the contents of an
      incoming message, you cannot test those conditions using <b>-bt</b>. The
      <b>-N</b> option provides a possible way of doing such tests.</dd>

    As part of its operation, <b>-bV</b> causes Exim to read and syntax check
      its configuration file. However, this is a static check only. It cannot
      check values that are to be expanded. For example, although a misspelt ACL
      verb is detected, an error in the verb's arguments is not. You cannot rely

    Verification differs from address testing (the <b>-bt</b> option) in that
      routers that have <b>no_verify</b> set are skipped, and if the address is
      accepted by a router that has <b>fail_verify</b> set, verification fails.
      The address is verified as a recipient if <b>-bv</b> is used; to test
      verification for a sender address, <b>-bvs</b> should be used.

    If the <b>-v</b> option is not set, the output consists of a single line for
      each address, stating whether it was verified or not, and giving a reason
      in the latter case. Without <b>-v</b>, generating more than one address by
      redirection causes verification to end successfully, without considering
      the generated addresses. However, if just one address is generated,
      processing continues, and the generated address must verify successfully
      for the overall verification to succeed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <b>-v</b> is set, more details are given of how the address has been
      handled, and in the case of address redirection, all the generated

      this case, the first file that exists is used. Failure to open an existing
      file stops Exim from proceeding any further along the list, and an error
      is generated.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When this option is used by a caller other than root, and the list is
      different from the compiled-in list, Exim gives up its root privilege
      immediately, and runs with the real and effective uid and gid set to those
      of the caller. However, if a TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST file is defined in
      Local/Makefile, that file contains a list of full pathnames, one per line,
      for configuration files which are trusted. Root privilege is retained for
      any configuration file so listed, as long as the caller is the Exim user
      (or the user specified in the CONFIGURE_OWNER option, if any), and as long
      as the configuration file is not writeable by inappropriate users or
      groups.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Leaving TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST unset precludes the possibility of testing a
      configuration using <b>-C</b> right through message reception and
      delivery, even if the caller is root. The reception works, but by that
      time, Exim is running as the Exim user, so when it re-executes to regain
      privilege for the delivery, the use of <b>-C</b> causes privilege to be
      lost. However, root can test reception and delivery using two separate
      commands (one to put a message on the queue, using <b>-odq</b>, and
      another to do the delivery, using <b>-M</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If ALT_CONFIG_PREFIX is defined in Local/Makefile, it specifies a prefix
      string with which any file named in a <b>-C</b> command line option must
      start. In addition, the file name must not contain the sequence /../.
      However, if the value of the <b>-C</b> option is identical to the value of
      CONFIGURE_FILE in Local/Makefile, Exim ignores <b>-C</b> and proceeds as
      usual. There is no default setting for ALT_CONFIG_PREFIX; when it is
      unset, any file name can be used with <b>-C</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    ALT_CONFIG_PREFIX can be used to confine alternative configuration files to
      a directory to which only root has access. This prevents someone who has
      broken into the Exim account from running a privileged Exim with an
      arbitrary configuration file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-C</b> facility is useful for ensuring that configuration files are
      syntactically correct, but cannot be used for test deliveries, unless the
      caller is privileged, or unless it is an exotic configuration that does
      not require privilege. No check is made on the owner or group of the files
      specified by this option.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b>&lt;<i>macro</i>&gt;=&lt;<i>value</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option can be used to override macro definitions in
      the configuration file. However, like <b>-C</b>, if it is used by an
      unprivileged caller, it causes Exim to give up its root privilege. If
      DISABLE_D_OPTION is defined in Local/Makefile, the use of <b>-D</b> is
      completely disabled, and its use causes an immediate error exit.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If WHITELIST_D_MACROS is defined in Local/Makefile then it should be a
      colon-separated list of macros which are considered safe and, if <b>-D</b>
      only supplies macros from this list, and the values are acceptable, then
      Exim will not give up root privilege if the caller is root, the Exim
      run-time user, or the CONFIGURE_OWNER, if set. This is a transition
      mechanism and is expected to be removed in the future. Acceptable values
      for the macros satisfy the regexp: ^[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]*$
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The entire option (including equals sign if present) must all be within one
      command line item. <b>-D</b> can be used to set the value of a macro to
      the empty string, in which case the equals sign is optional. These two
      commands are synonymous:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -DABC ...
    <br/>
     exim4 -DABC= ...
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To include spaces in a macro definition item, quotes must be used. If you
      use quotes, spaces are permitted around the macro name and the equals
      sign. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 '-D ABC = something' ...
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>-D</b> may be repeated up to 10 times on a command line. Only macro
      names up to 22 letters long can be set.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b>&lt;<i>debug options</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option causes debugging information to be written to
      the standard error stream. It is restricted to admin users because
      debugging output may show database queries that contain password
      information. Also, the details of users' filter files should be protected.
      If a non-admin user uses <b>-d</b>, Exim writes an error message to the
      standard error stream and exits with a non-zero return code.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <b>-d</b> is used, <b>-v</b> is assumed. If <b>-d</b> is given on its
      own, a lot of standard debugging data is output. This can be reduced, or
      increased to include some more rarely needed information, by directly
      following <b>-d</b> with a string made up of names preceded by plus or
      minus characters. These add or remove sets of debugging data,
      respectively. For example, <b>-d+filter</b> adds filter debugging, whereas
      <b>-d-all+filter</b> selects only filter debugging. Note that no spaces
      are allowed in the debug setting. The available debugging categories are:

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The all option excludes memory when used as +all, but includes it for -all.
      The reason for this is that +all is something that people tend to use when
      generating debug output for Exim maintainers. If +memory is included, an
      awful lot of output that is very rarely of interest is generated, so it
      now has to be explicitly requested. However, -all does turn everything
      off.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The resolver option produces output only if the DNS resolver was compiled
      with DEBUG enabled. This is not the case in some operating systems. Also,
      unfortunately, debugging output from the DNS resolver is written to stdout
      rather than stderr.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default ( <b>-d</b> with no argument) omits expand, filter, interface,
      load, memory, pid, resolver, and timestamp. However, the pid selector is
      forced when debugging is turned on for a daemon, which then passes it on
      to any re-executed Exims. Exim also automatically adds the pid to debug
      lines when several remote deliveries are run in parallel.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The timestamp selector causes the current time to be inserted at the start
      of all debug output lines. This can be useful when trying to track down
      delays in processing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the <b>debug_print</b> option is set in any driver, it produces output

      option, the user's <i>gecos</i> entry from the password data is used. As
      users are generally permitted to alter their <i>gecos</i> entries, no
      security considerations are involved. White space between <b>-F</b> and

      normally be used only by a trusted user, but <b>untrusted_set_sender</b>
      can be set to allow untrusted users to use it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Processes running as root or the Exim user are always trusted. Other trusted
      users are defined by the <b>trusted_users</b> or <b>trusted_groups</b>
      options. In the absence of <b>-f</b>, or if the caller is not trusted, the
      sender of a local message is set to the caller's login name at the default
      qualify domain.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is one exception to the restriction on the use of <b>-f</b>: an empty
      sender can be specified by any user, trusted or not, to create a message
      that can never provoke a bounce. An empty sender can be specified either
      as an empty string, or as a pair of angle brackets with nothing between
      them, as in these examples of shell commands:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -f '&lt;&gt;' user@domain
    <br/>
     exim4 -f &quot;&quot; user@domain
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In addition, the use of <b>-f</b> is not restricted when testing a filter
      file with <b>-bf</b> or when testing or verifying addresses using the
      <b>-bt</b> or <b>-bv</b> options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Allowing untrusted users to change the sender address does not of itself
      make it possible to send anonymous mail. Exim still checks that the
      <i>From:</i> header refers to the local user, and if it does not, it adds
      a <i>Sender:</i> header, though this can be overridden by setting
      <b>no_local_from_check</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    White space between <b>-f</b> and the &lt;<i>address</i>&gt; is optional
      (that is, they can be given as two arguments or one combined argument).
      The sender of a locally-generated message can also be set (when permitted)
      by an initial &quot;From &quot; line in the message - see the description
      of <b>-bm</b> above - but if <b>-f</b> is also present, it overrides

  <dd class="It-tag">This option is normally restricted to admin users. However,
      there is a configuration option called <b>prod_requires_admin</b> which
      can be set false to relax this restriction (and also the same requirement
      for the <b>-M</b>, <b>-R</b>, and <b>-S</b> options).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If other commandline options do not specify an action,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    the <b>-q</b> option starts one queue runner process. This scans the queue
      of waiting messages, and runs a delivery process for each one in turn. It
      waits for each delivery process to finish before starting the next one. A
      delivery process may not actually do any deliveries if the retry times for
      the addresses have not been reached. Use <b>-qf</b> (see below) if you
      want to override this.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the delivery process spawns other processes to deliver other messages
      down passed SMTP connections, the queue runner waits for these to finish
      before proceeding.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When all the queued messages have been considered, the original queue runner
      process terminates. In other words, a single pass is made over the waiting
      mail, one message at a time. Use <b>-q</b> with a time (see below) if you
      want this to be repeated periodically.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Exim processes the waiting messages in an unpredictable order. It isn't very
      random, but it is likely to be different each time, which is all that
      matters. If one particular message screws up a remote MTA, other messages
      to the same MTA have a chance of getting through if they get tried first.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is possible to cause the messages to be processed in lexical message id
      order, which is essentially the order in which they arrived, by setting
      the <b>queue_run_in_order</b> option, but this is not recommended for
      normal use.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">An option starting with <b>-qq</b> requests a two-stage

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The hints database that remembers which messages are waiting for specific
      hosts is updated, as if delivery to those hosts had been deferred. After
      this is complete, a second, normal queue scan happens, with routing and
      delivery taking place as normal. Messages that are routed to the same host
      should mostly be delivered down a single SMTP connection because of the
      hints that were set up during the first queue scan. This option may be
      useful for hosts that are connected to the Internet intermittently.</dd>

      other commandline options speicify an action, a <i>-qG&lt;name&gt;</i>
      option will specify a queue to operate on. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

     exim4 -bp -qGquarantine

  <dd class="It-tag">When scanning the queue, Exim can be made to skip over
      messages whose ids are lexically less than a given value by following the
      <b>-q</b> option with a starting message id. For example:

     exim4 -q 0t5C6f-0000c8-00

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -q 0t5C6f-0000c8-00 0t5C6f-0000c8-00
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    just one delivery process is started, for that message. This differs from
      <b>-M</b> in that retry data is respected, and it also differs from
      <b>-Mc</b> in that it counts as a delivery from a queue run. Note that the
      selection mechanism does not affect the order in which the messages are
      scanned. There are also other ways of selecting specific sets of messages
      for delivery in a queue run - see <b>-R</b> and <b>-S</b>.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q</b>&lt;<i>qflags</i>&gt;&lt;<i>time</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When a time value is present, the <b>-q</b> option causes
      Exim to run as a daemon, starting a queue runner process at intervals
      specified by the given time value. This form of the <b>-q</b> option is
      commonly combined with the <b>-bd</b> option, in which case a single
      daemon process handles both functions. A common way of starting up a
      combined daemon at system boot time is to use a command such as
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     /usr/sbin/exim4 -bd -q30m
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Such a daemon listens for incoming SMTP calls, and also starts a queue
      runner process every 30 minutes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When a daemon is started by <b>-q</b> with a time value, but without
      <b>-bd</b>, no pid file is written unless one is explicitly requested by

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-R</b>&lt;<i>rsflags</i>&gt; &lt;<i>string</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &lt;<i>rsflags</i>&gt; may be empty, in which case the
      white space before the string is optional, unless the string is <i>f</i>,
      <i>ff</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>rf</i>, or <i>rff</i>, which are the possible
      values for &lt; <i>rsflags</i>&gt;. White space is required if &lt;
      <i>rsflags</i>&gt; is not empty.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is similar to <b>-q</b> with no time value, that is, it causes
      Exim to perform a single queue run, except that, when scanning the
      messages on the queue, Exim processes only those that have at least one
      undelivered recipient address containing the given string, which is
      checked in a case-independent way. If the &lt; <i>rsflags</i>&gt; start
      with <i>r</i>, &lt;<i>string</i>&gt; is interpreted as a regular
      expression; otherwise it is a literal string.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you want to do periodic queue runs for messages with specific recipients,
      you can combine <b>-R</b> with <b>-q</b> and a time value. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     exim4 -q25m -R @special.domain.example
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This example does a queue run for messages with recipients in the given
      domain every 25 minutes. Any additional flags that are specified with
      <b>-q</b> are applied to each queue run.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Once a message is selected for delivery by this mechanism, all its addresses
      are processed. For the first selected message, Exim overrides any retry
      information and forces a delivery attempt for each undelivered address.
      This means that if delivery of any address in the first message is
      successful, any existing retry information is deleted, and so delivery
      attempts for that address in subsequently selected messages (which are
      processed without forcing) will run. However, if delivery of any address
      does not succeed, the retry information is updated, and in subsequently
      selected messages, the failing address will be skipped.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the &lt; <i>rsflags</i>&gt; contain <i>f</i> or <i>ff</i>, the delivery
      forcing applies to all selected messages, not just the first; frozen
      messages are included when <i>ff</i> is present.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-R</b> option makes it straightforward to initiate delivery of all
      messages to a given domain after a host has been down for some time. When
      the SMTP command ETRN is accepted by its ACL, its default effect is to run
      Exim with the <b>-R</b> option, but it can be configured to run an
      arbitrary command instead.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-S</b>&lt;<i>rsflags</i>&gt; &lt;<i>string</i>&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option acts like <b>-R</b> except that it checks the

      warning/retry features can be tested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When Exim is receiving a locally-generated, non-SMTP
      message on its standard input, the <b>-t</b> option causes the recipients
      of the message to be obtained from the <i>To:</i>, <i>Cc:</i>, and
      <i>Bcc:</i> header lines in the message instead of from the command
      arguments. The addresses are extracted before any rewriting takes place
      and the <i>Bcc:</i> header line, if present, is then removed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the command has any arguments, they specify addresses to which the
      message is <i>not</i> to be delivered. That is, the argument addresses are
      removed from the recipients list obtained from the headers. This is
      compatible with Smail 3 and in accordance with the documented behaviour of
      several versions of Sendmail, as described in man pages on a number of
      operating systems (e.g. Solaris 8, IRIX 6.5, HP-UX 11). However, some
      versions of Sendmail <i>add</i> argument addresses to those obtained from
      the headers, and the O'Reilly Sendmail book documents it that way. Exim
      can be made to add argument addresses instead of subtracting them by
      setting the option <b>extract_addresses_remove_arguments</b> false.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If there are any <b>Resent-</b> header lines in the message, Exim extracts
      recipients from all <i>Resent-To:</i>, <i>Resent-Cc:</i>, and
      <i>Resent-Bcc:</i> header lines instead of from <i>To:</i>, <i>Cc:</i>,
      and <i>Bcc:</i>. This is for compatibility with Sendmail and other MTAs.
      (Prior to release 4.20, Exim gave an error if <b>-t</b> was used in
      conjunction with <b>Resent-</b> header lines.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    RFC 2822 talks about different sets of <b>Resent-</b> header lines (for when
      a message is resent several times). The RFC also specifies that they
      should be added at the front of the message, and separated by
      <i>Received:</i> lines. It is not at all clear how <b>-t</b> should
      operate in the present of multiple sets, nor indeed exactly what
      constitutes a &quot;set&quot;. In practice, it seems that MUAs do not
      follow the RFC. The <b>Resent-</b> lines are often added at the end of the
      header, and if a message is resent more than once, it is common for the
      original set of <b>Resent-</b> headers to be renamed as <b>X-Resent-</b>
      when a new set is added. This removes any possible ambiguity.</dd>
