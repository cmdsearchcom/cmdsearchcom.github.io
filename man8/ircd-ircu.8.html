<p>IRCD-IRCU(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
IRCD-IRCU(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ircd-ircu - The Undernet Internet Relay Chat Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ircd [-t] [-d directory] [-f configfile] [-x debuglevel] [-h
hostname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ircd is the Undernet Internet Relay Chat daemon. ircd is a
server in that its function is to &quot;serve&quot; the
client program irc(1) with messages and commands. All
commands and user <br>
messages are passed directly to ircd for processing and
relaying to other servers. irc(1) depends upon there being
an ircd server running somewhere for it to connect to and
thus <br>
allow the user to begin talking to other users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many common clients
including ircII, EPIC, and BitchX for UNIX, mIRC and pIRCh
for Windows, and IRCle and Homer for the Macintosh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d directory <br>
This option tells the server to change to that directory and
use that as a reference point when opening ircd.conf and
other startup files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Instructs the server run in
the foreground and to direct debugging output to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x# Defines the debug level for
ircd. The higher the debug level, the more messages get
directed to debugging file (or standard output if the -t
option is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w interface <br>
This option is deprecated. Outgoing connections are bound to
the interface specified in the M: line, and incoming
connections are accepted only on interfaces specified in
<br>
the P: lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Specifies the ircd.conf file to be used for this server. The
option is used to override the default ircd.conf given at
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c This flag must be given if
you are running ircd from /dev/console or any other
situation where fd 0 isn&rsquo;t a TTY and you want the
server to fork off and run in the <br>
background. This needs to be given if you are starting ircd
from an rc (such as /etc/rc.local) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hostname <br>
Allows the user to manually set the server name at startup.
The default name is hostname.domainname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p portname <br>
This is deprecated in favor of specifying server ports in P:
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
If you plan to connect your ircd server to an existing IRC
network, you will need to alter your local ircd
configuration file (typically named ircd.conf) so that it
will accept <br>
and make connections to other IRC servers. This file
contains the hostnames, network addresses, and passwords for
connections to other IRC servers around the world. Because
the <br>
description of the ircd.conf file is beyond the scope of
this document, please refer to the INSTALL file in the ircd
documentation directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOTING THE SERVER: The ircd
server can be started as part of the UNIX boot procedure or
just by placing the server into Unix Background. Keep in
mind that if it is *not* part <br>
of your UNIXES Boot-up procedure then you will have to
manually start the ircd server each time your UNIX is
rebooted. This means if your UNIX is prone to crashing or
going for <br>
for repairs a lot it would make sense to start the ircd
server as part of your UNIX bootup procedure. In some cases
the irc(1) will automatically attempt to boot the ircd
server <br>
if the user is on the SAME UNIX that the ircd is supposed to
be running on. If the irc(1) cannot connect to the ircd
server it will try to start the server on it&rsquo;s own and
will <br>
then try to reconnect to the newly booted ircd server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
tolsun% ircd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Places ircd into UNIX Background
and starts up the server for use. Note: You do not have to
add the &quot;&amp;&quot; to this command, the program will
automatically detach itself from tty.</p>
