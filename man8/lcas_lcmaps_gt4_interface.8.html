<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lcas_lcmaps_gt_interface - A Globus GSI-AuthZ plug-in to run
LCAS and LCMAPS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lcas_lcmaps_gt_interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcas_lcmaps_gt4_interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is a plug-in to be loaded from a GSI-AuthZ capable
Globus service. The feature was introduced in Globus GT4 and
is available for GT5. The purpose of this call-out is to
au&acirc; <br>
thorize a user by running the LCAS framework and map the
user credentials to a Unix account based using the LCMAPS
framework. Both LCAS and LCMAPS are frameworks that run
config&acirc; <br>
ured plug-ins to do the real work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the plug-ins are capable
of imposing certain policy on the user credentials, others
are capable of off-loading the decision to a centralized
service to make the decision <br>
or even provide an account mapping in the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plug-in is dynamically
loaded during each interaction that requires an account
mapping in the GSI-AuthZ interface of a Globus service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
LLGT_LOG_FILE <br>
When this variable is set and it can be opened as file, log
output will go to the given file instead of to syslog. When
either $LCAS_LOG_FILE or $LCMAPS_LOG_FILE is unset, <br>
it will also be set to this same file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_LOG_FACILITY <br>
Change the default logging facility with the
$LLGT_LOG_FACILITY environment variable. Use the name of
(standard syslog) facility names. Example: LOG_DAEMON,
LOG_LOCAL1, <br>
etcetera</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_LOG_IDENT <br>
The $LLGT_LOG_IDENT can (optionally) be set as the Syslog
ident value. This will be the identifying string in Syslog
for the current process. Not using this option will <br>
let Syslog (or one of the GT services) to set these options.
By default the Syslog ident will be set to the executable
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_RUN_LCAS <br>
Set the environment variable $LLGT_RUN_LCAS to
&quot;no&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;disable&quot;
to avoid LCAS to run prior to the LCMAPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a matching ./configure
option &quot;--enable-lcas&quot; which can be used to change
the default behaviour to run LCAS or not. The $LLGT_RUN_LCAS
environment variable can <br>
still influence the LCAS run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_LIFT_PRIVILEGED_PROTECTION
<br>
Normally the callout, after LCMAPS has finished, checks
whether it is (still) running with root privileges (uid,
euid, gid or egid) and fails if that is the case. This is
<br>
to prevent erroneous configurations to silently result in a
root-account mapping in services that do not have their own
checks for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the environment variable
LLGT_LIFT_PRIVILEGED_PROTECTION is set, this check is
disabled. This is NEEDED for services that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.) don&rsquo;t user switch, and
run as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.) services that expect only a
username to be returned and perform the user switch
themselves, e.g. the Globus GSI-OpenSSHd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_CACHE_CALLOUT <br>
Set the environment variable $LLGT_CACHE_CALLOUT to
&quot;no&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;disable&quot;
to disable reusing the result of the &lsquo;localname&rsquo;
callout for the &lsquo;userok&rsquo; callout. This <br>
results in calling the LCAS/LCMAPS authorization twice for
e.g. gsisshd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_DLCLOSE_LCMAPS <br>
Set the environment variable $LLGT_DLCLOSE_LCMAPS to
&quot;no&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;disable&quot;
to prevent calling dlclose() on the LCMAPS library. This
might be needed as a workaround <br>
on RH5-based systems in an installation for gsisshd, when
the use of PAM is enabled (&quot;UsePAM Yes&quot; in the
/etc/gsissh/sshd_config). The underlying bug is a
combination be&acirc; <br>
tween the OpenSSL, VOMS and PAM libraries, which can trigger
a segfault when VOMS is initialized twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_DLCLOSE_LCAS <br>
Set the environment variable $LLGT_DLCLOSE_LCAS to
&quot;no&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;disable&quot;
to prevent calling dlclose() on the LCAS library. This might
be needed as a workaround on <br>
RH5-based systems. The underlying bug is a combination
between the OpenSSL, VOMS and Globus libraries, which can
trigger a segfault when VOMS is initialized twice, which
<br>
can happen when LCAS is using a VOMS based plugin. Normally
should not be needed as LCAS is now dlclosed and terminated
after LCMAPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_NO_CHANGE_USER (deprecated)
<br>
Depreciated $LLGT_NO_CHANGE_USER in favour of
$LLGT_LIFT_PRIVILEGED_PROTECTION. (Depreciation does not
mean non-functional anymore)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT4_NO_CHANGE_USER
(deprecated) <br>
Depreciated $LLGT4_NO_CHANGE_USER in favour of
$LLGT_LIFT_PRIVILEGED_PROTECTION. (Depreciation does not
mean non-functional anymore)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_VOMS_DISABLE_CREDENTIAL_CHECK
<br>
The VOMS credentials are verified by the LCMAPS framework
before further processing is done in the plug-ins. The
LCMAPS framework has an API to enable or disable the
veri&acirc; <br>
fication of the VOMS credentials and this option will
disable the verification of the VOMS credentials. A vanilla
LCMAPS build will verify the VOMS credentials by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_VOMS_ENABLE_CREDENTIAL_CHECK
<br>
Similar to the $LLGT_VOMS_DISABLE_CREDENTIAL_CHECK
environment variable, this setting will enable the
verification of the VOMS credentials, overriding the LCMAPS
default <br>
setting to have the verification of VOMS credentials to be
disabled. A vanilla LCMAPS build will verify the VOMS
credentials by default, the OSG build has is disabled by
<br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_LCAS_LIBDIR <br>
Support for an alternative LCAS_LIBDIR as a run-time setting
by exporting
$LLGT_LCAS_LIBDIR=&quot;/usr/local/lib/liblcas.so&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_LCMAPS_LIBDIR <br>
Support for an alternative LCMAPS_LIBDIR as a run-time
setting by exporting
$LLGT_LCMAPS_LIBDIR=&quot;/usr/local/lib/liblcmaps.so&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LLGT_ENABLE_DEBUG <br>
If the $LLGT_ENABLE_DEBUG environment variable is set, then
the debugging message logged at level LOG_DEBUG are passed
to the log. The scope of this setting is only within <br>
the LCAS-LCMAPS-GT-interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<br>
GATEKEEPER_JM_ID <br>
An environment variable that is internally set to uniquely
identify this gatekeeper and the job manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOB_REPOSITORY_ID <br>
Similar to the $GATEKEEPER_JM_ID value, but its purpose is
for the LCMAPS job repository plug-in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LCAS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
LCAS_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
Debug level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LCMAPS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<br>
LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
For LCMAPS 1.5.0 (and newer) the value &quot;5&quot;
corresponds to Syslog LOG_DEBUG, &quot;4&quot; corresponds
to LOG_INFO, &quot;3&quot; to LOG_NOTICE and so on. The
LCMAPS default is to log up to <br>
LOG_INFO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
True The user is authorized and a local Unix account was
procured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">False No mapping was
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
From version 0.3.0 onwards, the interface tries to forward
the requested username to LCMAPS (for version 1.6.0 and up).
The mapping plugins can use this to support multiple
user&acirc; <br>
name entries in the grid-mapfile, or enforcing poolaccount
mappings to a specific poolaccount.</p>
