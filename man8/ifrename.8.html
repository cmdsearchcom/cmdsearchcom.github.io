<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ifrename - rename network interfaces based on various static
criteria</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ifrename [-c configfile] [-p] [-d] [-u] [-v] [-V] [-D] <br>
ifrename [-c configfile] [-i interface] [-n newname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ifrename is a tool allowing you to assign a consistent name
to each of your network interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, interface names are
dynamic, and each network interface is assigned the first
available name (eth0, eth1...). The order network interfaces
are created may vary. For <br>
built-in interfaces, the kernel boot time enumeration may
vary. For removable interface, the user may plug them in any
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifrename allow the user to
decide what name a network interface will have. Ifrename can
use a variety of selectors to specify how interface names
match the network interfaces on <br>
the system, the most common selector is the interface MAC
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifrename must be run before
interfaces are brought up, which is why it&rsquo;s mostly
useful in various scripts (init, hotplug) but is seldom used
directly by the user. By default, <br>
ifrename renames all present system interfaces using
mappings defined in /etc/iftab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
-c configfile <br>
Set the configuration file to be used (by default
/etc/iftab). The configuration file define the mapping
between selectors and interface names, and is described in
<br>
iftab(5). <br>
If configfile is &quot;-&quot;, the configuration is read
from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Probe (load) kernel modules
before renaming interfaces. By default ifrename only check
interfaces already loaded, and doesn&rsquo;t auto-load the
required kernel modules. This <br>
option enables smooth integration with system not loading
modules before calling ifrename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable various Debian
specific hacks. Combined with -p, only modules for
interfaces specified in /etc/network/interface are
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface <br>
Only rename the specified interface as opposed to all
interfaces on the system. The new interface name is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n newname <br>
When used with -i, specify the new name of the interface.
The list of mappings from the configuration file is
bypassed, the interface specified with -i is renamed
directly <br>
to newname. The new name may be a wildcard containing a
single &rsquo;*&rsquo;. <br>
When used without -i, rename interfaces by using only
mappings that would rename them to newname. The new name may
not be a wildcard. This use of ifrename is discouraged, <br>
because inefficient (-n without -i). All the interfaces of
the system need to be processed at each invocation,
therefore in most case it is not faster than just letting
<br>
ifrename renaming all of them (without both -n and -i).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Enable name takeover support.
This allow interface name swapping between two or more
interfaces. <br>
Takeover enable an interface to &rsquo;steal&rsquo; the name
of another interface. This works only with kernel 2.6.X and
if the other interface is down. Consequently, this is not
com&acirc; <br>
patible with Hotplug. The other interface is assigned a
random name, but may be renamed later with
&rsquo;ifrename&rsquo;. <br>
The number of takeovers is limited to avoid circular loops,
and therefore some complex multi-way name swapping
situations may not be fully processed. <br>
In any case, name swapping and the use of this feature is
discouraged, and you are invited to choose unique and
unambiguous names for your interfaces...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Enable udev output mode. This
enables proper integration of ifrename in the udev
framework, udevd(8) will use ifrename to assign interface
names present in /etc/iftab. In <br>
this mode the output of ifrename can be parsed directly by
udevd(8) as an IMPORT action. This requires udev version 107
or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Dry-run mode. Ifrename
won&rsquo;t change any interface, it will only print new
interface name, if applicable, and return. <br>
In dry-run mode, interface name wildcards are not resolved.
New interface name is printed, even if it is the same as the
old name. <br>
Be also aware that some selectors can only be read by root,
for example those based on ethtool), and will fail silently
if run by a normal user. In other words, dry-run <br>
mode under a standard user may not give the expected
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Verbose mode. Ifrename will
display internal results of parsing its configuration file
and querying the interfaces selectors. Combined with the
dry-run option, this is a <br>
good way to debug complex configurations or trivial
problems.</p>
