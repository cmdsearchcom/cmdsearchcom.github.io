splashy - Mandos plugin to use splashy to get a password.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 8.00ex; text-indent: -8.00ex;"><b>splashy</b></div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program prompts for a password using <b>splashy_update</b>(8) and outputs
  any given password to standard output. If no <b>splashy</b>(8) process can be
  found, this program will immediately exit with an exit code indicating
  failure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program is not very useful on its own. This program is really meant to run
  as a plugin in the Mandos client-side system, where it is used as a fallback
  and alternative to retrieving passwords from a Mandos server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this program is killed (presumably by <b>plugin-runner</b>(8mandos) because
  some other plugin provided the password), it cannot tell <b>splashy</b>(8) to
  abort requesting a password, because <b>splashy</b>(8) does not support this.
  Therefore, this program will then <i>kill</i> the running <b>splashy</b>(8)
  process and start a <i>new</i> one, using &#x201C;boot&#x201D; as the only
  argument.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
This program takes no options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
If exit status is 0, the output from the program is the password as it was read.
  Otherwise, if exit status is other than 0, the program was interrupted or
  encountered an error, and any output so far could be corrupt and/or truncated,
  and should therefore be ignored.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<b>cryptsource</b>, <b>crypttarget</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If set, these environment variables will be
  assumed to contain the source device name and the target device mapper name,
  respectively, and will be shown as part of the prompt.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These variables will normally be inherited from <b>plugin-runner</b>(8mandos),
  which will normally have inherited them from /scripts/local-top/cryptroot in
  the initial RAM disk environment, which will have set them from parsing kernel
  arguments and /conf/conf.d/cryptroot (also in the initial RAM disk
  environment), which in turn will have been created when the initial RAM disk
  image was created by /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptroot, by extracting
  the information of the root file system from /etc/crypttab.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This behavior is meant to exactly mirror the behavior of <b>askpass</b>, the
  default password prompter.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
/sbin/splashy_update
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is the command run to retrieve a password
  from <b>splashy</b>(8). See <b>splashy_update</b>(8).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/proc
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">To find the running <b>splashy</b>(8), this
  directory will be searched for numeric entries which will be assumed to be
  directories. In all those directories, the exe entry will be used to determine
  the name of the running binary and the effective user and group ID of the
  process. See <b>proc</b>(5).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
/sbin/splashy
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is the name of the binary which will be
  searched for in the process list. See <b>splashy</b>(8).</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Killing <b>splashy</b>(8) and starting a new one is ugly, but necessary as long
  as it does not support aborting a password request.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please report bugs to the Mandos development mailing list:
  &lt;mandos-dev@recompile.se&gt; (subscription required). Note that this list
  is public. The developers can be reached privately at

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
Note that normally, this program will not be invoked directly, but instead
  started by the Mandos <b>plugin-runner</b>(8mandos).
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program takes no options.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
If this program is killed by a signal, it will kill the process ID which at the
  start of this program was determined to run <b>splashy</b>(8) as root (see
  also the section called &#x201C;FILES&#x201D;). There is a very slight risk
  that, in the time between those events, that process ID was freed and then
  taken up by another process; the wrong process would then be killed. Now, this
  program can only be killed by the user who started it; see
  <b>plugin-runner</b>(8mandos). This program should therefore be started by a
  completely separate non-privileged user, and no other programs should be
  allowed to run as that special user. This means that it is not recommended to
  use the user &quot;nobody&quot; to start this program, as other possibly less
  trusted programs could be running as &quot;nobody&quot;, and they would then
  be able to kill this program, triggering the killing of the process ID which
  may or may not be <b>splashy</b>(8).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only other thing that could be considered worthy of note is this: This
  program is meant to be run by <b>plugin-runner</b>(8mandos), and will, when
  run standalone, outside, in a normal environment, immediately output on its
  standard output any presumably secret password it just received. Therefore,
  when running this program standalone (which should never normally be done),
  take care not to type in any real secret password by force of habit, since it
  would then immediately be shown as output.
