idmap_script - Samba's idmap_script Backend for Winbind
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The idmap_script plugin is a substitute for the idmap_tdb2 backend used by
  winbindd for storing SID/uid/gid mapping tables in clustered environments with
  Samba and CTDB. It is a read only backend that uses a script to perform
  mapping.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It was developed out of the idmap_tdb2 back end and does not store SID/uid/gid
  mappings in a TDB, since the winbind_cache tdb will store the mappings once
  they are provided.

<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option can be used to configure an
  external program for performing id mappings.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IDMAP_SCRIPT"><a class="selflink" href="#IDMAP_SCRIPT">IDMAP
  SCRIPT</a></h1>
The tdb2 idmap backend supports an external program for performing id mappings
  through the smb.conf option <i>idmap config * : script</i> or its deprecated
  legacy form <i>idmap : script</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mappings obtained by the script are then stored in the idmap tdb2 database
  instead of mappings created by the incrementing id counters. It is therefore
  important that the script covers the complete range of SIDs that can be passed
  in for SID to Unix ID mapping, since otherwise SIDs unmapped by the script
  might get mapped to IDs that had previously been mapped by the script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The script should accept the following command line options.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
	SIDTOID S-1-xxxx
	IDTOSID UID xxxx
	IDTOSID GID xxxx
	IDTOSID XID xxxx
	
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And it should return one of the following responses as a single line of text.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
	UID:yyyy
	GID:yyyy
	XID:yyyy
	SID:ssss
	ERR:yyyy
	
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
XID indicates that the ID returned should be both a UID and a GID. That is, it
  requests an ID_TYPE_BOTH, but it is ultimately up to the script whether or not
  it can honor that request. It can choose to return a UID or a GID mapping
  only.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
This example shows how script is used as a the default idmap backend using an
  external program via the script parameter:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
	[global]
	idmap config * : backend = script
	idmap config * : range = 1000000-2000000
	idmap config * : script = /usr/local/samba/bin/idmap_script.sh
	
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This shows a simple script to partially perform the task:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
	#!/bin/sh
	#
	# Uncomment this if you want some logging
	#echo $@ &gt;&gt; /tmp/idmap.sh.log
	if [ &quot;$1&quot; == &quot;SIDTOID&quot; ]
	then
		# Note. The number returned has to be within the range defined
		#echo &quot;Sending UID:1000005&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/idmap.sh.log
		echo &quot;UID:1000005&quot;
		exit 0
	else
		#echo &quot;Sending ERR: No idea what to do&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/idmap.sh.log
		echo &quot;ERR: No idea what to do&quot;
		exit 1
	fi
	
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Clearly, this script is not enough, as it should probably use wbinfo to
  determine if an incoming SID is a user or group SID and then look up the
  mapping in a table or use some other mechanism for mapping SIDs to UIDs and
  etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please be aware that the script is called with the _NO_WINBINDD environment
  variable set to 1. This prevents recursive calls into winbind from the script
  both via explicit calls to wbinfo and via implicit calls via nss_winbind. For
  example a call to ls -l could trigger such an infinite recursion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is safe to call wbinfo -n and wbinfo -s from within an idmap script. To do
  so, the script must unset the _NO_WINBINDD environment variable right before
  the call to wbinfo and set it to 1 again right after wbinfo has returned to
  protect against the recursion.

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
  Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project
  similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.</div>
