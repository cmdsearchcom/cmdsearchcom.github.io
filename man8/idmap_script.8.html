<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
idmap_script - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_script Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The idmap_script plugin is a substitute for the idmap_tdb2
backend used by winbindd for storing SID/uid/gid mapping
tables in clustered environments with Samba and CTDB. It is
a <br>
read only backend that uses a script to perform mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It was developed out of the
idmap_tdb2 back end and does not store SID/uid/gid mappings
in a TDB, since the winbind_cache tdb will store the
mappings once they are provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDMAP OPTIONS <br>
range = low - high <br>
Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which
the backend is authoritative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script <br>
This option can be used to configure an external program for
performing id mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDMAP SCRIPT <br>
The tdb2 idmap backend supports an external program for
performing id mappings through the smb.conf option idmap
config * : script or its deprecated legacy form idmap :
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mappings obtained by the
script are then stored in the idmap tdb2 database instead of
mappings created by the incrementing id counters. It is
therefore important that the <br>
script covers the complete range of SIDs that can be passed
in for SID to Unix ID mapping, since otherwise SIDs unmapped
by the script might get mapped to IDs that had previously
<br>
been mapped by the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script should accept the
following command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIDTOID S-1-xxxx <br>
IDTOSID UID xxxx <br>
IDTOSID GID xxxx <br>
IDTOSID XID xxxx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And it should return one of the
following responses as a single line of text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UID:yyyy <br>
GID:yyyy <br>
XID:yyyy <br>
SID:ssss <br>
ERR:yyyy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XID indicates that the ID
returned should be both a UID and a GID. That is, it
requests an ID_TYPE_BOTH, but it is ultimately up to the
script whether or not it can honor that <br>
request. It can choose to return a UID or a GID mapping
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example shows how script is used as a the default idmap
backend using an external program via the script
parameter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[global] <br>
idmap config * : backend = script <br>
idmap config * : range = 1000000-2000000 <br>
idmap config * : script =
/usr/local/samba/bin/idmap_script.sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This shows a simple script to
partially perform the task:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
# <br>
# Uncomment this if you want some logging <br>
#echo $@ &gt;&gt; /tmp/idmap.sh.log <br>
if [ &quot;$1&quot; == &quot;SIDTOID&quot; ] <br>
then <br>
# Note. The number returned has to be within the range
defined <br>
#echo &quot;Sending UID:1000005&quot; &gt;&gt;
/tmp/idmap.sh.log <br>
echo &quot;UID:1000005&quot; <br>
exit 0 <br>
else <br>
#echo &quot;Sending ERR: No idea what to do&quot; &gt;&gt;
/tmp/idmap.sh.log <br>
echo &quot;ERR: No idea what to do&quot; <br>
exit 1 <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clearly, this script is not
enough, as it should probably use wbinfo to determine if an
incoming SID is a user or group SID and then look up the
mapping in a table or use some <br>
other mechanism for mapping SIDs to UIDs and etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please be aware that the script
is called with the _NO_WINBINDD environment variable set to
1. This prevents recursive calls into winbind from the
script both via explicit calls <br>
to wbinfo and via implicit calls via nss_winbind. For
example a call to ls -l could trigger such an infinite
recursion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is safe to call wbinfo -n and
wbinfo -s from within an idmap script. To do so, the script
must unset the _NO_WINBINDD environment variable right
before the call to wbinfo and <br>
set it to 1 again right after wbinfo has returned to protect
against the recursion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux <br>
kernel is developed.</p>
