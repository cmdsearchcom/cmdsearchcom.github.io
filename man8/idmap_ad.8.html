<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
idmap_ad - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_ad Backend for Winbind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The idmap_ad plugin provides a way for Winbind to read id
mappings from an AD server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema
extensions. This module implements only the
&quot;idmap&quot; API, and is <br>
READONLY. Mappings must be provided in advance by the
administrator by adding the uidNumber attributes for users
and gidNumber attributes for groups in the AD. Winbind will
only <br>
map users that have a uidNumber and whose primary group have
a gidNumber attribute set. It is however recommended that
all groups in use have gidNumber attributes assigned, <br>
otherwise they are not working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the ad backend does
not work as the default idmap backend, but one has to
configure it separately for each domain for which one wants
to use it, using disjoint ranges. <br>
One usually needs to configure a writeable default idmap
range, using for example the tdb or ldap backend, in order
to be able to map the BUILTIN sids and possibly other
trusted <br>
domains. The writeable default config is also needed in
order to be able to create group mappings. This catch-all
default idmap configuration should have a range that is
disjoint <br>
from any explicitly configured domain with idmap backend ad.
See the example below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDMAP OPTIONS <br>
range = low - high <br>
Defines the available matching UID and GID range for which
the backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a
filter. If specified any UID or GID stored in AD that <br>
fall outside the range is ignored and the corresponding map
is discarded. It is intended as a way to avoid accidental
UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely defined IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">schema_mode = &lt;rfc2307 | sfu
| sfu20&gt; <br>
Defines the schema that idmap_ad should use when querying
Active Directory regarding user and group information. This
can be either the RFC2307 schema support included in <br>
Windows 2003 R2 or the Service for Unix (SFU) schema. For
SFU 3.0 or 3.5 please choose &quot;sfu&quot;, for SFU 2.0
please choose &quot;sfu20&quot;. Please note that primary
group membership is <br>
currently always calculated via the
&quot;primaryGroupID&quot; LDAP attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from
our principal and trusted AD domains. If trusted domains are
present id conflicts must be resolved beforehand, there <br>
is no guarantee on the order conflicting mappings would be
resolved at this point. This example also shows how to leave
a small non conflicting range for local id allocation that
<br>
may be used in internal backends like BUILTIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux <br>
kernel is developed.</p>
