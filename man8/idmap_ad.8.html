idmap_ad - Samba's idmap_ad Backend for Winbind
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The idmap_ad plugin provides a way for Winbind to read id mappings from an AD
  server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema extensions. This module implements only
  the &quot;idmap&quot; API, and is READONLY. Mappings must be provided in
  advance by the administrator by adding the uidNumber attributes for users and
  gidNumber attributes for groups in the AD. Winbind will only map users that
  have a uidNumber and whose primary group have a gidNumber attribute set. It is
  however recommended that all groups in use have gidNumber attributes assigned,
  otherwise they are not working.

Currently, the <i>ad</i> backend does not work as the default idmap backend, but
  one has to configure it separately for each domain for which one wants to use
  it, using disjoint ranges. One usually needs to configure a writeable default
  idmap range, using for example the <i>tdb</i> or <i>ldap</i> backend, in order
  to be able to map the BUILTIN sids and possibly other trusted domains. The
  writeable default config is also needed in order to be able to create group
  mappings. This catch-all default idmap configuration should have a range that
  is disjoint from any explicitly configured domain with idmap backend
  <i>ad</i>. See the example below.

range = low - high
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Defines the available matching UID and GID
  range for which the backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a
  filter. If specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the range
  is ignored and the corresponding map is discarded. It is intended as a way to
  avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely defined
  IDs.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
schema_mode = &lt;rfc2307 | sfu | sfu20&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Defines the schema that idmap_ad should use
  when querying Active Directory regarding user and group information. This can
  be either the RFC2307 schema support included in Windows 2003 R2 or the
  Service for Unix (SFU) schema. For SFU 3.0 or 3.5 please choose
  &quot;sfu&quot;, for SFU 2.0 please choose &quot;sfu20&quot;. Please note that
  primary group membership is currently always calculated via the
  &quot;primaryGroupID&quot; LDAP attribute.</div>

The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from our principal and
  trusted AD domains. If trusted domains are present id conflicts must be
  resolved beforehand, there is no guarantee on the order conflicting mappings
  would be resolved at this point. This example also shows how to leave a small
  non conflicting range for local id allocation that may be used in internal
  backends like BUILTIN.

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
  Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project
  similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.</div>
