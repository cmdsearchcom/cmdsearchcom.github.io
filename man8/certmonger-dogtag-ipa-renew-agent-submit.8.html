dogtag-ipa-renew-agent-submit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dogtag-ipa-renew-agent-submit -E EE-URL -A AGENT-URL [-d
dbdir] [-n nickname] [-i cainfo] [-C capath] [-c certfile]
[-k keyfile] [-p pinfile] [-P pin] [-s serial (hex)] [-D
<br>
serial (decimal)] [-S state] [-T profile] [-O param=value]
[-v] [csrfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dogtag-ipa-renew-agent-submit is the helper which certmonger
uses to make certificate renewal requests to Dogtag
instances running on IPA servers. It is not normally run
inter&acirc; <br>
actively, but it can be for troubleshooting purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preferred option is to
request a renewal of an already-issued certificate, using
its serial number, which can be read from a PEM-formatted
certificate provided in the CERT&acirc; <br>
MONGER_CERTIFICATE environment variable, or via the -s or -D
option on the command line. If no serial number is provided,
then the client will attempt to obtain a new certifi&acirc;
<br>
cate by submitting a signing request to the CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The signing request which is to
be submitted should either be in a file whose name is given
as an argument, or fed into dogtag-ipa-renew-agent-submit
via stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">certmonger does not yet support
retrieving trust information from Dogtag CAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-E EE-URL <br>
The top-level URL for the end-entity interface provided by
the CA. In IPA installations, this is typically
http://SERVER:EEPORT/ca/ee/ca. If no URL is specified, the
<br>
host named in the [global] section in the
/etc/ipa/default.conf file is used as the value of SERVER,
and the value of EEPORT will be inferred based on the value
of the <br>
dogtag_version in the [global] section in the
/etc/ipa/default.conf file: if dogtag_version is set to 10
or more, EEPORT will be set to 8080. Otherwise it will be
9180.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A AGENT-URL <br>
The top-level URL for the agent interface provided by the
CA. In IPA installations, this is typically
https://SERVER:AGENTPORT/ca/agent/ca. If no URL is
specified, the <br>
host named in the [global] section in the
/etc/ipa/default.conf file is used as the value of SERVER,
and the value of AGENTPORT will be inferred based on the
value of the <br>
dogtag_version in the [global] section in the
/etc/ipa/default.conf file: if dogtag_version is set to 10
or more, AGENTPORT will be set to 8443. Otherwise it will be
<br>
9443.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dbdir -n nickname -c certfile
-k keyfile <br>
The location of the key and certificate which the client
should use to authenticate to the CA&rsquo;s agent
interface. Exactly which values are meaningful depend on
which cryp&acirc; <br>
tography library your copy of libcurl was linked with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of these options are
specified, and none of the -p, -P, -i, nor -C options are
specified, then this set of defaults is used: <br>
-i /etc/ipa/ca.crt <br>
-d /etc/httpd/alias <br>
-n ipaCert <br>
-p /etc/httpd/alias/pwdfile.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pinfile <br>
The name of a file which contains a PIN/password which will
be needed in order to make use of the agent credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not specified,
and none of the -d, -n, -c, -k, -P, -i, nor -C options are
specified, then this set of defaults is used: <br>
-i /etc/ipa/ca.crt <br>
-d /etc/httpd/alias <br>
-n ipaCert <br>
-p /etc/httpd/alias/pwdfile.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i cainfo -C capath <br>
The location of a file containing a copy of the CA&rsquo;s
certificate, against which the CA server&rsquo;s certificate
will be verified, or a directory containing, among other
<br>
things, such a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If these options are not
specified, and none of the -d, -n, -c, -k, -p, nor -P
options are specified, then this set of defaults is used:
<br>
-i /etc/ipa/ca.crt <br>
-d /etc/httpd/alias <br>
-n ipaCert <br>
-p /etc/httpd/alias/pwdfile.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s serial <br>
The serial number of an already-issued certificate for which
the client should attempt to obtain a new certificate, in
hexadecimal form, if one can not be read from the <br>
CERTMONGER_CERTIFICATE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D serial <br>
The serial number of an already-issued certificate for which
the client should attempt to obtain a new certificate, in
decimal form, if one can not be read from the CERT&acirc;
<br>
MONGER_CERTIFICATE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S state <br>
A cookie value provided by a previous instance of this
helper, if the helper is being asked to continue a
multi-step enrollment process. If the CERTMONGER_COOKIE
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable is set, its value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T profile/template <br>
The name of the type of certificate which the client should
request from the CA if it is not renewing a certificate (per
the -s option above). If the CERTMONGER_CA_PRO&acirc; <br>
FILE environment variable is set, its value is used.
Otherwise, the default value is caServerCert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O param=value <br>
An additional parameter to pass to the server when approving
the signing request using the agent&rsquo;s credentials. By
default, any server-supplied default settings are <br>
applied. This option can be used either to override a
server-supplied default setting, or to supply one which
would otherwise have not been used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increases the logging level.
Use twice for more logging. This option is mainly useful for
troubleshooting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 if the certificate was issued. The certificate will be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 if the CA is still thinking. A
cookie (state) value will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 if the CA rejected the
request. An error message may be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 if the CA was unreachable. An
error message may be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 if critical configuration
information is missing. An error message may be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 if the CA is still thinking. A
suggested poll delay (specified in seconds) and a cookie
(state) value will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17 if the CA indicates that the
client needs to attempt enrollment using a new key pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/ipa/default.conf <br>
is the IPA client configuration file. This file is consulted
to determine the URL for the Dogtag server&rsquo;s
end-entity and agent interfaces if they are not supplied as
<br>
arguments.</p>
