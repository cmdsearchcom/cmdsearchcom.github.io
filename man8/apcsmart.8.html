<p>APCSMART(8) NUT Manual APCSMART(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apcsmart - Driver for American Power Conversion Smart
Protocol UPS equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apcsmart -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apcsmart -a UPS_NAME [-x
option=value ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the apcsmart driver. For information about the core
driver, see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
The apcsmart driver should recognize (or at the very least,
work with) the majority of Smart-UPS models - which includes
Smart-UPS, Matrix-UPS and Back-UPS lineups, among few <br>
other ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, we can roughly divide
APC hardware into four groups (note that the division
isn&acirc;t strict by any means, and the borders between
those are pretty fuzzy):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[very] &quot;old&quot; models
<br>
These models usually have old APC logo, white color and no
programmable EEPROM; you won&acirc;t find them listed
anywhere on APC&acirc;s site either. The support for those
will be <br>
usually based on driver&acirc;s compatibility tables, or if
the model (firmware) is not listed in those - the driver
will try to follow the very basic subset of features, while
<br>
still trying to remain useful. Despite &quot;smart&quot;
tagname, they often tend to behave in pretty dumb way (see
the section below about shutdown behaviour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example models:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Smart-UPS
2000I</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Smart-UPS
900I</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;new&quot; models <br>
These models usually come from late 1990s / pre-2009 times.
They are often referred as &quot;3rd. gen&quot;. For the
most part, they have programmable EEPROM, report supported
commands <br>
and capabilites, and should work just fine with the apcsmart
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;microlink&quot; models
<br>
WARNING: these are not natively supported by apcsmart (or
apcupsd, for that matter, if you&acirc;re wondering). Around
2007, APC (now APC Schneider) decided to go back to its <br>
proprietry roots, and all the new models (SMT, SMX, SURTD)
use completely different protocol and cables. If you
purchased a new APC UPS - that uses cable with RJ45 on the
one <br>
end, and DB-9 on the other - then you have such model. Your
only option to support it through NUT is to purchase a
&quot;legacy communications card&quot; - part #AP9620
(google <br>
&rsquo;AP9620&rsquo; for more details). Or if that&acirc;s
not an option, rely on official software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Microsol models <br>
Several Microsol serial models sold in Brazil have been
rebranded as APC Back-UPS, and the model numbers tend to
start with &quot;BZ&quot;. If you have one of these
&quot;Nobreaks&quot;, they <br>
will not work with the apcsmart driver - please see the
solis(8) driver instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example models:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Back-UPS
BZ1200-BR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Back-UPS
BZ2200BI-BR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another thing to remember is
that Smart protocol is not USB protocol. If you have UPS
with both USB and serial ports, then depending on how you
connect it, you will need either <br>
apcsmart or usbhid-ups driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CABLING <br>
This driver expects to see a 940-0024C cable or a clone by
default. You can switch to the 940-0095B dual-mode cable
support with the &rsquo;cable=&rsquo; definition described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your 940-xx24X cable is
broken or missing, use this diagram to build a clone:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.networkupstools.org/cables.html#_940_0024c_clone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The &quot;xx&quot; is either &quot;00&quot; for a short
cable, or the number of feet of a longer cable. The
&quot;X&quot; is a letter representing the minor revision of
the physical cable and its <br>
connectors (&quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot; are commonly
found revisions). All minor revisions should use the same
pin-outs and wiring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify alternate cable
in ups.conf(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cable=940-0095B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can also
provide it on the command line using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x cable=940-0095B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTY MODES <br>
By default the driver works in canonical mode, but it proved
to be a problem in Windows systems. Furthermore
there&acirc;s a possibility of some obscure serial cards or
serial-USB <br>
converters that could cause problems as well. You can use
&rsquo;ttymode=&rsquo; option to force non-canonical
discipline in ups.conf(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttymode=raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can also
provide it on the command line using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x ttymode=raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Any other value will make the driver work in the canonical
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPLANATION OF SHUTDOWN METHODS
SUPPORTED BY APC UPSES <br>
APC hardware supports a lot of shutdown methods, that
themselves can differ in behaviour quite a bit, depending on
the model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S (soft hibernate) <br>
This is most basic command present in probably all APC
models. It will hibernate the UPS, and subsequently wake it
up when the mains supply returns. The command doesn&acirc;t
work <br>
if the UPS is running on mains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;old&quot; models <br>
The behaviour here is unfortunately pretty primitive - when
the power returns, the UPS just wakes up. No grace periods,
no min. battery charge condition, etc. This is <br>
probably not what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;new&quot; models <br>
The behaviour here is as expected - the power is cut off
after the EEPROM defined grace period. The UPS will wake up
when the power returns, after the EEPROM defined <br>
delay AND if the EEPROM defined min. battery charge level is
met. The delay is counted from the power&rsquo;s return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CS (aka &quot;force OB
hack&quot;) <br>
This is a trick to make UPS power down even if it&rsquo;s
running on mains. Immediately before issuing S,
&quot;simulate power failure&quot; is issued. The remaining
behaviour is as in S <br>
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name came from APC CS
models, where such trick was used to power down UPSes in
consistent fashion using only S. It&rsquo;s better to use
@nnn command if your UPS supports it <br>
(and is not too old, see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@nnn (hard hibernate) <br>
This is basic command used to hibernate UPS regardless if
it&rsquo;s running on batteries or on mains. The option
takes 3 digits argument which can be used to specify
additional <br>
wakeup delay (in 6 minute units).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;old&quot; models <br>
The behaviour is - unfortunately - similary primitive to S.
The UPS unconditionally wakes up after nnn*6 minutes - it
doesn&rsquo;t care if the power returned ! If nnn = 000,
<br>
then UPS will do precisely nothing. On those models
you&rsquo;re better specifying nnn &gt; 0, if you can
estimate the kind of power problems that might be happening
in your <br>
environment. Another thing to consider with &quot;old&quot;
models - you might lose the connection with the UPS, until
it wakes up (with S, the serial connection is kept
alive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;new&quot; models <br>
All the usual variables defined in EEPROM are respected (see
S). Additionally, if nnn &gt; 0, the nnn*6 minutes are added
to EEPROM defined delay. UPS will not power up if <br>
it&rsquo;s running on batteries, contrary to what
&quot;old&quot; models used to do - the combined delay is
counted from the moment of power return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supposedly there exist models
that take 2 digits instead of 3. Just in case, NUT also
supports such variation. You have to provide exactly 2
digits to trigger it (awd option, <br>
or argument to one of the supported instant commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K (delayed poweroff) <br>
This is permanent poweroff - the UPS will not wake up
automatically. On newer units, it will respect applicable
EEPROM variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Z (instant poweroff) <br>
This is also permanent poweroff - the UPS will not wake up
automatically. The poweroff is executed immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHUTDOWN CONTROL BY NUT <br>
There are three options used to control the shutdown
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sdtype=[0-5] <br>
This option takes a single digit (0-5) as an argument. See
below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">advorder=no|[0-4]+ <br>
This option takes string of digits as an argument. Methods
listed are tried in turn until one of them succeedes. Note
that the meaning of digits is different from sdtype. See
<br>
below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">awd=[0-9]{1,3} <br>
This option lets you specify additional wakeup delay used by
@. If you provide exactly 2 digits, the driver will try 2
digits variation (see previous section for more info). <br>
Otherwise standard 3 digits variation is used. Note: the
time unit is 6 minutes !</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind that sdtype and
advorder are mutually exclusive. If advorder is provided,
sdtype is ignored. If advorder is set to &rsquo;no&rsquo;,
sdtype is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nothing is provided, NUT will
assume sdtype=0 - which is generally fine for anything not
too ancient or not too quirky.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SDTYPE <br>
The values permitted are from 0 to 5. Only one can be
specified. Anything else will cause apcsmart to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 <br>
issue soft hibernate (S) if the UPS is running on batteries,
otherwise issue hard hibernate (@)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 <br>
issue soft hibernate (S) (if on batteries), and if it fails
(or on mains) - try hard hibernate (@)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 <br>
issue instant poweroff (Z)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 <br>
issue delayed poweroff (K)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 <br>
issue &quot;force OB hack&quot; (CS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 <br>
issue hard hibernate (@)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Hard hibernate&rsquo;s additional wakeup delay can be
provided by awd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVORDER <br>
The argument is either a word &rsquo;no&rsquo;, or a string
of 1 - 5 digits in [0 - 4] range. Each digit maps to the one
of shutdown methods supported by APC UPSes. Methods listed
in this <br>
way are tried in order, until one of them succedes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If advorder is undefined or set
to &rsquo;no&rsquo;, sdtype is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mapping is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 soft hibernate (S)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 hard hibernate (@)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 delayed poweroff (K)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 instant poweroff (Z)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 &quot;force OB hack&quot;
(CS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Hard hibernate&rsquo;s additional wakeup delay can be
provided by awd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORING LB STATE <br>
APC units - even if they report LB mode - will not go into
shutdown automatically. This gives us even more control with
reference to &quot;when to actually shutdown PSU&quot;.
Since <br>
version 2.6.2, NUT supports ignorelb option in
driver&acirc;s section of ups.conf(5). When such option is
in effect, the core driver will ignore LB state as reported
by specific driver <br>
and start shutdown basing the decision only on two
conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battery.charge &lt;
battery.charge.low</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battery.runtime &lt;
battery.runtime.low</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course - if any of the
variables are not available, the appropriate condition is
not checked. If you want to explicitly disable one of the
conditions, simply override the <br>
right hand variable causing the condition to always evaluate
to false (you can even provide negative numbers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APC UPSes don&acirc;t have
battery.charge.low - you will have to define it if you want
to use such condition (prefix the variable with override. or
default.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;New&quot; units have
battery.runtime.low, but depending on battery quality,
firmware version, calibration and UPS load - this variable
can be underestimated quite a bit - especially <br>
right after going into OB state. This in turn can cause LB
to be asserted, which under normal conditions will cause NUT
to initiate the shutdown. You might want to disable this
<br>
condition entirely, when relying on ignorelb option (this
was actually the main motivation behind introduction of such
feature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[apc] <br>
ignorelb <br>
override.battery.charge.low = 15 <br>
override.battery.runtime.low = -1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would cause apcsmart to go
into shutdown only if detected battery charge &lt; 15%.
Runtime condition is always false in this example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could ask - why bother ?
Well, the reason is already hinted above. APC units can be
very picky about the batteries, and their firmware can
underestimate the remaining runtime <br>
(especially right after going into OB state). ignorelb
option and override.* let you remain in control of the UPS,
not UPS in control of you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, this allows to
specify conditions similary to how it&acirc;s done in
apcupsd daemon, so it should be welcome by people used to
that software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED INSTANT COMMANDS <br>
The apcsmart driver exposes following instant commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.return <br>
executes soft hibernate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.return cs <br>
executes &quot;force OB hack&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.return at:&lt;nbr&gt;
<br>
executes &quot;hard hibernate&quot; with &lt;nbr&gt;*6
minutes additional wakeup delay (&lt;nbr&gt; format is the
same as of awd option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown.stayoff <br>
executes &quot;delayed poweroff&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load.off <br>
executes &quot;instant poweroff&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the above commands must be
issued 2nd time to have any effect (no less than 3 seconds,
and no more than 15 seconds after the initial call). Those
commands are mostly useful <br>
for manual testing, when your machine is not powered by the
UPS you&rsquo;re testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other supported commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; load.on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
test.panel.start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
test.failure.start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
test.battery.start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
test.battery.stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; bypass.start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; bypass.stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
calibrate.start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
calibrate.stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREVIOUS DRIVER VERSION <br>
Previous driver is still available as apcsmart-old, should
there be any need to use earlier version (bugs,
incompatiblities with new functionality, etc.). In due time,
<br>
apcsmart-old will be phased out completely, but this
won&acirc;t happen until the new version gets solid exposure
with no pending issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Some older APC UPS models return bogus data in the status
register during a front panel test. This is usually detected
and discarded, but some other unexpected values have <br>
occasionally slipped through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APC UPS models with both USB and
serial ports require a power cycle when switching from USB
communication to serial, and perhaps vice versa.</p>
