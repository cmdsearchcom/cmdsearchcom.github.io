<p>avenger.local(8) Mail Avenger 0.8.4 avenger.local(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
avenger.local - deliver mail for a local user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
avenger.local [-f sender] [-D recip] [-a extra] [-d]
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
avenger.local is a local mail delivery agent that enables
users to set up multiple &quot;extension&quot; email
addresses and process mail differently for each addresses.
The popular qmail <br>
MTA (&lt;http://www.qmail.org/&gt;) has a mechanism for
processing such extension addresses. avenger.local provides
a similar facility for users of other MTAs, such as
sendmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use avenger.local, you should
configure your MTA so that it delivers mail to
user+extra@host by executing avenger.local -D
user+extra@host -d user+extra. Alternatively, you <br>
can execute avenger.local -a extra -d user, but then you
lose information about the host. However, the latter syntax
has the advantage of being command-line compatible with <br>
procmail; thus, if your MTA has support for procmail as a
local delivery agent, you should be able to use that by
simply substituting avenger.local&rsquo;s path for
procmail&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that either way you invoke
it, avenger.local rejects recipients containing the string
&quot;..&quot; in the local part. Such mailbox names are not
allowed by RFC822, and could <br>
potentially lead to security problems if parts of mailbox
names are used as file names. Out of paranoia, avenger.local
additionally rejects mailbox names containing the
&quot;/&quot; <br>
character in the extra portion after the local username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avenger.local is designed to be
unobtrusive for users who do not want to take advantage of
its functionality. When delivering mail for user, if
user&rsquo;s home directory does not <br>
contain a subdirectory .avenger, avenger.local simply
executes the default mail delivery agent (usually called
mail.local).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For users who do have .avenger
directories, mail is delivered according to rule files
called .avenger/local*. Mail to user@host is delivered
according to rules in <br>
.avenger/local. Mail to user+ext1@host is delivered
according to rules in .avenger/local+ext1 if such a file
exists, or else .avenger/local+default if such a file
exists; if <br>
neither file exists, the mail is bounced. Addresses
containing multiple &quot;+&quot; characters are handled as
expected. Mail to user+ext1+ext2@host is governed by, in
order of <br>
decreasing precedence, .avenger/local+ext1+ext2,
.avenger/local+ext1+default, or .avenger/local+default; it
is bounced if none of those files exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local rule files can be in one
of two formats. If the first two characters of the file are
&quot;#!&quot;, then the file is simply executed as a
script, with the message on standard <br>
input. The script&rsquo;s standard input will be read-only,
but seekable, so, for example, the message can be delivered
to multiple mailboxes using the deliver utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if the first two
characters of a file are not &quot;#!&quot;, avenger.local
uses a syntax similar to (but not identical to)
qmail&rsquo;s, where each line is one of the following <br>
types, depending on the first character:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># comment <br>
Lines starting with &quot;#&quot; are treated as comments
and ignored. The exception is that if the first line begins
&quot;#!&quot;, the file is executed as a script. Note that
if the first <br>
two characters of a file are &quot;#!&quot; but the
file&rsquo;s execute permission bits are not set, then mail
sent to that address will be deferred. (This mechanism can
be used for <br>
intentionally deferring mail while performing
maintenance.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./maildir/ <br>
/path/to/maildir/ <br>
A line starting &quot;.&quot; or &quot;/&quot; and ending
with a &quot;/&quot; character is treated as a mail
directory. Mail is delivered there using the qmail maildir
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./file <br>
/path/to/file <br>
A line starting &quot;.&quot; or &quot;/&quot; and NOT
ending with a &quot;/&quot; character specifies an ordinary
Unix mbox file into which the message should be
delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;address <br>
&quot;&amp;&quot; indicates that a copy of the message
should be forwarded to address. You may not place a space
between &amp; and address, nor can address contain angle
brackets, comments, <br>
or anything other than an email address with a
fully-qualified domain name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that in qmail, the &amp;
character is optional for certain email addresses, while
avenger.local always requires the &amp; character.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forwarding happens after all
other lines in the file are processed. If any other
configuration line fails, for instance because a command
executed on behalf of a | line <br>
exits non-zero, the mail is not forwarded to any of the
addresses. (The exception is if a command exits with status
99, in which case mail is forwarded to addresses in all <br>
preceding &amp; lines, but subsequent lines are
ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| command <br>
Specifies that command should be run as a shell command,
with the mail message as its standard input. If command
exits with a status other than 0, processing of the local
<br>
rule file terminates immediately, with avenger.local&rsquo;s
exit status determined by command&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If command&rsquo;s status is 99,
avenger.local exits with status 0, effectively pretending
the command just executed was the last line in the
.avenger/local* file. If command&rsquo;s <br>
exit status is between 64 and 78, inclusive, avenger.local
exits with the same status as command. If command exits with
status 100 or 112, avenger.local exits with status <br>
70. For all other exit values, or if command terminates
because of a signal, avenger.local exits with status 75.
Note that the --qmailexit flag changes this behavior, as
<br>
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the file
/usr/include/sysexits.h for more information on the meaning
of various exit statuses to sendmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;address <br>
&lt;!command <br>
This sets the envelope sender (i.e., bounce address) for
copies of the message forwarded to users with &amp; lines.
Note that one sender address applies to all recipients, <br>
regardless of where in the .avenger/local* file the bounce
address is set. It is not possible to forward from different
bounce addresses for different recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form of this line
simply sets the envelope sender to address. No spaces are
allowed between &lt; and the address. No angle brackets or
comments are allowed either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form of this line
executes command with the shell, giving it the message body
as standard input. If command exits with status 0 and
outputs exactly one line of <br>
text, this line will be interpreted as the new envelope
sender for forwarded copies the message. If command exits
with any of statuses 64-78, 99-100, or 111-112, processing
<br>
of the avenger/.local* halts exactly as for the | command.
For other exit statuses, or if command outputs no lines or
more than one line, the command&rsquo;s result is ignored
and <br>
processing continues with the envelope sender unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! command <br>
Runs command with the shell, giving it the mail message on
standard input. If the command exits 0 and outputs exactly
one line of text beginning &quot;.&quot; or &quot;/&quot;,
the output is <br>
interpreted as either a maildir (if the line ends
&quot;/&quot;) or a mailbox (if it doesn&rsquo;t) to which
the message should be delivered. In other cases, either the
! line is ignored, <br>
or processing halts, as described for the &lt;! command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A completely empty file (not
even containing a comment or blank line), or a missing
.avenger/local (with no extension file), is treated as
equivalent to a file with the line <br>
&quot;./Mailbox&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a extra <br>
Specifies the extra portion of the local part of the email
address after the user name. In other words, if
avenger.local is invoked with arguments -a extra -d user, it
is <br>
equivalent to invoking it with the arguments -d user+extra.
The -a option allows command-line compatibility with
sendmail&rsquo;s procmail interface, which separates out the
user <br>
name from the extension portion of the address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d user <br>
Specifies the local user to deliver mail to. Note that for
compatibility with other local mailers, the -d is optional,
you can simply specify user as the final command-line <br>
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f sender <br>
-r sender <br>
The -f option specifies the envelope sender of the message.
For historical reasons, -r is synonymous with -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t This option is silently
ignored, for command-line compatibility with procmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Ordinarily, when forwarding a
bounce message, avenger.local will invoke sendmail with the
argument -f followed by an empty string argument (i.e.,
specifying an empty from <br>
address). This does not work with some older versions of
sendmail. The -B option says that bounce messages should be
forwarded with arguments -f @ instead, which appears to <br>
produce the desired (MAILER-DAEMON) result with older
versions of sendmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y This option is silently
ignored, for command-line compatibility with procmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fallback program <br>
If the user specified on the command line does not exist or
have a $HOME/.avenger/ directory, or else has UID 0 (root),
or has an invalid shell or an expired account, then <br>
avenger.local will not attempt to deliver mail to the user.
Instead, it will attempt to run the system&rsquo;s normal
mail delivery agent as a fallback. This program is usually
<br>
called mail.local, but you can specify an alternative with
the --falback option. Note that this should be the full path
of the program, and should not contain any arguments. <br>
avenger.local will supply the arguments -f from -d user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fcntl <br>
This option enables fcntl (a.k.a. POSIX) file locking of
mail spools, in addition to flock and dotfile locking. The
advantage of fcntl locking is that it may do the right <br>
thing over NFS. However, if either the NFS client or server
does not properly support fcntl locking, or the file system
is not mounted with the appropriate options, fcntl <br>
locking can fail in one of several ways. It can allow
different processes to lock the same file concurrently--even
on the same machine. It can simply hang when trying to <br>
acquire a lock, even if no other process holds a lock on the
file. Also, on some OSes it can interact badly with flock
locking, because those OSes actually implement flock <br>
in terms of fcntl. For these reasons, avenger.local performs
dotfile and flock locking by default, but not fcntl
locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--qmailexit <br>
When programs from |, !, and &lt;! exit with non-zero exit
status, the --qmailexit flag causes avenger.local to
translate the exit codes to ones more suitable for qmail.
Any <br>
code that would cause a hard error in sendmail causes
avenger.local to exit with 100, any soft error causes exit
code 111, and exit code 99 is passed through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sendmail program <br>
Specifies the program to run to send mail, when users have
lines beginning &quot;&amp;&quot; in their .avenger/local*
files. If program contains spaces, it is broken into
multiple <br>
arguments. The default value for program is &quot;sendmail
-oi -os -oee&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--separator char <br>
Specifies a separator character to place between portions of
the address extension. The default value is &quot;+&quot;.
Thus, the argument -a a+b would cause avenger.local to
search <br>
for files $HOME/.avenger/local+a+b,
$HOME/.avenger/local+a+default, and
$HOME/.avenger/local+default. Specifying a different char,
say &quot;-&quot;, would change the &quot;+&quot; to
&quot;-&quot; in <br>
both the email address and file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--smuser user <br>
By default, sendmail is run as the user under which
avenger.local is invoked, which will ordinarily be root. To
drop privileges before running sendmail, you can specify
this <br>
argument and avenger.local will run sendmail as user. Note
that avenger doesn&rsquo;t run sendmail as the recipient
user, because this often results in undesirable <br>
&quot;X-Authentication-Warning&quot; fields in the header.
If you wish the header to reflect a trail of how a message
has been forwarded, see the --to option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tmpfile template <br>
avenger.local creates a copy of the message in a local file.
template is a template for the name of the file, which must
end with a number of &quot;X&quot; characters, which will be
<br>
replaced by a unique identifier. (This is for use with the
mkstemp(3) library call.) The default value is
&quot;/tmp/msg.XXXXXXXXXX&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--to address (-D address) <br>
Specifies the full envelope recipient address to which this
message is being delivered. With this option, avenger.local
adds a line &quot;Delivered-To: address&quot; to the header
of <br>
the mail message. It also checks that the header did not
previously contain the same line--if the message has already
been delivered to the same address, this indicates a <br>
loop, and avenger.local exits with status 70.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables are set when running
commands specified in lines starting |.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXT The local portion of the
email address following the first separator character (which
is the &quot;+&quot; character, unless set otherwise by
--separator). This variable is not set if <br>
there is no extension in the email address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXT1, EXT2, ... <br>
When EXT itself contains a the separator character, EXT1
contains the part of EXT after the first separator, EXT2 the
part after the second separator, and so on for each <br>
separator character in EXT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST <br>
If a recipient has been specified with the -D recip flag,
this variable will contain the host portion of recip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL <br>
If a recipient has been specified with the -D recip flag,
this variable will contain the local portion of recip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREFIX <br>
SUFFIX, SUFFIX1, SUFFIX2, ... <br>
Assuming the separator is &quot;+&quot;, when processing a
file local+base+default, PREFIX is set to base, while SUFFIX
is set to the portion of the name for which default was <br>
substituted. When the file does not end with default, SUFFIX
is not set. When the file is just local with no extension,
neither PREFIX nor SUFFIX is set. When SUFFIX <br>
itself contains a &quot;+&quot; character, SUFFIX1 contains
to the part of SUFFIX after the first &quot;+&quot;
character, SUFFIX2 contains the part after the second
&quot;+&quot;, and so on for each &quot;+&quot; <br>
character in suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECIPIENT <br>
If the --to option was specified, the RECIPIENT environment
variable is set to the address specified in that option.
Otherwise, RECIPIENT is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECIPIENT_HOST <br>
RECIPIENT_LOCAL <br>
These are the same as HOST and LOCAL, but with all
characters folded to lower-case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPLINE <br>
A &quot;Return-Path:&quot; line suitable for prepending to
the message header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDER <br>
The envelope sender of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDMAIL <br>
The value of the --sendmail option, or &quot;sendmail -oi
-os -oee&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDFROM <br>
This is the same as $SENDER, unless envelope sender is empty
(for a bounce message) and the -B option has been specified,
in which case SENDFROM is &quot;@&quot;. You can forward a
<br>
message on from the same sender with a line like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| $SENDMAIL -f
&quot;$SENDFROM&quot; -- recpient1@host1.com ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEPARATOR <br>
The separator character specified by --separator, or the
default &quot;+&quot; if none has been explicitly
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UFLINE <br>
An mbox &quot;From &quot; line suitable for prepending to
the message before appending it to a mailbox or passing it
to a filter that expects such a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER <br>
The user to whom the message is being delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To use avenger.local with sendmail, you might put the
following in your sendmail m4 configuration file (this is
the file ending .mc that produces your sendmail.cf
file):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURE(&lsquo;local_procmail&rsquo;,
<br>
&lsquo;/usr/local/libexec/avenger.local&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;avenger.local -a $h -d $u&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To deliver mail to a maildir
directory called inbox in your home directory, you would
place the following line in the file
$HOME/.avenger/local:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./inbox/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are subscribed to several
mailing lists, you might wish to spool them in separate
files, so as to read them separately. (For example, the
emacs editor has a newsreader, <br>
GNUS, that lets you read multiple mailboxes more like
newsgroups.) To do this, you should subscribe to each
mailing list under a different address. If your address is
<br>
user@host, you might subscribe to the Mail Avenger mailing
list as user+avenger@host. To spool mail in file
$HOME/Mail/incoming/avenger-list.spool, create a file <br>
$HOME/Mail/.avenger/local+avenger with the following
line:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">./Mail/incoming/avenger-list.spool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a mailing list
user+friends@host for yourself and your friends, create a
file $HOME/Mail/.avenger/local+friends with your inbox and
their addresses, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./inbox/ <br>
&amp;friend1@host1.com <br>
&amp;friend2@host2.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/local/libexec/avenger.local, $HOME/.avenger/local,
$HOME/.avenger/local*, /etc/mail/sendmail.cf,
/usr/local/share/avenger/avsendmail.m4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
avenger.local doesn&rsquo;t necessarily report problems in a
the most useful place when it encounters errors in a
.avenger/local* file. It does send some diagnostics to
standard <br>
error, but these will typically end up in the mail log or in
bounce messages returned to the sender.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avenger.local should always
provide the exact envelope recipient in the RECIPIENT
environment variable. Unfortunately, this information is not
available unless it has been <br>
supplied with the -D flag. Often the envelope recipient is
just &quot;${USER}${SEPARATOR}${EXT}@your.host.name&quot;,
but it might not be if there are aliases or virtual domains.
On <br>
servers with virtual hosts, the actual hostname used will be
unavailable in the general case (though you may be able to
deduce it from $USER and $EXT if you know your particular
<br>
setup). Note that it is possible to configure sendmail to
supply the full recipient address. Mail avenger comes with
example sendmail configuration directives that can be <br>
included in your sendmail.mc m4 configuration file; see
/usr/local/share/avenger/avsendmail.m4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To protect against concurrent
accesses to mbox format files, avenger.local uses both flock
and dotfiles to lock mailboxes. However, it does not use
fcntl/lockf-style locking by <br>
default. Thus, if your mail reader exclusively uses fcntl
for locking, there will be race conditions unless you
specify the --fcntl option.</p>
