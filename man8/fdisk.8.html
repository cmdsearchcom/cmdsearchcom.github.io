<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fdisk (in the first form of invocation) is a menu-driven
program for creation and manipulation of partition tables.
It understands DOS-type partition tables and BSD- or
SUN-type <br>
disklabels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fdisk does not understand GUID
partition tables (GPTs) and it is not designed for large
partitions. In these cases, use the more advanced GNU
parted(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fdisk does not use
DOS-compatible mode and cylinders as display units by
default. The old deprecated DOS behavior can be enabled with
the &rsquo;-c=dos -u=cylinders&rsquo; command-line <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hard disks can be divided into
one or more logical disks called partitions. This division
is recorded in the partition table, found in sector 0 of the
disk. (In the BSD world <br>
one talks about &lsquo;disk slices&rsquo; and a
&lsquo;disklabel&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux needs at least one
partition, namely for its root file system. It can use swap
files and/or swap partitions, but the latter are more
efficient. So, usually one will want <br>
a second Linux partition dedicated as swap partition. On
Intel-compatible hardware, the BIOS that boots the system
can often only access the first 1024 cylinders of the disk.
<br>
For this reason people with large disks often create a third
partition, just a few MB large, typically mounted on /boot,
to store the kernel image and a few auxiliary files <br>
needed at boot time, so as to make sure that this stuff is
accessible to the BIOS. There may be reasons of security,
ease of administration and backup, or testing, to use more
<br>
than the minimum number of partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICES <br>
The device is usually /dev/sda, /dev/sdb or so. A device
name refers to the entire disk. Old systems without libata
(a library used inside the Linux kernel to support ATA host
<br>
controllers and devices) make a difference between IDE and
SCSI disks. In such cases the device name will be /dev/hd*
(IDE) or /dev/sd* (SCSI).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The partition is a device name
followed by a partition number. For example, /dev/sda1 is
the first partition on the first hard disk in the system.
See also Linux kernel docu&acirc; <br>
mentation (the Documentation/devices.txt file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISK LABELS <br>
A BSD/SUN-type disklabel can describe 8 partitions, the
third of which should be a &lsquo;whole disk&rsquo;
partition. Do not start a partition that actually uses its
first sector (like a <br>
swap partition) at cylinder 0, since that will destroy the
disklabel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An IRIX/SGI-type disklabel can
describe 16 partitions, the eleventh of which should be an
entire &lsquo;volume&rsquo; partition, while the ninth
should be labeled &lsquo;volume header&rsquo;. The
vol&acirc; <br>
ume header will also cover the partition table, i.e., it
starts at block zero and extends by default over five
cylinders. The remaining space in the volume header may be
used by <br>
header directory entries. No partitions may overlap with the
volume header. Also do not change its type or make some
filesystem on it, since you will lose the partition table.
<br>
Use this type of label only when working with Linux on
IRIX/SGI machines or IRIX/SGI disks under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A DOS-type partition table can
describe an unlimited number of partitions. In sector 0
there is room for the description of 4 partitions (called
&lsquo;primary&rsquo;). One of these may be <br>
an extended partition; this is a box holding logical
partitions, with descriptors found in a linked list of
sectors, each preceding the corresponding logical
partitions. The <br>
four primary partitions, present or not, get numbers 1-4.
Logical partitions start numbering from 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a DOS-type partition table
the starting offset and the size of each partition is stored
in two ways: as an absolute number of sectors (given in 32
bits), and as a Cylin&acirc; <br>
ders/Heads/Sectors triple (given in 10+8+6 bits). The former
is OK -- with 512-byte sectors this will work up to 2 TB.
The latter has two problems. First, these C/H/S fields <br>
can be filled only when the number of heads and the number
of sectors per track are known. And second, even if we know
what these numbers should be, the 24 bits that are
avail&acirc; <br>
able do not suffice. DOS uses C/H/S only, Windows uses both,
Linux never uses C/H/S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If possible, fdisk will obtain
the disk geometry automatically. This is not necessarily the
physical disk geometry (indeed, modern disks do not really
have anything like a phys&acirc; <br>
ical geometry, certainly not something that can be described
in simplistic Cylinders/Heads/Sectors form), but it is the
disk geometry that MS-DOS uses for the partition table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually all goes well by
default, and there are no problems if Linux is the only
system on the disk. However, if the disk has to be shared
with other operating systems, it is <br>
often a good idea to let an fdisk from another operating
system make at least one partition. When Linux boots it
looks at the partition table, and tries to deduce what
(fake) <br>
geometry is required for good cooperation with other
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever a partition table is
printed out, a consistency check is performed on the
partition table entries. This check verifies that the
physical and logical start and end <br>
points are identical, and that each partition starts and
ends on a cylinder boundary (except for the first
partition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some versions of MS-DOS create a
first partition which does not begin on a cylinder boundary,
but on sector 2 of the first cylinder. Partitions beginning
in cylinder 1 cannot <br>
begin on a cylinder boundary, but this is unlikely to cause
difficulty unless you have OS/2 on your machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A sync() and an ioctl(BLKRRPART)
(reread partition table from disk) are performed before
exiting when the partition table has been updated. Long ago
it used to be necessary to <br>
reboot after the use of fdisk. I do not think this is the
case anymore -- indeed, rebooting too quickly might cause
loss of not-yet-written data. Note that both the kernel and
<br>
the disk hardware may buffer data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS 6.x WARNING <br>
The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the
first sector of the data area of the partition, and treats
this information as more reliable than the information in
<br>
the partition table. DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear
the first 512 bytes of the data area of a partition whenever
a size change occurs. DOS FORMAT will look at this extra
<br>
information even if the /U flag is given -- we consider this
a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bottom line is that if you
use cfdisk or fdisk to change the size of a DOS partition
table entry, then you must also use dd to zero the first 512
bytes of that partition <br>
before using DOS FORMAT to format the partition. For
example, if you were using cfdisk to make a DOS partition
table entry for /dev/sda1, then (after exiting fdisk or
cfdisk and <br>
rebooting Linux so that the partition table information is
valid) you would use the command &quot;dd if=/dev/zero
of=/dev/sda1 bs=512 count=1&quot; to zero the first 512
bytes of the par&acirc; <br>
tition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL if you use
the dd command, since a small typo can make all of the data
on your disk useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, you should
always use an OS-specific partition table program. For
example, you should make DOS partitions with the DOS FDISK
program and Linux partitions with <br>
the Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b sectorsize <br>
Specify the sector size of the disk. Valid values are 512,
1024, 2048 or 4096. (Recent kernels know the sector size.
Use this only on old kernels or to override the <br>
kernel&rsquo;s ideas.) Since util-linux-2.17, fdisk
differentiates between logical and physical sector size.
This option changes both sector sizes to sectorsize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c[=mode] <br>
Specify the compatibility mode, &rsquo;dos&rsquo; or
&rsquo;nondos&rsquo;. The default is non-DOS mode. For
backward compatibility, it is possible to use the option
without the &lt;mode&gt; argument <br>
-- then the default is used. Note that the optional
&lt;mode&gt; argument cannot be separated from the -c option
by a space, the correct form is for example
&rsquo;-c=dos&rsquo;. This <br>
option is DEPRECATED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cyls <br>
Specify the number of cylinders of the disk. I have no idea
why anybody would want to do so. This option is
DEPRECATED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H heads <br>
Specify the number of heads of the disk. (Not the physical
number, of course, but the number used for partition
tables.) Reasonable values are 255 and 16. This option is
<br>
DEPRECATED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S sects <br>
Specify the number of sectors per track of the disk. (Not
the physical number, of course, but the number used for
partition tables.) A reasonable value is 63. This <br>
option is DEPRECATED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print help and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the partition tables for
the specified devices and then exit. If no devices are
given, those mentioned in /proc/partitions (if that exists)
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s partition... <br>
Print the size (in blocks) of each given partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u[=unit] <br>
When listing partition tables, show sizes in
&rsquo;sectors&rsquo; or in &rsquo;cylinders&rsquo;. The
default is to show sizes in sectors. For backward
compatibility, it is possible to use the <br>
option without the &lt;units&gt; argument -- then the
default is used. Note that the optional &lt;unit&gt;
argument cannot be separated from the -u option by a space,
the correct <br>
form is for example &rsquo;-u=cylinders&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version number of fdisk
program and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
FDISK_DEBUG=0xffff <br>
enables debug output</p>
