<p>I2CSET(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual I2CSET(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
i2cset - set I2C registers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
i2cset [-f] [-y] [-m mask] [-r] i2cbus chip-address
data-address [value] ... [mode] <br>
i2cset -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
i2cset is a small helper program to set registers visible
through the I2C bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force access to the device
even if it is already busy. By default, i2cset will refuse
to access a device which is already under the control of a
kernel driver. Using this <br>
flag is dangerous, it can seriously confuse the kernel
driver in question. It can also cause i2cset to silently
write to the wrong register. So use at your own risk and
<br>
only if you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Disable interactive mode. By
default, i2cset will wait for a confirmation from the user
before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it
will perform the opera&acirc; <br>
tion directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mask <br>
The mask parameter, if specified, describes which bits of
value will be actually written to data-address. Bits set to
1 in the mask are taken from value, while bits set to <br>
0 will be read from data-address and thus preserved by the
operation. Please note that this parameter assumes that the
read and write operations for the specified mode are <br>
symmetrical for the device you are accessing. This may or
may not be the case, as neither I2C nor SMBus guarantees
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read back the value right
after writing it, and compare the result with the value
written. This used to be the default behavior. The same
limitations apply as those of <br>
option -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three required options
to i2cset. i2cbus indicates the number or name of the I2C
bus to be scanned. This number should correspond to one of
the busses listed by i2cde&acirc; <br>
tect -l. chip-address specifies the address of the chip on
that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and 0x77.
data-address specifies the address on that chip to write to,
and is <br>
an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value parameter, if
specified, is the value to write to that location on the
chip. If this parameter is omitted, then a short write is
issued. For most chips, it simply sets <br>
an internal pointer to the target location, but
doesn&rsquo;t actually write to that location. For a few
chips though, in particular simple ones with a single
register, this short <br>
write is an actual write. If the mode parameter is s or i,
multiple values can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode parameter, if
specified, is one of the letters b, w, s, or i,
corresponding to a write size of a single byte, a 16-bit
word, a SMBus block write, or an I2C block write, <br>
respectively. For SMBus and I2C block writes, the write size
is determined by the number of value parameters. Except for
I2C block writes, a p can also be appended to the mode <br>
parameter to enable PEC. If the mode parameter is omitted,
i2cset defaults to byte mode without PEC. The value provided
must be within range for the specified data type <br>
(0x00-0xFF for byte and block writes, 0x0000-0xFFFF for
words). Another possible mode is c, which doesn&rsquo;t
write any value (so-called short write). You usually
don&rsquo;t have to <br>
specify this mode, as it is the default when no value is
provided, unless you also want to enable PEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
i2cset can be extremely dangerous if used improperly. It can
confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss, or have more serious
side effects. Writing to a serial EEPROM on a memory DIMM
<br>
(chip addresses between 0x50 and 0x57) may DESTROY your
memory, leaving your system unbootable! Be extremely careful
using this program.</p>
