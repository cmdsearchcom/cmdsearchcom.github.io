<p>PPTP(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual PPTP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pptp - PPTP driver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pptp &lt;pptp-server-IP&gt; &lt;pptp-options&gt;
[ppp-options] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pptp establishes the client side of a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) using the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
(PPTP). Use this program to connect to an employer&rsquo;s
PPTP based <br>
VPN, or to certain cable and ADSL service providers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pptp establishes the
PPTP call to the PPTP server, and then starts an instance of
pppd to manage the data transfer. However, pptp can also be
run as a connection <br>
manager within pppd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The first non-option argument on the pptp command line must
be the host name or IP address of the PPTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All long options (starting with
&quot;--&quot;) are interpreted as pptp options, and a fatal
error occurs if an unrecognised option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All command-line arguments which
do not start with &quot;-&quot; are interpreted as ppp
options, and passed as is to pppd unless --nolaunchpppd is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--phone &lt;number&gt; <br>
Pass &lt;number&gt; to remote host as phone number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nolaunchpppd <br>
Do not launch pppd but use stdin as the network connection.
Use this flag when including pptp as a pppd connection
process using the pty option. See EXAMPLES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quirks &lt;quirk&gt; <br>
Work around a buggy PPTP implementation, adopts special case
handling for particular PPTP servers and ADSL modems.
Currently recognised values are BEZEQ_ISRAEL only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Run in foreground (for debugging with gdb)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sync Enable Synchronous HDLC
(pppd must use it too)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout &lt;secs&gt; <br>
Time to wait for reordered packets (0.01 to 10 secs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nobuffer <br>
Completely disables buffering and reordering of packets. Any
--timeout specified will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--idle-wait &lt;secs&gt; <br>
Time to wait before sending a control connection echo
request. The RFC2637 default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-echo-wait &lt;secs&gt;
<br>
Time to wait for an echo reply before closing the control
connection. The RFC2637 default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logstring &lt;name&gt; <br>
Use &lt;name&gt; instead of &rsquo;anon&rsquo; in syslog
messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--localbind &lt;addr&gt; <br>
Bind to specified IP address instead of wildcard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rtmark &lt;n&gt; <br>
Use specified policy routing mark for all packets. This
causes both the TCP control connection&rsquo;s packets as
well as the GRE packets to bear the given policy routing /
<br>
netfilter mark. This can be used with ip rule (from
iproute2) to use a separate routing table for the pptp
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(requires root privileges or the
CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nohostroute <br>
Do not configure a host route pointing towards the PPTP
server. (cf. ROUTING below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loglevel &lt;level&gt; <br>
Sets the debugging level (0=low, 1=default, 2=high)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test-type &lt;n&gt; <br>
Enable packet reordering tests that damage the integrity of
the packet stream to the server. Use this only when testing
servers. Zero is the default, and means that <br>
packets are sent in the correct order. A value of one (1)
causes a single swap between two packets, such that the
sequence numbers might be 1 2 3 4 6 5 7 8 9. A value of <br>
two (2) causes ten packets to be buffered, then sent out of
order but ascending, such that the sequence numbers might be
1 2 3 4 16 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 18 19 20. <br>
A value of three (3) causes ten packets to be buffered, then
sent in the reverse order, like this; 1 2 3 4 16 15 14 13 12
11 10 9 8 7 6 5 17 18 19 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test-rate &lt;n&gt; <br>
Sets the number of packets to pass before causing a
reordering test. Default is 100. Has no effect if test-type
is zero. The result of test types 2 and 3 are undefined <br>
if this value is less than ten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROUTING <br>
When PPTP is used in conjunction with a default route on top
of the tunnel (or just any route encompassing the PPTP
server), the mechanics of routing would cause the PPTP
packets <br>
themselves to be routed over the tunnel. This would result
in an encapsulation loop, destroying connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pptp by default works around
this by looking up the route towards the PPTP server at
startup and configures a host route with that data. This
essentially &quot;freezes&quot; routing for <br>
PPTP packets at the startup configuration. This behaviour
can be disabled with --nohostroute if undesired (like when
using --rtmark to implement policy routing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NB: the route added by pptp is
currently not deleted at exit!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUIRKS <br>
BEZEQ_ISRAEL <br>
modifies packets to interoperate with Orckit ADSL modems on
the BEZEQ network in Israel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Connection to a Microsoft Windows VPN Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pppd noauth nobsdcomp nodeflate
require-mppe-128 name domain\\username remotename PPTP pty
&quot;pptp 10.0.0.5 --nolaunchpppd&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the chap-secrets file
used by pppd must include an entry for domain\username</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATISTICS <br>
The pptp process collects statistics when sending and
receiving GRE packets. They are intended to be useful for
debugging poor PPTP performance and for general monitoring
of link <br>
quality. The statistics are cumulative since the pptp
process was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The statistics can be viewed by
sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the &quot;GRE-to-PPP
Gateway&quot; process, which will cause it to dump them to
the system logs (at the LOG_NOTICE level). A <br>
better way to present the statistics to applications is
being sought (e.g. SNMP?).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following statistics are
collected at the time of writing (April 2003):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx accepted <br>
the number of GRE packets successfully passed to PPP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx lost <br>
the number of packets never received, and presumed lost in
the network</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx under win <br>
the number of packets which were duplicates or had old
sequence numbers (this might be caused by a
packet-reordering network if your reordering timeout is set
too low)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx over win <br>
the number of packets which were too far ahead in the
sequence to be reordered (might be caused by loss of more
than 300 packets in a row)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx buffered <br>
the number of packets which were slightly ahead of sequence,
and were either buffered for reordering, or if buffering is
disabled, accepted immediately (resulting in the <br>
intermediate packets being discarded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx OS errors <br>
the number of times where the operating system reported an
error when we tried to read a packet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx truncated <br>
the number of times we received a packet which was shorter
than the length implied by the GRE header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx invalid <br>
the number of times we received a packet which had invalid
or unsupported flags set in the header, wrong version, or
wrong protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rx acks <br>
the number of pure acknowledgements received (without data).
Too many of these will waste bandwidth, and might be solved
by tuning the remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tx sent <br>
the number of GRE packets sent with data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tx failed <br>
the number of packets we tried to send, but the OS reported
an error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tx short <br>
the number of times the OS would not let us write a complete
packet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tx acks <br>
the number of times we sent a pure ack, without data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tx oversize <br>
the number of times we couldn&rsquo;t send a packet because
it was over PACKET_MAX bytes long</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">round trip <br>
the estimated round-trip time in milliseconds</p>
