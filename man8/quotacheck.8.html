<p>quotacheck(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
quotacheck(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
quotacheck - scan a filesystem for disk usage, create, check
and repair quota files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
quotacheck [ -gubcfinvdMmR ] [ -F quota-format ] -a |
filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
quotacheck examines each filesystem, builds a table of
current disk usage, and compares this table against that
recorded in the disk quota file for the filesystem (this
step is <br>
omitted if option -c is specified). If any inconsistencies
are detected, both the quota file and the current system
copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only
<br>
occurs if an active filesystem is checked which is not
advised). By default, only user quotas are checked.
quotacheck expects each filesystem to be checked to have
quota files <br>
named [a]quota.user and [a]quota.group located at the root
of the associated filesystem. If a file is not present,
quotacheck will create it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the quota file is corrupted,
quotacheck tries to save as much data as possible. Rescuing
data may need user intervention. With no additional options
quotacheck will simply <br>
exit in such a situation. When in interactive mode (option
-i) , the user is asked for advice. Advice can also be
provided from command line (see option -n) , which is useful
<br>
when quotacheck is run automatically (ie. from script) and
failure is unacceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quotacheck should be run each
time the system boots and mounts non-valid filesystems. This
is most likely to happen after a system crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is strongly recommended to
run quotacheck with quotas turned off for the filesystem.
Otherwise, possible damage or loss to data in the quota
files can result. It is also <br>
unwise to run quotacheck on a live filesystem as actual
usage may change during the scan. To prevent this,
quotacheck tries to remount the filesystem read-only before
starting <br>
the scan. After the scan is done it remounts the filesystem
read-write. You can disable this with option -m. You can
also make quotacheck ignore the failure to remount the <br>
filesystem read-only with option -M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --backup <br>
Forces quotacheck to make backups of the quota file before
writing the new data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
quotacheck reports its operation as it progresses. Normally
it operates silently. If the option is specified twice, also
the current directory is printed (note that <br>
printing can slow down the scan measurably).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Enable debugging mode. It will result in a lot of
information which can be used in debugging the program. The
output is very verbose and the scan will be slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user <br>
Only user quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems
specified are to be checked. This is the default action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --group <br>
Only group quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems
specified are to be checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --create-files <br>
Don&rsquo;t read existing quota files. Just perform a new
scan and save it to disk. quotacheck also skips scanning of
old quota files when they are not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Forces checking and writing of new quota files on
filesystems with quotas enabled. This is not recommended as
the created quota files may be out of sync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --try-remount <br>
This flag forces checking of filesystem in read-write mode
if a remount fails. Do this only when you are sure no
process will write to a filesystem while scanning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --no-remount <br>
Don&rsquo;t try to remount filesystem read-only. See comment
with option -M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interactive <br>
Interactive mode. By default quotacheck exits when it finds
an error. In interactive mode user is asked for input
instead. See option -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --use-first-dquot <br>
If the quota files become corrupted, it is possible for
duplicate entries for a single user or group ID to exist.
Normally in this case, quotacheck exits or asks user for
<br>
input. When this option is set, the first entry found is
always used (this option works in interactive mode too).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --format=format-name <br>
Check and fix quota files of specified format (ie.
don&rsquo;t perform format auto-detection). This is
recommended as detection might not work well on corrupted
quota files. <br>
Possible format names are: vfsold Original quota format with
16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format with 32-bit UIDs /
GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode usage and <br>
limits, vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit quota limits and
usage, rpc (quota over NFS), xfs (quota on XFS
filesystem)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in /etc/mtab</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --exclude-root <br>
When used together with the -a option, all filesystems
except for the root filesystem are checked for quotas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
quotacheck should only be run by super-user. Non-privileged
users are presumably not allowed to read all the directories
on the given filesystem.</p>
