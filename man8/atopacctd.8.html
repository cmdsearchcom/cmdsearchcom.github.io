<b>atopacctd</b> - process accounting daemon

The <i>atopacctd</i> daemon switches on the process accounting feature in the
  kernel and let the process accounting records be written to a file, called the
  source file from now. After process accounting is activated, the
  <i>atopacctd</i> daemon transfers every process accounting record that is
  available in the source file to a shadow file. Client processes (like
  <i>atop</i> processes) will read the shadow files instead of the process
  accounting source file.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
In this way, the <i>atopacctd</i> daemon operates as a 'layer' between the
  process accounting file that is written by the kernel and the shadow
  accounting files that are read by <i>atop</i> processes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This approach has the following advantages:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>atopacctd</i> daemon takes care that the source file
      is kept to a limited size. As soon as its maximum size is reached, it is
      truncated to a size of zero again (this is not noticed by the <i>atop</i>
      processes).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>atopacct</i> daemon takes care that a shadow file is
      kept to a limited size. As soon as the current shadow file reaches this
      maximum size, the <i>atopacctd</i> daemon creates a new (subsequent)
      shadow file. While client processes still have the possibility to read the
      previous shadow file(s), the <i>atopacctd</i> daemon continues writing
      accounting records to the newest (current) shadow file. For this reason,
      the name of a shadow file consists of a 10-digit sequence number followed
      by the extension '.paf' (process acounting file). Old shadow files that
      are not used by client processes any more, are automatically removed by
      the garbage collector in the <i>atopacctd</i> daemon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When no client processes are active (any more), all shadow
      files will be deleted and no records will be transferred to a shadow file
      any more. As soon as at least one client is activate again, the
      <i>atopacctd</i> daemon continues writing shadow files.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The directory <b>/run</b> is used as the default topdirectory. Below this
  top-directory, the source file <b>pacct_source</b> is created to which the
  kernel writes the process accounting records.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Furthermore, the subdirectory <b>pacct_shadow.d</b> is created as a 'container'
  for the shadow files. Apart from the shadow files, also the file
  <b>current</b> is maintained in this subdirectory, containing the sequence
  number of the current (newest) shadow file and the maximum number of records
  that will be written in each shadow file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An alternative topdirectory can be specified as command line argument. When an
  alternative topdirectory is defined, also modify the configuration file
  <b>/etc/atoprc</b> to inform <i>atop</i> clients about this alternative
  location (see the <b>atoprc</b> man page). Such alternative topdirectory
  should be owned by root and may not be writable for the group or others
  (security reasons).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice that the kernel suspends writing process accounting records when the free
  space of the filesystem on which the process accounting file resides drops
  below 2%. Writing is resumed when the free space is 4% or more. These lowwater
  and highwater percentages can be configured via the
  <b>/proc/sys/kernel/acct</b> pseudo-file.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>atopacctd</i> daemon suspends transferring process accounting records to
  shadow files when the free space of the filesystem on which the process
  accounting file resides drops below 5%. Transfer is resumed when the free
  space is 5% or more. Log messages are generated via syslog when writing to the
  current shadow file is suspended or resumed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-v</b> flag can be used to verify the version of the <i>atopacctd</i>
  daemon.
