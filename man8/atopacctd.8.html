<p>ATOPACCTD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ATOPACCTD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
atopacctd - process accounting daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
atopacctd [-v | topdirectory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The atopacctd daemon switches on the process accounting
feature in the kernel and let the process accounting records
be written to a file, called the source file from now. After
<br>
process accounting is activated, the atopacctd daemon
transfers every process accounting record that is available
in the source file to a shadow file. Client processes (like
<br>
atop processes) will read the shadow files instead of the
process accounting source file. <br>
In this way, the atopacctd daemon operates as a
&rsquo;layer&rsquo; between the process accounting file that
is written by the kernel and the shadow accounting files
that are read by atop <br>
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This approach has the following
advantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The atopacctd daemon takes
care that the source file is kept to a limited size. As soon
as its maximum size is reached, it is truncated to a size of
zero again (this is not <br>
noticed by the atop processes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The atopacct daemon takes care
that a shadow file is kept to a limited size. As soon as the
current shadow file reaches this maximum size, the atopacctd
daemon creates a new <br>
(subsequent) shadow file. While client processes still have
the possibility to read the previous shadow file(s), the
atopacctd daemon continues writing accounting records to
<br>
the newest (current) shadow file. For this reason, the name
of a shadow file consists of a 10-digit sequence number
followed by the extension &rsquo;.paf&rsquo; (process
acounting file). <br>
Old shadow files that are not used by client processes any
more, are automatically removed by the garbage collector in
the atopacctd daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o When no client processes are
active (any more), all shadow files will be deleted and no
records will be transferred to a shadow file any more. As
soon as at least one client <br>
is activate again, the atopacctd daemon continues writing
shadow files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory /run is used as
the default topdirectory. Below this top-directory, the
source file pacct_source is created to which the kernel
writes the process accounting <br>
records. <br>
Furthermore, the subdirectory pacct_shadow.d is created as a
&rsquo;container&rsquo; for the shadow files. Apart from the
shadow files, also the file current is maintained in this
subdirec&acirc; <br>
tory, containing the sequence number of the current (newest)
shadow file and the maximum number of records that will be
written in each shadow file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative topdirectory can
be specified as command line argument. When an alternative
topdirectory is defined, also modify the configuration file
/etc/atoprc to inform atop <br>
clients about this alternative location (see the atoprc man
page). Such alternative topdirectory should be owned by root
and may not be writable for the group or others (secu&acirc;
<br>
rity reasons).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that the kernel suspends
writing process accounting records when the free space of
the filesystem on which the process accounting file resides
drops below 2%. Writing is <br>
resumed when the free space is 4% or more. These lowwater
and highwater percentages can be configured via the
/proc/sys/kernel/acct pseudo-file. <br>
The atopacctd daemon suspends transferring process
accounting records to shadow files when the free space of
the filesystem on which the process accounting file resides
drops <br>
below 5%. Transfer is resumed when the free space is 5% or
more. Log messages are generated via syslog when writing to
the current shadow file is suspended or resumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v flag can be used to
verify the version of the atopacctd daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/run/pacct_source <br>
Regular file to which the kernel writes the process
accounting records. This file will be regularly
truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/run/pacct_shadow.d/current <br>
Regular file containing the sequence number of the current
shadow file and the maximum number of records per shadow
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/run/pacct_shadow.d/N.paf <br>
Regular files containing the process accounting records that
have been copied transparently from the source file (N
represents a 10-digit sequence number).</p>
