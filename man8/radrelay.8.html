<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
radrelay -- Deprecated command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The functions of radrelay have been added to radiusd. One
benefit is that one instance of radiusd can read multiple
detail files, among others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rlm_sql_log module does
something similar, but for SQL queries. See it&rsquo;s man
page for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPLICATION FOR BACKUPS <br>
Many sites run multiple radius servers; at least one primary
and one backup server. When the primary goes down, most
NASes detect that and switch to the backup server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That will cause your accounting
packets to go the the backup server - and some NASes
don&rsquo;t even switch back to the primary server when it
comes back up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result is that accounting
records are missed, and/or the administrator must jump
through hoops in order to combine the different detail files
from multiple servers. It also <br>
means that the session database (&quot;radutmp&quot;, used
for radwho and simultaneous use detection) gets out of
sync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We solve this issue by
&quot;relaying&quot; packets from one server to another, so
they both have the same set of accounting data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
raddb/sites-available/buffered-sql for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUFFERING FOR HIGH-LOAD SERVERS
<br>
If the RADIUS server suddenly receives a many accounting
packets, there may be insufficient CPU power to process them
all in a timely manner. This problem is especially
notica&acirc; <br>
ble when the accounting packets are going to a back-end
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, you may have one
database that tracks &quot;live&quot; sessions, and another
that tracks historical accounting data. In that case,
accessing the first database is fast, as it <br>
is small. Accessing the second database many be slower, as
it may contain multiple gigabytes of data. In addition,
writing to the first database in a timely manner is
impor&acirc; <br>
tant, while data may be written to the second database with
a few minutes delay, without any harm being done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
raddb/sites-available/copy-to-home-server for more
information.</p>
