The functions of <i>radrelay</i> have been added to <i>radiusd</i>. One benefit
  is that one instance of <i>radiusd</i> can read multiple detail files, among
  others.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>rlm_sql_log</i> module does something similar, but for SQL queries. See
  it's man page for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPLICATION_FOR_BACKUPS"><a class="selflink" href="#REPLICATION_FOR_BACKUPS">REPLICATION
  FOR BACKUPS</a></h1>
Many sites run multiple radius servers; at least one primary and one backup
  server. When the primary goes down, most NASes detect that and switch to the
  backup server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
That will cause your accounting packets to go the the backup server - and some
  NASes don't even switch back to the primary server when it comes back up.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The result is that accounting records are missed, and/or the administrator must
  jump through hoops in order to combine the different detail files from
  multiple servers. It also means that the session database
  (&quot;radutmp&quot;, used for radwho and simultaneous use detection) gets out
  of sync.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
We solve this issue by &quot;relaying&quot; packets from one server to another,
  so they both have the same set of accounting data.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See raddb/sites-available/buffered-sql for more information.

If the RADIUS server suddenly receives a many accounting packets, there may be
  insufficient CPU power to process them all in a timely manner. This problem is
  especially noticable when the accounting packets are going to a back-end
  database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Similarly, you may have one database that tracks &quot;live&quot; sessions, and
  another that tracks historical accounting data. In that case, accessing the
  first database is fast, as it is small. Accessing the second database many be
  slower, as it may contain multiple gigabytes of data. In addition, writing to
  the first database in a timely manner is important, while data may be written
  to the second database with a few minutes delay, without any harm being done.
