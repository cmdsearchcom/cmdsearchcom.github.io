<p>FWLOGWATCH(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FWLOGWATCH(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fwlogwatch - a firewall log analyzer and realtime response
agent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fwlogwatch [options] [input_files]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fwlogwatch produces Linux ipchains, Linux
netfilter/iptables, Solaris/BSD/IRIX/HP-UX ipfilter, ipfw,
Cisco IOS, Cisco PIX/ASA, NetScreen, Elsa Lancom router and
Snort IDS log <br>
summary reports in plain text and HTML form and has a lot of
options to analyze and display relevant patterns. It also
can run as daemon (with web interface) doing realtime log
<br>
monitoring and reporting anomalies or starting attack
countermeasures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
These options are independent from the main modes of
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show the available
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Show time of the first and
the last log entry. The input file(s) can be compressed or
plain log file(s). Summary mode will show the time of the
first and last packet log <br>
entry, this log times mode will show the time of the first
and last entry overall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show version and copyright
information and the options used to compile fwlogwatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
The global options for all modes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Show the amount of data in
bytes this entry represents, this is the sum of total packet
lengths of packets matching this rule (obviously only
available for log formats <br>
that contain this information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config <br>
Use the alternate configuration file config instead of the
default configuration file /etc/fwlogwatch.config (which
does not need to exist). Only options not specified in <br>
the files can be overridden by command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not differentiate
destination IP addresses. Useful for finding scans in whole
subnets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Differentiate destination
ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E format <br>
Specific hosts, ports, chains and branches (targets) can be
selected or excluded, selections an exclusions can be added
and combined. The format is composed of one of the <br>
functions i include or e exclude, then one of the parameters
h host, p port, c chain or b branch. In case of a host or
port a third parameter for s source or d destination <br>
is needed. Finally, the object is directly appended, in case
of a host this is an IP address (networks can be specified
in CIDR format), port is a number and chain and <br>
branch are strings. To show entries with destination port 25
you would use -Eipd25 and to exclude entries which have the
class C network 192.168.1.0 as source or belong to <br>
the chain INPUT: -Eehs192.168.1.0/24 -EecINPUT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file <br>
If your logs contain private IP addresses that are not
resolvable through DNS but you want reports with meaningful
host names or you have any other reason to influence the
<br>
host names in reports you can initialize the DNS cache with
your own list of IP/name pairs. The file should be in the
same format as /etc/hosts and will not be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M number <br>
If you only want to see a fixed maximum amount of entries
(e.g. the &quot;top 20&quot;) this option will trim the
output for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m count <br>
When analyzing large amounts of data you usually
aren&rsquo;t interested in entries that have a small count.
You can hide entries below a certain threshold with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Enable service lookups. The
service name for a specific port number and protocol will be
looked up in /etc/services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Enable DNS lookups. Host
names will be resolved (reverse and forward lookup with a
warning if they don&rsquo;t match). If this makes summary
generation very slow (this happens <br>
when a lot of different hosts appear in the log file) you
should use a version of fwlogwatch compiled with GNU adns
support. Resolved host names are cached in memory for <br>
as long as fwlogwatch is running, the DNS cache can be
initialized with the -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O order <br>
This is the sort order of the summary and packet cache.
Since entries often are equal in certain fields you can sort
by several fields one after another (the sort algo&acirc;
<br>
rithm is stable, so equal entries will remain sorted in the
order they were sorted before). The sort string can be
composed of up to 11 fields of the form ab where a is <br>
the sort criteria: c count, t start time, e end time, z
duration, n target name, p protocol, b byte count (sum of
total packet lengths), S source host, s source port, D <br>
destination host and d destination port. b is the direction:
a ascending and d descending. Sorting is done in the order
specified, so the last option is the primary cri&acirc; <br>
teria. The default in summary mode is tacd (start with the
highest count, if two counts match list the one earlier in
time first) of which ta is built in, so if you spec&acirc;
<br>
ify an empty sort string or everything else is equal entries
will be sorted ascending by time. The realtime response mode
default is cd ( ta is not built in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P format <br>
Only use certain parsers, where the log format can be one or
a combination of: i ipchains, n netfilter, f ipfilter, b
ipfw, c Cisco IOS, p Cisco PIX/ASA, e NetScreen, l <br>
Elsa Lancom and s Snort. The default is to use all parsers
except the ones for NetScreen, Elsa Lancom and Snort
logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Differentiate protocols. This
is activated automatically if you differentiate source
and/or destination ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Differentiate source
ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U title <br>
Set title as title of the report and status page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. You can specify
it twice for more information. In very verbose mode while
parsing the log file you will see &quot;.&quot; for relevant
packet filter log entries, &quot;r&quot; <br>
for &rsquo;last message repeated&rsquo; entries concerning
packet filter logs, &quot;o&quot; for packet filter log
entries that are too old and &quot;_&quot; for entries that
are not packet filter logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Differentiate TCP options.
All packets with a SYN are listed separately, other TCP
flags are shown in full format if they are available
(ipchains does not log them, net&acirc; <br>
filter and ipfilter do, Cisco IOS doesn&rsquo;t even log
SYNs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG SUMMARY MODE <br>
This are additional options that are only available in log
summary mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C email <br>
A carbon copy of the summary will be sent by email to this
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Show timestamp of the last
packet logged for this entry. End times are only available
if there is more than one packet log entry with unique
characteristics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F email <br>
Set the sender address of the email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l time <br>
Process recent events only. See TIME FORMAT below for the
time options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Specify an output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Do not differentiate source
IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T email <br>
The summary will be sent by email to this address. If HTML
output is selected the report will be embedded as attachment
so HTML-aware mail clients can show it directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Show timestamp of the first
packet logged for this entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Look up information about the
source addresses in the whois database. This is slow, please
don&rsquo;t stress the registry with too many queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Produce output in HTML format
(XHTML 1.1 with CSS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Show time interval between
start and end time of packet log entries. This is only
available if there is more than one packet log entry with
unique characteristics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REALTIME RESPONSE MODE <br>
-R Enter realtime response mode. This means: detach and run
as daemon until the TERM signal (kill) is received. The HUP
signal forces a reload of the configuration file, the <br>
USR1 signal forces fwlogwatch to reopen and read the input
file from the beginning (useful e.g. for log rotation). All
output can be followed in the system log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a count <br>
Alert threshold. Notify or start countermeasures if this
limit is reached. Defaults to 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l time <br>
Forget events that happened this long ago (defaults to 1
day). See TIME FORMAT below for the time options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k IP/net <br>
This option defines a host or network in CIDR notation that
will never be blocked or other actions taken against. To
specify more than one, use the -k parameter again for <br>
each IP address or network you want to add.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A The notification script is
invoked when the threshold is reached. A few examples of
possible notifications are included in fwlw_notify, you can
add your own ones as you <br>
see fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B The response script is
invoked when the threshold is reached. Using the example
script fwlw_respond this will block the attacking host with
a new firewall rule. A new <br>
chain for fwlogwatch actions is inserted in the input chain
and block rules added as needed. The chain and its content
is removed if fwlogwatch is terminated normally. The <br>
example scripts contain actions for ipchains and netfilter,
you can modify them or add others as you like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X port <br>
Activate the internal web server to monitor and control the
current status of the daemon. It listens on the specified
port and by default only allows connections from <br>
localhost. The default user name is admin and the default
password is fwlogwat (since DES can only encrypt 8
characters). All options related to the status web server
can <br>
be changed in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
You can specify one or more input files (if none is given it
defaults to /var/log/messages ). Relevant entries are
automatically detected so combined log files (e.g. from a
log <br>
host) are no problem. Compressed files are supported (except
in realtime response mode where they don&rsquo;t make sense
anyway). The &rsquo;-&rsquo; sign may be used for reading
from standard <br>
input (stdin). In realtime response mode the file needs to
be specified with an absolute path since the daemon uses the
file system root (/) as working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME FORMAT <br>
Time is specified as nx where n is a natural number and x is
one of the following: s for seconds (this is the default), m
for minutes, h for hours, d for days, w for weeks, M for
<br>
months and y for years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/fwlogwatch.config <br>
Default configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/messages <br>
Default input log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/fwlogwatch.pid <br>
Default PID file generated by the daemon in realtime
response mode if configured to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES ONLY IN CONFIGURATION
FILE <br>
The following features are only available in the
configuration file and not on the command line, they are
presented and explained in more detail in the sample
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML colors and stylesheet <br>
The colors of the HTML output and status page can be
customized, an external cascading stylesheet can be
referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Realtime response options <br>
Verification of ipchains rules, PID file handling, the user
fwlogwatch should run as, the location of the notification
and response scripts, which address the status web <br>
server listens on, which host can connect, the refresh
interval of the status page and the admin name and password
can be configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
Since fwlogwatch is a security tool special care was taken
to make it secure. You can and should run it with user
permissions for most functions, you can make it setgid for a
<br>
group /var/log/messages is in if all you need is to be able
to read this file. Only the realtime response mode with
activated ipchains rule analysis needs superuser permissions
<br>
but you might also need them to write the PID file, for
actions in the response script and for binding the default
status port. However, you can configure fwlogwatch to drop
root <br>
privileges as soon as possible after allocating these
resources (the notification and response scripts will still
be executed with user privileges and log rotation might not
<br>
work).</p>
