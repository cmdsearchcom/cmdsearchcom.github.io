<p>UPDATE-BINFMTS(8) Debian System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
UPDATE-BINFMTS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
update-binfmts &acirc; maintain registry of executable
binary formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
update-binfmts [options] --install name path spec <br>
update-binfmts [options] --remove name path <br>
update-binfmts [options] --import [name] <br>
update-binfmts [options] --display [name] <br>
update-binfmts [options] --enable [name] <br>
update-binfmts [options] --disable [name] <br>
update-binfmts [options] --find [path]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Versions 2.1.43 and later of the Linux kernel have contained
the binfmt_misc module. This enables a system administrator
to register interpreters for various binary formats based
<br>
on a magic number or their file extension, and cause the
appropriate interpreter to be invoked whenever a matching
file is executed. Think of it as a more flexible version of
the <br>
#! executable interpreter mechanism, or as something which
can behave a little like &quot;associations&quot; in certain
other operating systems (though in GNU/Linux the tendency is
to keep <br>
this sort of thing somewhere else, like your file manager).
update-binfmts manages a persistent database of these
interpreters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When each package providing a
registered interpreter is installed, changed, or removed,
update-binfmts is called to update information about that
interpreter. update-binfmts is <br>
usually called from the postinst or prerm scripts in Debian
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Exactly one action must be specified; this may be
accompanied by any one of the common options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
--package package-name <br>
Specifies the name of the current package, to be used by
package post-installation and pre-removal scripts. System
administrators installing binary formats for local use <br>
should probably ignore this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When installing new formats, the
--import action should be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--admindir directory <br>
Specifies the administrative directory, when this is to be
different from the default of /var/lib/binfmts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--importdir directory <br>
Specifies the directory from which packaged binary formats
are imported, when this is to be different from the default
of /usr/share/binfmts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test <br>
Don&rsquo;t do anything, just demonstrate what would be
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Display some usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
--install name path spec <br>
Install a binary format identified by name with interpreter
path into the database. After registration, this format will
be used when the kernel tries to execute a file <br>
matching spec (see BINARY FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--install will attempt to enable
this binary format in the kernel as well as adding it to its
own database; see --enable below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot install a format with
any of the names &quot;.&quot;, &quot;..&quot;,
&quot;register&quot;, or &quot;status&quot;, as these are
used by the filesystem or the binfmt_misc module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove name path <br>
Remove the binary format identified by name with interpreter
path from the database. This will also attempt to disable
the binary format in the kernel; see --disable below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--import [name] <br>
Import a packaged format file called name, or import all
format files currently on the system if no name is given. If
name is not a full path, it is assumed to be a file in <br>
the import directory (/usr/share/binfmts by default). See
FORMAT FILES below for the required contents of these
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For packages, this is preferable
to using the --install option, as a format file can be
installed without update-binfmts needing to be
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display [name] <br>
Display any information held in the database about the
binary format identifier name, or about all known binary
formats if no name is given. Also show whether displayed
<br>
binary formats are enabled or disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable [name] <br>
Enable binary format name, or all known binary formats if no
name is given, in the kernel, thus enabling direct execution
of matching files. You must have binfmt_misc com&acirc; <br>
piled into the kernel or loaded as a module for this to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable [name] <br>
Disable binary format name, or all known binary formats if
no name is given, in the kernel, thus disabling direct
execution of matching files. You must have binfmt_misc
com&acirc; <br>
piled into the kernel or loaded as a module for this to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--find [path] <br>
Print the list of interpreters that will be tried in
sequence when attempting to execute path, one per line. The
first one for which execvp(3) succeeds will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if multiple formats
match an executable, then the order is in general not
defined, and may not be preserved between update-binfmts
operations, so you should gener&acirc; <br>
ally try to ensure that this option prints at most one line
for any given path. The exception to this is that any format
with a userspace detector will be run before any <br>
format without a userspace detector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINARY FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS
<br>
--magic byte-sequence <br>
This matches all files with the magic number byte-sequence.
Hexadecimal escapes may be included in the byte-sequence by
preceding them with or example &acirc;a&acirc; for a <br>
linefeed. Remember to protect such escapes with quotes or an
additional backslash to prevent their interpretation by the
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also see --offset and
--mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--offset offset <br>
This is the offset of the magic/mask in the file, counted in
bytes. The default is 0. Only valid with --magic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mask byte-sequence <br>
This mask will be logically-ANDed with the string to be
checked against the magic number given with --magic. The
default is all 0xff, i.e. no effect. Only valid with <br>
--magic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extension extension <br>
This matches all files whose names end in
&quot;.extension&quot;. Hexadecimal escapes are not
recognized here. Extension matching is case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detector path <br>
If this option is used, a userspace detector program will be
used to check whether the file is suitable for this
interpreter. This may be used when the binary format is more
<br>
complex than can be handled by the kernel&rsquo;s format
specifications alone. The program should return an exit code
of zero if the file is appropriate and non-zero
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--credentials yes, --credentials
no <br>
Whether to keep the credentials of the original binary to
run the interpreter; this is typically useful to run setuid
binaries, but has security implications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve yes, --preserve no
<br>
Whether to preserve the original argv[0] when running the
interpreter, rather than overwriting it with the full path
to the binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMAT FILES <br>
A format file is a sequence of options, one per line,
corresponding roughly to the options given to an --install
command. Each option consists of a key, followed by
whitespace, <br>
followed by a value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The package option should be set
to the current package. The interpreter option should be set
to the path to the interpreter that will handle this binary
format. The magic, <br>
offset, mask, extension, detector, credentials, and preserve
options correspond to the command-line options of the same
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The requested action was successfully performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Problems were encountered
whilst parsing the command line or performing the
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This format file can be used with an interpreter capable of
handling Java .class files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package javawrapper <br>
interpreter /usr/bin/javawrapper <br>
magic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This corresponds roughly to the
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-binfmts --package
javawrapper --install javawrapper /usr/bin/javawrapper
--magic &rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If you&rsquo;re not careful, you can break your system with
update-binfmts. An easy way to do this is to register an ELF
binary as a handler for ELF, which will almost certainly
cause <br>
your system to hang immediately; even if it doesn&rsquo;t,
you won&rsquo;t be able to run update-binfmts to fix it. In
the future update-binfmts may have some checks to prevent
this sort of <br>
thing happening accidentally, though of course you can still
manipulate the binfmt_misc kernel module directly.</p>
