<p>CONFIG(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
CONFIG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
config &acirc; build system configuration files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
config [-CVgp] [-I path] [-d destdir] SYSTEM_NAME <br>
config [-x kernel]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The config utility builds a set of system configuration
files from the file SYSTEM_NAME which describes the system
to configure. A second file tells config what files are
needed <br>
to generate a system and can be augmented by configuration
specific set of files that give alternate files for a
specific machine (see the FILES section below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available options and
operands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the config version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C If the INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE is
present in a configuration file, kernel image will contain
full configuration files included literally (preserving
comments). This flag <br>
is kept for backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I path Search in path for any
file included by the include directive. This option may be
specified more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d destdir Use destdir as the
output directory, instead of the default one. Note that
config does not append SYSTEM_NAME to the directory
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Print the MACHINE and
MACHINE_ARCH values for this kernel and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Configure a system for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x kernel Print kernel
configuration file embedded into a kernel file. This option
makes sense only if options INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE entry was
present in your configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Configure a system for
profiling; for example, kgmon(8) and gprof(1). If two or
more -p options are supplied, config configures a system for
high resolution profil&acirc; <br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM_NAME Specify the name of
the system configuration file containing device
specifications, configuration options and other system
parameters for one system configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The config utility should be run
from the conf subdirectory of the system source (usually
/sys/ARCH/conf), where ARCH represents one of the
architectures supported by FreeBSD. The <br>
config utility creates the directory ../compile/SYSTEM_NAME
or the one given with the -d option as necessary and places
all output files there. The output of config consists of a
<br>
number of files; for the i386, they are: Makefile, used by
make(1) in building the system; header files, definitions of
the number of various devices that will be compiled into the
<br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running config, it is
necessary to run &acirc;make depend&acirc; in the directory
where the new makefile was created. The config utility
prints a reminder of this when it completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any other error messages are
produced by config, the problems in the configuration file
should be corrected and config should be run again. Attempts
to compile a system that <br>
had configuration errors are likely to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG KERNELS <br>
Traditional BSD kernels are compiled without symbols due to
the heavy load on the system when compiling a
&acirc;debug&acirc; kernel. A debug kernel contains complete
symbols for all the <br>
source files, and enables an experienced kernel programmer
to analyse the cause of a problem. The debuggers available
prior to 4.4BSD-Lite were able to find some information from
<br>
a normal kernel; gdb(1) provides very little support for
normal kernels, and a debug kernel is needed for any
meaningful analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reasons of history, time and
space, building a debug kernel is not the default with
FreeBSD: a debug kernel takes up to 30% longer to build and
requires about 30 MB of disk <br>
storage in the build directory, compared to about 6 MB for a
non-debug kernel. A debug kernel is about 11 MB in size,
compared to about 2 MB for a non-debug kernel. This space is
<br>
used both in the root file system and at run time in memory.
Use the -g option to build a debug kernel. With this option,
config causes two kernel files to be built in the kernel
<br>
build directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; kernel.debug is
the complete debug kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; kernel is a copy
of the kernel with the debug symbols stripped off. This is
equivalent to the normal non-debug kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently little sense
in installing and booting from a debug kernel, since the
only tools available which use the symbols do not run
on-line. There are therefore two <br>
options for installing a debug kernel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &acirc;make
install&acirc; installs kernel in the root file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &acirc;make
install.debug&acirc; installs kernel.debug in the root file
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/sys/conf/files list of common files system is built from
<br>
/sys/conf/Makefile.ARCH generic makefile for the ARCH <br>
/sys/conf/files.ARCH list of ARCH specific files <br>
/sys/ARCH/compile/SYSTEM_NAME default kernel build directory
for system SYSTEM_NAME on ARCH.</p>

with Config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The config utility appeared in 4.1BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before support for -x was
introduced, options INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE included entire
configuration file that used to be embedded in the new
kernel. This meant that strings(1) could <br>
be used to extract it from a kernel: to extract the
configuration information, you had to use the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strings -n 3 kernel | sed -n
&rsquo;s/^___//p&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The line numbers reported in error messages are usually off
by one.</p>
