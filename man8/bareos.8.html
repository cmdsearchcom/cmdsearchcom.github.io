Bareos is a set of computer programs that permits you (or the system
  administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data
  across a network of computers of different kinds. In technical terms, it is a
  network Client/Server based backup program. Bareos is relatively easy to use
  and efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that
  make it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. Due to its modular
  design, Bareos is scalable from small single computer systems to systems
  consisting of hundreds of computers located over a large network.

Bareos Director service consists of the program that supervises all the backup,
  restore, verify and archive operations. The system administrator uses the
  Bareos Director to schedule backups and to recover files. For more details see
  the Director Services Daemon Design Document in the Bareos Developer's Guild.
  The Director runs as a daemon or a service (i.e. in the background).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bareos Console services is the program that allows the administrator or user to
  communicate with the Bareos Director (see above). Currently, the Bareos
  Console is available in two versions. The first and simplest is to run the
  Console program in a shell window (i.e. TTY interface). Most system
  administrators will find this completely adequate. The second version is a Qt
  4.2 GUI interface named bat that has more features than the bconsole program.

Bareos File services (or Client program) is the software program that is
  installed on the machine to be backed up. It is specific to the operating
  system on which it runs and is responsible for providing the file attributes
  and data when requested by the Director. The File services are also
  responsible for the file system dependent part of restoring the file
  attributes and data during a recovery operation. For more details see the File
  Services Daemon Design Document in the Bareos Developer's Guide. This program
  runs as a daemon on the machine to be backed up, and in some of the
  documentation, the File daemon is referred to as the Client (for example in
  Bareos's configuration file). In addition to Unix/Linux File daemons, there is
  a Windows File daemon (normally distributed in binary format). The Windows
  File daemon runs on all currently known Windows versions (2K, 2003, XP, and
  Vista).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bareos Storage services consist of the software programs that perform the
  storage and recovery of the file attributes and data to the physical backup
  media or volumes. In other words, the Storage daemon is responsible for
  reading and writing your tapes (or other storage media, e.g. files). For more
  details see the Storage Services Daemon Design Document in the Bareos
  Developer's Guide. The Storage services runs as a daemon on the machine that
  has the backup device (usually a tape drive).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Catalog services are comprised of the software programs responsible for
  maintaining the file indexes and volume databases for all files backed up. The
  Catalog services permit the System Administrator or user to quickly locate and
  restore any desired file. The Catalog services sets Bareos apart from simple
  backup programs like tar and bru, because the catalog maintains a record of
  all Volumes used, all Jobs run, and all Files saved, permitting efficient
  restoration and Volume management. Bareos currently supports three different
  databases, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite3, one of which must be chosen when
  building Bareos.
