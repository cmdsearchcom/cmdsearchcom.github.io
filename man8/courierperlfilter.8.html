<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
courierperlfilter - Sample Perl-based mail filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
filterctl [[start] | [stop]] [perlfilter]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is an example global mail filter that uses an embedded
Perl script. &quot;Embedded&quot; means that the Perl
interpreter is loaded once, and the same Perl code is
repeatedly called to <br>
accept or reject incoming messages, one by one. Perl
filtering is relatively time consuming (compared to
filtering in C or C++), and excessive delays in mail filters
result in <br>
incoming mail being deferred (rejected with a temporary
error code). Therefore the perlfilter wrapper can create
multiple perlfilter processes, so that multiple processes
are <br>
used to filter incoming mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlfilter requires Perl 5.10 or
higher. The best way to create a Perl filter is to start
with the sample filter,
/usr/lib/courier/perlfilter-example.pl. This filter reject
<br>
messages that contain an excessively long Date: header
(designed to crash certain poorly-written mail clients). Use
it as a basis for writing your own filter. You can install
<br>
your filter in any convenient location, then initialize the
/etc/courier/filters/perlfilter configuration file, as
described below. Run filterctl start perlfilter to activate
<br>
filtering (if necessary, run courierfilter start to start
the mail filtering subsystem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting up a Perl script <br>
Most of the ugly details of connecting the Perl script to
Courier&rsquo;s mail filtering engine is taken care of by
the sample perlfilter-example.pl script. One big no-no: the
script <br>
MAY NOT change the current directory. Anything else goes,
for the most part. Loading other modules and classes, pretty
much anything else you can do with Perl, is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl script, just like any
other mail filtering module, receives a pointer to a data
file and one or more control files, each time a message is
submitted to Courier for <br>
delivery. The sample script calls the filterdata() function
to process the data file. The data file contains the actual
message. The filtercontrol() function is called to process
<br>
each control file. The control file contains recipient and
message metadata. There may be more than one control file
for each message. The example script includes an <br>
implementation of filterdata() that blocks messages with
corrupted headers. The example script doesn&rsquo;t do
anything interesting with filtercontrol().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filterdata() and filtercontrol()
must return an empty string if no serious objections are
raised for this message. Any other return string is
interpreted as an SMTP-style error <br>
code that is used to reject the message. Care must be taken
that any error messages are formatted strictly according to
the format of SMTP error messages (even though the message
<br>
may not actually come in via SMTP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREDITS <br>
A lot of the Perl glue code is based on examples from the
perlembed manual page, and other sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
perlfilter uses the following configuration files. Changes
to the following files do not take effect until the filter
has been stopped and restarted.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/courier/filters/perlfilter-mode
<br>
If this file exists and contains the word &quot;all&quot;,
perlfilter will create its socket in
/var/lib/courier/allfilters, otherwise the socket will be
created in <br>
/var/lib/courier/filters, see courierfilter(8)[1] for more
information.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/courier/filters/perlfilter-numprocs
<br>
This file contains a number that sets how many perlfilter
processes are created. The default is 5 processes.
There&rsquo;s always an extra perlfilter process
that&rsquo;s used to clean <br>
up crashed child processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/courier/filters/perlfilter
<br>
This file MUST exist and it must contain a single line of
text with the filename of the Perl script to load.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/courier/perlfilter-example.pl
<br>
This is a sample Perl script of the kind that
/etc/courier/filters/perlfilter points to. Use it as an
example of writing your own Perl filters.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/courier/perlfilter-ratelimit.pl
<br>
This is a complete Perl-based filter than implements basic
rate-limiting features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please exercise good judgment in
writing Perl-based filters. They should be reasonably fast,
and do not allocate megabytes of memory. They should not be
very promiscuous in <br>
creating global Perl variables, and should clean up after
themselves. The current Perl wrapper does not destroy the
Perl symbol table after each call to the filter script. <br>
However, do not take that for granted. This may change in
the future.</p>
