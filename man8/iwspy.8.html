<p>IWSPY(8) Linux Programmer&rsquo;s Manual IWSPY(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
iwspy - Get wireless statistics from specific nodes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
iwspy [interface] <br>
iwspy interface [+] DNSNAME | IPADDR | HWADDR [...] <br>
iwspy interface off <br>
iwspy interface setthr low high <br>
iwspy interface getthr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Iwspy is used to set a list of addresses to monitor in a
wireless network interface and to read back quality of link
information for each of those. This information is the same
<br>
as the one available in /proc/net/wireless : quality of the
link, signal strength and noise level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information is updated each
time a new packet is received, so each address of the list
adds some overhead in the driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this functionality
works only for nodes part of the current wireless cell, you
can not monitor Access Points you are not associated with
(you can use Scanning for that) <br>
and nodes in other cells. In Managed mode, in most case
packets are relayed by the Access Point, in this case you
will get the signal strength of the Access Point. For those
rea&acirc; <br>
sons this functionality is mostly useful in Ad-Hoc and
Master mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
You may set any number of addresses up to 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSNAME | IPADDR <br>
Set an IP address, or in some cases a DNS name (using the
name resolver). As the hardware works with hardware
addresses, iwspy will translate this IP address through ARP.
<br>
In some case, this address might not be in the ARP cache and
iwspy will fail. In those case, ping(8) this name/address
and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HWADDR Set a hardware (MAC)
address (this address is not translated &amp; checked like
the IP one). The address must contain a colon (:) to be
recognised as a hardware address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Add the new set of addresses
at the end of the current list instead of replacing it. The
address list is unique for each device, so each user should
use this option to <br>
avoid conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off Remove the current list of
addresses and disable the spy functionality</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setthr Set the low and high
signal strength threshold for the iwspy event (for drivers
that support it). <br>
Every time the signal strength for any of the address
monitored with iwspy goes lower than the low threshold or
goes higher than the high threshold, a Wireless Event will
<br>
be generated. <br>
This can be used to monitor link outages without having to
run iwspy periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getthr Retrieve the current low
and high signal strength threshold for the iwspy event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
