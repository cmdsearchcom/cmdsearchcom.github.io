<p>JOHN(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual JOHN(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
john - a tool to find weak passwords of your users</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
john [options] password-files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the john command. This
manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution because the original program does not have a
manual page. <br>
john, better known as John the Ripper, is a tool to find
weak passwords of users in a server. John can use a
dictionary or some search pattern as well as a password file
to check <br>
for passwords. John supports different cracking modes and
understands many ciphertext formats, like several DES
variants, MD5 and blowfish. It can also be used to extract
AFS and <br>
Windows NT passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
To use John, you just need to supply it a password file and
the desired options. If no mode is specified, john will try
&quot;single&quot; first, then &quot;wordlist&quot; and
finally &quot;incremental&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once John finds a password, it
will be printed to the terminal and saved into a file called
~/.john/john.pot. John will read this file when it restarts
so it doesn&rsquo;t try to crack <br>
already done passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see the cracked passwords,
use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">john -show passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important: do this under the
same directory where the password was cracked (when using
the cronjob, /var/lib/john), otherwise it won&rsquo;t
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While cracking, you can press
any key for status, or Ctrl+C to abort the session, saving
point information to a file ( ~/.john/john.rec by default).
By the way, if you press <br>
Ctrl+C twice John will abort immediately without saving. The
point information is also saved every 10 minutes
(configurable in the configuration file, ~/.john/john.ini or
<br>
~/.john/john.conf ) in case of a crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To continue an interrupted
session, run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">john -restore</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, you may notice that many
accounts have a disabled shell, you can make John ignore
these (assume that shell is called /etc/expired ):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">john -show -shells:-/etc/expired
passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might want to mail all the
users who got weak passwords, to tell them to change the
passwords. It&rsquo;s not always a good idea though
(unfortunately, lots of people seem to <br>
ignore such mail, it can be used as a hint for crackers,
etc), but anyway, I&rsquo;ll assume you know what
you&rsquo;re doing. Get a copy of the &rsquo;mailer&rsquo;
script supplied with John, so you <br>
won&rsquo;t change anything that&rsquo;s under /usr/sbin ;
edit the message it sends, and possibly the mail command
inside it (especially if the password file is from a
different box than <br>
you got John running on). Then run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./mailer passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anyway, you probably should have
a look at /usr/share/doc/john/OPTIONS for a list of all the
command line options, and at /usr/share/doc/john/EXAMPLES
for more John usage exam&acirc; <br>
ples with other cracking modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All the options recognized by john start with a single dash
(&lsquo;-&rsquo;). A summary of options is included
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-external:MODE <br>
Enables an external mode, using external functions defined
in ~/john.ini&rsquo;s [List.External:MODE] section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-format:NAME <br>
Allows you to override the ciphertext format detection.
Currently, valid format names are DES, BSDI, MD5, BF, AFS,
LM. You can use this option when cracking or with <br>
&rsquo;-test&rsquo;. Note that John can&rsquo;t crack
password files with different ciphertext formats at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-groups:[-]GID[,..] <br>
Tells John to load users of the specified group(s) only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-incremental[:MODE] <br>
Enables the incremental mode, using the specified ~/john.ini
definition (section [Incremental:MODE], or [Incremental:All]
by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-makechars:FILE <br>
Generates a charset file, based on character frequencies
from ~/.john/john.pot, for use with the incremental mode.
The entire ~/.john/john.pot will be used for the charset
<br>
file unless you specify some password files. You can also
use an external filter() routine with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restore[:FILE] <br>
Continues an interrupted cracking session, reading point
information from the specified file (~/.john/john.rec by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rules Enables wordlist rules,
that are read from [List.Rules:Wordlist] in
/etc/john/john.conf (or the alternative configuration file
you might specify on the command line). <br>
This option requires the -wordlist option to be passed as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-salts:[-]COUNT <br>
This feature sometimes allows you to achieve better
performance. For example you can crack only some salts using
&rsquo;-salts:2&rsquo; faster, and then crack the rest using
<br>
&rsquo;-salts:-2&rsquo;. Total cracking time will be about
the same, but you will get some passwords cracked
earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-savemem:LEVEL <br>
You might need this option if you don&rsquo;t have enough
memory, or don&rsquo;t want John to affect other processes
too much. Level 1 tells John not to waste memory on login
names, <br>
so you won&rsquo;t see them while cracking. Higher levels
have a performance impact: you should probably avoid using
them unless John doesn&rsquo;t work or gets into swap
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-session:FILE <br>
Allows you to specify another point information file&rsquo;s
name to use for this cracking session. This is useful for
running multiple instances of John in parallel, or just to
<br>
be able to recover an older session later, not always
continue the latest one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shells:[-]SHELL[,..] <br>
This option is useful to load accounts with a valid shell
only, or not to load accounts with a bad shell. You can omit
the path before a shell name, so &rsquo;-shells:csh&rsquo;
will <br>
match both &rsquo;/bin/csh&rsquo; and
&rsquo;/usr/bin/csh&rsquo;, while
&Acirc;&acute;-shells:/bin/csh&rsquo; will only match
&rsquo;/bin/csh&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show Shows the cracked
passwords in a convenient form. You should also specify the
password files. You can use this option while another John
is cracking, to see what it did so <br>
far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-single <br>
Enables the &quot;single crack&quot; mode, using rules from
[List.Rules:Single].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-status[:FILE] <br>
Prints status of an interrupted or running session. To get
an up to date status information of a detached running
session, send that copy of John a SIGHUP before using <br>
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdin These are used to enable
the wordlist mode (reading from stdin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdout[:LENGTH] <br>
When used with a cracking mode, except for &quot;single
crack&quot;, makes John print the words it generates to
stdout instead of cracking. While applying wordlist rules,
the sig&acirc; <br>
nificant password length is assumed to be LENGTH, or
unlimited by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-test Benchmarks all the enabled
ciphertext format crackers, and tests them for correct
operation at the same time. <br>
This option does not need any file passed as argument. Its
only function is to benchmark the system john is running
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-users:[-]LOGIN|UID[,..] <br>
Allows you to filter a few accounts for cracking, etc. A
dash before the list can be used to invert the check (that
is, load all the users that aren&rsquo;t listed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wordlist:FILE <br>
These are used to enable the wordlist mode, reading words
from FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
John can work in the following modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wordlist <br>
John will simply use a file with a list of words that will
be checked against the passwords. See RULES for the format
of wordlist files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single crack <br>
In this mode, john will try to crack the password using the
login/GECOS information as passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incremental <br>
This is the most powerful mode. John will try any character
combination to resolve the password. Details about these
modes can be found in the MODES file in john&rsquo;s
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation, including how to define your own cracking
methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/john/john.conf <br>
is where you configure how john will behave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/john/john-mail.msg <br>
has the message sent to users when their passwords are
successfully cracked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/john/john-mail.conf <br>
is used to configure how john will send messages to users
that had their passwords cracked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The programs and the
configuration files are documented fully by John&rsquo;s
documentation, which should be available in
/usr/share/doc/john or other location, depending on your
sys&acirc; <br>
tem.</p>
