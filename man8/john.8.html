john - a tool to find weak passwords of your users
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>john</b> [<i>options</i>] password-files
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This manual page documents briefly the <b>john</b> command. This manual page was
  written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program
  does not have a manual page. <b>john</b>, better known as John the Ripper, is
  a tool to find weak passwords of users in a server. John can use a dictionary
  or some search pattern as well as a password file to check for passwords. John
  supports different cracking modes and understands many ciphertext formats,
  like several DES variants, MD5 and blowfish. It can also be used to extract
  AFS and Windows NT passwords.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
To use John, you just need to supply it a password file and the desired options.
  If no mode is specified, john will try &quot;single&quot; first, then
  &quot;wordlist&quot; and finally &quot;incremental&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once John finds a password, it will be printed to the terminal and saved into a
  file called ~/.john/john.pot. John will read this file when it restarts so it
  doesn't try to crack already done passwords.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To see the cracked passwords, use
<div class="Pp"></div>
john -show passwd
<div class="Pp"></div>
Important: do this under the same directory where the password was cracked (when
  using the cronjob, /var/lib/john), otherwise it won't work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While cracking, you can press any key for status, or Ctrl+C to abort the
  session, saving point information to a file ( <i>~/.john/john.rec</i> by
  default). By the way, if you press Ctrl+C twice John will abort immediately
  without saving. The point information is also saved every 10 minutes
  (configurable in the configuration file, <i>~/.john/john.ini</i> or
  <i>~/.john/john.conf</i> ) in case of a crash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To continue an interrupted session, run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
john -restore
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, you may notice that many accounts have a disabled shell, you can make John
  ignore these (assume that shell is called <i>/etc/expired</i> ):
<div class="Pp"></div>
john -show -shells:-/etc/expired passwd
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might want to mail all the users who got weak passwords, to tell them to
  change the passwords. It's not always a good idea though (unfortunately, lots
  of people seem to ignore such mail, it can be used as a hint for crackers,
  etc), but anyway, I'll assume you know what you're doing. Get a copy of the
  'mailer' script supplied with John, so you won't change anything that's under
  <i>/usr/sbin</i> ; edit the message it sends, and possibly the mail command
  inside it (especially if the password file is from a different box than you
  got John running on). Then run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 ./mailer passwd
<div class="Pp"></div>
Anyway, you probably should have a look at <i>/usr/share/doc/john/OPTIONS</i>
  for a list of all the command line options, and at
  <i>/usr/share/doc/john/EXAMPLES</i> for more John usage examples with other
  cracking modes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
All the options recognized by john start with a single dash (`-'). A summary of
  options is included below.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-external:MODE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables an external mode, using external functions defined
      in ~/john.ini's [List.External:MODE] section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-format:NAME</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Allows you to override the ciphertext format detection.
      Currently, valid format names are DES, BSDI, MD5, BF, AFS, LM. You can use
      this option when cracking or with '-test'. Note that John can't crack
      password files with different ciphertext formats at the same time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-groups:[-]GID[,..]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells John to load users of the specified group(s)
    only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-incremental[:MODE]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables the incremental mode, using the specified
      ~/john.ini definition (section [Incremental:MODE], or [Incremental:All] by
      default).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-makechars:FILE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Generates a charset file, based on character frequencies
      from ~/.john/john.pot, for use with the incremental mode. The entire
      ~/.john/john.pot will be used for the charset file unless you specify some
      password files. You can also use an external filter() routine with this
      option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-restore[:FILE]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Continues an interrupted cracking session, reading point
      information from the specified file (~/.john/john.rec by default).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-rules</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables wordlist rules, that are read from
      [List.Rules:Wordlist] in <i>/etc/john/john.conf</i> (or the alternative
      configuration file you might specify on the command line).
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option <b>requires</b> the <b>-wordlist</b> option to be passed as
      well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-salts:[-]COUNT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This feature sometimes allows you to achieve better
      performance. For example you can crack only some salts using '-salts:2'
      faster, and then crack the rest using '-salts:-2'. Total cracking time
      will be about the same, but you will get some passwords cracked
    earlier.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-savemem:LEVEL</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You might need this option if you don't have enough memory,
      or don't want John to affect other processes too much. Level 1 tells John
      not to waste memory on login names, so you won't see them while cracking.
      Higher levels have a performance impact: you should probably avoid using
      them unless John doesn't work or gets into swap otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-session:FILE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Allows you to specify another point information file's name
      to use for this cracking session. This is useful for running multiple
      instances of John in parallel, or just to be able to recover an older
      session later, not always continue the latest one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-shells:[-]SHELL[,..]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is useful to load accounts with a valid shell
      only, or not to load accounts with a bad shell. You can omit the path
      before a shell name, so '-shells:csh' will match both '/bin/csh' and
      '/usr/bin/csh', while &#x00B4;-shells:/bin/csh' will only match
      '/bin/csh'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-show</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Shows the cracked passwords in a convenient form. You
      should also specify the password files. You can use this option while
      another John is cracking, to see what it did so far.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-single</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables the &quot;single crack&quot; mode, using rules from
      [List.Rules:Single].</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-status[:FILE]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prints status of an interrupted or running session. To get
      an up to date status information of a detached running session, send that
      copy of John a SIGHUP before using this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-stdin</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These are used to enable the wordlist mode (reading from
      stdin).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-stdout[:LENGTH]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When used with a cracking mode, except for &quot;single
      crack&quot;, makes John print the words it generates to stdout instead of
      cracking. While applying wordlist rules, the significant password length
      is assumed to be LENGTH, or unlimited by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-test</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Benchmarks all the enabled ciphertext format crackers, and
      tests them for correct operation at the same time.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option does <b>not</b> need any file passed as argument. Its only
      function is to benchmark the system john is running on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-users:[-]LOGIN|UID[,..]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Allows you to filter a few accounts for cracking, etc. A
      dash before the list can be used to invert the check (that is, load all
      the users that aren't listed).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-wordlist:FILE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These are used to enable the wordlist mode, reading words
      from FILE.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODES"><a class="selflink" href="#MODES">MODES</a></h1>
John can work in the following modes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Wordlist</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">John will simply use a file with a list of words that will
      be checked against the passwords. See RULES for the format of wordlist
      files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Single crack</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, john will try to crack the password using the
      login/GECOS information as passwords.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Incremental</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the most powerful mode. John will try any character
      combination to resolve the password. Details about these modes can be
      found in the MODES file in john's documentation, including how to define
      your own cracking methods.</dd>
