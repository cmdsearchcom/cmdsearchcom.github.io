<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sethdlc is a program designed to set and/or report the
configuration information associated with a soundcard radio
modem port. This information includes the modem type, what
I/O <br>
port, IRQ and DMA channel a particular modem port is using,
and where to output a transmitter keying (PTT) signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -p option, sethdlc sets
and/or reports the port configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -a option, sethdlc sets
and/or reports the AX.25 channel access parameters. These
parameters can also be set with the kissparms utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -c option, sethdlc
instructs the driver to send a calibration pattern for cal
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without the -p, -a and -c
option, sethdlc will stay in the foreground and display
received packets. The AX.25 header and eventually a FlexNet
compressed header are decoded. CTRL- <br>
C terminates sethdlc. Specifying additional options, sethdlc
may display additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
sethdlc accepts the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Trace the bits at the output
of the demodulator, after RX clock recovery. This option is
only available if sethdlc and the soundcard modem kernel
driver is compiled with <br>
debugging support on. This is useful for driver
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Trace DCD, PTT and other
status information on stdout. sethdlc displays two times per
second a line containing this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display an overview of the
available command line parameters and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i The device argument specifies
the HDLC modem device which should be configured or
interrogated. It will usually have the following form:
bc[0-3] for the baycom driver and <br>
sm[0-3] for the soundcard modem driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Trace the bits at the
demodulator output, before the RX clock recovery, to stdout.
This option is only available the modem driver is compiled
with debugging support on. It <br>
may not be available on some modem, such as the par96.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
The following parameters can be assigned to a soundcard
radio modem port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All numerical parameter values
are assumed to be in decimal unless preceded by
&quot;0x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode parameter sets the type
of hardware and the operating mode of the driver. ser12 and
par96 are valid modes for the baycom driver. A star
&quot;*&quot; may be added to enable <br>
software DCD. The mode string format of the soundmodem
driver is as follows: hw:mode. hw may be either sbc, wss or
wssfdx. The first one specifies SoundBlaster compatible
sound&acirc; <br>
cards, the second one WindowsSoundSystem compatible
hardware, and the third one WSS fullduplex operation (which
currently works with Crystal Semiconductor Chipsets
CS423[126]). <br>
The mode portion may be afsk1200 or fsk9600. Optionally, the
receive and transmit modes may be different
(hw:txmode.rxmode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ioport parameter sets the
I/O port address. Typical values for the ser12 modem are
0x3f8, 0x2f8, 0x3e8 or 0x2e8, for the par96 modem 0x378,
0x278 or 0x3bc, for the sbc modems <br>
0x220 and for the wss modems 0x530, 0x608, 0xe80 or
0xf40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The irq parameter sets the
hardware IRQ number. Typical values for the ser12 modem are
4 and 3, for the par96 modem 7 or 5, for the sbc modems are
7 or 5 and for the wss modems, <br>
any free IRQ from the set 2, 7, 9, 10, 11 will do. The
driver automatically configures the WSS soundcard to the
correct IRQ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dma parameter sets the
hardware DMA number. Typical values for the sbc modems are 1
or 0 and for the wss modems, any free DMA from 0 to 3
(except 2) will do. The driver <br>
automatically configures the WSS soundcard to the correct
DMA. The Baycom modems do not need DMA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dma2 parameter sets the
second hardware DMA number. This is only needed for full
duplex operation with the soundmodem driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The seriobase parameter
optionally sets the address of a serial port, where the
driver will output a PTT signal at the TxD and RTS pins, and
a DCD signal at the DTR pin. As Bay&acirc; <br>
com modems do have their own PTT pin, this parameter is not
used by the Baycom modem driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pariobase parameter
optionally sets the address of a LPT port where the driver
will output a PTT signal on the DATA0 line and a DCD signal
on the DATA1 line. As Baycom modems <br>
do have their own PTT pin, this parameter is not used by the
Baycom modem driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The midiiobase parameter
optionally sets the address of a MPU401 compatible MIDI
port, where the driver will output a PTT signal. Since the
MIDI port is effectively an UART and <br>
therefore cannot output a DC signal, the output must be fed
through a retriggerable monoflop with a period of about
15ms. See <br>
http://www.ife.ee.ethz.ch/~sailer/pcf/ptt_circ/ptt.html for
a sample schematic diagram. As Baycom modems do have their
own PTT pin, this parameter is not used by the Baycom modem
<br>
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The txdelay sets the transmitter
keyup delay time. Unlike kissparms, the unit is tens of ms.
This is the time the transmitter needs to switch its PA on
and for its frequency syn&acirc; <br>
thesizer to settle. Typical values for a handheld
transceiver are 200ms (i.e. 20), and for a good crystal
driven transceiver 20ms (i.e. 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The txtail sets the time PTT is
held after the last packet. Unlike kissparms, the unit is
tens of ms. Do not set this value to 0. Most modems need
some extra time to actually <br>
clock the last bits out to the transmitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The slottime parameter specifies
how often the channel access algorithm is executed. Unlike
kissparms, the unit is tens of ms. Unless you have very
specific requirements, set <br>
this to 100ms (i.e. 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ppersist sets how
&quot;eagerly&quot; the station starts to transmit as soon
as the channel gets free. The optimum value is 256 divided
by the number of stations on the channel. (This <br>
should really be done automatically by the L2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">full sets the modem to full
duplex mode. Note that some modems do not actually support
full duplex mode, in this case this parameter makes the
modem start its transmission as <br>
soon as it gets packets from the upper layer, without
waiting for the channel to become free. This is needed by
some implementations of alternative channel access
algorithms, <br>
e.g. DAMA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">half sets the modem to half
duplex mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSIDERATIONS OF CONFIGURING
BAYCOM PORTS <br>
It is important to note that sethdlc merely tells the Linux
kernel where it should expect to find the I/O port and IRQ
lines of a particular serial port. It does not configure
<br>
the hardware to use a particular I/O port. In order to do
that, you will need to physically program the serial board,
usually by setting some jumpers or by switching some DIP
<br>
switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section will provide some
pointers in helping you decide how you would like to
configure your baycom ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;standard MS-DOS&quot;
port associations are given below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COM1, port 0x3f8, irq 4 <br>
COM2, port 0x2f8, irq 3 <br>
COM3, port 0x3e8, irq 4 <br>
COM4, port 0x2e8, irq 3 <br>
LPT1, port 0x378, irq 7 <br>
LPT1 (on hercules graphics adapter), port 0x3bc, irq 7 <br>
LPT1, port 0x278, irq 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSIDERATIONS OF CONFIGURING
SOUNDCARD RADIO MODEM PORTS <br>
Some cards need to be initialized before they act as a WSS
or SoundBlaster compatible card. This driver does not do
this. You can use the standard linux sound driver, if
compiled <br>
as a module. Just load the sound driver (insmod sound) and
remove it again (rmmod sound). The card should then be
configured for either soundblaster or WSS compatibility. If
this <br>
does not work for some reason, you&rsquo;ll have to write
your own soundcard configuration utility. This is not as
complicated as it sounds; it can be done from user space
(but requir&acirc; <br>
ing root privileges) using ioperm and/or iopl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important that the audio
levels of your radio match those of the soundcard. To help
achieve this, there are two utilities: smdiag and smmixer.
See their respective manpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sound driver and the
soundcard modem driver are mutually exclusive, i.e. they
cannot both access the same soundcard at the same time. Even
worse, the sound driver reserves <br>
the soundcard as soon as it gets loaded. The souncard modem
driver however reserves the card only when the interface is
started, i.e. during ifconfig sm[0-3] up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9600 baud may not currently work
on SoundBlaster cards with DSP revision 4.x, i.e. SB16 and
SB32 AWE. This is because they seem to not be fully
backwards compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION <br>
CAUTION: Using an invalid port can lock up your machine.</p>
