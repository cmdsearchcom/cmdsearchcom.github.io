<p>pam_console(8) System Administrator&rsquo;s Manual
pam_console(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_console - determine user owning the system console</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
session optional pam_console.so <br>
auth required pam_console.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pam_console.so is designed to give users at the physical
console (virtual terminals and local xdm-managed X sessions
by default, but that is configurable) capabilities that they
<br>
would not otherwise have, and to take those capabilities
away when the are no longer logged in at the console. It
provides two main kinds of capabilities: file permissions
and <br>
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user logs in at the
console and no other user is currently logged in at the
console, pam_console.so will run handler programs specified
in the file /etc/security/con&acirc; <br>
sole.handlers such as pam_console_apply which changes
permissions and ownership of files as described in the file
/etc/security/console.perms. That user may then log in on
other <br>
terminals that are considered part of the console, and as
long as the user is still logged in at any one of those
terminals, that user will own those devices. When the user
logs <br>
out of the last terminal, the console may be taken by the
next user to log in. Other users who have logged in at the
console during the time that the first user was logged in
<br>
will not be given ownership of the devices unless they log
in on one of the terminals; having done so on any one
terminal, the next user will own those devices until he or
she <br>
has logged out of every terminal that is part of the
physical console. Then the race can start for the next user.
In practice, this is not a problem; the physical console is
<br>
not generally in use by many people at the same time, and
pam_console.so just tries to do the right thing in weird
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an application attempts to
authenticate the user and this user is already logged in at
the console, pam_console.so checks whether there is a file
in /etc/security/con&acirc; <br>
sole.apps/ directory with the same name as the application
servicename, and if such a file exists, authentication
succeeds. This way pam_console may be utilized to run some
sys&acirc; <br>
tem applications (reboots, config tools) without root
password, or to enter user password on the first system
login only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
debug turns on debugging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_nonroot_tty <br>
gain console locks and change permissions even if the
TTY&rsquo;s owner is not root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">handlersfile=filename <br>
tells pam_console.so to get the list of the handlers from a
different file than /etc/security/console.handlers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
/etc/pam.d/some-system-tool: <br>
auth sufficient pam_rootok.so <br>
auth required pam_console.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/pam.d/some-login-service:
<br>
auth sufficient pam_console.so <br>
auth required pam_unix.so <br>
session required pam_unix.so <br>
session optional pam_console.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/run/console/ <br>
/var/run/console/console.lock <br>
/etc/security/console.apps <br>
/etc/security/console.handlers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY NOTES <br>
When pam_console &quot;auth&quot; is used for login services
which provide possibility of remote login, it is necessary
to make sure the application correctly sets PAM_RHOST
variable, or <br>
to deny remote logins completely. Currently, /bin/login
(invoked from telnetd) and gdm is OK, others may be not.</p>
