intro - Introduction to the Mandos system
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This is the the Mandos system, which allows computers to have encrypted root
  file systems and at the same time be capable of remote and/or unattended
  reboots.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The computers run a small client program in the initial RAM disk environment
  which will communicate with a server over a network. All network communication
  is encrypted using TLS. The clients are identified by the server using an
  OpenPGP key; each client has one unique to it. The server sends the clients an
  encrypted password. The encrypted password is decrypted by the clients using
  the same OpenPGP key, and the password is then used to unlock the root file
  system, whereupon the computers can continue booting normally.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
You know how it is. You&#x2019;ve heard of it happening. The Man comes and takes
  away your servers, your friends&#x2019; servers, the servers of everybody in
  the same hosting facility. The servers of their neighbors, and their
  neighbors&#x2019; friends. The servers of people who owe them money. And like
  <i>that</i>, they&#x2019;re gone. And you doubt you&#x2019;ll ever see them
  again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That is why your servers have encrypted root file systems. However,
  there&#x2019;s a downside. There&#x2019;s no going around it: rebooting is a
  pain. Dragging out that rarely-used keyboard and screen and unraveling cables
  behind your servers to plug them in to type in that password is messy,
  especially if you have many servers. There are some people who do clever
  things like using serial line consoles and daisy-chain it to the next server,
  and keep all the servers connected in a ring with serial cables, which will
  work, if your servers are physically close enough. There are also other
  out-of-band management solutions, but with <i>all</i> these, you still have to
  be on hand and manually type in the password at boot time. Otherwise the
  server just sits there, waiting for a password.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Wouldn&#x2019;t it be great if you could have the security of encrypted root
  file systems and still have servers that could boot up automatically if there
  was a short power outage while you were asleep? That you could reboot at will,
  without having someone run over to the server to type in the password?
<div class="Pp"></div>
Well, with Mandos, you (almost) can! The gain in convenience will only be offset
  by a small loss in security. The setup is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The server will still have its encrypted root file system. The password to this
  file system will be stored on another computer (henceforth known as the Mandos
  server) on the same local network. The password will <i>not</i> be stored in
  plaintext, but encrypted with OpenPGP. To decrypt this password, a key is
  needed. This key (the Mandos client key) will not be stored there, but back on
  the original server (henceforth known as the Mandos client) in the initial RAM
  disk image. Oh, and all network Mandos client/server communications will be
  encrypted, using TLS (SSL).
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, at boot time, the Mandos client will ask for its encrypted data over the
  network, decrypt it to get the password, use it to decrypt the root file, and
  continue booting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, of course the initial RAM disk image is not on the encrypted root file
  system, so anyone who had physical access could take the Mandos client
  computer offline and read the disk with their own tools to get the
  authentication keys used by a client. <i>But</i>, by then the Mandos server
  should notice that the original server has been offline for too long, and will
  no longer give out the encrypted key. The timing here is the only real weak
  point, and the method, frequency and timeout of the server&#x2019;s checking
  can be adjusted to any desired level of paranoia
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The encrypted keys on the Mandos server is on its normal file system, so those
  are safe, provided the root file system of <i>that</i> server is encrypted.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS">FREQUENTLY
  ASKED QUESTIONS</a></h1>
Couldn&#x2019;t the security be defeated by...
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Grabbing_the_Mandos_client_key_from_the_initrd_really_quickly?"><a class="selflink" href="#Grabbing_the_Mandos_client_key_from_the_initrd_really_quickly?">Grabbing
  the Mandos client key from the initrd <i>really quickly</i>?</a></h2>
This, as mentioned above, is the only real weak point. But if you set the timing
  values tight enough, this will be really difficult to do. An attacker would
  have to physically disassemble the client computer, extract the key from the
  initial RAM disk image, and then connect to a <i>still online</i> Mandos
  server to get the encrypted key, and do all this <i>before</i> the Mandos
  server timeout kicks in and the Mandos server refuses to give out the key to
  anyone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, as the typical procedure seems to be to barge in and turn off and grab
  <i>all</i> computers, to maybe look at them months later, this is not likely.
  If someone does that, the whole system <i>will</i> lock itself up completely,
  since Mandos servers are no longer running.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For sophisticated attackers who <i>could</i> do the clever thing, <i>and</i> had
  physical access to the server for enough time, it would be simpler to get a
  key for an encrypted file system by using hardware memory scanners and reading
  it right off the memory bus.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Replay_attacks?"><a class="selflink" href="#Replay_attacks?">Replay
  attacks?</a></h2>
Nope, the network stuff is all done over TLS, which provides protection against
  that.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Man-in-the-middle?"><a class="selflink" href="#Man-in-the-middle?">Man-in-the-middle?</a></h2>
No. The server only gives out the passwords to clients which have <i>in the TLS
  handshake</i> proven that they do indeed hold the OpenPGP private key
  corresponding to that client.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_about_sniffing_the_network_traffic_and_decrypting_it_later_by_physically_grabbing_the_Mandos_client_and_using_its_key?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_about_sniffing_the_network_traffic_and_decrypting_it_later_by_physically_grabbing_the_Mandos_client_and_using_its_key?">How
  about sniffing the network traffic and decrypting it later by physically
  grabbing the Mandos client and using its key?</a></h2>
We only use PFS (Perfect Forward Security) key exchange algorithms in TLS, which
  protects against this.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Physically_grabbing_the_Mandos_server_computer?"><a class="selflink" href="#Physically_grabbing_the_Mandos_server_computer?">Physically
  grabbing the Mandos server computer?</a></h2>
You could protect <i>that</i> computer the old-fashioned way, with a
  must-type-in-the-password-at-boot method. Or you could have two computers be
  the Mandos server for each other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple Mandos servers can coexist on a network without any trouble. They do
  not clash, and clients will try all available servers. This means that if just
  one reboots then the other can bring it back up, but if both reboot at the
  same time they will stay down until someone types in the password on one of
  them.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Faking_checker_results?"><a class="selflink" href="#Faking_checker_results?">Faking
  checker results?</a></h2>
If the Mandos client does not have an SSH server, the default is for the Mandos
  server to use &#x201C;fping&#x201D;, the replies to which could be faked to
  eliminate the timeout. But this could easily be changed to any shell command,
  with any security measures you like. If the Mandos client <i>has</i> an SSH
  server, the default configuration (as generated by <b>mandos-keygen</b> with
  the <b>--password</b> option) is for the Mandos server to use an
  <b>ssh-keyscan</b> command with strict keychecking, which can not be faked.
  Alternatively, IPsec could be used for the ping packets, making them secure.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
So, in summary: The only weakness in the Mandos system is from people who have:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.The power to come in and physically take
  your servers, <i>and</i></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.The cunning and patience to do it
  carefully, one at a time, and <i>quickly</i>, faking Mandos client/server
  responses for each one before the timeout.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While there are some who may be threatened by people who have <i>both</i> these
  attributes, they do not, probably, constitute the majority.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you <i>do</i> face such opponents, you must figure that they could just as
  well open your servers and read the file system keys right off the memory by
  running wires to the memory bus.
<div class="Pp"></div>
What Mandos is designed to protect against is <i>not</i> such determined,
  focused, and competent attacks, but against the early morning knock on your
  door and the sudden absence of all the servers in your server room. Which it
  does nicely.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PLUGINS"><a class="selflink" href="#PLUGINS">PLUGINS</a></h1>
In the early designs, the <b>mandos-client</b>(8mandos) program (which retrieves
  a password from the Mandos server) also prompted for a password on the
  terminal, in case a Mandos server could not be found. Other ways of retrieving
  a password could easily be envisoned, but this multiplicity of purpose was
  seen to be too complex to be a viable way to continue. Instead, the original
  program was separated into <b>mandos-client</b>(8mandos) and
  <b>password-prompt</b>(8mandos), and a <b>plugin-runner</b>(8mandos) exist to
  run them both in parallel, allowing the first successful plugin to provide the
  password. This opened up for any number of additional plugins to run, all
  competing to be the first to find a password and provide it to the plugin
  runner.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Four additional plugins are provided:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>plymouth</b>(8mandos)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This prompts for a password when using
  <b>plymouth</b>(8).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>usplash</b>(8mandos)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This prompts for a password when using
  <b>usplash</b>(8).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>splashy</b>(8mandos)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This prompts for a password when using
  <b>splashy</b>(8).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>askpass-fifo</b>(8mandos)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">To provide compatibility with the
  &quot;askpass&quot; program from cryptsetup, this plugin listens to the same
  FIFO as askpass would do.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
More plugins can easily be written and added by the system administrator; see
  the section called &quot;WRITING PLUGINS&quot; in
  <b>plugin-runner</b>(8mandos) to learn the plugin requirements.
