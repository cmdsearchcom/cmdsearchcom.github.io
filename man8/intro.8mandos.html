<p>INTRO(8mandos) Mandos Manual INTRO(8mandos)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
intro - Introduction to the Mandos system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is the the Mandos system, which allows computers to
have encrypted root file systems and at the same time be
capable of remote and/or unattended reboots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The computers run a small client
program in the initial RAM disk environment which will
communicate with a server over a network. All network
communication is encrypted using <br>
TLS. The clients are identified by the server using an
OpenPGP key; each client has one unique to it. The server
sends the clients an encrypted password. The encrypted
password <br>
is decrypted by the clients using the same OpenPGP key, and
the password is then used to unlock the root file system,
whereupon the computers can continue booting normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
You know how it is. You&acirc;ve heard of it happening. The
Man comes and takes away your servers, your friends&acirc;
servers, the servers of everybody in the same hosting
facility. The <br>
servers of their neighbors, and their neighbors&acirc;
friends. The servers of people who owe them money. And like
that, they&acirc;re gone. And you doubt you&acirc;ll ever
see them again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is why your servers have
encrypted root file systems. However, there&acirc;s a
downside. There&acirc;s no going around it: rebooting is a
pain. Dragging out that rarely-used keyboard <br>
and screen and unraveling cables behind your servers to plug
them in to type in that password is messy, especially if you
have many servers. There are some people who do clever <br>
things like using serial line consoles and daisy-chain it to
the next server, and keep all the servers connected in a
ring with serial cables, which will work, if your servers
<br>
are physically close enough. There are also other
out-of-band management solutions, but with all these, you
still have to be on hand and manually type in the password
at boot <br>
time. Otherwise the server just sits there, waiting for a
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wouldn&acirc;t it be great if
you could have the security of encrypted root file systems
and still have servers that could boot up automatically if
there was a short power outage while <br>
you were asleep? That you could reboot at will, without
having someone run over to the server to type in the
password?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Well, with Mandos, you (almost)
can! The gain in convenience will only be offset by a small
loss in security. The setup is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server will still have its
encrypted root file system. The password to this file system
will be stored on another computer (henceforth known as the
Mandos server) on the same <br>
local network. The password will not be stored in plaintext,
but encrypted with OpenPGP. To decrypt this password, a key
is needed. This key (the Mandos client key) will not be <br>
stored there, but back on the original server (henceforth
known as the Mandos client) in the initial RAM disk image.
Oh, and all network Mandos client/server communications will
<br>
be encrypted, using TLS (SSL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, at boot time, the Mandos
client will ask for its encrypted data over the network,
decrypt it to get the password, use it to decrypt the root
file, and continue booting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, of course the initial RAM
disk image is not on the encrypted root file system, so
anyone who had physical access could take the Mandos client
computer offline and read the <br>
disk with their own tools to get the authentication keys
used by a client. But, by then the Mandos server should
notice that the original server has been offline for too
long, <br>
and will no longer give out the encrypted key. The timing
here is the only real weak point, and the method, frequency
and timeout of the server&acirc;s checking can be adjusted
to any <br>
desired level of paranoia</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The encrypted keys on the
Mandos server is on its normal file system, so those are
safe, provided the root file system of that server is
encrypted.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS <br>
Couldn&acirc;t the security be defeated by...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grabbing the Mandos client key
from the initrd really quickly? <br>
This, as mentioned above, is the only real weak point. But
if you set the timing values tight enough, this will be
really difficult to do. An attacker would have to physically
<br>
disassemble the client computer, extract the key from the
initial RAM disk image, and then connect to a still online
Mandos server to get the encrypted key, and do all this <br>
before the Mandos server timeout kicks in and the Mandos
server refuses to give out the key to anyone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, as the typical procedure
seems to be to barge in and turn off and grab all computers,
to maybe look at them months later, this is not likely. If
someone does that, the whole <br>
system will lock itself up completely, since Mandos servers
are no longer running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For sophisticated attackers who
could do the clever thing, and had physical access to the
server for enough time, it would be simpler to get a key for
an encrypted file system by <br>
using hardware memory scanners and reading it right off the
memory bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replay attacks? <br>
Nope, the network stuff is all done over TLS, which provides
protection against that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Man-in-the-middle? <br>
No. The server only gives out the passwords to clients which
have in the TLS handshake proven that they do indeed hold
the OpenPGP private key corresponding to that client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How about sniffing the network
traffic and decrypting it later by physically grabbing the
Mandos client and using its key? <br>
We only use PFS (Perfect Forward Security) key exchange
algorithms in TLS, which protects against this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Physically grabbing the Mandos
server computer? <br>
You could protect that computer the old-fashioned way, with
a must-type-in-the-password-at-boot method. Or you could
have two computers be the Mandos server for each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple Mandos servers can
coexist on a network without any trouble. They do not clash,
and clients will try all available servers. This means that
if just one reboots then the <br>
other can bring it back up, but if both reboot at the same
time they will stay down until someone types in the password
on one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Faking checker results? <br>
If the Mandos client does not have an SSH server, the
default is for the Mandos server to use &acirc;fping&acirc;,
the replies to which could be faked to eliminate the
timeout. But this <br>
could easily be changed to any shell command, with any
security measures you like. If the Mandos client has an SSH
server, the default configuration (as generated by <br>
mandos-keygen with the --password option) is for the Mandos
server to use an ssh-keyscan command with strict
keychecking, which can not be faked. Alternatively, IPsec
could be <br>
used for the ping packets, making them secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
So, in summary: The only weakness in the Mandos system is
from people who have:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The power to come in and
physically take your servers, and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The cunning and patience to
do it carefully, one at a time, and quickly, faking Mandos
client/server responses for each one before the timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While there are some who may be
threatened by people who have both these attributes, they do
not, probably, constitute the majority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do face such opponents,
you must figure that they could just as well open your
servers and read the file system keys right off the memory
by running wires to the memory <br>
bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What Mandos is designed to
protect against is not such determined, focused, and
competent attacks, but against the early morning knock on
your door and the sudden absence of all <br>
the servers in your server room. Which it does nicely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLUGINS <br>
In the early designs, the mandos-client(8mandos) program
(which retrieves a password from the Mandos server) also
prompted for a password on the terminal, in case a Mandos
server <br>
could not be found. Other ways of retrieving a password
could easily be envisoned, but this multiplicity of purpose
was seen to be too complex to be a viable way to continue.
<br>
Instead, the original program was separated into
mandos-client(8mandos) and password-prompt(8mandos), and a
plugin-runner(8mandos) exist to run them both in parallel,
allowing <br>
the first successful plugin to provide the password. This
opened up for any number of additional plugins to run, all
competing to be the first to find a password and provide it
<br>
to the plugin runner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Four additional plugins are
provided:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plymouth(8mandos) <br>
This prompts for a password when using plymouth(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usplash(8mandos) <br>
This prompts for a password when using usplash(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splashy(8mandos) <br>
This prompts for a password when using splashy(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">askpass-fifo(8mandos) <br>
To provide compatibility with the &quot;askpass&quot;
program from cryptsetup, this plugin listens to the same
FIFO as askpass would do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More plugins can easily be
written and added by the system administrator; see the
section called &quot;WRITING PLUGINS&quot; in
plugin-runner(8mandos) to learn the plugin requirements.</p>
