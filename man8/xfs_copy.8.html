<p>xfs_copy(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
xfs_copy(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfs_copy - copy the contents of an XFS filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfs_copy [ -bd ] [ -L log ] source target1 [ target2 ... ]
<br>
xfs_copy -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfs_copy copies an XFS filesystem to one or more targets in
parallel (see xfs(5)). The first (source) argument must be
the pathname of the device or file containing the XFS <br>
filesystem. The remaining arguments specify one or more
target devices or file names. If the pathnames specify
devices, a copy of the source XFS filesystem is created on
each <br>
device. The target can also be the name of a regular file,
in which case an image of the source XFS filesystem is
created in that file. If the file does not exist, xfs_copy
cre&acirc; <br>
ates the file. The length of the resulting file is equal to
the size of the source filesystem. However, if the file is
created on an XFS filesystem, the file consumes roughly the
<br>
amount of space actually used in the source filesystem by
the filesystem and the XFS log. The space saving is because
xfs_copy seeks over free blocks instead of copying them and
<br>
the XFS filesystem supports sparse files efficiently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_copy should only be used to
copy unmounted filesystems, read-only mounted filesystems,
or frozen filesystems (see xfs_freeze(8)). Otherwise, the
generated filesystem(s) <br>
would be inconsistent or corrupt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_copy does not alter the
source filesystem in any way. Each new (target) filesystem
is identical to the original filesystem except that new
filesystems each have a new unique <br>
filesystem identifier (UUID). Therefore, if both the old and
new filesystems will be used as separate distinct
filesystems, xfs_copy or xfsdump(8)/xfsrestore(8) should be
used <br>
to generate the new filesystem(s) instead of dd(1) or other
programs that do block-by-block disk copying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_copy uses synchronous writes
to ensure that write errors are detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_copy uses pthreads(7) to
perform simultaneous parallel writes. xfs_copy creates one
additional thread for each target to be written. All threads
die if xfs_copy terminates <br>
or aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Create a duplicate (true clone) filesystem. This should
be done only if the new filesystem will be used as a
replacement for the original filesystem (such as in the case
<br>
of disk replacement).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b The buffered option can be
used to ensure direct IO is not attempted to any of the
target files. This is useful when the filesystem holding the
target file does not sup&acirc; <br>
port direct IO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L log Specifies the location of
the log if the default location of
/var/tmp/xfs_copy.log.XXXXXX is not desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints the version number and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
xfs_copy reports errors to both stderr and in more detailed
form to a generated log file whose name is of the form
/var/tmp/xfs_copy.log.XXXXXX or a log file specified by the
-L <br>
option. If xfs_copy detects a write error on a target, the
copy of that one target is aborted and an error message is
issued to both stderr and the log file, but the rest of the
<br>
copies continue. When xfs_copy terminates, all aborted
targets are reported to both stderr and the log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all targets abort or if there
is an error reading the source filesystem, xfs_copy
immediately aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs_copy returns an exit code of
0 if all targets are successfully copied and an exit code of
1 if any target fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
When moving filesystems from one disk to another, if the
original filesystem is significantly smaller than the new
filesystem, and will be made larger, we recommend that <br>
mkfs.xfs(8) and xfsdump(8)/xfsrestore(8) be used instead of
using xfs_copy and xfs_growfs(8). The filesystem layout
resulting from using xfs_copy/xfs_growfs is almost always
<br>
worse than the result of using mkfs.xfs/xfsdump/xfsrestore
but in the case of small filesystems, the differences can
have a significant performance impact. This is due to the
way <br>
xfs_growfs(8) works, and not due to any shortcoming in
xfs_copy itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
xfs_copy does not copy XFS filesystems that have a real-time
section or XFS filesystems with external logs. In both
cases, xfs_copy aborts with an error message.</p>

xfs_growfs(8), xfs(5).</p>
