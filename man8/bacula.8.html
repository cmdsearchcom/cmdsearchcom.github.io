<p>Bacula(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual Bacula(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Bacula - The Network Backup Solution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bacula-dir - Director <br>
bacula-fd - File daemon or Client <br>
bacula-sd - Storage daemon <br>
bconsole - Console to control Bacula</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bacula is a set of computer programs that permits you (or
the system administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and
verification of computer data across a network of computers
of <br>
different kinds. In technical terms, it is a network
Client/Server based backup program. Bacula is relatively
easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced
storage <br>
management features that make it easy to find and recover
lost or damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is
scalable from small single computer systems to systems
con&acirc; <br>
sisting of hundreds of computers located over a large
network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bacula Director service consists
of the program that supervises all the backup, restore,
verify and archive operations. The system administrator uses
the Bacula Director to <br>
schedule backups and to recover files. For more details see
the Director Services Daemon Design Document in the Bacula
Developer&rsquo;s Guild. The Director runs as a daemon or a
<br>
service (i.e. in the background).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bacula Console services is the
program that allows the administrator or user to communicate
with the Bacula Director (see above). Currently, the Bacula
Console is available in <br>
two versions. The first and simplest is to run the Console
program in a shell window (i.e. TTY interface). Most system
administrators will find this completely adequate. The <br>
second version is a Qt 4.2 GUI interface named bat that has
more features than the bconsole program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bacula File services (or Client
program) is the software program that is installed on the
machine to be backed up. It is specific to the operating
system on which it runs and is <br>
responsible for providing the file attributes and data when
requested by the Director. The File services are also
responsible for the file system dependent part of restoring
the <br>
file attributes and data during a recovery operation. For
more details see the File Services Daemon Design Document in
the Bacula Developer&rsquo;s Guide. This program runs as a
dae&acirc; <br>
mon on the machine to be backed up, and in some of the
documentation, the File daemon is referred to as the Client
(for example in Bacula&rsquo;s configuration file). In
addition to <br>
Unix/Linux File daemons, there is a Windows File daemon
(normally distributed in binary format). The Windows File
daemon runs on all currently known Windows versions (2K,
2003, <br>
XP, and Vista).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bacula Storage services consist
of the software programs that perform the storage and
recovery of the file attributes and data to the physical
backup media or volumes. In other <br>
words, the Storage daemon is responsible for reading and
writing your tapes (or other storage media, e.g. files). For
more details see the Storage Services Daemon Design
Docu&acirc; <br>
ment in the Bacula Developer&rsquo;s Guide. The Storage
services runs as a daemon on the machine that has the backup
device (usually a tape drive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Catalog services are comprised
of the software programs responsible for maintaining the
file indexes and volume databases for all files backed up.
The Catalog services permit <br>
the System Administrator or user to quickly locate and
restore any desired file. The Catalog services sets Bacula
apart from simple backup programs like tar and bru, because
the <br>
catalog maintains a record of all Volumes used, all Jobs
run, and all Files saved, permitting efficient restoration
and Volume management. Bacula currently supports three
dif&acirc; <br>
ferent databases, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite3, one of
which must be chosen when building Bacula.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
See the HTML/PDF documentation at: <br>
&lt;http://www.bacula.org&gt; <br>
for details of the command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Each daemon has its own configuration file which must be
tailored for each particular installation. Please see the
HTML/PDF documentation for the details.</p>
