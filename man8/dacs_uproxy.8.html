<p>DACS_UPROXY(8) DACS Web Services Manual
DACS_UPROXY(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dacs_uproxy - minimal HTTP proxying</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dacs_uproxy [dacsoptions[1]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This web service is part of the DACS suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dacs_uproxy web service
accepts an incoming HTTP request (the initial request), then
reissues a nearly identical HTTP request to a different URL
(the proxied request) and <br>
returns its unaltered response. The initial request must use
either the GET or POST HTTP method; the proxied request will
use the same method as the initial request. Note that <br>
the origin server (the web server that receives the proxied
request) will see a request that originates at the host that
runs dacs_uproxy, not the host that issues the initial <br>
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run on a firewall host, the
program can be useful for forwarding incoming requests to
interior hosts. An origin server does not need to be running
DACS. All access control <br>
is performed by the jurisdiction that runs dacs_uproxy.
Similarly, the program can be useful for forwarding requests
that originate behind the firewall, subject to access
control <br>
permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dacs_uproxy is not a transparent
proxy server. A request URL must be explicitly addressed to
it and include a (partial) name for the target resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
The program must be configured with care because it can
expose otherwise inaccessible hosts to arbitrary HTTP
requests from any source that can connect to
dacs_uproxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Particular care must be taken if
a program that is invoked by dacs_uproxy generates a
redirect that may be handled internally by the
program&rsquo;s web server. In this event the <br>
new request arising from the redirection will not
automatically be subjected to access control because the new
request does come through dacs_uproxy. Therefore, local <br>
redirects must be avoided by proxied web services, resources
that might be invoked through a local redirect must be
publicly accessible, or authorization checking must <br>
somehow be arranged for these resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access control rules are
primarily responsible for expressing restrictions on what
can be proxied and who can use this service. By default, all
access to this service is <br>
denied. Additionally, UPROXY_APPROVED[2] directives must be
configured to allow proxying to specific origin servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although in its current form the
program has the effect of anonymizing the proxied request,
this is more of a bug than a feature. Future versions may
forward an initial <br>
request&rsquo;s headers and other information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the exception of the Cookie
header, most request headers that accompany the initial
request are sent with the proxied request. dacs_uproxy makes
no attempt to &quot;impersonate&quot; <br>
the user&rsquo;s host, however. Therefore, to the origin
server it appears as if the request is coming from
dacs_uproxy and the IP address from which the forwarded
request is sent. Any <br>
cookies sent with the initial request are interpreted by
dacs_uproxy (e.g., to identify the user making the request
for access control purposes). At present, it is not possible
<br>
to forward cookies with the proxied request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So that the proxied web service
can tell that it is being invoked by dacs_uproxy, an
extension header named DACS-Uproxy-Via is included with the
forwarded request. Its value is <br>
the URL of dacs_uproxy with the proxied host appended. With
Apache, its value can be accessed from the environment
variable HTTP_DACS_UPROXY_VIA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If dacs_uproxy is passed a
DACS_APPROVAL[3] value, that value is forwarded with the
request through the DACS-Uproxy-Approval header and made
available by Apache in the <br>
HTTP_DACS_UPROXY_APPROVAL environment variable. A program
invoked indirectly through dacs_uproxy can use this
information to confirm that DACS authorized the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the forwarded request
generates a redirect (a 3xx class HTTP status code is
returned), it causes dacs_uproxy to return the redirection
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program is a minimal or
&quot;micro&quot; HTTP proxy, hence the u in dacs_uproxy
should really be the Greek letter mu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Web Service Arguments <br>
With some exceptions, all arguments passed to dacs_uproxy
are forwarded to the proxied request and are not interpreted
by dacs_uproxy. The first exception is DACS_ACS[4]. Another
<br>
exception is DACS_UPROXY; if its value is DEBUG, debugging
output is produced. Neither of these arguments is forwarded
with the proxied request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation <br>
A specification of the proxied request appears as a
component of the initial request. It is best to explain this
with an example. Let us assume that the URL for the
dacs_uproxy <br>
that the client wants to use is
https://example.com/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_uproxy. Let us also
assume that the client wants to access a web service at
foo.example.com (the proxied <br>
host) and that this web service can be invoked from
example.com (the proxying host) as
https://foo.example.com/cgi-bin/some_app. To achieve this,
the client would invoke this <br>
URL:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://example.com/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_uproxy/foo.example.com/cgi-bin/some_app</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that no scheme is included
with the name of the proxied host. A port number may follow
it, however, and any path components that follow are
appended (after the mapping <br>
specified by UPROXY_APPROVED) to form the final proxied
URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this example to be
authorized, an access control rule must grant the user
access to the initial URL. Whether there is additional
access control enforced at the proxied host <br>
is the responsibility of a web administrator. A simple rule
that grants access to any authenticated user looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;acl_rule
status=&quot;enabled&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;services&gt; <br>
&lt;service
url_expr=&rsquo;&quot;${Conf::dacs_cgi_bin_prefix}/dacs_uproxy&quot;&rsquo;/&gt;
<br>
&lt;service
url_expr=&rsquo;&quot;${Conf::dacs_cgi_bin_prefix}/dacs_uproxy/*&quot;&rsquo;/&gt;
<br>
&lt;/services&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;rule
order=&quot;allow,deny&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;allow&gt; <br>
user(&quot;auth&quot;) <br>
&lt;/allow&gt; <br>
&lt;/rule&gt; <br>
&lt;/acl_rule&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most sophisticated rules may of
course be used to further constrain how dacs_uproxy can be
used and by whom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UPROXY_APPROVED[2] directive
must be configured before dacs_uproxy will do anything, even
if otherwise permitted by an access control rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SSL/TLS is used for the
proxied request, the usual DACS configuration directives for
SSL/TLS apply - see dacs.conf(5)[5]. SSL/TLS can be used for
the proxied request <br>
independently of whether it is used for the initial
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The program exits 0 if everything was fine, 1 if an error
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The implementation may not yet fully conform to RFC
2616[6].</p>
