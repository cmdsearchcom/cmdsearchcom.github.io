<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUNT.FEDFS(8) System
Manager&rsquo;s Manual MOUNT.FEDFS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mount.fedfs - mount a FedFS domain root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mount.fedfs remotedir localdir [-fhnrsvVw] [-o options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for
short). FedFS is an extensible standardized mechanism by
which system administrators construct a coherent namespace
<br>
across multiple file servers using file system referrals.
For further details, see fedfs(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mount.fedfs(8) command
locates FedFS domains by looking for DNS SRV records that
advertise file servers exporting FedFS domain root replicas.
The remotedir argument deter&acirc; <br>
mines what FedFS domain is mounted and what network file
system protocol is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mount.fedfs(8) command sorts
the list of available domain root replicas according to the
SRV record sorting rules outlined in RFC 2782. It attempts
to contact each file <br>
server appearing in the SRV record list until a mount
request succeeds or the end of the SRV record list is
reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line arguments <br>
The first argument, remotedir, is the globally useful name
to mount. Globally useful names are discussed in more detail
in fedfs(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second argument, localdir,
specifies the local directory on which to mount the
requested FedFS globally useful name. As with other file
systems, localdir must exist on the <br>
client for a mount request to succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mount.fedfs(8) command
converts the specified remotedir and localdir arguments,
along with information obtained via DNS SRV queries, to
arguments suitable for a local mount <br>
request. It then forks and execs the appropriate file system
mount subcommand (such as the mount.nfs(8) subcommand) to
mount the file server where the domain root resides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because an unmodified file
system mount subcommand is used for the actual mount
operation, the file system&rsquo;s equivalent umount
subcommand is all that is required to unmount this <br>
mount point when it is finished being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount option inheritance <br>
The Linux NFS client treats an NFS referral as a
server-initiated mount request. The referring fileserver
provides only a list of server names and export paths. The
mount <br>
options for this new mount are inherited from the new mount
point&rsquo;s parent directory on the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As applications proceed deeper
into a domain&rsquo;s namespace, they can encounter both
file sets to which they have read-only access, and file sets
to which they have read-write <br>
access. To allow applications proper access to both types of
file sets, typically file-access clients mount domain root
directories in read-write mode. All submounts of the <br>
domain root are then mounted read-write as well. Write
access is then controlled by fileservers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a domain root may
contain an NFS version 4 referral to an export containing
user home directories. The domain root may be exported
read-only so file-access clients <br>
cannot update it, but user home directories would not be
very useful if they could not be written to by their owners.
The fileserver continues to employ user credentials to <br>
limit access as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network file system clients
follow file system referrals as applications encounter them,
which is similar to how an automounter works. Consider the
initial mount of the domain <br>
root as if you are mounting a single whole file system, even
though underneath, additional NFS mounts come and go as
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-f, --fake <br>
Fake mount. This option is ignored by mount.fedfs(8) but is
passed to the underlying file system mount subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print the mount.fedfs(8) usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-mtab <br>
Do not update /etc/mtab. This option is ignored by
mount.fedfs(8) but is passed to the underlying file system
mount subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --options options <br>
Specify mount options for this mount point and all
submounts. These are ignored by mount.fedfs(8) but are
passed to the underlying file system mount subcommand. For
fur&acirc; <br>
ther details, refer to mount(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --ro, --read-only <br>
Mount the domain root and all submounts read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sloppy <br>
Tolerate unrecognized mount options. This is ignored by
mount.fedfs(8) but is passed to the underlying file system
mount subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Report more information during the mount process. This
affects mount.fedfs(8) and is also passed to the underlying
file system mount subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version information for mount.fedfs(8) and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --rw, --read-write <br>
Mount the domain root and all submounts read-write. This is
the default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To mount the domain root of the example.net FedFS domain via
NFS version 4 automatically, you might add this to your
/etc/fstab:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/nfs4/example.net
/nfs4/example.net fedfs defaults 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A FedFS domain root can also be
mounted with a stand-alone invocation of mount(8):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># mount -t fedfs
/nfs4/example.net /mnt/fedfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mounts the FedFS domain
root for the example.net domain on the client&rsquo;s
/mnt/fedfs directory. A simple</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># umount /mnt/fedfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmounts it when you are
finished with it.</p>
