<p>APCTEST(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
APCTEST(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apctest &acirc; apcupsd(8) test program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apctest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apctest is a program that enables the running of certain
low-level tests to check the operation of the attached
simple signalling American Power Conversion Corp (APC) UPS
and to <br>
check that your apcupsd(8) configuration is correctly setup
and can establish communication with the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For an APC UPS operating in APC
smart protocol mode, apctest enables the reading and
programming of the values of the UPS EEPROM configuration
variables as well and the performing <br>
of a battery runtime calibration. It also provides a simple
TTY chat mode which allows direct interaction with the UPS
via the APC smart protocol. For details of this protocol
<br>
and the available commands, refer to the detailed &quot;APC
Smart Protocol&quot; section in the apcupsd manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT: Before running
apctest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Check that the
UPSCABLE, UPSTYPE and DEVICE configuration directives in the
apcupsd.conf(5) configuration file have been set
appropriately; and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Shutdown apcupsd
if it is running. You cannot run both apcupsd and apctest at
the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run, apctest displays a
menu of options which are different depending on whether the
UPS is connected to a USB port or to a serial port. For a
serial port connection, there <br>
are two different menus depending on whether the UPS is
operating in APC smart protocol mode or simple signalling
mode - this also depends on which cable is used to connect
to the <br>
UPS. If a simple signalling cable is used to connect to a
Smart-UPS, the UPS will only be able to operate in simple
signalling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apctest saves a transcript of
the session to the file apctest.out in the directory from
which the program was called. Its content is useful for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USB PORT <br>
When using a UPS connected to a USB port (eg Back-UPS RS
1500), the following menu options will appear:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 1) Test kill UPS power
<br>
Performs a power down of the UPS into hibernate mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 2) Perform self-test <br>
Performs an immediate self-test (switches to battery power
to do so).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 3) Read last self-test
result <br>
Displays the last self-test result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 4) View/Change battery
date <br>
Displays the current battery replacement date and optionally
allows you to change it - useful when the battery is
replaced so that you can accurately keep track of its
age.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 5) View manufacturing
date <br>
Displays the date the UPS was manufactured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 6) View/Change alarm
behavior <br>
Sets the delay period before the UPS starts sounding its
alarm when the utility power is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 7) View/Change
sensitivity <br>
Changes how sensitive the UPS is to the utility power
quality and voltage fluctuations - (H)igh, (M)edium or
(L)ow. The higher the sensitivity, the faster the UPS will
switch to <br>
battery power or activate SmartBoost/SmartTrim (features
that avoid using battery power provided the under/over
voltage is within 12% of nominal). This setting should
normally be <br>
set to High unless the UPS switches to battery power
frequently, in which case a less sensitive setting will
preserve UPS batteries... if the connected equipment can
tolerate the <br>
power quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 8) View/Change low
transfer voltage <br>
Sets the low voltage level at which the UPS switches to
battery or activates SmartBoost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 9) View/Change high
transfer voltage <br>
Sets the high voltage level at which the UPS switches to
battery or activates SmartTrim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 10) Perform battery
calibration <br>
This performs a battery runtime calibration. This can only
be performed if your battery is charged to 100% of capacity.
The runtime calibration discharges the UPS battery to <br>
approximately 25% of capacity. The exact percentage depends
on the UPS model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantage of doing this
calibration is that the UPS will recalibrate the remaining
runtime counter that it maintains and therefore report a
more accurate estimated runtime. As <br>
batteries age, they tend to hold less charge, so the
UPS&rsquo;s internal runtime counter may not be accurate
after several years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that battery
runtime calibration be performed annually. Performing it too
often shortens the lifetime of the UPS batteries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 11) Test Alarm <br>
This option will cause the UPS alarm beeper to sound for
several seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 12) View/Change self-test
interval <br>
This option allows you to change the time interval between
automatic UPS self-tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option Q) Quit <br>
Exits from the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERIAL PORT (SMART PROTOCOL
MODE) <br>
When using a UPS operating in APC smart protocol mode (eg a
Smart-UPS) the following menu options will appear:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 1) Query the UPS for all
known values <br>
Selecting this option probes the UPS for all EEPROM
configuration variable values known to apctest and displays
them in rather raw format. This output can be useful for
providing <br>
technical support if you are having problems with the
behaviour of the UPS or apcupsd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 2) Perform a Battery
Runtime Calibration <br>
This performs a battery runtime calibration. This can only
be performed if your battery is charged to 100% of capacity.
The runtime calibration discharges the UPS battery to <br>
approximately 25% of capacity. The exact percentage depends
on the UPS model. apctest can optionally abort the
calibration if it detects that the battery charge is below
10%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantage of doing this
calibration is that the UPS will recalibrate the remaining
runtime counter that it maintains and therefore report a
more accurate estimated runtime. As <br>
batteries age, they tend to hold less charge, so the
UPS&rsquo;s internal runtime counter may not be accurate
after several years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that battery
runtime calibration be performed annually. Performing it too
often shortens the lifetime of the UPS batteries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 3) Abort Battery
Calibration <br>
This option aborts an in progress battery runtime
calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 4) Monitor Battery
Calibration progress <br>
Allows restarting of the monitoring of a battery runtime
calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 5) Program EEPROM <br>
Allows the programming of the values of a Smart-UPS&rsquo;s
EEPROM configuration variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choosing this option presents a
sub-menu of programming options which are detailed
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 1) Print EEPROM
values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints the value of all EEPROM
configuration variables known to apctest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 2) Change Battery
date</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the battery date -
useful when the battery is replaced so that you can
accurately keep track of its age.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 3) Change UPS name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the UPS name - use no
more than 8 characters to name the UPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 4) Change sensitivity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes how sensitive the UPS is
to the utility power quality and voltage fluctuations -
(H)igh, (M)edium or (L)ow. The higher the sensitivity, the
faster the UPS will <br>
switch to battery power or activate SmartBoost/SmartTrim
(features that avoid using battery power provided the
under/over voltage is within 12% of nominal). This setting
<br>
should normally be set to High unless the UPS switches to
battery power frequently, in which case a less sensitive
setting will preserve UPS batteries... if the connected <br>
equipment can tolerate the power quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 5) Change alarm delay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the delay period before
the UPS starts sounding its alarm when the utility power is
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 6) Change low battery
warning delay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the remaining runtime
minutes at which the UPS will send the low battery signal.
When the UPS internally calculates that the specified number
of minutes remains <br>
before battery power will be exhausted, it sends the low
battery warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 7) Change wakeup
delay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the delay before the UPS
restores power to connected equipment when the utility power
returns after shutting down in hibernate mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 8) Change shutdown
delay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the delay for which the
UPS waits before shutting off power to the connected
equipment after being commanded to power down in hibernate
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 9) Change low transfer
voltage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the low voltage level at
which the UPS switches to battery or activates
SmartBoost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 10) Change high transfer
voltage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the high voltage level
at which the UPS switches to battery or activates
SmartTrim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 11) Change battery return
threshold percent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the battery charge
percentage required after power down in hibernate mode
before to the UPS will restore power to connected equipment
on the return of utility <br>
power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 12) Change output voltage
when on batteries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the nominal voltage
output when the UPS is running on battery power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 13) Change the self test
interval</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes or disables the
automatic self-test interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 14) Set EEPROM with
configuration file values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option allows the bulk
programming of the EEPROM configuration variables from the
values contained in the /etc/apcupsd.conf configuration
file. Refer to the &quot;APCTEST <br>
EEPROM CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES&quot; section of the man
page for apcupsd.conf(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 15) Quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option exits back to the
previous (main) menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 6) Enter TTY mode
communicating with UPS <br>
This option allows direct interaction with the attached UPS
using the APC smart protocol commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Take special care what
commands you enter because it is possible to cause the UPS
to suddenly shutdown or, in the worst case, modify the UPS
in such a way as to perma&acirc; <br>
nently disable it. Do NOT experiment with unknown or
unsupported commands. Caveat Utilitor!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 7) Quit <br>
Exits from the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERIAL PORT (SIMPLE SIGNALLING
MODE) <br>
