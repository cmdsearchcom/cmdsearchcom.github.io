<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
innbind - Helper program to bind sockets to privileged
ports</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
innbind [-p] fd,family,address,port [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
innbind is a helper program that&rsquo;s not meant to be run
directly. Instead, innd and nnrpd use it internally to bind
to ports that require root privileges to bind to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program must be installed
setuid root in order for innd or nnrpd to bind to ports
under 1024. The only functions that it&rsquo;s willing to
perform are to bind an open file <br>
descriptor to a given address and port or to create a new
socket, bind it, and return the bound socket to its caller.
It can only be run as the news user (as specified at <br>
configure time), and will only bind to ports 119, 433, 563,
an additional port specified with the --with-innd-port
argument to configure, or ports numbered 1024 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each argument to innbind must be
a comma-separated list of four elements. The first is the
file descriptor number that should be bound, the second is
the numeric family of the <br>
socket (AF_INET or AF_INET6), the third is the local address
to bind to (in dotted-quad format for IPv4 and in
colon-separated address format for IPv6), and the fourth is
the <br>
port number. To bind to all addresses with IPv4, use 0.0.0.0
as the address. To bind to all addresses with IPv6, use
&quot;::&quot; as the address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple arguments can be
specified to tell innbind to bind multiple sockets at the
same time. Any errors (other than permission denied -- see
below) encountered will cause <br>
innbind to abort, and error messages will be sent both to
syslog and to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, innbind attempts to
just bind the already open file descriptor that it inherits
from its caller. For each successfully bound file descriptor
(in the order given on <br>
the command line), innbind prints &quot;ok&quot; and a
newline to its standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems (apparently just
STREAMS-based systems), however, even a setuid root program
cannot bind a socket to a privileged port that was created
by a process that didn&rsquo;t <br>
have permissions. If innbind gets permission denied when
trying to bind a socket, it will print &quot;no&quot; and a
newline to its standard output. It will then create a new
socket, <br>
bind it as specified, and then attempt to pass that socket
back to its caller using the I_SENDFD STREAMS ioctl. The
caller should receive that file descriptor with I_RECVFD and
<br>
use it instead of the one that it created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that file descriptor
passing is only supported on STREAMS-based systems since it
is done with ioctls over a pipe. However, it is believed
that those systems are exactly the <br>
systems that can&rsquo;t simply bind the inherited file
descriptor. If this assumption proves to be incorrect,
traditional BSD file descriptor passing over a Unix domain
socket will <br>
have to be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p If given as the first command-line argument, no attempt
will be made to bind the inherited file descriptor and
innbind will only try creation of a new file descriptor and
<br>
passing it back via standard output. This option is
primarily useful for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
As innbind is normally installed setuid root, security is
even more of an issue for it than for other parts of INN. It
is a fairly short program, and if you understand C, you <br>
are encouraged to audit it yourself to be certain that it
does only what it is supposed to do. The only INN library
functions it uses are the vector functions, the message <br>
functions for error reporting, and xstrdup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ports that will be bound are
restricted to prevent potential attacks made possible by the
ability to bind low-numbered ports, such as exploits of the
rsh(1) family of <br>
commands on some systems. If innbind is installed setuid
root, it can only be executed by the news user to prevent
other users on the system from being able to bind to even
<br>
those few privileged ports that it allows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innbind uses no external
configuration files; the only files it might open are
through the system getpwnam(3) service to get the UID of the
news user. The only user input that <br>
it accepts are its command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
innbind may log the following messages to syslog and print
them to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot create socket for %s: %s
<br>
(Fatal) innbind fell back on attempting to create a new
socket to bind for the given argument, and the socket
creation failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot bind socket for %s: %s
<br>
(Fatal) Calling bind for the socket corresponding to the
given argument failed with a system error. If the error
indicates permission denied, make sure that innbind is <br>
setuid root. This can also be caused by trying to use IPv6
on a system whose kernel does not support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot bind to restricted port
%hu in %s <br>
(Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line
argument is for a port below 1024 which is not 119, 433,
563, or a port given to --with-innd-port at configure time.
<br>
Other ports are not allowed for security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot get socket options for
file descriptor %d: %s <br>
(Fatal) innbind was unable to get the socket options for
that file descriptor. The most likely cause of this error is
passing the wrong file descriptor number to innbind (a <br>
file descriptor that isn&rsquo;t open, or that corresponds
to a regular file rather than a network socket).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot get UID for %s <br>
(Fatal) innbind was unable to get the UID for the news user
specified during configure (and defaulting to
&quot;news&quot;). This normally means that user isn&rsquo;t
in the system passwd <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot mark socket reusable for
%s: %s <br>
(Fatal) innbind created a new socket for the given argument
but was unable to mark its bind address reusable (the
SO_REUSEADDR socket option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot pass file descriptor: %s
<br>
(Fatal) innbind created and bound a new file descriptor but
was unable to pass it back to its caller via its standard
output, using the I_SENDFD STREAMS ioctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid file descriptor %d: not
SOCK_STREAM <br>
(Fatal) The given file descriptor is not a SOCK_STREAM
socket. innbind can only bind SOCK_STREAM sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid IPv4 address %s in %s
<br>
(Fatal) The IPv4 address specified in the given command-line
option could not be parsed by inet_aton(3). IPv4 addresses
should be specified in the standard dotted-quad <br>
format (10.2.3.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid IPv6 address %s in %s
<br>
(Fatal) The IPv6 address specified in the given command-line
option could not be parsed by inet_pton(3). IPv6 addresses
should be specified in RFC 4291 format <br>
(1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A or 1080::8:800:200C:417A).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid command-line argument %s
<br>
(Fatal) The specified command-line argument could not be
parsed or was not in the correct format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid file descriptor %s in %s
<br>
(Fatal) The file descriptor portion of the given
command-line argument is not a non-negative integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid port number %s in %s
<br>
(Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line
argument is not a non-negative integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid protocol family %s in %s
<br>
(Fatal) The protocol family portion of the given
command-line argument is not a non-negative integer. It
should be equal to either AF_INET or AF_INET6 on the system
where <br>
innbind is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">must be run by user %s (%lu),
not %lu <br>
(Fatal) When setuid root, innbind may only be run by the
news user as specified at configure time (&quot;news&quot;
by default), for security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no addresses specified <br>
(Fatal) No arguments were given on the command line (except
maybe -p).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port may not be zero in %s <br>
(Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line
argument was zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unknown protocol family %s in %s
<br>
(Fatal) The protocol number portion of the given
command-line argument is neither AF_INET nor AF_INET6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
As mentioned above, innbind is never run directly, only by
innd and other programs that need to bind to and listen to
network ports. Sample invocations by innd would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innbind 3,10,::,119</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to bind the IPv6 socket on file
descriptor 3 to port 119, all addresses, or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innbind 6,2,10.0.0.3,433</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to bind the IPv4 socket on file
descriptor 6 to port 433 in the address 10.0.0.3.</p>
