innbind - Helper program to bind sockets to privileged ports
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>innbind</b> [<b>-p</b>] <i>fd</i>,<i>family</i>,<i>address</i>,<i>port</i>
  [...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>innbind</b> is a helper program that's not meant to be run directly. Instead,
  <b>innd</b> and <b>nnrpd</b> use it internally to bind to ports that require
  root privileges to bind to.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program must be installed setuid root in order for <b>innd</b> or
  <b>nnrpd</b> to bind to ports under 1024. The only functions that it's willing
  to perform are to bind an open file descriptor to a given address and port or
  to create a new socket, bind it, and return the bound socket to its caller. It
  can only be run as the news user (as specified at configure time), and will
  only bind to ports 119, 433, 563, an additional port specified with the
  <b>--with-innd-port</b> argument to configure, or ports numbered 1024 or
  higher.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each argument to <b>innbind</b> must be a comma-separated list of four elements.
  The first is the file descriptor number that should be bound, the second is
  the numeric family of the socket (AF_INET or AF_INET6), the third is the local
  address to bind to (in dotted-quad format for IPv4 and in colon-separated
  address format for IPv6), and the fourth is the port number. To bind to all
  addresses with IPv4, use 0.0.0.0 as the address. To bind to all addresses with
  IPv6, use &quot;::&quot; as the address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple arguments can be specified to tell <b>innbind</b> to bind multiple
  sockets at the same time. Any errors (other than permission denied
  --&#x00A0;see below) encountered will cause <b>innbind</b> to abort, and error
  messages will be sent both to syslog and to standard error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>innbind</b> attempts to just bind the already open file
  descriptor that it inherits from its caller. For each successfully bound file
  descriptor (in the order given on the command line), <b>innbind</b> prints
  &quot;ok&quot; and a newline to its standard output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On some systems (apparently just STREAMS-based systems), however, even a setuid
  root program cannot bind a socket to a privileged port that was created by a
  process that didn't have permissions. If <b>innbind</b> gets permission denied
  when trying to bind a socket, it will print &quot;no&quot; and a newline to
  its standard output. It will then create a new socket, bind it as specified,
  and then attempt to pass that socket back to its caller using the I_SENDFD
  STREAMS ioctl. The caller should receive that file descriptor with I_RECVFD
  and use it instead of the one that it created.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that file descriptor passing is only supported on STREAMS-based systems
  since it is done with ioctls over a pipe. However, it is believed that those
  systems are exactly the systems that can't simply bind the inherited file
  descriptor. If this assumption proves to be incorrect, traditional BSD file
  descriptor passing over a Unix domain socket will have to be added.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If given as the first command-line argument, no attempt
      will be made to bind the inherited file descriptor and <b>innbind</b> will
      only try creation of a new file descriptor and passing it back via
      standard output. This option is primarily useful for testing.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
As <b>innbind</b> is normally installed setuid root, security is even more of an
  issue for it than for other parts of INN. It is a fairly short program, and if
  you understand C, you are encouraged to audit it yourself to be certain that
  it does only what it is supposed to do. The only INN library functions it uses
  are the vector functions, the message functions for error reporting, and
  xstrdup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ports that will be bound are restricted to prevent potential attacks made
  possible by the ability to bind low-numbered ports, such as exploits of the
  <i>rsh</i>(1) family of commands on some systems. If <b>innbind</b> is
  installed setuid root, it can only be executed by the news user to prevent
  other users on the system from being able to bind to even those few privileged
  ports that it allows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>innbind</b> uses no external configuration files; the only files it might
  open are through the system <i>getpwnam</i>(3) service to get the UID of the
  news user. The only user input that it accepts are its command-line arguments.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
<b>innbind</b> may log the following messages to syslog and print them to
  standard error.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">cannot create socket for %s: %s</dt>

As mentioned above, <b>innbind</b> is never run directly, only by <b>innd</b>
  and other programs that need to bind to and listen to network ports. Sample
  invocations by <b>innd</b> would be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    innbind 3,10,::,119
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to bind the IPv6 socket on file descriptor 3 to port 119, all addresses, or:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    innbind 6,2,10.0.0.3,433
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to bind the IPv4 socket on file descriptor 6 to port 433 in the address
  10.0.0.3.
