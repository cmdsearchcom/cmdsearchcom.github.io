<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipppd - (ISDN) Point to Point Protocol daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/ipppd [ options ] [ device ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a method for
transmitting datagrams over serial point-to-point links. PPP
is composed of three parts: a method for encapsulating
data&acirc; <br>
grams over serial links, an extensible Link Control Protocol
(LCP), and a family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for
establishing and configuring different network-layer
pro&acirc; <br>
tocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The encapsulation scheme is
provided by driver code in the kernel. ipppd provides the
basic LCP, authentication support, and an NCP for
establishing and configuring the Internet <br>
Protocol (IP) (called the IP Control Protocol, IPCP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES for (ISDN) IPPPD <br>
This special (ISDN) PPP daemon is a modified version of pppd
and provides synchronous PPP for ISDN connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need asynchronous PPP
over ISDN lines use pppd instead with the ISDN character
devices, see ttyI(4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ipppd can handle multiple
devices. This is necessary to link several connections
together to one bundle. ipppd should be started once. It
opens the devices and waits for <br>
connections. If the connections is closed ipppd reopens the
device automatically (the device, that&rsquo;s it ... not
the link to the remote). So you shouldn&rsquo;t kill the
ipppd to <br>
close a link. Instead, trigger a hangup on the netdevice
layer by &rsquo;isdnctrl hangup &lt;device&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The facility to configure the
daemon via file /etc/ppp/ioptions.&lt;devname&gt; is
disabled. The &rsquo;file&rsquo; option or the command line
may be used for individual configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not set the permissions of
the program to &rsquo;setuid to root on execution&rsquo;.
Call the daemon as root instead. No common user should have
the need to call the daemon!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;device&gt; <br>
Communicate over the named device. The string
&quot;/dev/&quot; is prepended if necessary. If no device
name is given, or if the name of the controlling terminal is
given, ipppd <br>
will use the controlling terminal, and will not fork to put
itself in the background.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;local_IP_address&gt;:&lt;remote_IP_address&gt;
<br>
Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses. Either
one may be omitted. The IP addresses can be specified with a
host name or in decimal dot notation (e.g. <br>
150.234.56.78). The default local address is the (first) IP
address of the system (unless the noipdefault option is
given). The remote address will be obtained from the <br>
peer if not specified in any option. Thus, in simple cases,
this option is not required. If a local and/or remote IP
address is specified with this option, ipppd will <br>
not accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP
negotiation, unless the ipcp-accept-local and/or
ipcp-accept-remote options are given, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">active-filter filter-expression
<br>
Specifies a packet filter to be applied to data packets to
determine which packets are to be regarded as link activity,
and therefore reset the idle timer, or cause the <br>
link to be brought up in demand-dialling mode. This option
is useful in conjunction with the idle option if there are
packets being sent or received regularly over the <br>
link (for example, routing information packets) which would
otherwise prevent the link from ever appearing to be idle.
The filter-expression syntax is as described for <br>
tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers which are inappropriate
for a PPP link, such as ether and arp, are not permitted.
Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in <br>
single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from
being interpreted by the shell. This option is currently
only available if both the kernel and ipppd were com&acirc;
<br>
piled with IPPP_FILTER defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ac Disable Address/Control
compression negotiation (use default, i.e. address/control
field compression disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-all Don&rsquo;t request or
allow negotiation of any options for LCP and IPCP (use
default values).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth Require the peer to
authenticate itself before allowing network packets to be
sent or received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsdcomp nr,nt <br>
Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using
the BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of nr
bits, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer <br>
with a maximum code size of nt bits. If nt is not specified,
it defaults to the value given for nr. Values in the range 9
to 15 may be used for nr and nt; larger values <br>
give better compression but consume more kernel memory for
compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for nr
or nt disables compression in the corresponding <br>
direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bsdcomp <br>
Disables compression; ipppd will not request or agree to
compress packets using the BSD-Compress scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback &lt;string&gt; <br>
Request the peer to call back at the location given in
&lt;string&gt;. Usually this is a phone number, but it may
be interpreted differently (or ignored) depending on the
call&acirc; <br>
back-type option. If &lt;string&gt; is the empty string,
ipppd automatically tries to negotiate a callback type that
does not need a location to be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback-delay &lt;n&gt; <br>
Callback delay for CBCP in seconds. If callback is
negotiated using CBCP, request that the peer waits at least
&lt;n&gt; seconds before calling back. Ignored if callback
is <br>
negotiated as specified in RFC 1570. Legal range is 0..255,
default is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback-cbcp <br>
Enable callback negotiation via CBCB (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-callback-cbcp <br>
Disable callback negotiation via CBCB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-callback-cbcp <br>
Disable callback negotiation via CBCB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback-cbcp-preferred <br>
If both CBCP and RFC 1570 style callback negotiation is
enabled, CBCP is preferred (default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback-rfc1570-preferred <br>
If both CBCP and RFC 1570 style callback negotiation is
enabled, RFC 1570 style is preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback-rfc1570 <br>
Enable RFC 1570 style callback negotiation (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-callback-rfc1570 <br>
Disable RFC 1570 style callback negotiation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-callback-rfc1570 <br>
Disable RFC 1570 style callback negotiation (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback-type &lt;n&gt; <br>
Specifies how to interpret the location identifier given as
parameter of the callback option. Legal values are 0..4. A
value of 0 means that only callback types should be <br>
negotiated that need no extra location id. No location id is
sent to the peer in this case. For RFC 1570 style callback
negotiation, the values 1..4 indicate how the peer <br>
should interpret the location identifier: 1 - id is a system
specific dial string, 2 - id is used for database lookup by
the peer, 3 - id is a phone number, and 4 id is a <br>
name. For CBCP callback negotiation, the location id is
always interpreted as a phone number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ccp Necessary for a few
netblazers on the remote side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noccp same as -ccp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+chap Require the peer to
authenticate itself using CHAP [Cryptographic Handshake
Authentication Protocol] authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chap Don&rsquo;t agree to
authenticate using CHAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chap-interval &lt;n&gt; <br>
If this option is given, ipppd will rechallenge the peer
every &lt;n&gt; seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chap-max-challenge &lt;n&gt;
<br>
Set the maximum number of CHAP challenge transmissions to
&lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chap-restart &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for
challenges) to &lt;n&gt; seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Increase debugging level
(same as -d). If this option is given, ipppd will log the
contents of all control packets sent or received in a
readable form. The packets are <br>
logged through syslog with facility daemon and level debug.
This information can be directed to a file by setting up
/etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see syslog.conf(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Increase debugging level
(same as the debug option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaultroute <br>
Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the
peer as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully
completed. This entry is removed when the PPP con&acirc;
<br>
nection is broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-defaultroute <br>
Disable the defaultroute option. The system administrator
who wishes to prevent users from creating default routes
with ipppd can do so by placing this option in the <br>
/etc/ppp/ioptions file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deldefaultroute <br>
Replace default route if it already exists. Together with
the option defaultroute, this will replace any existing
default route by a new one through this ipppd&rsquo;s
interface <br>
when it comes up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-detach <br>
Don&rsquo;t fork to become a background process (otherwise
ipppd will do so if a serial device other than its
controlling terminal is specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">domain &lt;d&gt; <br>
Append the domain name &lt;d&gt; to the local host name for
authentication purposes. For example, if gethostname()
returns the name porsche, but the fully qualified domain
name <br>
is porsche.Quotron.COM, you would use the domain option to
set the domain name to Quotron.COM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file &lt;f&gt; <br>
Read options from file &lt;f&gt; (the format is described
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ip Disable IP address
negotiation. If this option is used, the remote IP address
must be specified with an option on the command line or in
an options file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ip-protocol <br>
Enable the IPCP and IP protocols. This is the default
condition. This option is only needed if the default setting
is -ip-protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ip-protocol <br>
Disable the IPCP and IP protocols. This should only be used
if you know that you are using a client which only
understands IPX and you don&rsquo;t want to confuse the
client <br>
with the IPCP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ipx-protocol <br>
Enable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This is the default
condition if your kernel supports IPX. This option is only
needed if the default setting is -ipx-protocol. If your <br>
kernel does not support IPX then this option will have no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ipx-protocol <br>
Disable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This should only be
used if you know that you are using a client which only
understands IP and you don&rsquo;t want to confuse the
client <br>
with the IPXCP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-accept-local <br>
With this option, ipppd will accept the peer&rsquo;s idea of
our local IP address, even if the local IP address was
specified in an option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-accept-remote <br>
With this option, ipppd will accept the peer&rsquo;s idea of
its (remote) IP address, even if the remote IP address was
specified in an option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-max-configure &lt;n&gt;
<br>
Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-request
transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-max-failure &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-NAKs returned
before starting to send configure-Rejects instead to
&lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-max-terminate &lt;n&gt;
<br>
Set the maximum number of IPCP terminate-request
transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-restart &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the IPCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to
&lt;n&gt; seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipparam string <br>
Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up and ip-down
scripts. If this option is given, the string supplied is
given as the 6th parameter to those scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-network &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP configure request
frame to &lt;n&gt;. There is no valid default. If this
option is not specified then the network number is obtained
from <br>
the peer. If the peer does not have the network number, the
IPX protocol will not be started. This is a hexadecimal
number and is entered without any leading sequence such <br>
as 0x. It is related to the ipxcp-accept-network option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-node &lt;n&gt;:&lt;m&gt;
<br>
Set the IPX node numbers. The two node numbers are separated
from each other with a colon character. The first number
&lt;n&gt; is the local node number. The second number
&lt;m&gt; <br>
is the peer&rsquo;s node number. Each node number is a
hexadecimal number, to the maximum of ten significant
digits. The node numbers on the ipx-network must be unique.
There is <br>
no valid default. If this option is not specified then the
node number is obtained from the peer. This option is a
related to the ipxcp-accept-local and ipxcp-accept- <br>
remote options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-router-name &lt;string&gt;
<br>
Set the name of the router. This is a string and is sent to
the peer as information data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipx-routing &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the routing protocol to be received by this option. Use
a comma-separated list if you want to specify more than one
protocol. The &rsquo;none&rsquo; option (0) may be specified
<br>
as the only instance of ipx-routing. The values may be 0 for
NONE, 2 for RIP/SAP, and 4 for NLSP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-accept-local <br>
Accept the peer&rsquo;s NAK for the node number specified in
the ipx-node option. If a node number was specified, and
non-zero, the default is to insist that the value be used.
<br>
If you include this option then you will permit the peer to
override the entry of the node number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-accept-network <br>
Accept the peer&rsquo;s NAK for the network number specified
in the ipx-network option. If a network number was
specified, and non-zero, the default is to insist that the
value <br>
be used. If you include this option then you will permit the
peer to override the entry of the node number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-accept-remote <br>
Use the peer&rsquo;s network number specified in the
configure request frame. If a node number was specified for
the peer and this option was not specified, the peer will be
<br>
forced to use the value which you have specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-max-configure &lt;n&gt;
<br>
Set the maximum number of IPXCP configure request frames
which the system will send to &lt;n&gt;. The default is
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-max-failure &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK frames which the local
system will send before it rejects the options. The default
value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipxcp-max-terminate &lt;n&gt;
<br>
Set the maximum number of IPXCP terminate request frames
before the local system considers that the peer is not
listening to them. The default value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdebug n <br>
Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver. The
argument n is a number which is the sum of the following
values: 1 to enable general debug messages, 2 to <br>
request that the contents of received packets be printed,
and 4 to request that the contents of transmitted packets be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-echo-failure &lt;n&gt; <br>
If this option is given, ipppd will presume the peer to be
dead if n LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a
valid LCP echo-reply. If this happens, ipppd will ter&acirc;
<br>
minate the connection. Use of this option requires a
non-zero value for the lcp-echo-interval parameter. This
option can be used to enable ipppd to terminate after the
<br>
physical connection has been broken (e.g., the line hung up)
in situations where no hardware modem control lines are
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-echo-interval &lt;n&gt; <br>
If this option is given, ipppd will send an LCP echo-request
frame to the peer every n seconds. With Linux, the
echo-request is sent when no packets have been received <br>
from the peer for n seconds. Normally the peer should
respond to the echo-request by sending an echo-reply. This
option can be used with the lcp-echo-failure option to <br>
detect that the peer is no longer connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-max-configure &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the maximum number of LCP configure-request
transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-max-failure &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the maximum number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before
starting to send configure-Rejects instead to &lt;n&gt;
(default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-max-terminate &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the maximum number of LCP terminate-request
transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcp-restart &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to
&lt;n&gt; seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock Specifies that ipppd should
create a UUCP-style lock file for the serial device to
ensure exclusive access to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login Use the system password
database for authenticating the peer using PAP, and record
the user in the system wtmp file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mn Disable magic number
negotiation. With this option, ipppd cannot detect a
looped-back line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+mp enables MPPP negotiation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mru &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to &lt;n&gt; for
negotiation. ipppd will ask the peer to send packets of no
more than &lt;n&gt; bytes. The minimum MRU value is 128. The
<br>
default MRU value is 1500. A value of 296 is recommended for
slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256 bytes of
data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mru Disable MRU [Maximum
Receive Unit] negotiation. With this option, ipppd will use
the default MRU value of 1500 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ms-dns &lt;n&gt; <br>
This option sets the IP address or addresses for the Domain
Name Server. It is used by Microsoft Windows clients. The
primary DNS address is specified by the first <br>
instance of the ms-dns option. The secondary is specified by
the second instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ms-get-dns <br>
Implements the client side of RFC1877. If ipppd is acting as
a client to a server that implements RFC1877 such as one
intended to be used with Microsoft Windows clients, <br>
this option allows ipppd to obtain one or two DNS (Domain
Name Server) addresses from the server. It does not do
anything with these addresses except put them in the <br>
environment (MS_DNS1 MS_DNS2) that is passed to scripts. For
compatibility with the async pppd, DNS1 DNS2 environment
variables are also set. A sample resolv.conf is cre&acirc;
<br>
ated in /etc/ppp/resolv.conf. The /etc/ppp/ip-up script
should use this information to perform whatever adjustment
is necessary. Note: RFC1877 is a horrible protocol <br>
layering violation, the correct approach would be to use
DHCP after the IPCP phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ms-get-wins <br>
As ms-get-dns but for WINS (Windows Internet Name Services)
server addresses. Environment variables are MS_WINS1 and
MS_WINS2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtu &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to &lt;n&gt;.
Unless the peer requests a smaller value via MRU
negotiation, ipppd will request that the kernel networking
code send <br>
data packets of no more than n bytes through the PPP network
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes
to &lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netmask &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the interface netmask to &lt;n&gt;, a 32 bit netmask in
&quot;decimal dot&quot; notation (e.g. 255.255.255.0). If
this option is given, the value specified is ORed with the
default <br>
netmask. The default netmask is chosen based on the
negotiated remote IP address; it is the appropriate network
mask for the class of the remote IP address, ORed with the
<br>
netmasks for any non point-to-point network interfaces in
the system which are on the same network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noipdefault <br>
Disables the default behaviour when no local IP address is
specified, which is to determine (if possible) the local IP
address from the hostname. With this option, the <br>
peer will have to supply the local IP address during IPCP
negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on the command
line or in an options file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passive <br>
Enables the &quot;passive&quot; option in the LCP. With this
option, ipppd will attempt to initiate a connection; if no
reply is received from the peer, ipppd will then just wait
<br>
passively for a valid LCP packet from the peer (instead of
exiting, as it does without this option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Same as the passive
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+pap Require the peer to
authenticate itself using PAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pap Don&rsquo;t agree to
authenticate using PAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">papcrypt <br>
Indicates that all secrets in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file
which are used for checking the identity of the peer are
encrypted, and thus ipppd should not accept a password <br>
which (before encryption) is identical to the secret from
the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pap-max-authreq &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the maximum number of PAP authenticate-request
transmissions to &lt;n&gt; (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pap-restart &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the PAP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to
&lt;n&gt; seconds (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pap-timeout &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the maximum time that ipppd will wait for the peer to
authenticate itself with PAP to &lt;n&gt; seconds (0 means
no limit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pass-filter filter-expression
<br>
Specifies a packet filter to applied to data packets being
sent or received to determine which packets should be
allowed to pass. Packets which are rejected by the filter
<br>
are silently discarded. This option can be used to prevent
specific network daemons (such as routed) using up link
bandwidth, or to provide a basic firewall capability. <br>
The filter-expression syntax is as described for tcpdump(1),
except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP
link, such as ether and arp, are not permitted. Gen&acirc;
<br>
erally the filter expression should be enclosed in
single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from
being interpreted by the shell. Note that it is possible to
<br>
apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets
using the inbound and outbound qualifiers. This option is
currently only available if both the kernel and <br>
ipppd were compiled with IPPP_FILTER defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pc Disable protocol field
compression negotiation (use default, i.e. protocol field
compression disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pidfile &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Use &lt;filename&gt; instead of /var/run/ipppd.pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pred1comp <br>
Attempt to request that the peer send the local system
frames which have been compressed by the Predictor-1
compression. The compression protocols must be loaded or
this <br>
option will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pred1comp <br>

Sets the number of connection slots to be used by the Van

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FILES <br>
Options can be taken from files as well as the command line.
ipppd reads options from the file /etc/ppp/ioptions before
looking at the command line. An options file is parsed <br>
into a series of words, delimited by whitespace. Whitespace
can be included in a word by enclosing the word in quotes
(&quot;). A backslash ( quotes the following character. A
<br>
hash (#) starts a comment, which continues until the end of
the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
ipppd provides system administrators with sufficient access
control that PPP access to a server machine can be provided
to legitimate users without fear of compromising the
secu&acirc; <br>
rity of the server or the network it&rsquo;s on. In part
this is provided by the /etc/ppp/ioptions file, where the
administrator can place options to require authentication
whenever <br>
ipppd is run, and in part by the PAP and CHAP secrets files,
where the administrator can restrict the set of IP addresses
which individual users may use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour of ipppd
is to agree to authenticate if requested, and to not require
authentication from the peer. However, ipppd will not agree
to authenticate itself <br>
with a particular protocol if it has no secrets which could
be used to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authentication is based on
secrets, which are selected from secrets files
(/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for
CHAP). Both secrets files have the same for&acirc; <br>
mat, and both can store secrets for several combinations of
server (authenticating peer) and client (peer being
authenticated). Note that ipppd can be both a server and
client, <br>
and that different protocols can be used in the two
directions if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A secrets file is parsed into
words as for a options file. A secret is specified by a line
containing at least 3 words, in the order client name,
server name, secret. Any fol&acirc; <br>
lowing words on the same line are taken to be a list of
acceptable IP addresses for that client. If there are only 3
words on the line, it is assumed that any IP address is OK;
<br>
to disallow all IP addresses, use &quot;-&quot;. If the
secret starts with an &lsquo;@&rsquo;, what follows is
assumed to be the name of a file from which to read the
secret. A &quot;*&quot; as the client or <br>
server name matches any name. When selecting a secret, ipppd
takes the best match, i.e. the match with the fewest
wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus a secrets file contains
both secrets for use in authenticating other hosts, plus
secrets which we use for authenticating ourselves to others.
Which secret to use is chosen <br>
based on the names of the host (the &lsquo;local
name&rsquo;) and its peer (the &lsquo;remote name&rsquo;).
The local name is set as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the usehostname option is
given, <br>
then the local name is the hostname of this machine (with
the domain appended, if given)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">else if the name option is
given, <br>
then use the argument of the first name option seen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">else if the local IP address is
specified with a hostname, <br>
then use that name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">else use the hostname of this
machine (with the domain appended, if given)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When authenticating ourselves
using PAP, there is also a &lsquo;username&rsquo; which is
the local name by default, but can be set with the user
option or the +ua option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remote name is set as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the remotename option is
given, <br>
then use the argument of the last remotename option seen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">else if the remote IP address is
specified with a hostname, <br>
then use that host name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">else the remote name is the null
string &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secrets are selected from the
PAP secrets file as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For authenticating the peer,
look for a secret with client == username specified in the
PAP authenticate-request, and server == local name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For authenticating ourselves
to the peer, look for a secret with client == our username,
server == remote name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When authenticating the peer
with PAP, a secret of &quot;&quot; matches any password
supplied by the peer. If the password doesn&rsquo;t match
the secret, the password is encrypted using <br>
crypt() and checked against the secret again; thus secrets
for authenticating the peer can be stored in encrypted form.
If the papcrypt option is given, the first (unencrypted)
<br>
comparison is omitted, for better security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the login option was
specified, the username and password are also checked
against the system password database. Thus, the system
administrator can set up the pap-secrets <br>
file to allow PPP access only to certain users, and to
restrict the set of IP addresses that each user can use.
Typically, when using the login option, the secret in <br>
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be &quot;&quot;, to avoid the
need to have the same secret in two places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secrets are selected from the
CHAP secrets file as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For authenticating the peer,
look for a secret with client == name specified in the
CHAP-Response message, and server == local name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For authenticating ourselves
to the peer, look for a secret with client == local name,
and server == name specified in the CHAP-Challenge
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authentication must be
satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or any other Network
Control Protocol) can be started. If authentication fails,
ipppd will terminated the link (by <br>
closing LCP). If IPCP negotiates an unacceptable IP address
for the remote host, IPCP will be closed. IP packets can
only be sent or received when IPCP is open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases it is desirable to
allow some hosts which can&rsquo;t authenticate themselves
to connect and use one of a restricted set of IP addresses,
even when the local host gener&acirc; <br>
ally requires authentication. If the peer refuses to
authenticate itself when requested, ipppd takes that as
equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string
for the <br>
username and password. Thus, by adding a line to the
pap-secrets file which specifies the empty string for the
client and password, it is possible to allow restricted
access to <br>
hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROUTING <br>
When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, ipppd will
inform the kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for
the ppp interface. This is sufficient to create a host <br>
route to the remote end of the link, which will enable the
peers to exchange IP packets. Communication with other
machines generally requires further modification to routing
<br>
tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables. In
some cases this will be done automatically through the
actions of the routed or gated daemons, but in most cases
some <br>
further intervention is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is desirable to add
a default route through the remote host, as in the case of a
machine whose only connection to the Internet is through the
ppp interface. The <br>
defaultroute option causes ipppd to create such a default
route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the link is
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases it is desirable to
use proxy ARP, for example on a server machine connected to
a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to communicate with the
remote host. The prox&acirc; <br>
yarp option causes ipppd to look for a network interface on
the same subnet as the remote host (an interface supporting
broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a point-to-point or
<br>
loopback interface). If found, ipppd creates a permanent,
published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host
and the hardware address of the network interface found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility
LOG_DAEMON. (This can be overriden by recompiling ipppd with
the macro LOG_PPP defined as the desired facility.) In order
<br>
to see the error and debug messages, you will need to edit
your /etc/syslog.conf file to direct the messages to the
desired output device or file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debug option causes the
contents of all control packets sent or received to be
logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP or IPCP packets. This
can be useful if the PPP negotiation <br>
does not succeed. If debugging is enabled at compile time,
the debug option also causes other debugging messages to be
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging can also be enabled or
disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 to the ipppd process. This
signal acts as a toggle.</p>
