<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nnrpd - NNTP server for reader clients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nnrpd [-DfnoSt] [-4 address] [-6 address] [-b address] [-c
configfile] [-i initial] [-I instance] [-p port] [-P
prefork] [-r reason] [-s padding]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nnrpd is an NNTP server for newsreaders. It accepts commands
on its standard input and responds on its standard output.
It is normally invoked by innd(8) with those descriptors
<br>
attached to a remote client connection. nnrpd also supports
running as a standalone daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike innd(8), nnrpd supports
all NNTP commands for user-oriented reading and posting.
nnrpd uses the readers.conf file to control who is
authorized to access the Usenet <br>
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, nnrpd will report usage
statistics through syslog(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nnrpd only reads config files
(both readers.conf and inn.conf) when it is spawned. You can
therefore never change the behavior of a client that&rsquo;s
already connected. If nnrpd is <br>
run from innd (the default) or from inetd(8), xinetd(8), or
some equivalent, a new nnrpd process is spawned for every
connection and therefore any changes to configuration files
<br>
will be immediately effective for all new connections. If
you are instead running nnrpd with the -D option, any
configuration changes won&rsquo;t take effect until nnrpd is
restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inn.conf setting nnrpdflags
can be used to pass any of the options below to instances of
nnrpd that are spawned directly from innd. Many options only
make sense when -D is <br>
used, so these options should not be used with nnrpdflags.
See also the discussion of nnrpdflags in inn.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When nnrpdloadlimit in inn.conf
is not 0, it will also reject connections if the load
average is greater than that value (typically 16). nnrpd can
also prevent high-volume <br>
posters from abusing your resources. See the discussion of
exponential backoff in inn.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-4 address <br>
The -4 parameter instructs nnrpd to bind to the specified
IPv4 address when started as a standalone daemon using the
-D flag. This has to be a valid IPv4 address belonging <br>
to an interface of the local host. It can also be 0.0.0.0,
saying to bind to all addresses (this is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 address <br>
The -6 parameter instructs nnrpd to bind to the specified
IPv6 address when started as a standalone daemon using the
-D flag. This has to be a valid IPv6 address belonging <br>
to an interface of the local host. It can also be
&quot;::0&quot;, saying to bind to all IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, nnrpd in daemon mode
listens to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. With this option,
it will listen only to the specified IPv6 addresses. On some
systems however, a <br>
value of &quot;::0&quot; will cause it to listen to all IPv4
addresses as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b address <br>
Similar to the -4 flag. -b is kept for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c configfile <br>
By default, nnrpd reads the readers.conf to determine how to
authenticate connections. The -c flag specifies an alternate
file for this purpose. If the file name isn&rsquo;t <br>
fully qualified, it is taken to be relative to pathetc in
inn.conf. (This is useful to have several instances of nnrpd
running on different ports or IP addresses with <br>
different settings.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D If specified, this parameter
causes nnrpd to operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches
itself and runs in the background, forking a process for
every connection. By <br>
default, nnrpd listens on the NNTP port (119), so either
innd(8) has to be started on another port or the -p
parameter used. Note that with this parameter, nnrpd
continues <br>
running until killed. This means that it reads inn.conf once
on startup and never again until restarted. nnrpd should
therefore be restarted if inn.conf is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When started in daemon mode,
nnrpd will write its PID into a file in the pathrun
directory. The file will be named nnrpd.pid if nnrpd listens
on port 119 (default), or <br>
nnrpd-%d.pid, where %d is replaced with the port that nnrpd
is configured to listen on (-p option is given and its
argument is not 119).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f If specified, nnrpd does not
detach itself and runs in the foreground when started as a
standalone daemon using the -D flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i initial <br>
Specify an initial command to nnrpd. When used, initial is
taken as if it were the first command received by nnrpd.
After having responded, nnrpd will close the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I instance <br>
If specified, instance is used as an additional static
portion within message-IDs generated by nnrpd; typically
this option would be used where a cluster of machines exist
<br>
with the same virtual hostname and must be disambiguated
during posts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The -n flag turns off
resolution of IP addresses to names. If you only use
IP-based restrictions in readers.conf and can handle IP
addresses in your logs, using this flag <br>
may result in some additional speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o The -o flag causes all
articles to be spooled instead of sending them to innd(8).
rnews with the -U flag should be invoked from cron on a
regular basis to take care of these <br>
articles. This flag is useful if innd(8) is accepting
articles and nnrpd is started standalone or using
inetd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
The -p parameter instructs nnrpd to listen on port when
started as a standalone daemon using the -D flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P prefork <br>
The -P parameter instructs nnrpd to prefork prefork children
awaiting connections when started as a standalone daemon
using the -D flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r reason <br>
If the -r flag is used, then nnrpd will reject the incoming
connection giving reason as the text. This flag is used by
innd(8) when it is paused or throttled. reason should <br>
be encoded in UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s padding <br>
As each command is received, nnrpd tries to change its
&quot;argv&quot; array so that ps(1) will print out the
command being executed. To get a full display, the -s flag
may be used <br>
with a long string as its argument, which will be
overwritten when the program changes its title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S If specified, nnrpd will
start a negotiation for a TLS session as soon as connected.
To use this flag, the OpenSSL SSL and crypto libraries must
have been found at configure <br>
time, or --with-openssl specified at configure time. For
more information on running nnrpd with TLS support, see
&quot;TLS SUPPORT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t If the -t flag is used, then
all client commands and initial responses will be traced by
reporting them in syslog. This flag is set by innd(8) under
the control of the <br>
ctlinnd(8) &quot;trace&quot; command, and is toggled upon
receipt of a SIGHUP; see signal(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TLS SUPPORT <br>
If INN is built with --with-openssl or if the OpenSSL SSL
and crypto libraries are found at configure time, nnrpd will
support news reading over TLS (also known as SSL). For <br>
clients that use the STARTTLS command, no special
configuration is needed beyond creating a TLS/SSL
certificate for the server. You should do this in exactly
the same way that <br>
you would generate a certificate for a web server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re happy with a
self-signed certificate (which will generate warnings with
some news reader clients), you can create and install one in
the default path by running &quot;make <br>
cert&quot; after &quot;make install&quot; when installing
INN, or by running the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask 077 <br>
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out &lt;pathetc&gt;/cert.pem
-days 366 -keyout &lt;pathetc&gt;/key.pem <br>
chown news:news &lt;pathetc&gt;/cert.pem <br>
chmod 640 &lt;pathetc&gt;/cert.pem <br>
chown news:news &lt;pathetc&gt;/key.pem <br>
chmod 600 &lt;pathetc&gt;/key.pem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace the paths with something
appropriate to your INN installation. This will create a
self-signed certificate that will expire in a year. The
openssl program will ask you a <br>
variety of questions about your organization. Enter the
fully qualified domain name of the server as the name the
certificate is for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You then have to set these
inn.conf parameters with the right paths:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tlscapath: &lt;pathetc&gt; <br>
tlscertfile: &lt;pathetc&gt;/cert.pem <br>
tlskeyfile: &lt;pathetc&gt;/key.pem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case you have a certificate
authority root certificate, you can also set tlscafile to
its path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two common ways for a
news client to negotiate a TLS connection: either via the
use of the STARTTLS command on the usual NNTP port (119) or
via the now discouraged way <br>
(per RFC 4642) to immediately negotiate an encrypted session
upon connection on a dedicated port (usually 563). As most
news clients currently do not use the STARTTLS command, <br>
and instead expect to connect to a separate port (563) and
start a TLS negotiation immediately, it is still useful to
provide a legacy way for these news clients to encrypt the
<br>
NNTP session. innd does not, however, know how to listen for
connections to that separate port. You will therefore need
to arrange for nnrpd to listen on that port through some
<br>
other means. This can be done with the -D flag along with
&quot;-p 563&quot; and put into your init scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su news -s /bin/sh -c
&rsquo;&lt;pathbin&gt;/nnrpd -D -p 563 -S&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but the easiest way is probably
to add a line like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nntps stream tcp nowait news
&lt;pathbin&gt;/nnrpd nnrpd -S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to /etc/inetd.conf or the
equivalent on your system and let inetd run nnrpd. (Change
the path to nnrpd to match your installation.) You may need
to replace &quot;nntps&quot; with 563 if <br>
&quot;nntps&quot; isn&rsquo;t defined in /etc/services on
your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, you may set the
tlsciphers, tlscompression, tlseccurve,
tlspreferserverciphers, and tlsprotocols parameters in
inn.conf to fine-tune the behaviour of the TLS/SSL <br>
negotiation whenever a new attack on the TLS protocol or
some supported cipher suite is discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL DIFFERENCES <br>
nnrpd implements the NNTP commands defined in RFC 3977
(NNTP), RFC 4642 (TLS/NNTP), RFC 4643 (NNTP authentication)
and RFC 6048 (NNTP LIST additions) with the following <br>
differences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The XGTITLE [wildmat] command
is provided. This extension is used by ANU-News and
documented in RFC 2980. It returns a 282 reply code,
followed by a one-line description of <br>
all newsgroups that match the pattern. The default is the
current group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that LIST NEWSGROUPS should
be used instead of XGTITLE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The XHDR header
[message-ID|range] command is implemented. It returns a 221
reply code, followed by specific headers for the specified
range; the default is to return the <br>
data for the current article. See RFC 2980.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that HDR should be used
instead of XHDR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The XOVER [range] command is
provided. It returns a 224 reply code, followed by the
overview data for the specified range; the default is to
return the data for the current <br>
article. See RFC 2980.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that OVER should be used
instead of XOVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. A new command, XPAT header
message-ID|range pattern [pattern ...], is provided. The
first argument is the case-insensitive name of the header to
be searched. The second <br>
argument is either an article range or a single message-ID,
as specified in RFC 2980. The third argument is a
uwildmat(3)-style pattern; if there are additional
arguments, <br>
they are joined together separated by a single space to form
the complete pattern. This command is similar to the XHDR
command. It returns a 221 response code, followed by <br>
the text response of all article numbers that match the
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. A newsgroup name is
case-sensitive for nnrpd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. If IHAVE has been advertised,
it will not necessarily be advertised for the entire session
(contrary to section 3.4.1 of RFC 3977). nnrpd only
advertises the IHAVE <br>
capability when it is really available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. nnrpd allows a wider syntax
for wildmats and ranges (especially &quot;-&quot; and
&quot;-article-number&quot;).</p>
