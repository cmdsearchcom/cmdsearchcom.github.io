<p>SAM_OVERVIEW(8) Corosync Cluster Engine
Programmer&rsquo;s Manual SAM_OVERVIEW(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sam_overview - Overview of the Simple Availability
Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
The SAM library provide a tool to check the health of an
application. The main purpose of SAM is to restart a local
process when it fails to respond to a healthcheck request in
<br>
a configured time interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During sam_initialize(3), a
duplicate copy of the process is created using the fork(3)
system call. This duplicate process copy contains the logic
for executing the SAM server. <br>
The SAM server is responsible for requesting healthchecks
from the active process, and controlling the lifecycle of
the active process when it fails. If the active process
fails <br>
to respond to the healthcheck request sent by the SAM
server, it will be sent a user configurable signal (default
SIGTERM) to request shutdown of the application. After a
con&acirc; <br>
figured time interval, the process will be forcibly killed
by being sent a SIGKILL signal. Once the active process
terminates, the SAM server will create a new active
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Simple Availability Manager
is meant to be used in conjunction with the cpg service.
Used together, it is possible to restart a cpg process that
fails healthchecking during <br>
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main features of SAM
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A configurable
recovery policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A configurable
time interval for health check operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A notification
via signal before recovery action is taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A mechanism to
indicate to the application the number of times an active
process has been created by the SAM server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Both application
driven health checking and event driven health checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initializing SAM <br>
The SAM library is initialized by sam_initialize(3).
sam_initalize(3) may only be called once per process.
Calling it more then once has undefined results and is not
recom&acirc; <br>
mended or tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting warning callback <br>
User configurable signal (default SIGTERM) is sent to the
application when a recovery action is planned. The
application can use the signal(3) system call to monitor for
this <br>
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no special constraints
on what SAM apis may be called in a warning callback. After
time_interval expires, a SIGKILL signal is sent to the
active process to force its <br>
termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Registering the active process
<br>
The active process is registered with SAM by calling
sam_register(3). This function should only be called one
time in a process. After a recovery action is taken, the new
<br>
active process will begin execution at the next line of code
in a user process after sam_register(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling event driven
healthchecking <br>
Two types of healthchecking are available to the user. The
first model is one where the user application healthchecks
during its normal operation. It is never requested to <br>
healtcheck, and if the active process doesn&rsquo;t respond
within the time interval, the process will be restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more useful mechanism for
healthchecking is event driven healthchecking. Because this
model is directed by the SAM server, It isn&rsquo;t
necessary to guess or add timers to the <br>
active process to signal a healthcheck operation is
successful. To use event driven healthchecking, the
sam_hc_callback_register(3) function should be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quorum integration <br>
SAM has special policies (SAM_RECOVERY_POLICY_QUIT and
SAM_RECOVERY_POLICY_RESTART) for integration with quorum
service. This policies changes SAM behaviour in two
aspects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Call of
sam_start(3) blocks until corosync becomes quorate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; User selected
recovery action is taken immediately after lost of
quorum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Storing user data <br>
Sometimes there is need to store some data, which survives
between instances. One can in such case use files,
databases, ... or much simpler in memory solution presented
by <br>
sam_data_store(3), sam_data_restore(3) and
sam_data_getsize(3) functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Confdb integration <br>
SAM has policy flag used for confdb system integration
(SAM_RECOVERY_POLICY_CONFDB). If process is registered with
this flag, new confdb object PROCESS_NAME:PID is created
with <br>
following keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; recovery - will
be quit or restart depending on policy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; poll_period -
period of health checking in milliseconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; last_updated -
Timestamp (in nanoseconds) of the last health check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; state - state of
process (can be one of registered, started, failed, waiting
for quorum)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object is automatically deleted
if process exits with stopped health checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Confdb integration with corosync
wathdog can be used in implicit and explicit way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implicit way is achieved by
setting recovery policy to QUIT and let process exit with
started health checking. If this happened, object is not
deleted and corosync watchdog will <br>
take required action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicit way is useful for
situations, when developer can deal with some non-fatal fall
of application. This mode is achieved by setting policy to
RESTART and using SAM same as <br>
without Confdb integration. If real fail is needed (like too
many restarts at all, per/sec, ...), it&rsquo;s possible to
use sam_mark_failed(3) and let corosync watchdog take
required <br>
action.</p>
