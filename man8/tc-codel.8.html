<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
CoDel - Controlled-Delay Active Queue Management
algorithm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tc qdisc ... codel [ limit PACKETS ] [ target TIME ] [
interval TIME ] [ ecn | noecn ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
CoDel (pronounced &quot;coddle&quot;) is an adaptive
&quot;no-knobs&quot; active queue management algorithm (AQM)
scheme that was developed to address the shortcomings of RED
and its variants. It <br>
was developed with the following goals in mind: <br>
o It should be parameterless. <br>
o It should keep delays low while permitting bursts of
traffic. <br>
o It should control delay. <br>
o It should adapt dynamically to changing link rates with no
impact on utilization. <br>
o It should be simple and efficient and should scale from
simple to complex routers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHM <br>
CoDel comes with three major innovations. Instead of using
queue size or queue average, it uses the local minimum queue
as a measure of the standing/persistent queue. Second, it
<br>
uses a single state-tracking variable of the minimum delay
to see where it is relative to the standing queue delay.
Third, instead of measuring queue size in bytes or packets,
it <br>
is measured in packet-sojourn time in the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CoDel measures the minimum local
queue delay (i.e. standing queue delay) and compares it to
the value of the given acceptable queue delay target. As
long as the minimum queue <br>
delay is less than target or the buffer contains fewer than
MTU worth of bytes, packets are not dropped. Codel enters a
dropping mode when the minimum queue delay has exceeded <br>
target for a time greater than interval. In this mode,
packets are dropped at different drop times which is set by
a control law. The control law ensures that the packet drops
<br>
cause a linear change in the throughput. Once the minimum
delay goes below target, packets are no longer dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional details can be found
in the paper cited below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
limit <br>
hard limit on the real queue size. When this limit is
reached, incoming packets are dropped. If the value is
lowered, packets are dropped so that the new limit is met.
Default is <br>
1000 packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target <br>
is the acceptable minimum standing/persistent queue delay.
This minimum delay is identified by tracking the local
minimum queue delay that packets experience. Default and
recom&acirc; <br>
mended value is 5ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interval <br>
is used to ensure that the measured minimum delay does not
become too stale. The minimum delay must be experienced in
the last epoch of length interval. It should be set on the
<br>
order of the worst-case RTT through the bottleneck to give
endpoints sufficient time to react. Default value is
100ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ecn | noecn <br>
can be used to mark packets instead of dropping them. If ecn
has been enabled, noecn can be used to turn it off and
vice-a-versa. By default, ecn is turned off.</p>
