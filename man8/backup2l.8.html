<p>BACKUP2L(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
BACKUP2L(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
backup2l - low-maintenance backup/restore tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
backup2l [ -c conffile ] [ -t backup-ID ] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
backup2l is a tool for generating, maintaining and restoring
backups on a mountable file system (e. g. hard disk). The
main design goals are low maintenance effort, efficiency,
<br>
transparency and robustness. It features differential
backups at multiple hierarchical levels and provides
rollback functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All control files are stored
together with the archives on the backup device, and their
contents are mostly self-explaining. Hence, in the case of
an emergency, a user does not <br>
only have to rely on the restore functionality of backup2l,
but can - if necessary - browse the files and extract
archives manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An open driver architecture
allows one to use virtually any archiving program as a
backend. Built-in drivers support .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or
.afioz files. Further drivers can be <br>
added by the user. When restoring data, an appropriate
driver is selected automatically for each archive depending
on the suffix of the archive file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method of hierarchical
differential backups is a generalization to the concept of
the &quot;daily&quot;, &quot;weekly&quot; and
&quot;monthly&quot; backups. Each backup has a level and a
serial number. <br>
Maximum-level backups are comparable with daily differential
backups, level-0 backups are full backups. For example, let
MAX_LEVEL be 4 and MAX_PER_LEVEL be 5. After 5 level-4 <br>
backups (e. g. after 5 days), a new level-3 backup is made.
After 5 level-3 backups (and 5*5 at level-4), a new level-2
backup is made, and so on. Each differential backup
con&acirc; <br>
tains the changes towards the previous backup of the same or
a lower level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This scheme allows one to
efficiently generate small incremental backups at short
intervals. At the same time, the total number of archives
that have to be stored (or processed <br>
in the case of a restore) only increases logarithmically
with the number of backups since the last full backup.
Time-consuming full backups are only sparsely needed. In the
<br>
example above, a new full backup is only necessary after 780
(=5^4+5^3+5*5+5) days, while only at most 20 (=4*5) archives
have to be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backup2l, each backup
archive is identified by its backup ID (BID). The number of
digits determines the level. Level-0 (full) backups have a
1-digit BID, level-n backups have <br>
a BID of n+1 digits. The last digit is a serial number, the
prefix identifies the lower-level backups on which a given
backup is based on. For example, the archive 235 contains
<br>
the differences towards archive 234, and to restore the file
system state of the time it was generated, the full backup
2, the level-1 backups 21, 22, 23 and the level-2 backups
<br>
231, ..., 235 have to be processed. All serial numbers are
between 1 and 9, a zero in the BID indicates that no archive
of the respective level is contained in the chain. For <br>
example, the level-3 backup 1201 is immediately based on the
level-1 backup 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For deciding whether a file is
new or modified, backup2l looks at its name, modification
time, size, ownership and permissions. Unlike other backup
tools, the i-node is not con&acirc; <br>
sidered in order to avoid problems with non-Unix file
systems like FAT32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --conf conffile <br>
This argument specifies the configuration file (default:
etc/backup2l.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --time BID <br>
If present, this option selects a certain backup for the
--locate and --restore commands. E. g., the latter will
restore files and directories exactly as they were on the
<br>
system at the time when the specified backup was made. If
not present, the latest available backup is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Display the usage info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --estimate [ level ] <br>
Prints the number of files, estimated amount of data and
other information on the backup that would be generated
next. No backup archives are actually created or removed.
<br>
If specified, the parameter level overrides the MAX_LEVEL
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --backup [ level ] <br>
Creates a new backup and removes old archives based on the
given configuration file. If specified, the parameter level
overrides the MAX_LEVEL setting. This is useful e. <br>
g. shortly before or after major changes are performed with
the file system. In this case, a lower level should be
specified in order to avoid that a large number of files
<br>
are backed up multiple times again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --get-summary <br>
Shows a table describing each backup (date, size, files,
...) and the file system usage of the backup device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --get-available [ pattern
list ] <br>
Shows all files removed and added for all backups. A
&rsquo;+&rsquo; in the output indicates that the file is new
and thus contained in the archive file. A &rsquo;-&rsquo;
indicates that the file <br>
has been removed (or replaced). If one or several patterns
are supplied, grep(1) is used to filter the list. All status
messages go to stderr, so that the generated file <br>
list can easily be redirected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The search pattern is not
just applied to the file names, but to the whole entry in
the .list.gz file. This allows one to not only search for
file names but also for <br>
other attributes like ownership, modification time etc. . In
order to apply a search pattern to file names only, precede
it by &quot;&lt;space&gt;/.*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --locate [ pattern list ]
<br>
Shows most recent backup location for active files. If one
or several patterns are supplied, grep(1) is used to filter
the list in the same way as for --get-available (see <br>
above) . All status messages go to stderr, so that the
generated file list can easily be redirected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Active files are files that have
been on the system at the time of the selected backup, which
is either the latest backup or the one specified by --time
(see above). Files <br>
that were removed at that time but are still stored in some
later archive will not be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Altogether, this command tells
you, which files have to be extracted from which archive in
order to restore the state of the system at the time of the
selected backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --restore [ pattern list ]
<br>
Performs the same steps like --locate and then restores the
respective files. All files are restored relative to the
current directory. They can be restored to their orig&acirc;
<br>
inal location by cd&rsquo;ing into / before, but this is not
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --purge BID list <br>
Removes the specified backup archive(s) and all depending
backups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --make-check [ BID list ]
<br>
Creates (a) check file(s) for the specified archive(s) using
md5sum(1). If no BID is specified, check files are created
wherever missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verify [ BID list ] <br>
Verifies the specified backup archive(s). If no BID is
specified, all existing archives are checked. If a check
file exists, this allows one a comprehensive test
includ&acirc; <br>
ing e. g. media failures. If the check file is missing, only
the existence of all files and the immediate base archive
are verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --extract capacity max-free
BID-list <br>
Split and collect files to be stored on removable media (e.
g. CDs). capacity is the medium capacity in MB. max-free is
the maximum amount of empty space on each medium <br>
(except for the last one, of course). BID-list specifies the
archives and may contain wildcards, e. g.: 1
&rsquo;2*&rsquo;. The operation generates enumbered
subdirectories repre&acirc; <br>
senting the media contents. Some more files are generated
that may be useful, e. g. to print labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While guaranteeing a minimum
waste of max-free MB per medium, the collection procedure
preserves the ordering of files and keeps all control files
of an archive always <br>
together on the same medium. Large archive files are split
into multiple files with serial numbers appended to their
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation is interactive.
Just run it and look what it is about to do. If that is not
what you want, you can stop it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
In the configuration file (/etc/backup2l.conf by default),
the following variables have to be set, following the
bash(1) syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOR_VERSION=version <br>
Defines the backup2l version for which the configuration
file is written. This way, future versions can automatically
print a warning if the syntax has changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SRCLIST=( source list ) <br>
This is a blank-separated list of all top-level directories
to make backups of. Directory names with spaces have to be
quoted, e. g.: SRCLIST=(&quot;/my dir&quot; /another/dir).
<br>
The last elements of the list may be options for find(1),
for example -xdev in order to skip subdirs on other file
systems like /dev or /proc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SKIPCOND=( find condition ) <br>
Files for which this condition is &rsquo;true&rsquo; are not
considered for backup. See find(1) for information on how to
formulate possible conditions. Special characters
(&quot;(&quot;, <br>
&quot;)&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, ...) must be quoted by a
leading backslash (&quot; &quot;&quot;, &quot; &quot;, ...).
An empty condition (i. e. if you do not want any files to be
skipped) must be specified as <br>
&quot;( -false )&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[
BACKUP_DEV=&quot;mount_point&quot; ] <br>
If defined, backup2l mounts the backup device before any
operation. Afterwards, it is unmounted unless it was already
mounted before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKUP_DIR=&quot;backup
dir&quot; <br>
Destination directory for backup files. This must be
different from MOUNT_POINT, i. e. a subdirectory on the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME=&quot;volname&quot; <br>
This is a common prefix for all backup and control files.
Multiple backup volumes are possible if for each volume a
separate configuration file is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAX_LEVEL=max_level <br>
Maximum backup level. Possible values are 1..9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAX_PER_LEVEL=max_per_level <br>
Number of differential backups per level. Possible values
are 1..9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAX_FULL=max_full <br>
Number of full backups kept. Possible values are 1..8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATIONS=generations <br>
Number of backup generations to keep for each non-zero
level. Old backups are automatically removed as long as at
least GENERATIONS * MAX_PER_LEVEL backups for the
respec&acirc; <br>
tive level remain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with MAX_LEVEL=3,
MAX_PER_LEVEL=5, GENERATIONS=2 it is always possible to
access the last 10 level-3 (e. g. daily) backups, the last
10 level-2 backups (e. g. <br>
5, 10, 15, ..., 50 days old), and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRE_BACKUP () { do something }
<br>
This function is called before writing the backup. It can be
used to dump some important system information, e. g. the
HD&rsquo;s partition table, to a file which is then backed
<br>
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POST_BACKUP () { do something }
<br>
This function is called after writing the backup. Together
with PRE_BACKUP it can be used to stop and restart e. g.
database or mail services which may frequently alter <br>
some files that have to be backed up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ AUTORUN=1 ] <br>
If set to 1, backup2l performs the --backup operation when
invoked without arguments. Otherwise, the usage information
is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ SIZE_UNITS= B | K | M | G ]
<br>
Sets the units for archive sizes in summary listings to
bytes, KB, MB, or GB. If unset, a user-readable format is
chosen automatically. If set, the units are the same for
<br>
the whole table, which may be even more user-friendly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ CREATE_DRIVER=&quot;archive
driver&quot; ] <br>
Selects an archive driver for creating backups. An archive
driver is responsible for managing backup files. If unset,
the default driver &quot;DRIVER_TAR_GZ&quot; is used. The
<br>
--help operation lists all available drivers. More drivers
can be defined in the configuration file (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[
USER_DRIVER_LIST=&quot;user-defined drivers&quot; ] <br>
Declares additional, user-defined archive drivers which are
implemented in the configuration file. The sample
configuration file contains a commented example. Read it in
<br>
order to learn how to implement your own driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/backup2l.conf <br>
Configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME.BID.tar.gz,
VOLNAME.BID.afioz, ... <br>
Archive files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME.BID.list.gz <br>
List of all active files when the backup was made. Each file
is preceded with its size, modification time, and other
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME.BID.new.gz <br>
List of all new ore modified files when the backup was made
(pathnames only). Unless an error occurred, this list
reflects the contents of the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME.BID.obsolete.gz <br>
List of all obsolete files when the backup was made
(pathnames only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME.BID.skipped.gz <br>
Complete list of all files that were skipped according to
SKIPMASK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME.BID.error.gz <br>
This file is generated by comparing the .new.gz file with
the actual archive contents using diff(1). If the error file
is non-empty, something may have gone wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLNAME.BID.check <br>
MD5 check sums of all files of the present archive and the
.list.gz file of the base archive. This file is optional and
may be used by the --verify operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION BY CRON <br>
backup2l is designed to be run autonomously as a cron job.
If the variable AUTORUN is set, it generates a backup if
invoked without any parameters, and you can simply create a
<br>
symlink, e. g. by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln -s &lsquo;which
backup2l&lsquo; /etc/cron.daily/zz-backup2l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;zz-&quot; prefix
causes the backup job to be the last one executed, so that
other jobs are not delayed if the backup takes somewhat
longer. The status output is e-mailed to root <br>
by the cron daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANIPULATING FILES AND
CONFIGURATIONS <br>
backup2l has been designed to be robust with respect to
errors and configuration changes. If the backup process is
interrupted, e. g. because of a shutdown while it is
running, <br>
no serious data corruption can occur. Some temporary files
may remain which are cleaned up during the next run. If file
is changed during the backup generation, it may not be <br>
contained in the current backup. However, it is guaranteed
that it is considered modified during the next backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to save disk space, e.
g. after some archives have been copied to external media,
archive files (.tar.gz or .afioz, for example) can safely be
removed from the backup <br>
directory. As long as all control files are kept, backup2l
retains full functionality as far as possible. The --restore
command prompts for eventually missing archive files for
<br>
the respective request (and only those). The --extract
command completely ignores all backups with missing archive
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration, especially
the settings for MAX_LEVEL, MAX_PER_LEVEL, MAX_FULL and the
specification of source files, can be arbitrarily changed
without having to expect data <br>
corruption. backup2l will gracefully adapt the new settings
during the next run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
After a restore operation, the modification time of
directories is equal to the restoration time while for files
it is equal to the original modification time.</p>
