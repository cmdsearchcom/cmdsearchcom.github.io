<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>backup2l</b> is a tool for generating, maintaining and restoring backups on a
  mountable file system (e. g. hard disk). The main design goals are low
  maintenance effort, efficiency, transparency and robustness. It features
  differential backups at multiple hierarchical levels and provides rollback
  functionality.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All control files are stored together with the archives on the backup device,
  and their contents are mostly self-explaining. Hence, in the case of an
  emergency, a user does not only have to rely on the restore functionality of
  <b>backup2l</b>, but can - if necessary - browse the files and extract
  archives manually.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
An open driver architecture allows one to use virtually any archiving program as
  a backend. Built-in drivers support <b>.tar.gz</b>, <b>.tar.bz2</b>, or
  <b>.afioz</b> files. Further drivers can be added by the user. When restoring
  data, an appropriate driver is selected automatically for each archive
  depending on the suffix of the archive file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The method of hierarchical differential backups is a generalization to the
  concept of the &quot;daily&quot;, &quot;weekly&quot; and &quot;monthly&quot;
  backups. Each backup has a level and a serial number. Maximum-level backups
  are comparable with daily differential backups, level-0 backups are full
  backups. For example, let <b>MAX_LEVEL</b> be 4 and <b>MAX_PER_LEVEL</b> be 5.
  After 5 level-4 backups (e. g. after 5 days), a new level-3 backup is made.
  After 5 level-3 backups (and 5*5 at level-4), a new level-2 backup is made,
  and so on. Each differential backup contains the changes towards the previous
  backup of the same or a lower level.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This scheme allows one to efficiently generate small incremental backups at
  short intervals. At the same time, the total number of archives that have to
  be stored (or processed in the case of a restore) only increases
  logarithmically with the number of backups since the last full backup.
  Time-consuming full backups are only sparsely needed. In the example above, a
  new full backup is only necessary after 780 (=5^4+5^3+5*5+5) days, while only
  at most 20 (=4*5) archives have to be processed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For <b>backup2l</b>, each backup archive is identified by its <b>backup ID
  (BID)</b>. The number of digits determines the level. Level-0 (full) backups
  have a 1-digit BID, level-n backups have a BID of n+1 digits. The last digit
  is a serial number, the prefix identifies the lower-level backups on which a
  given backup is based on. For example, the archive 235 contains the
  differences towards archive 234, and to restore the file system state of the
  time it was generated, the full backup 2, the level-1 backups 21, 22, 23 and
  the level-2 backups 231, ..., 235 have to be processed. All serial numbers are
  between 1 and 9, a zero in the BID indicates that no archive of the respective
  level is contained in the chain. For example, the level-3 backup 1201 is
  immediately based on the level-1 backup 12.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For deciding whether a file is new or modified, <b>backup2l</b> looks at its
  name, modification time, size, ownership and permissions. Unlike other backup
  tools, the i-node is not considered in order to avoid problems with non-Unix
  file systems like FAT32.

<b>backup2l</b> is designed to be run autonomously as a cron job. If the
  variable <b>AUTORUN</b> is set, it generates a backup if invoked without any
  parameters, and you can simply create a symlink, e. g. by:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
ln -s `which backup2l` /etc/cron.daily/zz-backup2l
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
The &quot;zz-&quot; prefix causes the backup job to be the last one executed, so
  that other jobs are not delayed if the backup takes somewhat longer. The
  status output is e-mailed to root by the cron daemon.

<b>backup2l</b> has been designed to be robust with respect to errors and
  configuration changes. If the backup process is interrupted, e. g. because of
  a shutdown while it is running, no serious data corruption can occur. Some
  temporary files may remain which are cleaned up during the next run. If file
  is changed during the backup generation, it may not be contained in the
  current backup. However, it is guaranteed that it is considered modified
  during the next backup.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order to save disk space, e. g. after some archives have been copied to
  external media, archive files (.tar.gz or .afioz, for example) can safely be
  removed from the backup directory. As long as all control files are kept,
  <b>backup2l</b> retains full functionality as far as possible. The
  <b>--restore</b> command prompts for eventually missing archive files for the
  respective request (and only those). The <b>--extract</b> command completely
  ignores all backups with missing archive files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The configuration, especially the settings for <b>MAX_LEVEL</b>,
  <b>MAX_PER_LEVEL</b>, <b>MAX_FULL</b> and the specification of source files,
  can be arbitrarily changed without having to expect data corruption.
  <b>backup2l</b> will gracefully adapt the new settings during the next run.
