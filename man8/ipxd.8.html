<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipxd - IPX RIP/SAP daemon program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipxd [ -d ] [ -p ] [ -l log_file ] [ -t ticks_file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The IPX RIP/SAP daemon ipxd is invoked at boot time to
manage the kernel IPX routing tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ipxd is started, it scans
the file /proc/net/ipx_interfaces to find the ipx networks
the computer is directly connected to. It sends the RIP and
SAP response and request <br>
packets required by the IPX router specification v1.20 to
the interfaces it found, so that an initial RIP and SAP
table can be built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During normal operation, ipxd
listens on the RIP and SAP ports of each directly connected
interface for broadcasts that other routers on the network
send out, as well as requests <br>
issued by workstations. This way the full router
functionality required by the IPX router specification v1.20
is hopefully implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every 30 seconds, as well as on
request by a HUP signal, the file /proc/net/ipx_interfaces
is re-scanned. Changes in the network topology are detected
this way and broadcasted <br>
appropriately. This could eventually make Linux a quite
flexible IPX router.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d <br>
With option -d, ipxd does not daemonize itself and logs the
IPX traffic it receives and sends out to the log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
With option -p, ipxd works in passive mode. This means it
does not output any response on the net. It does not
broadcast its internal tables, and does not answer requests.
<br>
This makes it suitable for use in a normal IPX workstation,
which should not act as a router. By starting ipxd in
passive mode, the kernel routing tables are kept up to date.
<br>
This means that utilities like slist or nprint do not have
to run suid root, to be able to add IPX routing table
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to use ipxd
in passive mode when you have an internal net, because other
IPX nodes must know how to reach the internal net. They can
only know it if ipxd <br>
tells them where the internal net is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
With this option you can tell ipxd where to put its log
output. The default is /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t ticks_file <br>
With this option you can override the default file name for
the ticks file. The default is /etc/ipx_ticks. See
ipx_ticks(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/ipx_ticks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ipx_ticks(5), ipx_interface(8)</p>
