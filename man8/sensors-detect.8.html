<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sensors-detect - detect hardware monitoring chips</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sensors-detect [ --auto ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sensors-detect is an interactive program that will walk you
through the process of scanning your system for various
hardware monitoring chips, or sensors, supported by
libsen&acirc; <br>
sors(3), or more generally by the lm_sensors tool suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensors-detect will look for the
following devices, in order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sensors embedded
in CPUs, south bridges and memory controllers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sensors embedded
in Super I/O chips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hardware
monitoring chips accessed through ISA I/O ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hardware
monitoring chips reachable over the SMBus or more generally
any I2C bus on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the last two detection steps
can cause trouble on some systems, they are normally not
attempted if the second detection step led to the discovery
of a Super I/O chip with com&acirc; <br>
plete hardware monitoring features. However, the user is
always free to ask for all detection steps if so is his/her
wish. This can be useful if a given system has more than one
<br>
hardware monitoring chip. Some vendors are known to do this,
most notably Asus and Tyan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--auto Run in automatic, non-interactive mode. Assume
default answers to all questions. Note that this isn&rsquo;t
necessarily safe as the internal logic may lead to
potentially dan&acirc; <br>
gerous probes being attempted. See the WARNING section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
sensors-detect needs to access the hardware for most of the
chip detections. By definition, it doesn&rsquo;t know which
chips are there before it manages to identify them. This
means <br>
that it can access chips in a way these chips do not like,
causing problems ranging from SMBus lockup to permanent
hardware damage (a rare case, thankfully.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authors made their best to
make the detection as safe as possible, and it turns out to
work just fine in most cases, however it is impossible to
guarantee that sensors-detect <br>
will not lock or kill a specific system. So, as a rule of
thumb, you should not run sensors-detect on production
servers, and you should not run sensors-detect if
can&rsquo;t afford <br>
replacing a random part of your system. Also, it is
recommended to not force a detection step which would have
been skipped by default, unless you know what you are
doing.</p>
