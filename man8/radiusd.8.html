FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server. It
  supports many database back-ends such as flat-text files, SQL, LDAP, Perl,
  Python, etc. It also supports many authentication protocols such as PAP, CHAP,
  MS-CHAP(v2), HTTP Digest, and EAP (EAP-MD5, EAP-TLS, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM,
  etc.).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It also has fullsupport for Cisco's VLAN Query Protocol (VMPS) and DHCP.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Please read the DEBUGGING section below. It contains instructions for quickly
  configuring the server for your local system.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following command-line options are accepted by the server:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-C</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Check the configuration and exit immediately. If there is a
      problem reading the configuration, then the server will exit with a
      non-zero status code. If the configuration appears to be acceptable, then
      the server will exit with a zero status code.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that there are limitations to this check. Due to the complexities
      involved in <i>almost</i> starting a RADIUS server, these checks are
      necessarily incomplete. The server can return a zero status code when run
      with -C, but may still exit with an error when run normally.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See the output of <b>radiusd -XC</b> for an informative list of which
      modules are checked for correct configuration, and which modules are
      skipped, and therefore not checked.</dd>

The default configuration is set to work in the widest possible circumstances.
  It requires minimal changes for your system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, your needs may be complex, and may require significant changes to the
  server configuration. Making random changes is a guaranteed method of failure.
  Instead, we STRONGLY RECOMMEND proceeding via the following steps:
<div class="Pp"></div>
1) Always run the server in debugging mode ( <b>radiusd -X</b> ) after making a
  configuration change. We cannot emphasize this enough. If you are not running
  the server in debugging mode, you <i>will not</i> be able to see what is
  doing, and you <i>will not</i> be able to correct any problems.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you ask questions on the mailing list, the first response will be to tell you
  &quot;run the server in debugging mode&quot;. Please, follow these
  instructions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2) Change as little as possible in the default configuration files. The server
  contains a decade of experience with protocols, databases, and different
  systems. Its default configuration is designed to work almost everywhere, and
  to do almost everything you need.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3) When you make a small change, testing it before changing anything else. If
  the change works, save a copy of the configuration, and make another change.
  If the change doesn't work, debug it, and try to understand why it doesn't
  work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you begin by making large changes to the server configuration, it will never
  work, and you will never be able to debug the problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4) If you need to add a connection to a database FOO (e.g. LDAP or SQL), then:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
a) Edit raddb/modules/foo
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This file contains the default configuration for the module. It contains
  comments describing what can be configured, and what those configuration
  entries mean.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
b) Edit raddb/sites-available/default
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This file contains the default policy for the server. e.g. &quot;enable CHAP,
  MS-CHAP, and EAP authentication&quot;. Look in this file for all references to
  your module &quot;foo&quot;. Read the comments, and remove the leading hash
  '#' from the lines referencing the module. This enables the module.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
c) Edit raddb/sites-available/inner-tunnel
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This file contains the default policy for the &quot;tunneled&quot; portion of
  certain EAP methods. Perform the same kind of edits as above, for the
  &quot;default&quot; file.. If you are not using EAP (802.1X), then this step
  can be skipped.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
d) Start the server in debugging mode ( <b>radiusd -X</b> ), and start testing.
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
5) Ask questions on the mailing list (freeradius-users@lists.freeradius.org).
  When asking questions, include the output from debugging mode ( <b>radiusd
  -X</b> ). This information will allow people to help you. If you do not
  include it, the first response to your message will be &quot;post the output
  of debug mode&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ask questions earlier, rather than later. If you cannot solve a problem in a
  day, ask a question on the mailing list. Most questions have been seen before,
  and can be answered quickly.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BACKGROUND"><a class="selflink" href="#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</a></h1>
<b>RADIUS</b> is a protocol spoken between an access server, typically a device
  connected to several modems or ISDN lines, and a <b>radius</b> server. When a
  user connects to the access server, (s)he is asked for a loginname and a
  password. This information is then sent to the <b>radius</b> server. The
  server replies with &quot;access denied&quot;, or &quot;access OK&quot;. In
  the latter case login information is sent along, such as the IP address in the
  case of a PPP connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The access server also sends login and logout records to the <b>radius</b>
  server so accounting can be done. These records are kept for each terminal
  server seperately in a file called <b>detail</b>, and in the <i>wtmp</i>
  compatible logfile <b>/var/log/radwtmp</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<b>Radiusd</b> uses a number of configuration files. Each file has it's own
  manpage describing the format of the file. These files are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">radiusd.conf</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The main configuration file, which sets the
      administrator-controlled items.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">dictionary</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This file is usually static. It defines all the possible
      RADIUS attributes used in the other configuration files. You don't have to
      modify it. It includes other dictionary files in the same directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">hints</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Defines certain hints to the radius server based on the
      users's loginname or other attributes sent by the access server. It also
      provides for mapping user names (such as Pusername -&gt; username). This
      provides the functionality that the <i>Livingston 2.0</i> server has as
      &quot;Prefix&quot; and &quot;Suffix&quot; support in the <i>users</i>
      file, but is more general. Ofcourse the Livingston way of doing things is
      also supported, and you can even use both at the same time (within certain
      limits).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">huntgroups</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Defines the huntgroups that you have, and makes it possible
      to restrict access to certain huntgroups to certain (groups of)
    users.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">users</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Here the users are defined. On a typical setup, this file
      mainly contains DEFAULT entries to process the different types of logins,
      based on hints from the hints file. Authentication is then based on the
      contents of the UNIX <i>/etc/passwd</i> file. However it is also possible
      to define all users, and their passwords, in this file.</dd>
