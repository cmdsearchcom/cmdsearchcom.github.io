<p>USBHID-UPS(8) NUT Manual USBHID-UPS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
usbhid-ups - Driver for USB/HID UPS equipment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features
of the usbhid-ups driver. For information about the core
driver, see nutupsdrv(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This driver, formerly called
newhidups, replaces the legacy hidups driver, which only
supported Linux systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
usbhid-ups brings USB/HID UPS monitoring to NUT on all
platform supporting USB through libusb. It should detect any
UPS that uses the HID power device class, but the amount of
<br>
data will vary depending on the manufacturer and model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the present time, usbhid-ups
supports:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the newer Eaton
USB models,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; all MGE USB
models,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; all Dell USB
models,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; some APC
models,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; some Belkin
models,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; some Cyber Power
Systems models,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; some Powercom
models,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; some TrippLite
models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list, refer
to the NUT hardware compatibility list, available in the
source distribution as data/drivers.list, or on the NUT
website. You may use the <br>
&quot;explore&quot; driver option to gather information from
HID UPSes which are not yet supported; see below for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This driver is known to work
on:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; most Linux
systems,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; FreeBSD (beta
stage) and maybe other *BSD,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Darwin / Mac OS
X,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Solaris 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver also supports the following optional
settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offdelay=num <br>
Set the timer before the UPS is turned off after the kill
power command is sent (via the -k switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 20 (in
seconds). Usually this must be lower than ondelay, but the
driver will not warn you upon startup if it isn&acirc;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ondelay=num <br>
Set the timer for the UPS to switch on in case the power
returns after the kill power command had been sent but
before the actual switch off. This ensures the machines <br>
connected to the UPS are, in all cases, rebooted after a
power failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 30 (in
seconds). Usually this must be greater than offdelay, but
the driver will not warn you upon startup if it isn&acirc;t.
Some UPS&acirc;es will restart no <br>
matter what, even if the power is (still) out at the moment
this timer elapses. In that case, you could try if setting
ondelay = -1 in ups.conf helps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pollfreq=num <br>
Set polling frequency, in seconds, to reduce the USB data
flow. Between two polling requests, the driver will wait for
interrupts (aka UPS notifications), which are data <br>
changes returned by the UPS by itself. This mechanism allow
to avoid or reduce staleness message, due to the UPS being
temporarily overloaded with too much polling requests. <br>
The default value is 30 (in seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pollonly <br>
If this flag is set, the driver will ignore interrupts it
receives from the UPS (not recommended, but needed if these
reports are broken on your UPS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vendor=regex, product=regex,
serial=regex, vendorid=regex, productid=regex <br>
Select a specific UPS, in case there is more than one
connected via USB Each option specifies an extended regular
expression (see regex(7)) that must match the UPS&acirc;s
entire <br>
vendor/product/serial string (minus any surrounding
whitespace), or the whole 4-digit hexadecimal code for
vendorid and productid. Try -DD for finding out the strings
to <br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -x
vendor=&quot;Foo.Corporation.*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -x
vendorid=051d* (APC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -x
product=&quot;.*(Smart|Back)-?UPS.*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bus=regex <br>
Select a UPS on a specific USB bus or group of busses. The
argument is a regular expression that must match the bus
name where the UPS is connected (e.g. bus=&quot;002&quot;,
<br>
bus=&quot;00[2-3]&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">explore <br>
With this option, the driver will connect to any device,
including ones that are not yet supported. This must always
be combined with the &quot;vendorid&quot; option. In this
mode, the <br>
driver will not do anything useful except for printing
debugging information (typically used with -DD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxreport <br>
With this option, the driver activates a tweak to workaround
buggy firmware returning invalid HID report length. Some APC
Back-UPS units are known to have this bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interruptonly <br>
If this flag is set, the driver will not poll UPS. This also
implies using of INPUT flagged objects. Some Powercom units
need this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interruptsize=num <br>
Limit the number of bytes to read from interrupt pipe. For
some Powercom units this option should be equal to 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
This driver is not built by default. You can build it by
using &quot;configure --with-usb=yes&quot;. Note that it
will also install other USB drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also need to install
manually the legacy hotplug files (libhidups and
libhid.usermap, generally in /etc/hotplug/usb/), or the udev
file (nut-usbups.rules, generally in <br>
/etc/udev/rules.d/) to address the permission settings
problem. For more information, refer to the README file in
nut/scripts/hotplug or nut/scripts/udev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux with MGE equipment, you
will need at least a 2.4.25 or 2.6.2 kernel as well as
libusb-0.1.8 or later to disable hiddev support and avoid
conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION <br>
The driver ignores the &quot;port&quot; value in ups.conf.
Unlike previous versions of this driver, it is now possible
to control multiple UPS units simultaneously with this
driver, <br>
provided they can be distinguished by setting some
combination of the &quot;vendor&quot;, &quot;product&quot;,
&quot;serial&quot;, &quot;vendorid&quot;, and
&quot;productid&quot; options. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[mge] <br>
driver = usbhid-ups <br>
port = auto <br>
vendorid = 0463 <br>
[tripplite] <br>
driver = usbhid-ups <br>
port = auto <br>
vendorid = 09ae</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS <br>
Repetitive timeout and staleness <br>
Some models tends to be unresponsive with the default
polling frequency. The result is that your system log will
have lots of messages like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usb 2-1: control timeout on
ep0in <br>
usb 2-1: usbfs: USBDEVFS_CONTROL failed cmd usbhid-ups rqt
128 rq 6 len 256 <br>
ret -110</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, simply modify the
general parameter &quot;pollinterval&quot; to a higher value
(like 10 for 10 seconds). This should solve the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Got EPERM: Operation not
permitted upon driver startup <br>
You have forgotten to install the hotplug files, as
explained in the INSTALLATION section above. Don&acirc;t
forget to restart hotplug so that it applies these
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unattended shutdowns <br>
The hardware which was used for development of this driver
is almost certainly different from what you have, and not
all manufacturers follow the USB HID Power Device Class <br>
specifications to the letter. You don&acirc;t want to find
out that yours has issues here when a power failure hits
your server room and you&acirc;re not around to manually
restart your <br>
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you rely on the UPS to
shutdown your systems in case of mains failure and to
restart them when the power returns, you must test this. You
can do so by running upsmon -c fsd. <br>
With the mains present, this should bring your systems down
and then cycle the power to restart them again. If you do
the same without mains present, it should do the same, but
<br>
in this case, the outputs shall remain off until mains power
is applied again.</p>
