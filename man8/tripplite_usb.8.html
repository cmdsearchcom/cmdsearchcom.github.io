<p>TRIPPLITE_USB(8) NUT Manual TRIPPLITE_USB(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tripplite_usb - Driver for older Tripp Lite USB UPSes (not
PDC HID)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tripplite_usb -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tripplite_usb -a UPS_NAME
[OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED HARDWARE <br>
This driver should work with older Tripp Lite UPSes which
are detected as USB HID-class devices, but are not true HID
Power-Device Class devices. So far, the devices supported by
<br>
tripplite_usb have product ID 0001, and the newer units
(such as those with &quot;LCD&quot; in the model name) with
product ID 2001 require the usbhid-ups(8) driver instead.
Please report <br>
success or failure to the nut-upsuser mailing list. A key
piece of information is the protocol number, returned in
ups.debug.0. Also, be sure to turn on debugging (-DDD) for
more <br>
informative log messages. If your Tripp Lite UPS uses a
serial port, you may wish to investigate the tripplite(8) or
tripplite_su(8) driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This driver has been tested with
the following models:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
INTERNETOFFICE700</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; OMNIVS1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; OMNIVS1500XL
(some warnings)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SMART700USB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
SMART1500RM2U</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
SMART2200RMXL2U</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
SMART3000RM2U</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have used Tripp
Lite&acirc;s PowerAlert software to connect to your UPS,
there is a good chance that tripplite_usb will work if it
uses one of the following protocols:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Protocol
0004</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Protocol
1001</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Protocol
2001</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Protocol
3003</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, if the web
page for your UPS on the Tripp-Lite website says
&quot;HID-compliant USB port also enables direct integration
with built-in power management and <br>
auto-shutdown features of Windows and MAC OS X&quot;, then
you should use the usbhid-ups(8) driver instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA ARGUMENTS <br>
This driver supports the following optional settings in the
ups.conf(5) file (or with -x on the command line):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offdelay <br>
This setting controls the delay between receiving the
&quot;kill&quot; command (-k) and actually cutting power to
the computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battery_min, battery_max <br>
These floating-point values correspond to the
&quot;empty&quot; (10%) and &quot;full&quot; (100%) voltages
of the battery. They are used for an approximation of the
battery state-of-charge. The <br>
calculated battery.charge value will be clamped to the range
of 10% through 100%, so the resting voltage of the charged
battery can be used for battery_max, and the higher <br>
float charge voltage should not cause problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bus <br>
This regular expression is used to match the USB bus (as
seen in /proc/bus/usb/devices or lsusb(8); including leading
zeroes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">product <br>
A regular expression to match the product string for the
UPS. This would be useful if you have two different Tripp
Lite UPS models connected to the system, and you want to be
<br>
sure that you shut them down in the correct order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This regex is matched against the full USB product string as
seen in lsusb(8). The ups.model in the upsc(1) output only
lists the name after TRIPP LITE, so to match a <br>
SMART2200RMXL2U, you could use the regex .*SMART2200.*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">productid <br>
The productid is a regular expression which matches the UPS
PID as four hexadecimal digits. So far, the only devices
that work with this driver have PID 0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serial <br>
It does not appear that these particular Tripp Lite UPSes
use the iSerial descriptor field to return a serial number.
However, in case your unit does, you may specify it <br>
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on regular
expressions, see regex(7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME VARIABLES <br>
ups.delay.shutdown <br>
This variable is the same as the offdelay setting, but it
can be changed at runtime by upsrw(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ups.id <br>
Some SMARTPRO models feature an ID that can be set and
retrieved. If your UPS supports this feature, this variable
will be listed in the output of upsrw(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outlet.1.switch <br>
Some Tripp Lite units have a switchable outlet (usually
outlet #1) which can be turned on and off by writing 1 or 0,
respectively, to outlet.1.switch with upsrw(8). If your <br>
unit has multiple switchable outlets, substitute the outlet
number for 1 in the variable name. Be sure to test this
first - there is no other way to be certain that the <br>
number used by the driver matches the label on the unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS <br>
The driver was not developed with any official documentation
from Tripp Lite, so certain events may confuse the driver.
If you observe any strange behavior, please re-run the <br>
driver with -DDD to increase the verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So far, the Tripp Lite UPSes do
not seem to have a serial number or other globally unique
identifier accessible through USB. Thus, when monitoring
several Tripp Lite USB UPSes, <br>
you should use either the bus or product configuration
options to uniquely specify which UPS a given driver
instance should control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, you can easily
monitor an OMNIVS1000 and a SMART1500RM2U at the same time,
since they have different USB Product ID strings. If you
have two SMART1500RM2U units, <br>
you would have to find which USB bus number each unit is on
(via lsusb(8)), which may result in ambiguities if the
available USB ports are on the same bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the SMART*2U models have
an ID number, but because this ID is not exposed as a USB
string descriptor, there is no easy way to use this ID to
distinguish between multiple <br>
UPS units on a single machine. The UPS would need to be
claimed by the driver in order to read this ID.</p>
