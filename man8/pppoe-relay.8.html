<p>PPPOE-RELAY(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
PPPOE-RELAY(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pppoe-relay - user-space PPPoE relay agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pppoe-relay [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pppoe-relay is a user-space relay agent for PPPoE
(Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) for Linux.
pppoe-relay works in concert with the pppoe client and
pppoe-server server. <br>
See the OPERATION section later in this manual for details
on how pppoe-relay works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-S interface <br>
Adds the Ethernet interface interface to the list of
interfaces managed by pppoe-relay. Only PPPoE servers may be
connected to this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C interface <br>
Adds the Ethernet interface interface to the list of
interfaces managed by pppoe-relay. Only PPPoE clients may be
connected to this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B interface <br>
Adds the Ethernet interface interface to the list of
interfaces managed by pppoe-relay. Both PPPoE clients and
servers may be connected to this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num Allows at most num
concurrent PPPoE sessions. If not specified, the default is
5000. num can range from 1 to 65534.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i timeout <br>
Specifies the session idle timeout. If both peers in a
session are idle for more than timeout seconds, the session
is terminated. If timeout is specified as zero, ses&acirc;
<br>
sions will never be terminated because of idleness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the idle-session
expiry routine is never run more frequently than every 30
seconds, so the timeout is approximate. The default value
for timeout is 600 seconds <br>
(10 minutes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F The -F option causes
pppoe-relay not to fork into the background; instead, it
remains in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h The -h option prints a brief
usage message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
pppoe-relay listens for incoming PPPoE PADI frames on all
interfaces specified with -B or -C options. When a PADI
frame appears, pppoe-relay adds a Relay-Session-ID tag and
<br>
broadcasts the PADI on all interfaces specified with -B or
-S options (except the interface on which the frame
arrived.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any PADO frames received are
relayed back to the client which sent the PADI (assuming
they contain valid Relay-Session-ID tags.) Likewise, PADR
frames from clients are relayed <br>
back to the matching access concentrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a PADS frame is received,
pppoe-relay enters the two peers&rsquo; MAC addresses and
session-ID&rsquo;s into a hash table. (The session-ID seen
by the access concentrator may be differ&acirc; <br>
ent from that seen by the client; pppoe-relay must renumber
sessions to avoid the possibility of duplicate
session-ID&rsquo;s.) Whenever either peer sends a session
frame, pppoe-relay <br>
looks up the session entry in the hash table and relays the
frame to the correct peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a PADT frame is received,
pppoe-relay relays it to the peer and deletes the session
entry from its hash table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a client and server crash (or
frames are lost), PADT frames may never be sent, and
pppoe-relay&rsquo;s hash table can fill up with stale
sessions. Therefore, a session-cleaning <br>
routine runs periodically, and removes old sessions from the
hash table. A session is considered &quot;old&quot; if no
traffic has been seen within timeout seconds. When a session
is <br>
deleted because of a timeout, a PADT frame is sent to each
peer to make certain that they are aware the session has
been killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE INVOCATIONS <br>
pppoe-relay -C eth0 -S eth1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example above relays frames
between PPPoE clients on the eth0 network and PPPoE servers
on the eth1 network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pppoe-relay -B eth0 -B eth1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example is a transparent
relay -- frames are relayed between any mix of clients and
servers on the eth0 and eth1 networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pppoe-relay -S eth0 -C eth1 -C
eth2 -C eth3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example relays frames
between servers on the eth0 network and clients on the eth1,
eth2 and eth3 networks.</p>
