<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Uses information in sysfs (Linux kernel series 2.6 and later) to list SCSI
  devices (or hosts) currently attached to the system. Options can be used to
  control the amount and form of information provided for each device.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <i>H:C:T:L</i> argument is given then it acts as a filter and only devices
  that match it are listed. The colons don't have to be present, and '-', '*',
  '?' or missing arguments at the end are interpreted as wildcards. The default
  is '*:*:*:*' which means to match everything. Any filter string using '*' of
  '?' should be surrounded by single or double quotes to stop shell expansions.
  If '-' is used as a wildcard then the whole filter argument should be prefixed
  by '-- ' to tell this utility there are no more options on the command line to
  be interpreted. A leading '[' and trailing ']' are permitted (e.g. '[1:0:0]'
  matches all LUNs on 1:0:0). May also be used to filter <i>--hosts</i> in which
  case only the <i>H</i> is active and may be either a number or in the form
  &quot;host&lt;n&gt;&quot; where &lt;n&gt; is a host number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default in this utility device node names (e.g. &quot;/dev/sda&quot; or
  &quot;/dev/root_disk&quot;) are obtained by noting the major and minor numbers
  for the listed device obtained from sysfs (e.g. the contents of
  &quot;/sys/block/sda/dev&quot;) and then looking for a match in the
  &quot;/dev&quot; directory. This &quot;match by major and minor&quot; will
  allow devices that have been given a different name by udev (for example) to
  be correctly reported by this utility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In some situations it may be useful to see the device node name that Linux would
  produce by default, so the <i>--kname</i> option is provided. An example of
  where this may be useful is kernel error logs which tend to report disk error
  messages using the disk's default kernel name.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well. The options
  are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long option name.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TRANSPORTS"><a class="selflink" href="#TRANSPORTS">TRANSPORTS</a></h1>
This utility lists SCSI devices which are known as logical units (LU) in the
  SCSI Architecture Model (ref: SAM-4 at http://www.t10.org) or hosts when the
  <i>--hosts</i> option is given. A host is called an initiator in SAM-4. A SCSI
  command travels out via an initiator, across some transport to a target and
  then onwards to a logical unit. A target device may contain several logical
  units. A target device has one or more ports that can be viewed as transport
  end points. Each FC and SAS disk is a single target that has two ports and
  contains one logical unit. If both target ports on a FC or SAS disk are
  connected and visible to a machine, then lsscsi will show two entries.
  Initiators (i.e. hosts) also have one or more ports and some HBAs in Linux
  have a host entry per initiator port while others have a host entry per
  initiator device.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the <i>--transport</i> option is given for devices (i.e. <i>--hosts</i> not
  given) then most of the information produced by lsscsi is associated with the
  target, or more precisely: the target port, through which SCSI commands pass
  that access a logical unit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typically this utility provides one line of output per &quot;device&quot; or
  host. Significantly more information can be obtained by adding the
  <i>--list</i> option. When used together with the <i>--transport</i> option,
  after the summary line, multiple lines of transport specific information in
  the form &quot;&lt;attribute_name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&quot; are output, each
  indented by two spaces. Using a filter argument will reduce the volume of
  output if a lot of devices or hosts are present.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The transports that are currently recognized are: IEEE 1394, ATA, FC, iSCSI,
  SAS, SATA, SPI and USB.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. Firewire and &quot;SBP&quot; when storage is involved),
  the EUI-64 based target port name is output when <i>--transport</i> is given,
  in the absence of the <i>--hosts</i> option. When the <i>--hosts</i> option is
  given then the EUI-64 initiator port name is output. Output on the summary
  line specific to the IEEE 1394 transport is prefixed by &quot;sbp:&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
to detect ATA and SATA a crude check is performed on the driver name (after the
  checks for other transports are exhausted). Based on the driver name either
  ATA or SATA transport type is chosen. Output on the summary line is either
  &quot;ata:&quot; or &quot;sata:&quot;. No other attributes are given. Most
  device and hosts flagged as &quot;ata:&quot; will use the parallel ATA
  transport (PATA).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For Fibre Channel (FC) the port name and port identifier are output when
  <i>--transport</i> is given. In the absence of the <i>--hosts</i> option these
  ids will be for the target port associated with the device (logical unit)
  being listed. When the <i>--hosts</i> option is given then the ids are for the
  initiator port used by the host. Output on the summary line specific to the FC
  transport is prefixed by &quot;fc:&quot;. If FCoE (over Ethernet) is detected
  the prefix is changed to &quot;fcoe:&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For iSCSI the target port name is output when <i>--transport</i> is given, in
  the absence of the <i>--hosts</i> option. This is made up of the iSCSI name
  and the target portal group tag. Since the iSCSI name starts with
  &quot;iqn&quot; no further prefix is used. When the <i>--hosts</i> option is
  given then only &quot;iscsi:&quot; is output on the summary line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For Serial Attached SCSI the SAS address of the target port (or initiator port
  if <i>--hosts</i> option is also given) is output. This will be a naa-5
  address. For SAS HBAs and SAS targets (such as SAS disks and tape drives) the
  SAS address will be world wide unique. For SATA disks attached to a SAS
  expander, the expander provides the SAS address by adding a non zero value to
  its (i.e. the expander's) SAS address (e.g. expander_sas_address + phy_id +
  1). SATA disks directly attached to SAS HBAs seem to have an indeterminate SAS
  address. Output on the summary line specific to the SAS transport is prefixed
  by &quot;sas:&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the SCSI Parallel Interface (SPI) the target port identifier (usually a
  number between 0 and 15 inclusive) is output when <i>--transport</i> is given,
  in the absence of the <i>--hosts</i> option. When the <i>--hosts</i> option is
  given then only &quot;spi:&quot; is output on the summary line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a USB transport is detected, the summary line will contain &quot;usb:&quot;
  followed by a USB device name. The USB device name has the form
  &quot;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;p1&gt;[.&lt;p2&gt;[.&lt;p3&gt;]]:&lt;c&gt;.&lt;i&gt;&quot;
  where &lt;b&gt; is the USB bus number, &lt;p1&gt; is the port on the host.
  &lt;p2&gt; is a port on a host connected hub, if present. If needed &lt;p3&gt;
  is a USB hub port closer to the USB storage device. &lt;c&gt; refers to the
  configuration number while &lt;i&gt; is the interface number. There is a
  separate SCSI host for each USB (SCSI) target. A USB SCSI target may contain
  multiple logical units. Thus the same &quot;usb: &lt;device_name&gt;&quot;
  string appears for a USB SCSI host and all logical units that belong to the
  USB SCSI target associated with that USB SCSI host.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LUNS"><a class="selflink" href="#LUNS">LUNS</a></h1>
For historical reasons and as used by several other Unix based Operating
  Systems, Linux uses a tuple of integers to describe (a path to) a SCSI device
  (also know as a Logical Unit (LU)). The last element of that tuple is the
  so-called Logical Unit Number (LUN). And originally in SCSI a LUN was an
  integer, at first 3 bits long, then 8 then 16 bits. SCSI LUNs today (SAM-5
  section 4.7) are 64 bits but SCSI standards now consider a LUN to be an array
  of 8 bytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Up until 2013, Linux mapped SCSI LUNs to a 32 bit integer by taking the first 4
  bytes of the SCSI LUN and ignoring the last 4 bytes. Linux treated the first
  two bytes of the SCSI LUN as a unit (a word) and it became the least
  significant 16 bits in the Linux LUN integer. The next two bytes of the SCSI
  LUN became the upper 16 bits in the Linux LUN integer. The rationale for this
  was to keep commonly used LUNs small Linux LUN integers. The most common LUN
  (by far) in SCSI LUN (hex) notation is 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 and this
  becomes the Linux LUN integer 0. The next most common LUN is 00 01 00 00 00 00
  00 00 and this becomes the Linux LUN integer 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In 2013 it is proposed to increase Linux LUNs to a 64 bit integer by extending
  the mapping outlined above. In this case all information that is possible to
  represent in a SCSI LUN is mapped a Linux LUN (64 bit) integer. And the
  mapping can be reversed without losing information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This version of the utility supports both 32 and 64 bit Linux LUN integers. By
  default the LUN shown at the end of the tuple commencing each line is a Linux
  LUN as a decimal integer. When the <i>--lunhex</i> option is given then the
  LUN is in SCSI LUN format with the 8 bytes run together, with the output in
  hexadecimal and prefixed by '0x'. The LUN is decoded according to SAM-5's
  description and trailing zeros (i.e. digits to the right) are not shown. So
  LUN 0 (i.e. 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00) is shown as 0x0000 and LUN 65 (i.e. 00 41
  00 00 00 00 00 00) is shown as 0x0041. If the <i>--lunhex</i> option is given
  twice then the full 64 bits (i.e. 16 hexadecimal digits) are shown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <i>--lunhex</i> option is not given on the command line then the
  environment variable LSSCSI_LUNHEX_OPT is checked. If LSSCSI_LUNHEX_OPT is
  present then its associated value becomes the number of times the
  <i>--lunhex</i> is set internally. So, for example, 'LSSCSI_LUNHEX_OPT=2
  lsscsi' and 'lsscsi -xx' are equivalent.

  http://sg.danny.cz/scsi/lsscsi.html .
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Information for this command is derived from the sysfs file system, which is
  assumed to be mounted at /sys unless specified otherwise by the user. SCSI
  (pseudo) devices that have been detected by the SCSI mid level will be listed
  even if the required upper level drivers (i.e. sd, sr, st, osst or ch) have
  not been loaded. If the appropriate upper level driver has not been loaded
  then the device file name will appear as '-' rather than something like
  '/dev/st0'. Note that some devices (e.g. scanners and medium changers) do not
  have a primary upper level driver and can only be accessed via a SCSI generic
  (sg) device name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generic SCSI devices can also be accessed via the bsg driver in Linux. By
  default, the bsg driver's device node names are of the form '/dev/bsg/
  <i>H:C:T:L</i>'. So, for example, the SCSI device shown by this utility on a
  line starting with the tuple '6:0:1:2' could be accessed via the bsg driver
  with the '/dev/bsg/6:0:1:2' device node name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
lsscsi version 0.21 or later is required to correctly display SCSI devices in
  Linux kernel 2.6.26 (and possibly later) when the CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2
  kernel option is not defined.
