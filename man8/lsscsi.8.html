<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lsscsi - list SCSI devices (or hosts) and their
attributes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lsscsi [--classic] [--device] [--generic] [--help] [--hosts]
[--kname] [--list] [--lunhex] [--long] [--protection]
[--protmode] [--scsi_id] [--size] [--sysfsroot=PATH]
[--trans&acirc; <br>
port] [--verbose] [--version] [--wwn] [H:C:T:L]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Uses information in sysfs (Linux kernel series 2.6 and
later) to list SCSI devices (or hosts) currently attached to
the system. Options can be used to control the amount and
form <br>
of information provided for each device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a H:C:T:L argument is given
then it acts as a filter and only devices that match it are
listed. The colons don&rsquo;t have to be present, and
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, &rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;?&rsquo; or missing
arguments at <br>
the end are interpreted as wildcards. The default is
&rsquo;*:*:*:*&rsquo; which means to match everything. Any
filter string using &rsquo;*&rsquo; of &rsquo;?&rsquo;
should be surrounded by single or double quotes <br>
to stop shell expansions. If &rsquo;-&rsquo; is used as a
wildcard then the whole filter argument should be prefixed
by &rsquo;-- &rsquo; to tell this utility there are no more
options on the command <br>
line to be interpreted. A leading &rsquo;[&rsquo; and
trailing &rsquo;]&rsquo; are permitted (e.g.
&rsquo;[1:0:0]&rsquo; matches all LUNs on 1:0:0). May also
be used to filter --hosts in which case only the H is <br>
active and may be either a number or in the form
&quot;host&lt;n&gt;&quot; where &lt;n&gt; is a host
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default in this utility
device node names (e.g. &quot;/dev/sda&quot; or
&quot;/dev/root_disk&quot;) are obtained by noting the major
and minor numbers for the listed device obtained from sysfs
<br>
(e.g. the contents of &quot;/sys/block/sda/dev&quot;) and
then looking for a match in the &quot;/dev&quot; directory.
This &quot;match by major and minor&quot; will allow devices
that have been given a dif&acirc; <br>
ferent name by udev (for example) to be correctly reported
by this utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some situations it may be
useful to see the device node name that Linux would produce
by default, so the --kname option is provided. An example of
where this may be useful is <br>
kernel error logs which tend to report disk error messages
using the disk&rsquo;s default kernel name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. The options are arranged in alphabetical order based
on the long option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --classic <br>
The output is similar to that obtained from &rsquo;cat
/proc/scsi/scsi&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --device <br>
After outputting the (probable) SCSI device name the device
node major and minor numbers are shown in brackets (e.g.
&quot;/dev/sda[8:0]&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --generic <br>
Output the SCSI generic device file name. Note that if the
sg driver is a module it may need to be loaded otherwise
&rsquo;-&rsquo; may appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Output the usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hosts <br>
List the SCSI hosts currently attached to the system. If
this option is not given then SCSI devices are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --kname <br>
Use Linux default algorithm for naming devices (e.g. block
major 8, minor 0 is &quot;/dev/sda&quot;) rather than the
&quot;match by major and minor&quot; in the &quot;/dev&quot;
directory as discussed <br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --list <br>
Output additional information in
&lt;attribute_name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; pairs, one pair per
line preceded by two spaces. This option has the same effect
as &rsquo;-lll&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --long <br>
Output additional information for each SCSI device (host).
Can be used multiple times for more output in which case the
shorter option form is more convenient (e.g. <br>
&rsquo;-lll&rsquo;). When used three times (i.e.
&rsquo;-lll&rsquo;) outputs SCSI device (host) attributes
one per line; preceded by two spaces; in the form
&quot;&lt;attribute_name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --lunhex <br>
when this option is used once the LUN in the tuple (at the
start of each device line) is shown in &quot;T10&quot;
format which is up to 16 hexadecimal digits. It is prefixed
by &quot;0x&quot; <br>
to distinguish the LUN from the decimal value shown in the
absence of this option. Also hierarchal LUNs are shown with
a &quot;_&quot; character separating the levels. For example
<br>
the two level LUN: 0x0355006600000000 will appear as
0x0355_0066. If this option is given twice (e.g. using the
short form: &rsquo;-xx&rsquo;) then the full 16 hexadecimal
digits are <br>
shown for each LUN, prefixed by &quot;0x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --protection <br>
Output target (DIF) and initiator (DIX) protection
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --protmode <br>
Output effective protection information mode for each disk
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --scsi_id <br>
outputs the udev derived matching id found in
/dev/disk/by-id/scsi* . This is only for disk (and disk
like) devices. If no match is found then
&quot;dm-uuid-mpath*&quot; and &quot;usb*&quot; <br>
are searched in the same directory. If there is still no
match then the /sys/class/block/&lt;disk&gt;/holders
directory is searched. The matching id is printed following
the <br>
device name (e.g. /dev/sdc) and if there is no match
&quot;-&quot; is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --size <br>
Print disk capacity in human readable form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --transport <br>
Output transport information. This will be a target related
information or, if --hosts is given, initiator related
information. When used without --list, a name or
identi&acirc; <br>
fier (or both) are output on a single line, usually prefixed
by the type of transport. For devices this information
replaces the normal vendor, product and revision <br>
strings. When the --list option is also given then
additionally multiple lines of attribute_name=value pairs
are output, each indented by two spaces. See the section on
<br>
transports below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
outputs directory names where information is found. Use
multiple times for more output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
outputs version information then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wwn <br>
outputs the WWN for disks instead of manufacturer, model and
revision (or instead of transport information). The World
Wide Name (WWN) is typically 64 bits long (16 hex <br>
digits) but could be up to 128 bits long. To indicate the
WWN is hexadecimal, it is prefixed by &quot;0x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --sysfsroot=PATH <br>
assumes sysfs is mounted at PATH instead of the default
&rsquo;/sys&rsquo; . If this option is given PATH should be
an absolute path (i.e. start with &rsquo;/&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSPORTS <br>
This utility lists SCSI devices which are known as logical
units (LU) in the SCSI Architecture Model (ref: SAM-4 at
http://www.t10.org) or hosts when the --hosts option is
given. <br>
A host is called an initiator in SAM-4. A SCSI command
travels out via an initiator, across some transport to a
target and then onwards to a logical unit. A target device
may <br>
contain several logical units. A target device has one or
more ports that can be viewed as transport end points. Each
FC and SAS disk is a single target that has two ports and
<br>
contains one logical unit. If both target ports on a FC or
SAS disk are connected and visible to a machine, then lsscsi
will show two entries. Initiators (i.e. hosts) also have
<br>
one or more ports and some HBAs in Linux have a host entry
per initiator port while others have a host entry per
initiator device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the --transport option is
given for devices (i.e. --hosts not given) then most of the
information produced by lsscsi is associated with the
target, or more precisely: the <br>
target port, through which SCSI commands pass that access a
logical unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically this utility provides
one line of output per &quot;device&quot; or host.
Significantly more information can be obtained by adding the
--list option. When used together with the <br>
--transport option, after the summary line, multiple lines
of transport specific information in the form
&quot;&lt;attribute_name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&quot; are output,
each indented by two spaces. <br>
Using a filter argument will reduce the volume of output if
a lot of devices or hosts are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transports that are
currently recognized are: IEEE 1394, ATA, FC, iSCSI, SAS,
SATA, SPI and USB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. Firewire
and &quot;SBP&quot; when storage is involved), the EUI-64
based target port name is output when --transport is given,
in the absence of the --hosts option. <br>
When the --hosts option is given then the EUI-64 initiator
port name is output. Output on the summary line specific to
the IEEE 1394 transport is prefixed by &quot;sbp:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to detect ATA and SATA a crude
check is performed on the driver name (after the checks for
other transports are exhausted). Based on the driver name
either ATA or SATA transport <br>
type is chosen. Output on the summary line is either
&quot;ata:&quot; or &quot;sata:&quot;. No other attributes
are given. Most device and hosts flagged as &quot;ata:&quot;
will use the parallel ATA trans&acirc; <br>
port (PATA).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Fibre Channel (FC) the port
name and port identifier are output when --transport is
given. In the absence of the --hosts option these ids will
be for the target port associ&acirc; <br>
ated with the device (logical unit) being listed. When the
--hosts option is given then the ids are for the initiator
port used by the host. Output on the summary line specific
<br>
to the FC transport is prefixed by &quot;fc:&quot;. If FCoE
(over Ethernet) is detected the prefix is changed to
&quot;fcoe:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For iSCSI the target port name
is output when --transport is given, in the absence of the
--hosts option. This is made up of the iSCSI name and the
target portal group tag. Since <br>
the iSCSI name starts with &quot;iqn&quot; no further prefix
is used. When the --hosts option is given then only
&quot;iscsi:&quot; is output on the summary line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Serial Attached SCSI the SAS
address of the target port (or initiator port if --hosts
option is also given) is output. This will be a naa-5
address. For SAS HBAs and SAS tar&acirc; <br>
gets (such as SAS disks and tape drives) the SAS address
will be world wide unique. For SATA disks attached to a SAS
expander, the expander provides the SAS address by adding a
<br>
non zero value to its (i.e. the expander&rsquo;s) SAS
address (e.g. expander_sas_address + phy_id + 1). SATA disks
directly attached to SAS HBAs seem to have an indeterminate
SAS <br>
address. Output on the summary line specific to the SAS
transport is prefixed by &quot;sas:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the SCSI Parallel Interface
(SPI) the target port identifier (usually a number between 0
and 15 inclusive) is output when --transport is given, in
the absence of the --hosts <br>
option. When the --hosts option is given then only
&quot;spi:&quot; is output on the summary line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a USB transport is
detected, the summary line will contain &quot;usb:&quot;
followed by a USB device name. The USB device name has the
form
&quot;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;p1&gt;[.&lt;p2&gt;[.&lt;p3&gt;]]:&lt;c&gt;.&lt;i&gt;&quot;
where &lt;b&gt; <br>
is the USB bus number, &lt;p1&gt; is the port on the host.
&lt;p2&gt; is a port on a host connected hub, if present. If
needed &lt;p3&gt; is a USB hub port closer to the USB
storage device. &lt;c&gt; <br>
refers to the configuration number while &lt;i&gt; is the
interface number. There is a separate SCSI host for each USB
(SCSI) target. A USB SCSI target may contain multiple
logical <br>
units. Thus the same &quot;usb: &lt;device_name&gt;&quot;
string appears for a USB SCSI host and all logical units
that belong to the USB SCSI target associated with that USB
SCSI host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LUNS <br>
For historical reasons and as used by several other Unix
based Operating Systems, Linux uses a tuple of integers to
describe (a path to) a SCSI device (also know as a Logical
<br>
Unit (LU)). The last element of that tuple is the so-called
Logical Unit Number (LUN). And originally in SCSI a LUN was
an integer, at first 3 bits long, then 8 then 16 bits. <br>
SCSI LUNs today (SAM-5 section 4.7) are 64 bits but SCSI
standards now consider a LUN to be an array of 8 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up until 2013, Linux mapped SCSI
LUNs to a 32 bit integer by taking the first 4 bytes of the
SCSI LUN and ignoring the last 4 bytes. Linux treated the
first two bytes of the SCSI <br>
LUN as a unit (a word) and it became the least significant
16 bits in the Linux LUN integer. The next two bytes of the
SCSI LUN became the upper 16 bits in the Linux LUN integer.
<br>
The rationale for this was to keep commonly used LUNs small
Linux LUN integers. The most common LUN (by far) in SCSI LUN
(hex) notation is 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 and this <br>
becomes the Linux LUN integer 0. The next most common LUN is
00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 and this becomes the Linux LUN
integer 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In 2013 it is proposed to
increase Linux LUNs to a 64 bit integer by extending the
mapping outlined above. In this case all information that is
possible to represent in a SCSI <br>
LUN is mapped a Linux LUN (64 bit) integer. And the mapping
can be reversed without losing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of the utility
supports both 32 and 64 bit Linux LUN integers. By default
the LUN shown at the end of the tuple commencing each line
is a Linux LUN as a decimal <br>
integer. When the --lunhex option is given then the LUN is
in SCSI LUN format with the 8 bytes run together, with the
output in hexadecimal and prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo;. The
LUN is <br>
decoded according to SAM-5&rsquo;s description and trailing
zeros (i.e. digits to the right) are not shown. So LUN 0
(i.e. 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00) is shown as 0x0000 and LUN 65
(i.e. <br>
00 41 00 00 00 00 00 00) is shown as 0x0041. If the --lunhex
option is given twice then the full 64 bits (i.e. 16
hexadecimal digits) are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --lunhex option is not
given on the command line then the environment variable
LSSCSI_LUNHEX_OPT is checked. If LSSCSI_LUNHEX_OPT is
present then its associated value <br>
becomes the number of times the --lunhex is set internally.
So, for example, &rsquo;LSSCSI_LUNHEX_OPT=2 lsscsi&rsquo;
and &rsquo;lsscsi -xx&rsquo; are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Information about this utility including examples can also
be found at: http://sg.danny.cz/scsi/lsscsi.html .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Information for this command is derived from the sysfs file
system, which is assumed to be mounted at /sys unless
specified otherwise by the user. SCSI (pseudo) devices that
<br>
have been detected by the SCSI mid level will be listed even
if the required upper level drivers (i.e. sd, sr, st, osst
or ch) have not been loaded. If the appropriate upper <br>
level driver has not been loaded then the device file name
will appear as &rsquo;-&rsquo; rather than something like
&rsquo;/dev/st0&rsquo;. Note that some devices (e.g.
scanners and medium changers) do <br>
not have a primary upper level driver and can only be
accessed via a SCSI generic (sg) device name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generic SCSI devices can also be
accessed via the bsg driver in Linux. By default, the bsg
driver&rsquo;s device node names are of the form
&rsquo;/dev/bsg/H:C:T:L&rsquo;. So, for example, the <br>
SCSI device shown by this utility on a line starting with
the tuple &rsquo;6:0:1:2&rsquo; could be accessed via the
bsg driver with the &rsquo;/dev/bsg/6:0:1:2&rsquo; device
node name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsscsi version 0.21 or later is
required to correctly display SCSI devices in Linux kernel
2.6.26 (and possibly later) when the
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2 kernel option is not <br>
defined.</p>
