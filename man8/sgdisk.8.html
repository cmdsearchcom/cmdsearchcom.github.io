<p>SGDISK(8) GPT fdisk Manual SGDISK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sgdisk - Command-line GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
for Linux and Unix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sgdisk [ options ] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GPT fdisk is a text-mode menu-driven package for creation
and manipulation of partition tables. It consists of two
programs: the text-mode interactive gdisk and the
command-line <br>
sgdisk. Either program will automatically convert an
old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD
disklabel stored without an MBR carrier partition to the
newer <br>
Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT)
format, or will load a GUID partition table. This man page
documents the command-line sgdisk program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some advanced data manipulation
and recovery options require you to understand the
distinctions between the main and backup data, as well as
between the GPT headers and the par&acirc; <br>
tition tables. For information on MBR vs. GPT, as well as
GPT terminology and structure, see the extended gdisk
documentation at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/ or consult
<br>
Wikipedia.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sgdisk program employs a
user interface that&rsquo;s based entirely on the command
line, making it suitable for use in scripts or by experts
who want to make one or two quick <br>
changes to a disk. (The program may query the user when
certain errors are encountered, though.) The program&rsquo;s
name is based on sfdisk, but the user options of the two
programs <br>
are entirely different from one another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, sgdisk operates on
disk device files, such as /dev/sda or /dev/hda under Linux,
/dev/disk0 under Mac OS X, or /dev/ad0 or /dev/da0 under
FreeBSD. The program can also <br>
operate on disk image files, which can be either copies of
whole disks (made with dd, for instance) or raw disk images
used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that only
<br>
raw disk images are supported; sgdisk cannot work on
compressed or other advanced disk image formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MBR partitioning system uses
a combination of cylinder/head/sector (CHS) addressing and
logical block addressing (LBA). The former is klunky and
limiting. GPT drops CHS <br>
addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode exclusively. Thus, GPT
data structures, and therefore sgdisk, do not need to deal
with CHS geometries and all the problems they create.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, you should use
an OS-specific partition table program whenever possible.
For example, you should make Mac OS X partitions with the
Mac OS X Disk Utility program <br>
and Linux partitions with the Linux gdisk, sgdisk, or GNU
Parted programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon start, sgdisk attempts to
identify the partition type in use on the disk. If it finds
valid GPT data, sgdisk will use it. If sgdisk finds a valid
MBR or BSD disklabel but no <br>
GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR or disklabel
into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have unusable
first and/or final partitions because they overlap with the
<br>
GPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can identify, but
not use data in, Apple Partition Map (APM) disks, which are
used on 680x0- and PowerPC-based Macintoshes. If you specify
<br>
any option that results in changes to an MBR or BSD
disklabel, sgdisk ignores those changes unless the -g
(--mbrtogpt), -z (--zap), or -Z (--zap-all) option is used.
If you use <br>
the -g option, sgdisk replaces the MBR or disklabel with a
GPT. This action is potentially dangerous! Your system may
become unbootable, and partition type codes may become
cor&acirc; <br>
rupted if the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot
problems are particularly likely if you&rsquo;re
multi-booting with any GPT-unaware OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MBR-to-GPT conversion will
leave at least one gap in the partition numbering if the
original MBR used logical partitions. These gaps are
harmless, but you can eliminate them <br>
by using the -s (--sort) option, if you like. (Doing this
may require you to update your /etc/fstab file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating a fresh partition
table, certain considerations may be in order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For data (non-boot) disks, and
for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the
boot loader, partitions may be created in whatever order and
in whatever sizes <br>
are desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Boot disks for EFI-based
systems require an EFI System Partition (sgdisk internal
code 0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32. The recommended size of
this partition is between 100 <br>
and 300 MiB. Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that
GNU Parted identifies such partitions as having the
&quot;boot flag&quot; set.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some boot loaders for
BIOS-based systems make use of a BIOS Boot Partition (sgdisk
internal code 0xEF02), in which the secondary boot loader is
stored, possibly without <br>
the benefit of a filesystem. This partition can typically be
quite small (roughly 32 to 200 KiB), but you should consult
your boot loader documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If Windows is to boot from a
GPT disk, a partition of type Microsoft Reserved (sgdisk
internal code 0x0C01) is recommended. This partition should
be about 128 MiB in size. <br>
It ordinarily follows the EFI System Partition and
immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that
GNU Parted creates all FAT partitions as this type, which
<br>
actually makes the partition unusable for normal file
storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some OSes&rsquo; GPT utilities
create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after each
partition. The intent is to enable future disk utilities to
use this space. Such free space <br>
is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help in
future disk maintenance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Some options take no arguments, others take one argument
(typically a partition number), and others take compound
arguments with colon delimitation. For instance, -n (--new)
<br>
takes a partition number, a starting sector number, and an
ending sector number, as in sgdisk -n 2:2000:50000 /dev/sdc,
which creates a new partition, numbered 2, starting at <br>
sector 2000 an ending at sector 50,000, on /dev/sdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrelated options may be
combined; however, some such combinations will be nonsense
(such as deleting a partition and then changing its GUID
type code). sgdisk interprets <br>
options in the order in which they&rsquo;re entered, so
effects can vary depending on order. For instance, sgdisk -s
-d 2 sorts the partition table entries and then deletes
partition 2 <br>
from the newly-sorted list; but sgdisk -d 2 -s deletes the
original partition 2 and then sorts the modified partition
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error checking and opportunities
to correct mistakes in sgdisk are minimal. Although the
program endeavors to keep the GPT data structures legal, it
does not prompt for verifica&acirc; <br>
tion before performing its actions. Unless you require a
command-line-driven program, you should use the interactive
gdisk instead of sgdisk, since gdisk allows you to quit
with&acirc; <br>
out saving your changes, should you make a mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although sgdisk is based on the
same partition-manipulation code as gdisk, sgdisk implements
fewer features than its interactive sibling. Options
available in sgdisk are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --set-alignment=value <br>
Set the sector alignment multiple. GPT fdisk aligns the
start of partitions to sectors that are multiples of this
value, which defaults to 2048 on freshly formatted disks.
<br>
This alignment value is necessary to obtain optimum
performance with Western Digital Advanced Format and similar
drives with larger physical than logical sector sizes, <br>
with some types of RAID arrays, and with SSD devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A,
--attributes=list|[partnum:show|or|nand|xor|=|set|clear|toggle|get[:bitnum|hexbitmask]]
<br>
View or set partition attributes. Use list to see defined
(known) attribute values. Omit the partition number (and
even the device filename) when using this option. The <br>
others require a partition number. The show and get options
show the current attribute settings (all attributes or for a
particular bit, respectively). The or, nand, xor, <br>
=, set, clear, and toggle options enable you to change the
attribute bit value. The set, clear, toggle, and get options
work on a bit number; the others work on a hexadec&acirc;
<br>
imal bit mask. For example, type sgdisk -A 4:set:2 /dev/sdc
to set the bit 2 attribute (legacy BIOS bootable) on
partition 4 on /dev/sdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --backup=file <br>
Save partition data to a backup file. You can back up your
current in-memory partition table to a disk file using this
option. The resulting file is a binary file consist&acirc;
<br>
ing of the protective MBR, the main GPT header, the backup
GPT header, and one copy of the partition table, in that
order. Note that the backup is of the current in-memory <br>
data structures, so if you launch the program, make changes,
and then use this option, the backup will reflect your
changes. If the GPT data structures are damaged, the <br>
backup may not accurately reflect the damaged state;
instead, they will reflect GPT fdisk&rsquo;s first-pass
interpretation of the GPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --change-name=partnum:name
<br>
Change the GPT name of a partition. This name is encoded as
a UTF-16 string, but proper entry and display of anything
beyond basic ASCII values requires suitable locale <br>
and font support. For the most part, Linux ignores the
partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. GPT
fdisk sets a default name based on the partition type <br>
code. If you want to set a name that includes a space,
enclose it in quotation marks, as in sgdisk -c
1:&quot;Sample Name&quot; /dev/sdb. Note that the GPT name
of a partition is <br>
distinct from the filesystem name, which is encoded in the
filesystem&rsquo;s data structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --recompute-chs <br>
Recompute CHS values in protective or hybrid MBR. This
option can sometimes help if a disk utility, OS, or BIOS
doesn&rsquo;t like the CHS values used by the partitions in
the <br>
protective or hybrid MBR. In particular, the GPT
specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for over-8GiB
partitions, but this value is technically illegal by the
<br>
usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they encounter this
value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS value --
0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, enabling these <br>
BIOSes to boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --delete=partnum <br>
Delete a partition. This action deletes the entry from the
partition table but does not disturb the data within the
sectors originally allocated to the partition on the <br>
disk. If a corresponding hybrid MBR partition exists, gdisk
deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent 0xEE (EFI GPT)
MBR protective partition to fill the new free <br>
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --display-alignment <br>
Display current sector alignment value. Partitions will be
created on multiples of the sector value reported by this
option. You can change the alignment value with the -a <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e, --move-second-header <br>
Move backup GPT data structures to the end of the disk. Use
this option if you&rsquo;ve added disks to a RAID array,
thus creating a virtual disk with space that follows the
<br>
backup GPT data structures. This command moves the backup
GPT data structures to the end of the disk, where they
belong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --end-of-largest <br>
Displays the sector number of the end of the largest
available block of sectors on the disk. A script may store
this value and pass it back as part of -n&rsquo;s option to
cre&acirc; <br>
ate a partition. If no unallocated sectors are available,
this function returns the value 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --first-in-largest <br>
Displays the sector number of the start of the largest
available block of sectors on the disk. A script may store
this value and pass it back as part of -n&rsquo;s option to
<br>
create a partition. If no unallocated sectors are available,
this function returns the value 0. Note that this parameter
is blind to partition alignment; when you actually <br>
create a partition, its start point might be changed from
this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --first-aligned-in-largest
<br>
Similar to -f (--first-in-largest), except returns the
sector number with the current alignment correction applied.
Use this function if you need to compute the actual <br>
partition start point rather than a theoretical start point
or the actual start point if you set the alignment value to
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --mbrtogpt <br>
Convert an MBR or BSD disklabel disk to a GPT disk. As a
safety measure, use of this option is required on MBR or BSD
disklabel disks if you intend to save your changes, <br>
in order to prevent accidentally damaging such disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --randomize-guids <br>
Randomize the disk&rsquo;s GUID and all partitions&rsquo;
unique GUIDs (but not their partition type code GUIDs). This
function may be used after cloning a disk in order to render
all <br>
GUIDs once again unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --hybrid <br>
Create a hybrid MBR. This option takes from one to three
partition numbers, separated by colons, as arguments. The
created hybrid MBR places an EFI GPT (type 0xEE)
parti&acirc; <br>
tion first in the table, followed by the partition(s) you
specify. Their type codes are based on the GPT fdisk type
codes divided by 0x0100, which is usually correct for <br>
Windows partitions. If the active/bootable flag should be
set, you must do so in another program, such as fdisk. The
gdisk program offers additional hybrid MBR creation <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info=partnum <br>
Show detailed partition information. The summary information
produced by the -p command necessarily omits many details,
such as the partition&rsquo;s unique GUID and the
trans&acirc; <br>
lation of sgdisk&rsquo;s internal partition type code to a
plain type name. The -i option displays this information for
a single partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --load-backup=file <br>
Load partition data from a backup file. This option is the
reverse of the -b option. Note that restoring partition data
from anything but the original disk is not recom&acirc; <br>
mended. This option will work even if the disk&rsquo;s
original partition table is bad; however, most other options
on the same command line will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --list-types <br>
Display a summary of partition types. GPT uses a GUID to
identify partition types for particular OSes and purposes.
For ease of data entry, sgdisk compresses these into <br>
two-byte (four-digit hexadecimal) values that are related to
their equivalent MBR codes. Specifically, the MBR code is
multiplied by hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the <br>
code for Linux swap space in MBR is 0x82, and it&rsquo;s
0x8200 in gdisk. A one-to-one correspondence is impossible,
though. Most notably, the codes for all varieties of FAT and
<br>
NTFS partition correspond to a single GPT code (entered as
0x0700 in sgdisk). Some OSes use a single MBR code but
employ many more codes in GPT. For these, sgdisk adds <br>
code numbers sequentially, such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD
disklabel, 0xa501 for FreeBSD boot, 0xa502 for FreeBSD swap,
and so on. Note that these two-byte codes are unique <br>
to gdisk and sgdisk. This option does not require you to
specify a valid disk device filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --gpttombr <br>
Convert disk from GPT to MBR form. This option takes from
one to four partition numbers, separated by colons, as
arguments. Their type codes are based on the GPT fdisk <br>
type codes divided by 0x0100. If the active/bootable flag
should be set, you must do so in another program, such as
fdisk. The gdisk program offers additional MBR conver&acirc;
<br>
sion options. It is not possible to convert more than four
partitions from GPT to MBR form or to convert partitions
that start above the 2TiB mark or that are larger than <br>
2TiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --new=partnum:start:end <br>
Create a new partition. You enter a partition number,
starting sector, and an ending sector. Both start and end
sectors can be specified in absolute terms as sector
num&acirc; <br>
bers or as positions measured in kibibytes (K), mebibytes
(M), gibibytes (G), tebibytes (T), or pebibytes (P); for
instance, 40M specifies a position 40MiB from the start <br>
of the disk. You can specify locations relative to the start
or end of the specified default range by preceding the
number by a &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo; symbol, as in
+2G to specify a <br>
point 2GiB after the default start sector, or -200M to
specify a point 200MiB before the last available sector. A
start or end value of 0 specifies the default value, <br>
which is the start of the largest available block for the
start sector and the end of the same block for the end
sector. A partnum value of 0 causes the program to use the
<br>
first available partition number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --largest-new=num <br>
Create a new partition that fills the largest available
block of space on the disk. Note that if used on a
completely blank disk, this is likely to result in a sector-
<br>
moved warning, since the first available sector (normally
34) doesn&rsquo;t fall on a 2048-sector boundary (the
default for alignment). You can use the -a (--set-alignment)
<br>
option to adjust the alignment, if desired. A num value of 0
causes the program to use the first available partition
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --clear <br>
Clear out all partition data. This includes GPT header data,
all partition definitions, and the protective MBR. Note that
this operation will, like most other operations, <br>
fail on a damaged disk. If you want to prepare a disk you
know to be damaged for GPT use, you should first wipe it
with -Z and then partition it normally. This option will
<br>
work even if the disk&rsquo;s original partition table is
bad; however, most other options on the same command line
will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --print <br>
Display basic partition summary data. This includes
partition numbers, starting and ending sector numbers,
partition sizes, sgdisk&rsquo;s partition types codes, and
partition <br>
names. For additional information, use the -i (--info)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pretend <br>
Pretend to make specified changes. In-memory GPT data
structures are altered according to other parameters, but
changes are not written to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --transpose <br>
Swap two partitions&rsquo; entries in the partition table.
One or both partitions may be empty, although swapping two
empty partitions is pointless. For instance, if partitions
<br>
1-4 are defined, transposing 1 and 5 results in a table with
partitions numbered from 2-5. Transposing partitions in this
way has no effect on their disk space allocation; <br>
it only alters their order in the partition table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R,
--replicate=second_device_filename <br>
Replicate the main device&rsquo;s partition table on the
specified second device. Note that the replicated partition
table is an exact copy, including all GUIDs; if the device
<br>
should have its own unique GUIDs, you should use the -G
option on the new disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sort <br>
Sort partition entries. GPT partition numbers need not match
the order of partitions on the disk. If you want them to
match, you can use this option. Note that some par&acirc;
<br>
titioning utilities sort partitions whenever they make
changes. Such changes will be reflected in your device
filenames, so you may need to edit /etc/fstab if you use
this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t,
--typecode=partnum:{hexcode|GUID} <br>
Change a single partition&rsquo;s type code. You enter the
type code using either a two-byte hexadecimal number, as
described earlier, or a fully-specified GUID value, such as
<br>
EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --transform-bsd=partnum <br>
Transform BSD partitions into GPT partitions. This option
works on BSD disklabels held within GPT (or converted MBR)
partitions. Converted partitions&rsquo; type codes are <br>
likely to need manual adjustment. sgdisk will attempt to
convert BSD disklabels stored on the main disk when
launched, but this conversion is likely to produce first
<br>
and/or last partitions that are unusable. The many BSD
variants means that the probability of sgdisk being unable
to convert a BSD disklabel is high compared to the
like&acirc; <br>
lihood of problems with an MBR conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u,
--partition-guid=partnum:guid <br>
Set the partition unique GUID for an individual partition.
The GUID may be a complete GUID or &rsquo;R&rsquo; to set a
random GUID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --disk-guid=guid <br>
Set the GUID for the disk. The GUID may be a complete GUID
or &rsquo;R&rsquo; to set a random GUID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Print a brief summary of available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verify <br>
Verify disk. This option checks for a variety of problems,
such as incorrect CRCs and mismatched main and backup data.
This option does not automatically correct most <br>
problems, though; for that, you must use options on the
recovery &amp; transformation menu. If no problems are
found, this command displays a summary of unallocated disk
<br>
space. This option will work even if the disk&rsquo;s
original partition table is bad; however, most other options
on the same command line will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display program version information. This option may be used
without specifying a device filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --zap <br>
Zap (destroy) the GPT data structures and then exit. Use
this option if you want to repartition a GPT disk using
fdisk or some other GPT-unaware program. This option <br>
destroys only the GPT data structures; it leaves the MBR
intact. This makes it useful for wiping out GPT data
structures after a disk has been repartitioned for MBR using
<br>
a GPT-unaware utility; however, there&rsquo;s a risk that it
will damage boot loaders or even the start of the first or
end of the last MBR partition. If you use it on a valid <br>
GPT disk, the MBR will be left with an inappropriate EFI GPT
(0xEE) partition definition, which you can delete using
another utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --zap-all <br>
Zap (destroy) the GPT and MBR data structures and then exit.
This option works much like -z, but as it wipes the MBR as
well as the GPT, it&rsquo;s more suitable if you want to
<br>
repartition a disk after using this option, and completely
unsuitable if you&rsquo;ve already repartitioned the
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Print a summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
sgdisk returns various values depending on its success or
failure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Normal program execution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Too few arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 An error occurred while
reading the partition table</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Non-GPT disk detected and no
-g option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 An error prevented saving
changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 An error occurred while
reading standard input (should never occur with sgdisk, but
may with gdisk)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 Disk replication operation
(-R) failed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As of January 2013 (version 0.8.6), sgdisk should be
considered beta software. Known bugs and limitations
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program compiles correctly
only on Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. Linux versions for
x86-64 (64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have
been tested, with the <br>
x86-64 version having seen the most testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The FreeBSD version of the
program can&rsquo;t write changes to the partition table to
a disk when existing partitions on that disk are mounted.
(The same problem exists with <br>
many other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.)
This limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The fields used to display the
start and end sector numbers for partitions in the -p option
are 14 characters wide. This translates to a limitation of
about 45 PiB. On <br>
larger disks, the displayed columns will go out of
alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program can load only up
to 128 partitions (4 primary partitions and 124 logical
partitions) when converting from MBR format. This limit can
be raised by changing the <br>
#define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in the basicmbr.h source code
file and recompiling; however, such a change will require
using a larger-than-normal partition table. (The limit <br>
of 128 partitions was chosen because that number equals the
128 partitions supported by the most common partition table
size.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Converting from MBR format
sometimes fails because of insufficient space at the start
or (more commonly) the end of the disk. Resizing the
partition table (using the &rsquo;s&rsquo; <br>
option in the experts&rsquo; menu) can sometimes overcome
this problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary
to resize a partition using GNU Parted or a similar tool
<br>
prior to conversion with gdisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* MBR conversions work only if
the disk has correct LBA partition descriptors. These
descriptors should be present on any disk over 8 GiB in size
or on smaller disks parti&acirc; <br>
tioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* BSD disklabel support can
create first and/or last partitions that overlap with the
GPT data structures. This can sometimes be compensated by
adjusting the partition table <br>
size, but in extreme cases the affected partition(s) may
need to be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Because of the highly variable
nature of BSD disklabel structures, conversions from this
form may be unreliable -- partitions may be dropped,
converted in a way that cre&acirc; <br>
ates overlaps with other partitions, or converted with
incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with
caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Booting after converting an
MBR or BSD disklabel disk is likely to be disrupted.
Sometimes re-installing a boot loader will fix the problem,
but other times you may need <br>
to switch boot loaders. Except on EFI-based platforms,
Windows through at least Windows 7 RC doesn&rsquo;t support
booting from GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the
&rsquo;h&rsquo; <br>
option on the recovery &amp; transformation menu) or
abandoning GPT in favor of MBR may be your only options in
this case.</p>
