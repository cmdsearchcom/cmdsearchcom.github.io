<b>Ifmail</b> converts RFC-822 compliant mail and RFC-1036 compliant news to FTN
  packets. It must run setuid owner of fidonet related stuff. The current packet
  naming is BinkleyTerm, with file/directory names in lowcase. Naming
  conventions are implemented in a separate source file, pktname.c, to make
  modifications easier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default mode is the mail mode of operation. In mail mode, you must specify
  recepient address(es) on the command line, in the form:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;Eugene.Crosser@p14.f6.n5020.z2.fidonet.org&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first recepient address is used as the routing address, if no routing
  address is specified. In news mode then the $NEWSSITE environment variable is
  used as the routing address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the news mode is in effect, (i.e. &quot;-n&quot; key is specified or the
  program is called by alias &quot;ifnews&quot;) a news article (or batch) is
  expected on stdin.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Ifmail</b> will try to preserve as much information as possible in
  &quot;X-FTN-...&quot; headers and &quot;^ARFC-...&quot; kludges, and restore
  messages more or less accurately to their original form when
  double-gatewaying.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A dbm-based alias database is supported, so if a message passes from a newsgroup
  to an echo, the author's free form name and domain address are stored, and
  when a netmail reply comes from fidonet to that free form name, it is passed
  as a mail message to the remembered domain address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ATTENTION:</b> This mechanism will not work if you specify fidonet-style
  address as the &quot;visible name&quot; in your MTA. However you can edit
  /etc/aliases to add lines of the pattern: <b>John.Smith:	jsmith</b> Or you can
  set GECOS matching in sendmail.cf (OGTrue)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several addresses may be specified in the config file, netmail from fidonet
  addressed to any of those addresses is assumed local and resolved through the
  aforementioned database, otherwise the mail will be routed through the normal
  MTA (and presumably packed to some other fidonet node). If there is a
  &quot;To:&quot; line at the beginning of the fido message, the address is
  taken from it <b>(ONLY THE FIRST ADDRESS!).</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When an RFC message is split, unique MSGIDs are generated for all parts after
  the first one. In any case, the original &quot;Message-ID:&quot; header is
  preserved in the &quot;^ARFC-Message-ID:&quot; kludge and used if the message
  comes back to usenet on some (other) gateway.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On the way from news to echo, if the node to which the packet is being created
  is present in an &quot;X-FTN-SEEN-BY:&quot; header, the message is not
  included in the packet. SEEN-BY lines in the messages included into the packet
  consist of (1) your node primary address, (2) copy of
  &quot;X-FTN-SEEN-BY:&quot; header(s), (3) ftn addresses that could be parsed
  from the CNews file &quot;$NEWSCTL/log&quot; in the line with the
  corresponding Message-ID. For the latter to work, you should have a Cnews
  compatible log file available for reading and have an &quot;ndbm&quot;
  package. This works with INN too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ATTENTION:</b> your feed name in the cnews &quot;sys&quot; file should be
  fNNN.nMMM or pNNN.fMMM.nLLL, without zone and domain, see the examples
  included with the source distribution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In some cases, though, you will need to specify zone and/or domain of the feed,
  e.g. if you are exporting echomail to several networks. In such case, specify
  the &quot;cutdown&quot; fNNN.nMMM notation after the slash, to prevent
  exporting back (Refer the your news systems manual). This trick may also be
  useful if your hub presents non-primary AKA in the echomail it gives you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Ifmail</b> does make some attempt to process file attaches, but only locally.
  Not passing to the Internet and back, but if a fileattach netmail message is
  routed from one fidonet node to another, it probably will take the attached
  file with it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also a feature to define &quot;forbidden&quot; groups. If a usenet
  message is crossposted to some of the gated groups _and_ to some of the
  forbidden groups it will not be passed to any fidonet echoes. Messages with
  &quot;Control:&quot; headers are also not passed to FidoNet.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-h</b> 	Display a short help message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x verbosity</b> 	Set the debug verbosity <b>verbosity</b> may be a number
  from 0 to 32 to set 'on' bits from 1 to number, or a string of letters where
  'a' = bit 1, 'b' = bit 2, etc. up to bit 26.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-N</b> 	Put resultant packets to /tmp/ifmail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-I File</b> 	Use the alternate configuration file <b>File.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-n</b> 	Set news mode for processing RFC-1036 Usenet news rather than RFC-822
  electronic mail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-s</b> 	Set secure mode: this enables ifmail to check the nodelist before
  gating the message from RFC-822 electronic mail to FTN-style netmail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-r Address</b> 	Route packets to the Fidonet address <b>Address.</b>
  <b>Address</b> should be in the format
  &quot;[pNN.]fNN.nNN[.zNN[.domain]]&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-g Grade</b> 	Set the type of Fidonet packet to create. Where <b>Grade</b> is
  one of:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	N = Normal (Default)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	C = Crash
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	H = Hold
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-c Charset</b> 	Forces the use of the given <b>Charset,</b> it is useful when
  you know that a given link can only handle one charset for its incoming mail.
  This switch override all the charset handling done internally. It needs
  <b>-DDIRTY_CHRS</b> at compile time to be active.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-l Level</b> 	Sets the <b>Level</b> for ^aRFC- kludges. If not set 1 is the
  default. it determines the amount of info from rfc headers that is kept when
  gating.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	-1: really nothing is gated, not recommended at all !
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	0: only intended for points or end-leaf nodes that have only an FTN link
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	1: normal level inteded for normal gateways and nodes (points)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	2: keeps almost everything, including lots of non relevant headers.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	3: hey! same as 2 but in plain text, no ^aRFC- kludge is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I recommend you to leave the default value of 1 if you don't <b>really</b> know
  what you are doing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-b</b> 	Don't split the messages when writting to PKT. Use this option only
  if you know your partner uses a tosser that can handle messages of arbitrary
  size (or at least 64KB big). Note that strict compliance to <b>fidonet</b>
  standards imply handling messages of arbitrary size.
