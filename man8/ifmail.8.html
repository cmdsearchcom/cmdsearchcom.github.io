ifmail - Convert RFC-822 and RFC-1036 mail/news to FTN
Fidonet packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifnews - Convert RFC-1036 Usenet
news to FTN Fidonet packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synopsis <br>
ifmail [-h] [-x verbosity] [-I file] [-n] [-r Address] [-g
grade] receipent ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifnews [-h] [-x verbosity] [-I
file] [-r Address] [-g grade] [receipent]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
Ifmail converts RFC-822 compliant mail and RFC-1036
compliant news to FTN packets. It must run setuid owner of
fidonet related stuff. The current packet naming is
BinkleyTerm, <br>
with file/directory names in lowcase. Naming conventions are
implemented in a separate source file, pktname.c, to make
modifications easier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default mode is the mail
mode of operation. In mail mode, you must specify recepient
address(es) on the command line, in the form: <br>
&quot;Eugene.Crosser@p14.f6.n5020.z2.fidonet.org&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first recepient address is
used as the routing address, if no routing address is
specified. In news mode then the $NEWSSITE environment
variable is used as the routing <br>
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the news mode is in effect,
(i.e. &quot;-n&quot; key is specified or the program is
called by alias &quot;ifnews&quot;) a news article (or
batch) is expected on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifmail will try to preserve as
much information as possible in &quot;X-FTN-...&quot;
headers and &quot;^ARFC-...&quot; kludges, and restore
messages more or less accurately to their original form <br>
when double-gatewaying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A dbm-based alias database is
supported, so if a message passes from a newsgroup to an
echo, the author&rsquo;s free form name and domain address
are stored, and when a netmail reply <br>
comes from fidonet to that free form name, it is passed as a
mail message to the remembered domain address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTENTION: This mechanism will
not work if you specify fidonet-style address as the
&quot;visible name&quot; in your MTA. However you can edit
/etc/aliases to add lines of the pattern: <br>
John.Smith: jsmith Or you can set GECOS matching in
sendmail.cf (OGTrue)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several addresses may be
specified in the config file, netmail from fidonet addressed
to any of those addresses is assumed local and resolved
through the aforementioned database, <br>
otherwise the mail will be routed through the normal MTA
(and presumably packed to some other fidonet node). If there
is a &quot;To:&quot; line at the beginning of the fido
message, the <br>
address is taken from it (ONLY THE FIRST ADDRESS!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an RFC message is split,
unique MSGIDs are generated for all parts after the first
one. In any case, the original &quot;Message-ID:&quot;
header is preserved in the &quot;^ARFC-Message- <br>
ID:&quot; kludge and used if the message comes back to
usenet on some (other) gateway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the way from news to echo, if
the node to which the packet is being created is present in
an &quot;X-FTN-SEEN-BY:&quot; header, the message is not
included in the packet. SEEN-BY lines <br>
in the messages included into the packet consist of (1) your
node primary address, (2) copy of &quot;X-FTN-SEEN-BY:&quot;
header(s), (3) ftn addresses that could be parsed from the
CNews <br>
file &quot;$NEWSCTL/log&quot; in the line with the
corresponding Message-ID. For the latter to work, you should
have a Cnews compatible log file available for reading and
have an &quot;ndbm&quot; <br>
package. This works with INN too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTENTION: your feed name in the
cnews &quot;sys&quot; file should be fNNN.nMMM or
pNNN.fMMM.nLLL, without zone and domain, see the examples
included with the source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, though, you will
need to specify zone and/or domain of the feed, e.g. if you
are exporting echomail to several networks. In such case,
specify the &quot;cutdown&quot; <br>
fNNN.nMMM notation after the slash, to prevent exporting
back (Refer the your news systems manual). This trick may
also be useful if your hub presents non-primary AKA in the
<br>
echomail it gives you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ifmail does make some attempt to
process file attaches, but only locally. Not passing to the
Internet and back, but if a fileattach netmail message is
routed from one fidonet <br>
node to another, it probably will take the attached file
with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a feature to
define &quot;forbidden&quot; groups. If a usenet message is
crossposted to some of the gated groups _and_ to some of the
forbidden groups it will not be passed <br>
to any fidonet echoes. Messages with &quot;Control:&quot;
headers are also not passed to FidoNet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display a short help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x verbosity Set the debug
verbosity verbosity may be a number from 0 to 32 to set
&rsquo;on&rsquo; bits from 1 to number, or a string of
letters where &rsquo;a&rsquo; = bit 1, &rsquo;b&rsquo; = bit
2, etc. up <br>
to bit 26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Put resultant packets to
/tmp/ifmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I File Use the alternate
configuration file File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Set news mode for processing
RFC-1036 Usenet news rather than RFC-822 electronic
mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Set secure mode: this enables
ifmail to check the nodelist before gating the message from
RFC-822 electronic mail to FTN-style netmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Address Route packets to the
Fidonet address Address. Address should be in the format
&quot;[pNN.]fNN.nNN[.zNN[.domain]]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Grade Set the type of Fidonet
packet to create. Where Grade is one of: <br>
N = Normal (Default) <br>
C = Crash <br>
H = Hold</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Charset Forces the use of the
given Charset, it is useful when you know that a given link
can only handle one charset for its incoming mail. This
switch override all the <br>
charset handling done internally. It needs -DDIRTY_CHRS at
compile time to be active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Level Sets the Level for
^aRFC- kludges. If not set 1 is the default. it determines
the amount of info from rfc headers that is kept when
gating. <br>
-1: really nothing is gated, not recommended at all ! <br>
0: only intended for points or end-leaf nodes that have only
an FTN link <br>
1: normal level inteded for normal gateways and nodes
(points) <br>
2: keeps almost everything, including lots of non relevant
headers. <br>
3: hey! same as 2 but in plain text, no ^aRFC- kludge is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I recommend you to leave the
default value of 1 if you don&rsquo;t really know what you
are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Don&rsquo;t split the
messages when writting to PKT. Use this option only if you
know your partner uses a tosser that can handle messages of
arbitrary size (or at least 64KB <br>
big). Note that strict compliance to fidonet standards imply
handling messages of arbitrary size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$IFLIBDIR/config Runtime configuration file.</p>
