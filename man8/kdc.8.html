<p>KDC(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual KDC(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kdc &acirc; Kerberos 5 server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kdc [-c file | --config-file=file] [-p |
--no-require-preauth] [--max-request=size] [-H |
--enable-http] [-r string | --v4-realm=string] [-P portspec
| --ports=portspec] [--detach] <br>
[--disable-des] [--addresses=list of addresses]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
kdc serves requests for tickets. When it starts, it first
checks the flags passed, any options that are not specified
with a command line flag are taken from a config file, or
<br>
from a default compiled-in value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file, --config-file=file <br>
Specifies the location of the config file, the default is
/etc/heimdal-kdc/kdc.conf. This is the only value that
can&rsquo;t be specified in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --no-require-preauth <br>
Turn off the requirement for pre-autentication in the
initial AS-REQ for all principals. The use of
pre-authentication makes it more difficult to do offline
password <br>
attacks. You might want to turn it off if you have clients
that don&rsquo;t support pre-authentication. Since the
version 4 protocol doesn&rsquo;t support any
pre-authentication, <br>
serving version 4 clients is just about the same as not
requiring pre-athentication. The default is to require
pre-authentication. Adding the require-preauth per
princi&acirc; <br>
pal is a more flexible way of handling this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-request=size <br>
Gives an upper limit on the size of the requests that the
kdc is willing to handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --enable-http <br>
Makes the kdc listen on port 80 and handle requests
encapsulated in HTTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r string, --v4-realm=string
<br>
What realm this server should act as when dealing with
version 4 requests. The database can contain any number of
realms, but since the version 4 protocol doesn&rsquo;t
contain <br>
a realm for the server, it must be explicitly specified. The
default is whatever is returned by krb_get_lrealm(). This
option is only available if the KDC has been com&acirc; <br>
piled with version 4 support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P portspec, --ports=portspec
<br>
Specifies the set of ports the KDC should listen on. It is
given as a white-space separated list of services or port
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--addresses=list of addresses
<br>
The list of addresses to listen for requests on. By default,
the kdc will listen on all the locally configured addresses.
If only a subset is desired, or the automatic <br>
detection fails, this option might be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach <br>
detach from pty and run as a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-des <br>
disable all des encryption types, makes the kdc not use
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All activities are logged to one
or more destinations, see krb5.conf(5), and krb5_openlog(3).
The entity used for logging is kdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file has the same syntax as krb5.conf(5),
but will be read before /etc/krb5.conf, so it may override
settings found there. Options specific to the KDC only are
<br>
found in the &acirc;[kdc]&acirc; section. All the
command-line options can preferably be added in the
configuration file. The only difference is the
pre-authentication flag, which has to be <br>
specified as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require-preauth = no</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(in fact you can specify the
option as --require-preauth=no).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And there are some configuration
options which do not have command-line equivalents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable-digest = boolean <br>
turn on support for digest processing in the KDC. The
default is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check-ticket-addresses = boolean
<br>
Check the addresses in the ticket when processing TGS
requests. The default is TRUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-null-ticket-addresses =
boolean <br>
Permit tickets with no addresses. This option is only
relevant when check-ticket-addresses is TRUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-anonymous = boolean <br>
Permit anonymous tickets with no addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-kdc-datagram-reply-length =
number <br>
Maximum packet size the UDP rely that the KDC will transmit,
instead the KDC sends back a reply telling the client to use
TCP instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transited-policy = always-check
| allow-per-principal | always-honour-request <br>
This controls how KDC requests with the
disable-transited-check flag are handled. It can be one
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always-check <br>
Always check transited encoding, this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-per-principal <br>
Currently this is identical to always-check. In a future
release, it will be possible to mark a principal as able to
handle unchecked requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always-honour-request <br>
Always do what the client asked. In a future release, it
will be possible to force a check per principal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encode_as_rep_as_tgs_rep =
boolean <br>
Encode AS-Rep as TGS-Rep to be bug-compatible with old DCE
code. The Heimdal clients allow both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdc_warn_pwexpire = time <br>
How long before password/principal expiration the KDC should
start sending out warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file is only
read when the kdc is started. If changes made to the
configuration file are to take effect, the kdc needs to be
restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of a config file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[kdc] <br>
require-preauth = no <br>
v4-realm = FOO.SE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If the machine running the KDC has new addresses added to
it, the KDC will have to be restarted to listen to them. The
reason it doesn&rsquo;t just listen to wildcarded (like <br>
INADDR_ANY) addresses, is that the replies has to come from
the same address they were sent to, and most OS:es
doesn&rsquo;t pass this information to the application. If
your normal <br>
mode of operation require that you add and remove addresses,
the best option is probably to listen to a wildcarded TCP
socket, and make sure your clients use TCP to connect. For
<br>
instance, this will listen to IPv4 TCP port 88 only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdc --addresses=0.0.0.0
--ports=&quot;88/tcp&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There should be a way to specify
protocol, port, and address triplets, not just addresses and
protocol, port tuples.</p>
