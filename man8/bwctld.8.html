<p>bwctld(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual bwctld(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bwctld - Bandwidth Control server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bwctld [ -a auth_mode ] [ -c conf_dir ] [ -e facility ] [ -f
] [ -G group ] [ -h ] [ -R var_dir ] [ -S nodename:port ] [
-U user ] [ -v ] [ -Z ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bwctld is a server program designed to schedule and run
Iperf, Thrulay or Nuttcp, Ping, Traceroute, Tracepath, and
Owamp tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aside from actually running
network measurement tests, the main function of bwctld is to
determine which tests are allowable based upon the policy
restrictions configured by the <br>
system administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bwctld was designed to be run as
a stand-alone daemon process. It uses the classic
accept/fork model of handling new requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the command line options
for bwctld have analogous options in the bwctld.conf file.
The command line takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a auth_mode <br>
Specify the authentication modes the server is willing to
use for communication. auth_mode should be set as a
character string with any or all of the characters
&quot;AEO&quot;. The <br>
modes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A [A]uthenticated. This mode
encrypts the control connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E [E]ncrypted. This mode
encrypts the control connection. If the test supports
encryption, this mode will additionally encrypt the test
stream. (Encryption of the <br>
test stream is not currently supported, so this mode is
currently identical to authenticated.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O [O]pen. No encryption of any
kind is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server can specify all the
modes with which it is willing to communicate. The most
strict mode that both the server and the client are willing
to use will be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: <br>
&quot;AEO&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c conf_dir <br>
Specify the directory that holds the bwctld configuration
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: <br>
Current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e facility <br>
Syslog facility to which messages are logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: <br>
LOG_DAEMON</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Enables the bwctld daemon to
run with root permissions. There are legitimate reasons to
run bwctld as root, but it is risky. Forcing this additional
option will make it <br>
less likely root permissions are accidently used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G group <br>
Specify the gid for the bwctld process. group can be
specified using a valid group name or by using -gid. This
option is only used if bwctld is started as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R var_dir <br>
Specify the directory to hold the bwctld.pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: <br>
Current directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S nodename:port <br>
Specify the address and port on which bwctld will listen for
requests. nodename can be specified using a DNS name or
using the textual representation of the address. It <br>
is possible to set the source address without setting the
port simply by leaving off the &rsquo;:&rsquo; and port
specification. If an IPv6 address is specified, note that
the <br>
accepted format contains nodename in square brackets, such
as: [fe80::fe9f:62d8]. This ensures the port number is
distinct from the address specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: <br>
nodename is wildcarded as any currently available address.
port is 4823.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U user <br>
Specify the uid for the bwctld process. user can be
specified using a valid user name or by using -uid. This
option is only used if bwctld is started as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Set verbose output. Messages
will only go to syslog unless the -Z option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Run the master bwctld process
in the foreground. In this mode, error messages are printed
to stderr as well as being sent to syslog. Also, normal
terminal controls are <br>
available. (i.e., &lt;Cntr-C&gt; will cause the daemon to
kill it&rsquo;s child processes and exit.) This is useful
for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
The bwctld daemon prefers a reasonably synchronized clock.
It is scheduling tests and needs to be sure it has the same
idea of when a test should take place as does the peer test
<br>
system. Therefore, bwctld attempts to use NTP specific
system calls to determine the accuracy of the local clock.
If those system calls are unavailable, or the administrator
has <br>
set the allow_unsync option in the bwctld.conf file, then
bwctld will blindly accept tests assuming the clock is
synchronized to within the sync_fuzz value that is also
defined <br>
in the bwctld.conf file. If this assumption does not hold
true, then the test will eventually fail. Unfortunately,
because the time offset is not detected early, this test
will <br>
have taken up a schedule slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
bwctld.pid <br>
bwctld.conf <br>
bwctld.limits <br>
bwctld.keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
There are more details on configuring the bwctld daemon in
the bwctld.conf(5) manual page. Details on configuring the
policy is in the bwctld.limits(5) and bwctld.keys(5) manual
<br>
pages. Information on the client is in the bwctl(1) manual
page. For more of an overview of the full functionality and
architecture see the http://software.internet2.edu/bwctl/
