<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
winbindd - Name Service Switch daemon for resolving names
from NT servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
winbindd [-D|--daemon] [-F|--foreground] [-S|--stdout]
[-i|--interactive] [-d &lt;debug level&gt;] [-s &lt;smb
config file&gt;] [-n|--no-caching] [--no-process-group]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">winbindd is a daemon that
provides a number of services to the Name Service Switch
capability found in most modern C libraries, to arbitrary
applications via PAM and ntlm_auth <br>
and to Samba itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if winbind is not used for
nsswitch, it still provides a service to smbd, ntlm_auth and
the pam_winbind.so PAM module, by managing connections to
domain controllers. In this <br>
configuration the idmap config * : range parameter is not
required. (This is known as &lsquo;netlogon proxy only
mode&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Name Service Switch allows
user and system information to be obtained from different
databases services such as NIS or DNS. The exact behaviour
can be configured through the <br>
/etc/nsswitch.conf file. Users and groups are allocated as
they are resolved to a range of user and group ids specified
by the administrator of the Samba system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The service provided by winbindd
is called &lsquo;winbind&rsquo; and can be used to resolve
user and group information from a Windows NT server. The
service can also provide authentication <br>
services via an associated PAM module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pam_winbind module supports
the auth, account and password module-types. It should be
noted that the account module simply performs a getpwnam()
to verify that the system can <br>
obtain a uid for the user, as the domain controller has
already performed access control. If the libnss_winbind
library has been correctly installed, or an alternate source
of <br>
names configured, this should always succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following nsswitch databases
are implemented by the winbindd service:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hosts <br>
This feature is only available on IRIX. User information
traditionally stored in the hosts(5) file and used by
gethostbyname(3) functions. Names are resolved through the
WINS <br>
server or by broadcast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passwd <br>
User information traditionally stored in the passwd(5) file
and used by getpwent(3) functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group <br>
Group information traditionally stored in the group(5) file
and used by getgrent(3) functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following
simple configuration in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file can be
used to initially resolve user and group information from
/etc/passwd and /etc/group and <br>
then from the Windows NT server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passwd: files winbind <br>
group: files winbind <br>
## only available on IRIX: use winbind to resolve hosts:
<br>
# hosts: files dns winbind <br>
## All other NSS enabled systems should use libnss_wins.so
like this: <br>
hosts: files dns wins</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following simple
configuration in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file can be used to
initially resolve hostnames from /etc/hosts and then from
the WINS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hosts: files wins</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-D|--daemon <br>
If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as
a daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the
background on the appropriate port. This switch is assumed
<br>
if winbindd is executed on the command line of a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F|--foreground <br>
If specified, this parameter causes the main winbindd
process to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate
with the terminal. Child processes are still created as <br>
normal to service each connection request, but the main
process does not exit. This operation mode is suitable for
running winbindd under process supervisors such as <br>
supervise and svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein&rsquo;s
daemontools package, or the AIX process monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S|--stdout <br>
If specified, this parameter causes winbindd to log to
standard output rather than a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--debuglevel=level <br>
level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
parameter is not specified is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The higher this value, the more
detail will be logged to the log files about the activities
of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious
warnings will be <br>
logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running
- it generates a small amount of information about
operations carried out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Levels above 1 will generate
considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used
when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed
for use only by developers <br>
and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that specifying this
parameter here will override the log level parameter in the
smb.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V|--version <br>
Prints the program version number.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s|--configfile=&lt;configuration
file&gt; <br>
The file specified contains the configuration details
required by the server. The information in this file
includes server-specific information such as what printcap
file to <br>
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at <br>
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
<br>
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
&quot;.progname&quot; will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the
client.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
<br>
Set the smb.conf(5) option &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; to value
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?|--help <br>
Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Display brief usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i|--interactive <br>
Tells winbindd to not become a daemon and detach from the
current terminal. This option is used by developers when
interactive debugging of winbindd is required. winbindd <br>
also logs to standard output, as if the -S parameter had
been given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n|--no-caching <br>
Disable some caching. This means winbindd will often have to
wait for a response from the domain controller before it can
respond to a client and this thus makes things <br>
slower. The results will however be more accurate, since
results from the cache might not be up-to-date. This might
also temporarily hang winbindd if the DC doesn&rsquo;t
respond. <br>
This does not disable the samlogon cache, which is required
for group membership tracking in trusted environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-process-group <br>
Do not create a new process group for winbindd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME AND ID RESOLUTION <br>
Users and groups on a Windows NT server are assigned a
security id (SID) which is globally unique when the user or
group is created. To convert the Windows NT user or group
into <br>
a unix user or group, a mapping between SIDs and unix user
and group ids is required. This is one of the jobs that
winbindd performs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As winbindd users and groups are
resolved from a server, user and group ids are allocated
from a specified range. This is done on a first come, first
served basis, although all <br>
existing users and groups will be mapped as soon as a client
performs a user or group enumeration command. The allocated
unix ids are stored in a database and will be
remembered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: The SID to unix id
database is the only location where the user and group
mappings are stored by winbindd. If this store is deleted or
corrupted, there is no way for <br>
winbindd to determine which user and group ids correspond to
Windows NT user and group rids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Configuration of the winbindd daemon is done through
configuration parameters in the smb.conf(5) file. All
parameters should be specified in the [global] section of
smb.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; winbind
separator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; idmap config * :
range</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; idmap config * :
backend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; winbind cache
time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; winbind enum
users</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; winbind enum
groups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; template
homedir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; template
shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; winbind use
default domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; winbind: rpc
only Setting this parameter forces winbindd to use RPC
instead of LDAP to retrieve information from Domain
Controllers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE SETUP <br>
To setup winbindd for user and group lookups plus
authentication from a domain controller use something like
the following setup. This was tested on an early Red Hat
Linux box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In /etc/nsswitch.conf put the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passwd: files winbind <br>
group: files winbind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In /etc/pam.d/* replace the <br>
auth lines with something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth required
/lib/security/pam_securetty.so <br>
auth required /lib/security/pam_nologin.so <br>
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_winbind.so <br>
auth required /lib/security/pam_unix.so use_first_pass
shadow nullok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The PAM module pam_unix has recently replaced the module
pam_pwdb. Some Linux systems use the module pam_unix2 in
place of pam_unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note in particular the use of
the sufficient keyword and the use_first_pass keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now replace the account lines
with this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account required
/lib/security/pam_winbind.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next step is to join the
domain. To do that use the net program like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">net join -S PDC -U
Administrator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The username after the -U can be
any Domain user that has administrator privileges on the
machine. Substitute the name or IP of your PDC for
&quot;PDC&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next copy libnss_winbind.so to
/lib and pam_winbind.so to /lib/security. A symbolic link
needs to be made from /lib/libnss_winbind.so to
/lib/libnss_winbind.so.2. If you are <br>
using an older version of glibc then the target of the link
should be /lib/libnss_winbind.so.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, setup a smb.conf(5)
containing directives like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[global] <br>
winbind separator = + <br>
winbind cache time = 10 <br>
template shell = /bin/bash <br>
template homedir = /home/%D/%U <br>
idmap config * : range = 10000-20000 <br>
workgroup = DOMAIN <br>
security = domain <br>
password server = *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now start winbindd and you
should find that your user and group database is expanded to
include your NT users and groups, and that you can login to
your unix box as a domain <br>
user, using the DOMAIN+user syntax for the username. You may
wish to use the commands getent passwd and getent group to
confirm the correct operation of winbindd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The following notes are useful when configuring and running
winbindd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmbd(8) must be running on the
local machine for winbindd to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM is really easy to
misconfigure. Make sure you know what you are doing when
modifying PAM configuration files. It is possible to set up
PAM such that you can no longer log <br>
into your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one UNIX machine is
running winbindd, then in general the user and groups ids
allocated by winbindd will not be the same. The user and
group ids will only be valid <br>
for the local machine, unless a shared idmap config * :
backend is configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Windows NT SID to UNIX
user and group id mapping file is damaged or destroyed then
the mappings will be lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The following signals can be used to manipulate the winbindd
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
Reload the smb.conf(5) file and apply any parameter changes
to the running version of winbindd. This signal also clears
any cached user and group information. The list of <br>
other domains trusted by winbindd is also reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
The SIGUSR2 signal will cause winbindd to write status
information to the winbind log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log files are stored in the
filename specified by the log file parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/nsswitch.conf(5) <br>
Name service switch configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/.winbindd/pipe <br>
The UNIX pipe over which clients communicate with the
winbindd program. For security reasons, the winbind client
will only attempt to connect to the winbindd daemon if both
<br>
the /tmp/.winbindd directory and /tmp/.winbindd/pipe file
are owned by root.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LOCKDIR/winbindd_privileged/pipe
<br>
The UNIX pipe over which &rsquo;privileged&rsquo; clients
communicate with the winbindd program. For security reasons,
access to some winbindd functions - like those needed by the
<br>
ntlm_auth utility - is restricted. By default, only users in
the &rsquo;root&rsquo; group will get this access, however
the administrator may change the group permissions on <br>
$LOCKDIR/winbindd_privileged to allow programs like
&rsquo;squid&rsquo; to use ntlm_auth. Note that the winbind
client will only attempt to connect to the winbindd daemon
if both the <br>
$LOCKDIR/winbindd_privileged directory and
$LOCKDIR/winbindd_privileged/pipe file are owned by
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib/libnss_winbind.so.X <br>
Implementation of name service switch library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LOCKDIR/winbindd_idmap.tdb <br>
Storage for the Windows NT rid to UNIX user/group id
mapping. The lock directory is specified when Samba is
initially compiled using the --with-lockdir option. This
directory <br>
is by default /usr/local/samba/var/locks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LOCKDIR/winbindd_cache.tdb <br>
Storage for cached user and group information.</p>
