<p>IIPSRV(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual IIPSRV(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
IIPSRV - IIPImage Image Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
IIPImage is an advanced high-performance feature-rich
multi-protocol image server for web-based streamed viewing
and zooming of ultra high-resolution images. It is designed
to be <br>
fast and bandwidth-efficient with low processor and memory
requirements. The system can comfortably handle gigapixel
size images as well as advanced image features such as 8, 16
<br>
and 32 bit depths, CIELAB colorimetric images and scientific
imagery such as multispectral images. Source images can be
either TIFF (tiled multi-resolution) or JPEG2000 (if <br>
enabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image server can also
dynamically export images in JPEG format and perform basic
image processing, such as contrast adjustment, gamma
control, conversion from color to <br>
greyscale, color twist, region extraction and arbitrary
rescaling. The server can also export spectral point or
profile data from multispectral data and apply color maps or
per&acirc; <br>
form hillshading rendering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Command line use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iipsrv.fcgi --bind host :
port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
iipsrv.fcgi main executable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iipsrv.log log file: usually in
/var/log/ or /tmp/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
There are several parameters that can be supplied to
iipsrv.fcgi These should be set via the appropriate web
server configuration directives if running via Apache or
Lighttpd. <br>
See EXAMPLES for details of web server configuations.
Alternatively these parameters can be set via environment
settings if running directly from the command line or from
spawn- <br>
fcgi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGFILE <br>
The log file the module will (attempt) to write to. If no
value is given, no log will be written. Make sure the server
process has write access to this directory. Paths <br>
with spaces in them may not work correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERBOSITY <br>
The level of logging. 0 means no logging, 1 is minimal
logging, 2 lots of debugging stuff and 3 even more debugging
stuff and 4 a very large amount indeed. Logging is only <br>
enabled if LOGFILE has also been defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG_QUALITY <br>
The default JPEG quality factor for compression when the
client does not specify one. The value should be between 1
(highest level of compression) and 100 (highest image <br>
quality). The default is 75.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAX_IMAGE_CACHE_SIZE <br>
Max image cache size to be held in RAM in MB. This is a
cache of the compressed JPEG image tiles requested by the
client. The default is 5MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILESYSTEM_PREFIX <br>
This is a prefix automatically added by the server to the
beginning of each file system path. This can be useful for
security reasons to limit access to certain sub-direc&acirc;
<br>
tories. For example, with a prefix of
&quot;/home/images/&quot; set on the server, a request by a
client for &quot;image.tif&quot; will point to the path
&quot;/home/images/image.tif&quot;. Any <br>
reverse directory path component such as ../ is also
filtered out. No default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAX_CVT <br>
The maximum permitted image pixel size returned by the CVT
command in conjunction with WID or HEI or RGN. The default
is 5000. This prevents huge requests from overloading <br>
the server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAX_LAYERS <br>
The maximum number of quality layers to decode for image
that support progressive quality encoding, such as JPEG2000.
Ignored for other file formats. By default half of <br>
the available layers are decoded. If set to -1, all the
available layers will be decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WATERMARK <br>
TIFF image to use as watermark file. This image should be
not be bigger the tile size used for TIFF tiling. If bigger,
it will simply be cropped to the tile size. If <br>
smaller, the watermark will be positioned randomly within
the available space. The image can be either colour or
grayscale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WATERMARK_PROBABILITY <br>
The probability that a particilar tile will have a watermark
applied to it. 0 means never, 1 means always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WATERMARK_OPACITY <br>
The opacity (between 0 and 1) applied to the watermark
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMCACHED_SERVERS <br>
A comma-delimitted list of memcached servers with optional
port numbers. For example:
localhost,192.168.0.1:8888,192.168.0.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMCACHED_TIMEOUT <br>
Time in seconds that cache remains fresh. Default is 86400
seconds (24 hours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILENAME_PATTERN <br>
Pattern that follows the name stem for a panoramic image
sequence. eg: &quot;_pyr_&quot; for FZ1_pyr_000_090.tif. In
this example, just supply FZ1 to the FIF command. The
&quot;000&quot; <br>
indicates the vertical angle and &quot;090&quot; the
horizontal. This is only relevant to 3D image sequences. The
default is &quot;_pyr_&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORS Cross Origin Resource
Sharing setting. Disabled by default. Set to &quot;*&quot;
to enable for all domains or specify a single domain. See
http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ for more <br>
details on CORS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASE_URL <br>
Set a base URL for use in certain protocol requests if web
server rewriting has taken place and the public URL is not
the same as that supplied to iipsrv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CACHE_CONTROL <br>
Set the HTTP Cache-Control header. See
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9
for a full list of options. If not set, header defaults to
&quot;max- <br>
age=86400&quot; (24 hours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
iipsrv will be automatically started by both Apache and
Lighttpd. But not by Nginx or Java Application Servers. See
the example configuration in the README or included with
your <br>
distribution for the appropriate syntax. Note that Apache
has two FCGI modules: mod_fastcgi and mod_fcgid which are
configured differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also wish to run iipsrv
as a standalone program. To do this, use the following
syntax to bind to a particular port and listen for FCGI (not
HTTP) requests. In the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing example, iipsrv will bind to port 9000 on the
machine&rsquo;s IP address 192.168.0.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% iipsrv.fcgi --bind
192.168.0.1:9000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is additionally a
--backlog parameter that is optional and sets the socket
backlog value. The backlog value specifies the number of
requests can be queued and, therefore, <br>
increases the number of concurrent connections that iipsrv
can handle and is set to 2048 by default. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% iipsrv.fcgi --bind
192.168.0.1:9000 --backlog 1024</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the backlog parameter
must be specified after the bind parameter and argument.
Note also that this value may be limited by the operating
system. On Linux kernels &lt; <br>
2.4.25 and Mac OS X, the backlog limit is hard-coded to 128,
so any value above this will be limited to 128 by the OS. If
you do provide a backlog value, verify whether the
set&acirc; <br>
ting /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn should be updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to run via
the spawn-fcgi program. Set up any parameters via
environment variables and run the command as follows to
bind, as in the previous example to port <br>
9000 on IP address 192.168.0.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% spawn-fcgi -f src/iipsrv.fcgi
-a 192.168.0.1 -p 9000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For use in stand alone or
spawn-fcgi mode, you will then need to configure your
webserver on the same machine or another to direct FCGI
protocol requests to this IP address and <br>
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For web servers such as Nginx or
Java Application Servers such as Tomcat, JBoss or Jetty,
which cannot automatically start FCGI processes, iipsrv will
need to be started in stand <br>
alone mode or via spawn-fcgi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOLS <br>
The IIPImage server supports the Internet Imaging Protocol
(IIP) , the Zoomify protocol, the DeepZoom and the
International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)
protocols. <br>
Client applications supporting these protocols should be
able to use iipsrv as their back-end server. IIP is the most
feature rich of the 4 protocols and allows access to the
<br>
more advanced imaging server features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAGE PATHS <br>
The image paths given to the server must be absolute paths
on the server machine (eg. via the FIF variable for the IIP
protocol: FIF=/images/test.tif) and not paths relative to
<br>
the web server document root location. If the
FILESYSTEM_PREFIX server directive has been set (see OPTIONS
above), then this prefix is automatically pre-pended to all
requests to <br>
generate the absolute image path. Make sure that the server
process owner is able to access and read the images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that images do not need to
be directly accessible externally by the client via the web
server.</p>
