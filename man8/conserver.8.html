<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Conserver</b> is the daemon that manages remote access to system consoles by
  multiple users via the <b>console</b>(1) client program and (optionally) log
  the console output. It can connect to consoles via local serial ports, Unix
  domain sockets, TCP sockets (for terminal servers and the like), or any
  external program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When started, <b>conserver</b> reads the <b>conserver.cf</b>(5) file for details
  of each console. The console type, logging options, serial or network
  parameters, and user access levels are just a few of the things that can be
  specified. Command-line options are then applied, possibly overriding
  <b>conserver.cf</b>(5) settings. <b>Conserver</b> categorizes consoles into
  two types: those it should actively manage, and those it should just know
  about, so it can refer clients to other <b>conserver</b> instances. If the
  <b>master</b> value of a console matches the hostname or ip address of the
  local machine, <b>conserver</b> will actively manage the console. Otherwise,
  it's considered a ``remote'' console and managed by a different server.
  <b>Conserver</b> forks a child for each group of consoles it must manage and
  assigns each process a port number to listen on. The maximum number of
  consoles managed by each child process is set using the <b>-m</b> option. The
  <b>console</b>(1) client program communicates with the master console server
  process to find the port (and host, in a multi-server configuration) on which
  the appropriate child is listening. <b>Conserver</b> restricts connections
  from clients based on the host access section of its <b>conserver.cf</b>(5)
  file, restricts users based on the console access lists of the
  <b>conserver.cf</b>(5) file, and authenticates users against its
  <b>conserver.passwd</b>(5) file. <b>Conserver</b> can also restrict clients
  using the tcp-wrappers package (enabled using <b>--with-libwrap</b>). This
  authentication is done before consulting the <b>conserver.cf</b>(5) access
  list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When Unix domain sockets are used between the client and server (enabled using
  <b>--with-uds</b>), authentication checks are done on the hardcoded address
  ``127.0.0.1''. Automatic client redirection is also disabled (as if the
  <b>-R</b> option was used) since the client cannot communicate with remote
  servers. The directory used to hold the sockets is checked to make sure it's
  empty when the server starts. The server will <b>not</b> remove any files in
  the directory itself, just in case the directory is accidentally specified as
  ``/etc'' or some other critical location. The server will do its best to
  remove all the sockets when it shuts down, but it could stop ungracefully
  (crash, ``kill -9'', etc) and leave files behind. It would then be up to the
  admin (or a creative startup script) to clean up the directory before the
  server will start again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Conserver</b> completely controls any connection to a console. All escape
  sequences given by the user to <b>console</b> are passed to the server without
  interpretation. The server recognizes and processes all escape sequences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>conserver</b> parent process will automatically respawn any child process
  that dies. The following signals are propagated by the parent process to its
  children.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">SIGTERM</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Close all connections and exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">SIGHUP</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Reread the configuration file. New consoles are managed by
      forking off new children, deleted consoles (and their clients) are
      dropped, and changes to consoles are done &quot;in place&quot;, resetting
      the console port (bringing it down and up) only when necessary. The
      console name is used to determine when consoles have been
      added/removed/changed. All actions performed by SIGUSR2 are also
      performed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">SIGUSR1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Try to connect to any consoles marked as down. This can
      come in handy if you had a terminal server (or more) that wasn't accepting
      connections at startup and you want <b>conserver</b> to try to reconnect
      to all those downed ports.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">SIGUSR2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Close and reopen all console logfiles and, if in daemon
      mode (<b>-d</b> option), the error logfile (see the <b>-L</b> option). All
      actions performed by SIGUSR1 are also performed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Consoles which have no current client connection might produce important error
  messages. With the <b>-u</b> option, these ``unloved'' errors are labeled with
  a machine name and output on stdout (or, in daemon mode, to the logfile). This
  allows a live operator or an automated log scanner to find otherwise unseen
  errors by watching in a single location.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Conserver</b> must be run as root if it is to bind to a port under 1024 or if
  it must read protected password files (like shadow passwords) for
  authentication (see <b>conserver.passwd</b>(5)). Otherwise, it may be run by
  any user, with <b>-p</b> used to specify a port above 1024.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If encryption has been built into the code (<b>--with-openssl</b>), encrypted
  client connections (without certificate exchanges) happen by default. To add
  certificate exchanges, use the <b>-c</b> option with the client and server.
  For authentication of the certificates to work, the signing certificate must
  be properly trusted, which usually means the public portion is in
  <i>OPENSSL_ROOT</i><b>/ssl/certs</b> (on both the client and server sides).
  See the sample self-signing certificate making script
  <b>contrib/maketestcerts</b> for further clues. To allow non-encrypted client
  connections (in addition to encrypted client connections), use the <b>-E</b>
  option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Options may be given as separate arguments (e.g., <b>-n</b> <b>-d</b>) or
  clustered (e.g., <b>-nd</b>). Options and their arguments may be separated by
  optional white space. Option arguments containing spaces or other characters
  special to the shell must be quoted.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROTOCOL"><a class="selflink" href="#PROTOCOL">PROTOCOL</a></h1>
The protocol used to interact with the <b>conserver</b> daemon has two basic
  styles. The first style is the initial line-based mode, which occurs before
  connecting to a console. The second style is the character-based,
  escape-sequence mode, while connected to a console.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The initial line-based mode begins the same for both the master process and its
  children. Upon a successful (non-rejected) client connection, an ``ok'' is
  sent. The client then issues a command and the server responds to it with a
  result string (``ok'' being the sign of success for most commands). The
  commands available are ``help'', ``ssl'' (if SSL was built into the code),
  ``login'', and ``exit''. Using the ``login'' command, the client authenticates
  and gains access to the extended command set. This is where the master process
  and its children differ. The master process gives the client access to global
  commands, and the child provides commands for interacting with the consoles it
  manages. The ``help'' command, in both cases, will provide a complete list of
  commands and a short description of what they do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second, character-based, style of interaction occurs when the client issues
  the ``call'' command with a child process. This command connects the client to
  a console and, at that point, relays all traffic between the client and the
  console. There is no more command-based interaction between the client and the
  server, any interaction with the server is done with the default escape
  sequence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is, by no means, a complete description of the entire client/server
  interaction. It is, however, a brief explanation in order to give a idea of
  what the program does. See the <b>PROTOCOL</b> file in the distribution for
  further details.
