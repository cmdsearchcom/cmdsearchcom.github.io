<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
conserver - console server daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
conserver [-7dDEFhinoRSuvV] [-a type] [-m max] [-M master]
[-p port] [-b port] [-c cred] [-C config] [-P passwd] [-L
logfile] [-O min] [-U logfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Conserver is the daemon that manages remote access to system
consoles by multiple users via the console(1) client program
and (optionally) log the console output. It can connect <br>
to consoles via local serial ports, Unix domain sockets, TCP
sockets (for terminal servers and the like), or any external
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When started, conserver reads
the conserver.cf(5) file for details of each console. The
console type, logging options, serial or network parameters,
and user access levels are <br>
just a few of the things that can be specified. Command-line
options are then applied, possibly overriding
conserver.cf(5) settings. Conserver categorizes consoles
into two <br>
types: those it should actively manage, and those it should
just know about, so it can refer clients to other conserver
instances. If the master value of a console matches the <br>
hostname or ip address of the local machine, conserver will
actively manage the console. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s
considered a &lsquo;&lsquo;remote&rsquo;&rsquo; console and
managed by a different server. Con&acirc; <br>
server forks a child for each group of consoles it must
manage and assigns each process a port number to listen on.
The maximum number of consoles managed by each child process
<br>
is set using the -m option. The console(1) client program
communicates with the master console server process to find
the port (and host, in a multi-server configuration) on <br>
which the appropriate child is listening. Conserver
restricts connections from clients based on the host access
section of its conserver.cf(5) file, restricts users based
on the <br>
console access lists of the conserver.cf(5) file, and
authenticates users against its conserver.passwd(5) file.
Conserver can also restrict clients using the tcp-wrappers
pack&acirc; <br>
age (enabled using --with-libwrap). This authentication is
done before consulting the conserver.cf(5) access list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Unix domain sockets are
used between the client and server (enabled using
--with-uds), authentication checks are done on the hardcoded
address &lsquo;&lsquo;127.0.0.1&rsquo;&rsquo;. Automatic
<br>
client redirection is also disabled (as if the -R option was
used) since the client cannot communicate with remote
servers. The directory used to hold the sockets is checked
to <br>
make sure it&rsquo;s empty when the server starts. The
server will not remove any files in the directory itself,
just in case the directory is accidentally specified as
&lsquo;&lsquo;/etc&rsquo;&rsquo; or <br>
some other critical location. The server will do its best to
remove all the sockets when it shuts down, but it could stop
ungracefully (crash, &lsquo;&lsquo;kill -9&rsquo;&rsquo;,
etc) and leave files <br>
behind. It would then be up to the admin (or a creative
startup script) to clean up the directory before the server
will start again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conserver completely controls
any connection to a console. All escape sequences given by
the user to console are passed to the server without
interpretation. The server recog&acirc; <br>
nizes and processes all escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conserver parent process
will automatically respawn any child process that dies. The
following signals are propagated by the parent process to
its children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM Close all connections
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP Reread the configuration
file. New consoles are managed by forking off new children,
deleted consoles (and their clients) are dropped, and
changes to consoles are done <br>
&quot;in place&quot;, resetting the console port (bringing
it down and up) only when necessary. The console name is
used to determine when consoles have been <br>
added/removed/changed. All actions performed by SIGUSR2 are
also performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 Try to connect to any
consoles marked as down. This can come in handy if you had a
terminal server (or more) that wasn&rsquo;t accepting
connections at startup and you want <br>
conserver to try to reconnect to all those downed ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 Close and reopen all
console logfiles and, if in daemon mode (-d option), the
error logfile (see the -L option). All actions performed by
SIGUSR1 are also performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consoles which have no current
client connection might produce important error messages.
With the -u option, these
&lsquo;&lsquo;unloved&rsquo;&rsquo; errors are labeled with
a machine name and output <br>
on stdout (or, in daemon mode, to the logfile). This allows
a live operator or an automated log scanner to find
otherwise unseen errors by watching in a single
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conserver must be run as root if
it is to bind to a port under 1024 or if it must read
protected password files (like shadow passwords) for
authentication (see con&acirc; <br>
server.passwd(5)). Otherwise, it may be run by any user,
with -p used to specify a port above 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If encryption has been built
into the code (--with-openssl), encrypted client connections
(without certificate exchanges) happen by default. To add
certificate exchanges, use <br>
the -c option with the client and server. For authentication
of the certificates to work, the signing certificate must be
properly trusted, which usually means the public por&acirc;
<br>
tion is in OPENSSL_ROOT/ssl/certs (on both the client and
server sides). See the sample self-signing certificate
making script contrib/maketestcerts for further clues. To
allow <br>
non-encrypted client connections (in addition to encrypted
client connections), use the -E option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options may be given as separate arguments (e.g., -n -d) or
clustered (e.g., -nd). Options and their arguments may be
separated by optional white space. Option arguments
con&acirc; <br>
taining spaces or other characters special to the shell must
be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7 Strip the high bit off of all
data received, whether from the console client or from the
console device, before any processing occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-atype Set the default access
type for incoming connections from console clients:
&lsquo;r&rsquo; for refused (the default), &lsquo;a&rsquo;
for allowed, or &lsquo;t&rsquo; for trusted. This applies to
hosts <br>
for which no matching entry is found in the access section
of conserver.cf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bport Set the base port for
children to listen on. Each child starts looking for free
ports at port and working upward, trying a maximum number of
ports equal to twice the <br>
maximum number of groups. If no free ports are available in
that range, conserver exits. By default, conserver lets the
operating system choose a free port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ccred Load an SSL certificate
and key from the PEM encoded file cred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Cconfig Read configuration
information from the file config. The default config may be
changed at compile time using the --with-cffile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Become a daemon. Disconnects
from the controlling terminal and sends all output
(including any debug output) to the logfile (see -L).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enable debugging output, sent
to stderr. Multiple -D options increases debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E If encryption has been built
into the code (--with-openssl), encrypted client connections
are a requirement. This option allows non-encrypted clients
(as well as <br>
encrypted clients) to connect to consoles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Do not automatically
reinitialize failed (unexpectedly closed) consoles. If the
console is a program (&lsquo;|&rsquo; syntax) and it closes
with a zero exit status, the console <br>
is reinitialized regardless of this option. Without this
option, a console is immediately reopened, and if that
fails, retried every minute until successful. This <br>
option has no effect on the -o and -O options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Output a brief help
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Initiate console connections
on demand (and close them when not used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Llogfile Log errors and
informational messages to logfile after startup in daemon
mode (-d). This option does not apply when not running in
daemon mode. The default logfile <br>
may be changed at compile time using the --with-logfile
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmax Set the maximum consoles
managed per process. The default max may be changed at
compile time using the --with-maxmemb option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mmaster Normally, this allows
conserver to bind to a particular IP address (like
&lsquo;127.0.0.1&rsquo;) instead of all interfaces. The
default is to bind to all addresses. However, <br>
if --with-uds was used to enable Unix domain sockets for
client/server communication, this points conserver to the
directory where it should store the sockets. The <br>
default master directory
(&lsquo;&lsquo;/tmp/conserver&rsquo;&rsquo;) may be changed
at compile time using the --with-uds option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Obsolete (now a no-op); see
-u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Normally, a client connecting
to a &lsquo;&lsquo;downed&rsquo;&rsquo; console does just
that. Using this option, the server will automatically
attempt to open (&lsquo;&lsquo;bring up&rsquo;&rsquo;) the
console <br>
when the client connects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Omin Enable periodic attempts
(every min minutes) to open (&lsquo;&lsquo;bring
up&rsquo;&rsquo;) all downed consoles (similar to sending a
SIGUSR1). Without this option, or if min is zero, no <br>
periodic attempts occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pport Set the TCP port for the
master process to listen on. This may be either a port
number or a service name. The default port,
&lsquo;&lsquo;conserver&rsquo;&rsquo; (typically 782), may
be <br>
changed at compile time using the --with-port option. If the
--with-uds option was used, this option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ppasswd Read the table of
authorized user data from the file passwd. The default
passwd may be changed at compile time using the
--with-pwdfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Disable automatic client
redirection to other conserver hosts. This means
informational commands like -w and -i will only show the
status of the local conserver host <br>
and attempts to connect to remote consoles will result in an
informative message to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Do not run the server, just
perform a syntax check of configuration file and exit with a
non-zero value if there is an error. Using more than one -S
will cause con&acirc; <br>
server to output various information about each console in 5
colon-separated fields, enclosed in curly-braces. The
philosophy behind the output is to provide infor&acirc; <br>
mation to allow external detection of multiple consoles
access the same physical port. Since this is highly
environment-specific, conserver cannot do the check <br>
internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name The name of the
console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">master The hostname of the
master conserver host for the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aliases The console aliases in a
comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type The type of console. Values
will be a &lsquo;/&rsquo; for a local device,
&lsquo;|&rsquo; for a command, &lsquo;!&rsquo; for a remote
port, &lsquo;%&rsquo; for a Unix domain socket, and
&lsquo;#&rsquo; for a noop <br>
console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">details Multiple values are
comma-separated and depend on the type of the console. Local
devices will have the values of the device file and baud
rate/parity. Com&acirc; <br>
mands will have string to invoke. Remote ports will have the
values of the remote hostname and port number. Unix domain
sockets will have the path to the <br>
socket. Noop consoles will have nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Send unloved console output
to conserver&rsquo;s stdout (which, in daemon mode, is
redirected to the logfile). This applies to all consoles to
which no user is attached, <br>
independent of whether logging of individual consoles is
enabled via conserver.cf entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ulogfile Copy all console data
to the &lsquo;&lsquo;unified&rsquo;&rsquo; logfile. The
output is the same as the -u output, but all consoles, not
just those without a user, are logged. Each line of <br>
output is prefixed with the console name. If a user is
attached read/write, a &lsquo;*&rsquo; is appended to the
console name, to allow log watching utilites to ignore
potential <br>
user-introduced alarms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Echo the configuration as it
is being read (be verbose).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Output the version number and
settings of the conserver program and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL <br>
The protocol used to interact with the conserver daemon has
two basic styles. The first style is the initial line-based
mode, which occurs before connecting to a console. The <br>
second style is the character-based, escape-sequence mode,
while connected to a console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial line-based mode
begins the same for both the master process and its
children. Upon a successful (non-rejected) client
connection, an &lsquo;&lsquo;ok&rsquo;&rsquo; is sent. The
client then <br>
issues a command and the server responds to it with a result
string (&lsquo;&lsquo;ok&rsquo;&rsquo; being the sign of
success for most commands). The commands available are
&lsquo;&lsquo;help&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;ssl&rsquo;&rsquo; (if SSL <br>
was built into the code), &lsquo;&lsquo;login&rsquo;&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;&lsquo;exit&rsquo;&rsquo;. Using the
&lsquo;&lsquo;login&rsquo;&rsquo; command, the client
authenticates and gains access to the extended command set.
This is where the master <br>
process and its children differ. The master process gives
the client access to global commands, and the child provides
commands for interacting with the consoles it manages. <br>
The &lsquo;&lsquo;help&rsquo;&rsquo; command, in both cases,
will provide a complete list of commands and a short
description of what they do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second, character-based,
style of interaction occurs when the client issues the
&lsquo;&lsquo;call&rsquo;&rsquo; command with a child
process. This command connects the client to a console and,
at <br>
that point, relays all traffic between the client and the
console. There is no more command-based interaction between
the client and the server, any interaction with the server
<br>
is done with the default escape sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is, by no means, a complete
description of the entire client/server interaction. It is,
however, a brief explanation in order to give a idea of what
the program does. See <br>
the PROTOCOL file in the distribution for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The following default file locations may be overridden at
compile time or by the command-line options described above.
Run conserver -V to see the defaults set at compile
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/conserver.cf description of
console terminal lines and client host access levels; see
