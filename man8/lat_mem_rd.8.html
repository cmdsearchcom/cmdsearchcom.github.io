<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lat_mem_rd - memory read latency benchmark</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lat_mem_rd [ -P &lt;parallelism&gt; ] [ -W &lt;warmups&gt; ]
[ -N &lt;repetitions&gt; ] size_in_megabytes stride [ stride
stride... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lat_mem_rd measures memory read latency for varying memory
sizes and strides. The results are reported in nanoseconds
per load and have been verified accurate to within a few
<br>
nanoseconds on an SGI Indy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entire memory hierarchy is
measured, including onboard cache latency and size, external
cache latency and size, main memory latency, and TLB miss
latency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only data accesses are measured;
the instruction cache is not measured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The benchmark runs as two nested
loops. The outer loop is the stride size. The inner loop is
the array size. For each array size, the benchmark creates a
ring of pointers that <br>
point backward one stride. Traversing the array is done
by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p = (char **)*p;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in a for loop (the over head of
the for loop is not significant; the loop is an unrolled
loop 100 loads long).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of the array varies
from 512 bytes to (typically) eight megabytes. For the small
sizes, the cache will have an effect, and the loads will be
much faster. This becomes <br>
much more apparent when the data is plotted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since this benchmark uses
fixed-stride offsets in the pointer chain, it may be
vulnerable to smart, stride-sensitive cache prefetching
policies. Older machines were typically <br>
able to prefetch for sequential access patterns, and some
were able to prefetch for strided forward access patterns,
but only a few could prefetch for backward strided patterns.
<br>
These capabilities are becoming more widespread in newer
processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
Output format is intended as input to xgraph or some similar
program (we use a perl script that produces pic input).
There is a set of data produced for each stride. The data
<br>
set title is the stride size and the data points are the
array size in megabytes (floating point value) and the load
latency over all points in that array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT <br>
The output is best examined in a graph where you typically
get a graph that has four plateaus. The graph should plotted
in log base 2 of the array size on the X axis and the <br>
latency on the Y axis. Each stride is then plotted as a
curve. The plateaus that appear correspond to the onboard
cache (if present), external cache (if present), main memory
<br>
latency, and TLB miss latency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a rough guide, you may be
able to extract the latencies of the various parts as
follows, but you should really look at the graphs, since
these rules of thumb do not always <br>
work (some systems do not have onboard cache, for
example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onboard cache Try stride of 128
and array size of .00098.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external cache Try stride of 128
and array size of .125.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main memory Try stride of 128
and array size of 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TLB miss Try the largest stride
and the largest array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This program is dependent on the correct operation of
mhz(8). If you are getting numbers that seem off, check that
mhz(8) is giving you a clock rate that you believe.</p>
