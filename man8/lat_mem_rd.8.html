lat_mem_rd - memory read latency benchmark
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>lat_mem_rd</b> [ <i>-P &lt;parallelism&gt;</i> ] [ <i>-W &lt;warmups&gt;</i>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>lat_mem_rd</b> measures memory read latency for varying memory sizes and
  strides. The results are reported in nanoseconds per load and have been
  verified accurate to within a few nanoseconds on an SGI Indy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The entire memory hierarchy is measured, including onboard cache latency and
  size, external cache latency and size, main memory latency, and TLB miss
  latency.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only data accesses are measured; the instruction cache is not measured.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The benchmark runs as two nested loops. The outer loop is the stride size. The
  inner loop is the array size. For each array size, the benchmark creates a
  ring of pointers that point backward one stride. Traversing the array is done
  by
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	p = (char **)*p;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
in a for loop (the over head of the for loop is not significant; the loop is an
  unrolled loop 100 loads long).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The size of the array varies from 512 bytes to (typically) eight megabytes. For
  the small sizes, the cache will have an effect, and the loads will be much
  faster. This becomes much more apparent when the data is plotted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since this benchmark uses fixed-stride offsets in the pointer chain, it may be
  vulnerable to smart, stride-sensitive cache prefetching policies. Older
  machines were typically able to prefetch for sequential access patterns, and
  some were able to prefetch for strided forward access patterns, but only a few
  could prefetch for backward strided patterns. These capabilities are becoming
  more widespread in newer processors.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></h1>
Output format is intended as input to <b>xgraph</b> or some similar program (we
  use a perl script that produces pic input). There is a set of data produced
  for each stride. The data set title is the stride size and the data points are
  the array size in megabytes (floating point value) and the load latency over
  all points in that array.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERPRETING_THE_OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERPRETING_THE_OUTPUT">INTERPRETING
  THE OUTPUT</a></h1>
The output is best examined in a graph where you typically get a graph that has
  four plateaus. The graph should plotted in log base 2 of the array size on the
  X axis and the latency on the Y axis. Each stride is then plotted as a curve.
  The plateaus that appear correspond to the onboard cache (if present),
  external cache (if present), main memory latency, and TLB miss latency.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a rough guide, you may be able to extract the latencies of the various parts
  as follows, but you should really look at the graphs, since these rules of
  thumb do not always work (some systems do not have onboard cache, for
  example).

This program is dependent on the correct operation of <b>mhz</b>(8). If you are
  getting numbers that seem off, check that <b>mhz</b>(8) is giving you a clock
  rate that you believe.
