<p>AUDITCTL:(8) System Administration Utilities
AUDITCTL:(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
auditctl - a utility to assist controlling the
kernel&rsquo;s audit system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
auditctl [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The auditctl program is used to configure kernel options
related to auditing, to see status of the configuration, and
to load discretionary audit rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
-b backlog <br>
Set max number of outstanding audit buffers allowed (Kernel
Default=64) If all buffers are full, the failure flag is
consulted by the kernel for action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backlog_wait_time wait_time
<br>
Set the time for the kernel to wait (Kernel Default 60*HZ)
when the backlog_limit is reached before queuing more audit
events to be transferred to auditd. The number must <br>
be greater than or equal to zero and less that 10 times the
default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Continue loading rules in
spite of an error. This summarizes the results of loading
the rules. The exit code will not be success if any rule
fails to load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Delete all rules and watches.
This can take a key option (-k), too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e [0..2] <br>
Set enabled flag. When 0 is passed, this can be used to
temporarily disable auditing. When 1 is passed as an
argument, it will enable auditing. To lock the audit
configu&acirc; <br>
ration so that it can&rsquo;t be changed, pass a 2 as the
argument. Locking the configuration is intended to be the
last command in audit.rules for anyone wishing this feature
<br>
to be active. Any attempt to change the configuration in
this mode will be audited and denied. The configuration can
only be changed by rebooting the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f [0..2] <br>
Set failure mode 0=silent 1=printk 2=panic. This option lets
you determine how you want the kernel to handle critical
errors. Example conditions where this mode may have <br>
an effect includes: transmission errors to userspace audit
daemon, backlog limit exceeded, out of kernel memory, and
rate limit exceeded. The default value is 1. Secure <br>
environments will probably want to set this to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore errors when reading
rules from a file. This causes auditctl to always return a
success exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loginuid-immutable <br>
This option tells the kernel to make loginuids unchangeable
once they are set. Changing loginuids requires
CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL. So, its not something that can be done by
<br>
unprivileged users. Setting this makes loginuid
tamper-proof, but can cause some problems in certain kinds
of containers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q mount-point,subtree <br>
If you have an existing directory watch and bind or move
mount another subtree in the watched subtree, you need to
tell the kernel to make the subtree being mounted
equiv&acirc; <br>
alent to the directory being watched. If the subtree is
already mounted at the time the directory watch is issued,
the subtree is automatically tagged for watching. Please
<br>
note the comma separating the two values. Omitting it will
cause errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rate <br>
Set limit in messages/sec (0=none). If this rate is non-zero
and is exceeded, the failure flag is consulted by the kernel
for action. The default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R file <br>
Read rules from a file. The rules must be 1 per line and in
the order that they are to be executed in. The rule file
must be owned by root and not readable by other users <br>
or it will be rejected. The rule file may have comments
embedded by starting the line with a &rsquo;#&rsquo;
character. Rules that are read from a file are identical to
what you would <br>
type on a command line except they are not preceded by
auditctl (since auditctl is the one executing the file) and
you would not use shell escaping since auditctl is
read&acirc; <br>
ing the file instead of bash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Trim the subtrees after a
mount command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS OPTIONS <br>
-l List all rules 1 per line. Two more options may be given
to this command. You can give either a key option (-k) to
list rules that match a key or a (-i) to have a0 through
<br>
a3 interpretted to help determine the syscall argument
values are correct .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m text <br>
Send a user space message into the audit system. This can
only be done if you have CAP_AUDIT_WRITE capability
(normally the root user has this). The resulting event will
<br>
be the USER type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Report the kernel&rsquo;s
audit subsystem status. It will tell you the in-kernel
values that can be set by -e, -f, -r, and -b options. The
pid value is the process number of the <br>
audit daemon. Note that a pid of 0 indicates that the audit
daemon is not running. The lost entry will tell you how many
event records that have been discarded due to the <br>
kernel audit queue overflowing. The backlog field tells how
many event records are currently queued waiting for auditd
to read them. This option can be followed by the -i <br>
to get a couple fields interpreted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version of
auditctl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RULE OPTIONS <br>
-a [list,action|action,list] <br>
Append rule to the end of list with action. Please note the
comma separating the two values. Omitting it will cause
errors. The fields may be in either order. It could be <br>
list,action or action,list. The following describes the
valid list names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">task Add a rule to the per task
list. This rule list is used only at the time a task is
created -- when fork() or clone() are called by the parent
task. When using <br>
this list, you should only use fields that are known at task
creation time, such as the uid, gid, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit Add a rule to the syscall
exit list. This list is used upon exit from a system call to
determine if an audit event should be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user Add a rule to the user
message filter list. This list is used by the kernel to
filter events originating in user space before relaying them
to the audit dae&acirc; <br>
mon. It should be noted that the only fields that are valid
are: uid, auid, gid, pid, subj_user, subj_role, subj_type,
subj_sen, subj_clr, and msgtype. All <br>
other fields will be treated as non-matching. It should be
understood that any event originating from user space from a
process that has CAP_AUDIT_WRITE will <br>
be recorded into the audit trail. This means that the most
likely use for this filter is with rules that have an action
of never since nothing has to be done <br>
to allow events to be recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exclude Add a rule to the event
type exclusion filter list. This list is used to filter
events that you do not want to see. For example, if you do
not want to see any <br>
avc messages, you would using this list to record that. The
message type that you do not wish to see is given with the
msgtype field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following describes the
valid actions for the rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">never No audit records will be
generated. This can be used to suppress event generation. In
general, you want suppressions at the top of the list
instead of the bot&acirc; <br>
tom. This is because the event triggers on the first
matching rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always Allocate an audit
context, always fill it in at syscall entry time, and always
write out a record at syscall exit time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A list,action <br>
Add rule to the beginning list with action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C [f=f | f!=f] <br>
Build an inter-field comparison rule: field, operation,
field. You may pass multiple comparisons on a single command
line. Each one must start with -C. Each inter-field <br>
equation is anded with each other as well as equations
starting with -F to trigger an audit record. There are 2
operators supported - equal, and not equal. Valid fields
<br>
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auid, uid, euid, suid, fsuid,
obj_uid; and gid, egid, sgid, fsgid, obj_gid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two groups of uid and gid
cannot be mixed. But any comparison within the group can be
made. The obj_uid/gid fields are collected from the object
of the event such as a <br>
file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d list,action <br>
Delete rule from list with action. The rule is deleted only
if it exactly matches syscall name(s) and every field name
and value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F [n=v | n!=v | n&lt;v | n&gt;v
| n&lt;=v | n&gt;=v | n&amp;v | n&amp;=v] <br>
Build a rule field: name, operation, value. You may have up
to 64 fields passed on a single command line. Each one must
start with -F. Each field equation is anded with <br>
each other (as well as equations starting with -C) to
trigger an audit record. There are 8 operators supported -
equal, not equal, less than, greater than, less than or <br>
equal, and greater than or equal, bit mask, and bit test
respectively. Bit test will &quot;and&quot; the values and
check that they are equal, bit mask just &quot;ands&quot;
the values. <br>
Fields that take a user ID may instead have the user&rsquo;s
name; the program will convert the name to user ID. The same
is true of group names. Valid fields are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a0, a1, a2, a3 <br>
Respectively, the first 4 arguments to a syscall. Note that
string arguments are not supported. This is because the
kernel is passed a pointer to the string. <br>
Triggering on a pointer address value is not likely to work.
So, when using this, you should only use on numeric values.
This is most likely to be used on <br>
platforms that multiplex socket or IPC operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch The CPU architecture of the
syscall. The arch can be found doing &rsquo;uname -m&rsquo;.
If you do not know the arch of your machine but you want to
use the 32 bit syscall <br>
table and your machine supports 32 bit, you can also use b32
for the arch. The same applies to the 64 bit syscall table,
you can use b64. In this way, you can <br>
write rules that are somewhat arch independent because the
family type will be auto detected. However, syscalls can be
arch specific and what is available on <br>
x86_64, may not be available on ppc. The arch directive
should precede the -S option so that auditctl knows which
internal table to use to look up the syscall <br>
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auid The original ID the user
logged in with. Its an abbreviation of audit uid. Sometimes
its referred to as loginuid. Either the user account text or
number may be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devmajor Device Major Number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devminor Device Minor Number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir Full Path of Directory to
watch. This will place a recursive watch on the directory
and its whole subtree. It can only be used on exit list. See
&quot;-w&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">egid Effective Group ID. May be
numeric or the groups name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">euid Effective User ID. May be
numeric or the user account name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit Exit value from a syscall.
If the exit code is an errno, you may use the text
representation, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsgid Filesystem Group ID. May
be numeric or the groups name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsuid Filesystem User ID. May be
numeric or the user account name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filetype The target file&rsquo;s
type. Can be either file, dir, socket, link, character,
block, or fifo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gid Group ID. May be numeric or
the groups name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inode Inode Number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key This is another way of
setting a filter key. See discussion above for -k
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msgtype This is used to match
the event&rsquo;s record type. It should only be used on the
exclude or user filter lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj_uid Object&rsquo;s UID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj_gid Object&rsquo;s GID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj_user Resource&rsquo;s SE
Linux User</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj_role Resource&rsquo;s SE
Linux Role</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj_type Resource&rsquo;s SE
Linux Type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj_lev_low Resource&rsquo;s SE
Linux Low Level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj_lev_high <br>
Resource&rsquo;s SE Linux High Level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path Full Path of File to watch.
It can only be used on exit list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perm Permission filter for file
operations. See &quot;-p&quot;. It can only be used on exit
list. You can use this without specifying a syscall and the
kernel will select the <br>
syscalls that satisfy the permissions being requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pers OS Personality Number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid Process ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppid Parent&rsquo;s Process
ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subj_user Program&rsquo;s SE
Linux User</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subj_role Program&rsquo;s SE
Linux Role</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subj_type Program&rsquo;s SE

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subj_sen Program&rsquo;s SE
Linux Sensitivity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subj_clr Program&rsquo;s SE
Linux Clearance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sgid Saved Group ID. See
getresgid(2) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">success If the exit value is
&gt;= 0 this is true/yes otherwise its false/no. When
writing a rule, use a 1 for true/yes and a 0 for
false/no</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suid Saved User ID. See
getresuid(2) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid User ID. May be numeric or
the user account name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k key Set a filter key on an
audit rule. The filter key is an arbitrary string of text
that can be up to 31 bytes long. It can uniquely identify
the audit records produced by a <br>
rule. Typical use is for when you have several rules that
together satisfy a security requirement. The key value can
be searched on with ausearch so that no matter which <br>
rule triggered the event, you can find its results. The key
can also be used on delete all (-D) and list rules (-l) to
select rules with a specific key. You may have more <br>
than one key on a rule if you want to be able to search
logged events in multiple ways or if you have an audispd
plugin that uses a key to aid its analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [r|w|x|a] <br>
Describe the permission access type that a file system watch
will trigger on. r=read, w=write, x=execute, a=attribute
change. These permissions are not the standard file <br>
permissions, but rather the kind of syscall that would do
this kind of thing. The read &amp; write syscalls are
omitted from this set since they would overwhelm the logs.
But <br>
rather for reads or writes, the open flags are looked at to
see what permission was requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S [Syscall name or number|all]
<br>
Any syscall name or number may be used. The word
&rsquo;all&rsquo; may also be used. If the given syscall is
made by a program, then start an audit record. If a field
rule is given <br>
and no syscall is specified, it will default to all
syscalls. You may also specify multiple syscalls in the same
rule by using multiple -S options in the same rule. Doing
<br>
so improves performance since fewer rules need to be
evaluated. Alternatively, you may pass a comma separated
list of syscall names. If you are on a bi-arch system, like
<br>
x86_64, you should be aware that auditctl simply takes the
text, looks it up for the native arch (in this case b64) and
sends that rule to the kernel. If there are no <br>
additional arch directives, IT WILL APPLY TO BOTH 32 &amp;
64 BIT SYSCALLS. This can have undesirable effects since
there is no guarantee that any syscall has the same number
<br>
on both 32 and 64 bit interfaces. You will likely want to
control this and write 2 rules, one with arch equal to b32
and one with b64 to make sure the kernel finds the <br>
events that you intend. See the arch field discussion for
more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w path <br>
Insert a watch for the file system object at path. You
cannot insert a watch to the top level directory. This is
prohibited by the kernel. Wildcards are not supported <br>
either and will generate a warning. The way that watches
work is by tracking the inode internally. If you place a
watch on a file, its the same as using the -F path option
<br>
on a syscall rule. If you place a watch on a directory, its
the same as using the -F dir option on a syscall rule. The
-w form of writing watches is for backwards compati&acirc;
<br>
bility and the syscall based form is more expressive. Unlike
most syscall auditing rules, watches do not impact
performance based on the number of rules sent to the
ker&acirc; <br>
nel. The only valid options when using a watch are the -p
and -k. If you need to anything fancy like audit a specific
user accessing a file, then use the syscall auditing <br>
form with the path or dir fields. See the EXAMPLES section
for an example of converting one form to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W path <br>
Remove a watch for the file system object at path. The rule
must match exactly. See -d discussion for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE TIPS <br>
Syscall rules get evaluated for each syscall for every
program. If you have 10 syscall rules, every program on your
system will delay during a syscall while the audit system
<br>
evaluates each rule. Too many syscall rules will hurt
performance. Try to combine as many as you can whenever the
filter, action, key, and fields are identical. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -a always,exit -S
openat -F success=0 <br>
auditctl -a always,exit -S truncate -F success=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">could be re-written as one
rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -a always,exit -S
openat -S truncate -F success=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, try to use file system
auditing wherever practical. This improves performance. For
example, if you were wanting to capture all failed opens
&amp; truncates like above, but were <br>
only concerned about files in /etc and didn&rsquo;t care
about /usr or /sbin, its possible to use this rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -a always,exit -S
openat -S truncate -F dir=/etc -F success=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will be higher performance
since the kernel will not evaluate it each and every
syscall. It will be handled by the filesystem auditing code
and only checked on filesystem <br>
related syscalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To see all syscalls made by a specific program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -a always,exit -S all
-F pid=1005</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see files opened by a
specific user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -a always,exit -S
openat -F auid=510</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see unsuccessful openat
calls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -a always,exit -S
openat -F success=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To watch a file for changes (2
ways to express):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa
<br>
auditctl -a always,exit -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To recursively watch a directory
for changes (2 ways to express):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -w /etc/ -p wa <br>
auditctl -a always,exit -F dir=/etc/ -F perm=wa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see if an admin is accessing
other user&rsquo;s files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auditctl -a always,exit -F
dir=/home/ -F uid=0 -C auid!=obj_uid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
