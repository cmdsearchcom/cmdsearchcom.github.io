innfeed, imapfeed - Multi-host, multi-connection, streaming NNTP feeder
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>innfeed</b> [<b>-ChmMvxyz</b>] [<b>-a</b> <i>spool-dir</i>] [<b>-b</b>
  <i>directory</i>] [ <b>-c</b> <i>config-file</i>] [<b>-d</b> <i>log-level</i>]
  [ <b>-e</b> <i>bytes</i>] [ <b>-l</b> <i>logfile</i>] [<b>-o</b> <i>bytes</i>]
  [ <b>-p</b> <i>pid-file</i>] [<b>-s</b> <i>command</i>] [ <b>-S</b>
  <i>status-file</i>] [ <i>file</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>innfeed</b> implements the NNTP protocol for transferring news between
  computers. It handles the standard IHAVE protocol as well as the
  CHECK/TAKETHIS streaming extension. <b>innfeed</b> can feed any number of
  remote hosts at once and will open multiple connections to each host if
  configured to do so. The only limitations are the process limits for open file
  descriptors and memory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As an alternative to using NNTP, INN may also be fed to an IMAP server. This is
  done by using an executable called <b>imapfeed</b>, which is identical to
  <b>innfeed</b> except for the delivery process. The new version has two types
  of connections: an LMTP connection to deliver regular messages and an IMAP
  connection to handle control messages.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODES"><a class="selflink" href="#MODES">MODES</a></h1>
<b>innfeed</b> has three modes of operation: channel, funnel-file and batch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Channel mode is used when no filename is given on the command line, the
  <i>input-file</i> keyword is <i>not</i> given in the config file, <i>and</i>
  the <b>-x</b> option is <i>not</i> given. In channel mode, <b>innfeed</b> runs
  with stdin connected via a pipe to <b>innd</b>. Whenever <b>innd</b> closes
  this pipe (and it has several reasons during normal processing to do so),
  <b>innfeed</b> will exit. It first will try to finish sending all articles it
  was in the middle of transmitting, before issuing a QUIT command. This means
  <b>innfeed</b> may take a while to exit depending on how slow your peers are.
  It never (well, almost never) just drops the connection. The recommended way
  to restart <b>innfeed</b> when run in channel mode is therefore to tell
  <b>innd</b> to close the pipe and spawn a new <b>innfeed</b> process. This can
  be done with &quot;ctlinnd flush <i>feed</i>&quot; where <i>feed</i> is the
  name of the <b>innfeed</b> channel feed in the <i>newsfeeds</i> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Funnel-file mode is used when a filename is given as an argument or the
  <i>input-file</i> keyword is given in the config file. In funnel-file mode, it
  reads the specified file for the same formatted information as <b>innd</b>
  would give in channel mode. It is expected that <b>innd</b> is continually
  writing to this file, so when <b>innfeed</b> reaches the end of the file, it
  will check periodically for new information. To prevent the funnel file from
  growing without bounds, you will need to periodically move the file to the
  side (or simply remove it) and have <b>innd</b> flush the file. Then, after
  the file is flushed by <b>innd</b>, you can send <b>innfeed</b> a SIGALRM, and
  it too will close the file and open the new file created by <b>innd</b>.
  Something like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    innfeed -p &lt;pathrun in inn.conf&gt;/innfeed.pid my-funnel-file &amp;
    while true; do
        sleep 43200
        rm -f my-funnel-file
        ctlinnd flush funnel-file-site
        kill -ALRM `cat &lt;pathrun&gt;/innfeed.pid`
    done
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Batch mode is used when the <b>-x</b> flag is used. In batch mode,
  <b>innfeed</b> will ignore stdin, and will simply process any backlog created
  by a previously running <b>innfeed</b>. This mode is not normally needed as
  <b>innfeed</b> will take care of backlog processing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<b>innfeed</b> expects a couple of things to be able to run correctly: a
  directory where it can store backlog files and a configuration file to
  describe which peers it should handle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration file is described in <i>innfeed.conf</i>(5). The <b>-c</b>
  option can be used to specify a different file. For each peer (say,
  &quot;foo&quot;), <b>innfeed</b> manages up to 4 files in the backlog
  directory:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A <i>foo.lock</i> file, which prevents other instances of
      <b>innfeed</b> from interfering with this one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A <i>foo.input</i> file which has old article information
      <b>innfeed</b> is reading for re-processing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A <i>foo.output</i> file where <b>innfeed</b> is writing
      information on articles that could not be processed (normally due to a
      slow or blocked peer).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A <i>foo</i> file that is never created by <b>innfeed</b>,
      but if <b>innfeed</b> notices it, it will rename it to <i>foo.input</i> at
      the next opportunity and will start reading from it. This lets you create
      a batch file and put it in a place where <b>innfeed</b> will find it.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should never alter the <i>foo.input</i> or <i>foo.output</i> files of a
  running <b>innfeed</b>. The format of these last three files is one of the
  following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /path/to/article &lt;message-id&gt;
    @token@ &lt;message-id&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the same as the first two fields of the lines <b>innd</b> feeds to
  <b>innfeed</b>, and the same as the first two fields of the lines of the batch
  file <b>innd</b> will write if <b>innfeed</b> is unavailable for some reason.
  When <b>innfeed</b> processes its own batch files, it ignores everything after
  the first two whitespace separated fields, so moving the <b>innd</b>-created
  batch file to the appropriate spot will work, even though the lines have extra
  fields.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first field can also be a storage API token. The two types of lines can be
  intermingled; <b>innfeed</b> will use the storage manager if appropriate, and
  otherwise treat the first field as a filename to read directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>innfeed</b> writes its current status to the file <i>innfeed.status</i> (or
  the file given by the <b>-S</b> option). This file contains details on the
  process as a whole, and on each peer this instance of <b>innfeed</b> is
  managing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>innfeed</b> is told to send an article to a host it is not managing, then
  the article information will be put into a file matching the pattern
  <i>innfeed-dropped.*</i>, with part of the file name matching the pid of the
  <b>innfeed</b> process that is writing to it. <b>innfeed</b> will not process
  this file except to write to it. If nothing is written to the file, then it
  will be removed if <b>innfeed</b> exits normally. Otherwise, the file remains,
  and <b>procbatch</b> can be invoked to process it afterwards.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
Upon receipt of a SIGALRM, <b>innfeed</b> will close the funnel file specified
  on the command line, and will reopen it (see funnel file description above).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>innfeed</b> with catch SIGINT and will write a large debugging snapshot of
  the state of the running system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>innfeed</b> will catch SIGHUP and will reload both the config and the log
  files. See <i>innfeed.conf</i>(5) for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>innfeed</b> will catch SIGCHLD and will close and reopen all backlog files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>innfeed</b> will catch SIGTERM and will do an orderly shutdown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Upon receipt of a SIGUSR1, <b>innfeed</b> will increment the debugging level by
  one; receipt of a SIGUSR2 will decrement it by one. The debugging level starts
  at zero (unless the <b>-d</b> option it used), in which case no debugging
  information is emitted. A larger value for the level means more debugging
  information. Numbers up to 5 are currently useful.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSLOG_ENTRIES"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSLOG_ENTRIES">SYSLOG
  ENTRIES</a></h1>
There are 3 different categories of syslog entries for statistics: host,
  connection and global.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The host statistics are generated for a given peer at regular intervals after
  the first connection is made (or, if the remote is unreachable, after spooling
  starts). The host statistics give totals over all connections that have been
  active during the given time frame. For example (broken here to fit the page,
  with &quot;vixie&quot; being the peer):

If the <b>-z</b> option is used (see below), then when the peer stats are

If you only open a maximum of one connection to a remote, then there will be a
  close correlation between connection numbers and host numbers, but in general
  you cannot tie the two sets of number together in any easy or very meaningful
  way. When a connection closes, it will always log its stats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If all connections for a host get closed together, then the host logs its stats
  as &quot;final&quot; and resets its counters. If the feed is so busy that
  there is always at least one connection open and running, then after some
  amount of time (set via the config file), the host stats are logged as final
  and reset. This is to make generating higher level stats from log files, by
  other programs, easier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is one log entry that is emitted for a host just after its last connection
  closes and <b>innfeed</b> is preparing to exit. This entry contains counts
  over the entire life of the process. The &quot;seconds&quot; field is from the
  first time a connection was successfully built, or the first time spooling
  started. If a host has been completely idle, it will have no such log entry.

When using the <b>-x</b> option, the config file entry's

  created and used, no matter how many big the batch file, and no matter how big
  the <i>max-connections</i> field specifies. Thus a value of 0 for

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>innfeed</b> does not automatically grab the file out of <i>pathoutgoing</i>.
  This needs to be prepared for it by external means.

Probably too many other bugs to count.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ALTERNATIVE"><a class="selflink" href="#ALTERNATIVE">ALTERNATIVE</a></h1>
An alternative to <b>innfeed</b> can be <b>innduct</b>, maintained by Ian
  Jackson and available at
  &lt;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ian/git-manpage/innduct.git/innduct.8&gt;.
  It is intended to solve a design issue in the way <b>innfeed</b> works. As a
  matter of fact, the program feed protocol spoken between <b>innd</b> and
  <b>innfeed</b> is lossy: if <b>innfeed</b> dies unexpectedly, articles which
  <b>innd</b> has written to the pipe to <b>innfeed</b> will be skipped.
  <b>innd</b> has no way of telling which articles those are, no useful records,
  and no attempts to resend these articles.

Earlier versions of <b>innfeed</b> (up to 0.10.1) were shipped separately;
  <b>innfeed</b> is now part of INN and shares the same version number.
