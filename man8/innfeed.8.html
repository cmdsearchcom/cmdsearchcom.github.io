<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
innfeed, imapfeed - Multi-host, multi-connection, streaming
NNTP feeder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
innfeed [-ChmMvxyz] [-a spool-dir] [-b directory] [-c
config-file] [-d log-level] [-e bytes] [-l logfile] [-o
bytes] [-p pid-file] [-s command] [-S status-file]
[file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
innfeed implements the NNTP protocol for transferring news
between computers. It handles the standard IHAVE protocol as
well as the CHECK/TAKETHIS streaming extension. innfeed <br>
can feed any number of remote hosts at once and will open
multiple connections to each host if configured to do so.
The only limitations are the process limits for open file
<br>
descriptors and memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an alternative to using NNTP,
INN may also be fed to an IMAP server. This is done by using
an executable called imapfeed, which is identical to innfeed
except for the <br>
delivery process. The new version has two types of
connections: an LMTP connection to deliver regular messages
and an IMAP connection to handle control messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
innfeed has three modes of operation: channel, funnel-file
and batch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Channel mode is used when no
filename is given on the command line, the input-file
keyword is not given in the config file, and the -x option
is not given. In channel mode, <br>
innfeed runs with stdin connected via a pipe to innd.
Whenever innd closes this pipe (and it has several reasons
during normal processing to do so), innfeed will exit. It
first <br>
will try to finish sending all articles it was in the middle
of transmitting, before issuing a QUIT command. This means
innfeed may take a while to exit depending on how slow <br>
your peers are. It never (well, almost never) just drops the
connection. The recommended way to restart innfeed when run
in channel mode is therefore to tell innd to close the <br>
pipe and spawn a new innfeed process. This can be done with
&quot;ctlinnd flush feed&quot; where feed is the name of the
innfeed channel feed in the newsfeeds file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Funnel-file mode is used when a
filename is given as an argument or the input-file keyword
is given in the config file. In funnel-file mode, it reads
the specified file for the <br>
same formatted information as innd would give in channel
mode. It is expected that innd is continually writing to
this file, so when innfeed reaches the end of the file, it
will <br>
check periodically for new information. To prevent the
funnel file from growing without bounds, you will need to
periodically move the file to the side (or simply remove it)
and <br>
have innd flush the file. Then, after the file is flushed by
innd, you can send innfeed a SIGALRM, and it too will close
the file and open the new file created by innd. <br>
Something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innfeed -p &lt;pathrun in
inn.conf&gt;/innfeed.pid my-funnel-file &amp; <br>
while true; do <br>
sleep 43200 <br>
rm -f my-funnel-file <br>
ctlinnd flush funnel-file-site <br>
kill -ALRM &lsquo;cat &lt;pathrun&gt;/innfeed.pid&lsquo;
<br>
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Batch mode is used when the -x
flag is used. In batch mode, innfeed will ignore stdin, and
will simply process any backlog created by a previously
running innfeed. This mode is <br>
not normally needed as innfeed will take care of backlog
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
innfeed expects a couple of things to be able to run
correctly: a directory where it can store backlog files and
a configuration file to describe which peers it should
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file is
described in innfeed.conf(5). The -c option can be used to
specify a different file. For each peer (say,
&quot;foo&quot;), innfeed manages up to 4 files in the <br>
backlog directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A foo.lock file,
which prevents other instances of innfeed from interfering
with this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A foo.input file
which has old article information innfeed is reading for
re-processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A foo.output
file where innfeed is writing information on articles that
could not be processed (normally due to a slow or blocked
peer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A foo file that
is never created by innfeed, but if innfeed notices it, it
will rename it to foo.input at the next opportunity and will
start reading from it. This lets you <br>
create a batch file and put it in a place where innfeed will
find it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should never alter the
foo.input or foo.output files of a running innfeed. The
format of these last three files is one of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/path/to/article
&lt;message-id&gt; <br>
@token@ &lt;message-id&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the same as the first
two fields of the lines innd feeds to innfeed, and the same
as the first two fields of the lines of the batch file innd
will write if innfeed is <br>
unavailable for some reason. When innfeed processes its own
batch files, it ignores everything after the first two
whitespace separated fields, so moving the innd-created
batch <br>
file to the appropriate spot will work, even though the
lines have extra fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first field can also be a
storage API token. The two types of lines can be
intermingled; innfeed will use the storage manager if
appropriate, and otherwise treat the first <br>
field as a filename to read directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innfeed writes its current
status to the file innfeed.status (or the file given by the
-S option). This file contains details on the process as a
whole, and on each peer this <br>
instance of innfeed is managing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If innfeed is told to send an
article to a host it is not managing, then the article
information will be put into a file matching the pattern
innfeed-dropped.*, with part of the <br>
file name matching the pid of the innfeed process that is
writing to it. innfeed will not process this file except to
write to it. If nothing is written to the file, then it <br>
will be removed if innfeed exits normally. Otherwise, the
file remains, and procbatch can be invoked to process it
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Upon receipt of a SIGALRM, innfeed will close the funnel
file specified on the command line, and will reopen it (see
funnel file description above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innfeed with catch SIGINT and
will write a large debugging snapshot of the state of the
running system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innfeed will catch SIGHUP and
will reload both the config and the log files. See
innfeed.conf(5) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innfeed will catch SIGCHLD and
will close and reopen all backlog files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innfeed will catch SIGTERM and
will do an orderly shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon receipt of a SIGUSR1,
innfeed will increment the debugging level by one; receipt
of a SIGUSR2 will decrement it by one. The debugging level
starts at zero (unless the -d <br>
option it used), in which case no debugging information is
emitted. A larger value for the level means more debugging
information. Numbers up to 5 are currently useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSLOG ENTRIES <br>
There are 3 different categories of syslog entries for
statistics: host, connection and global.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host statistics are
generated for a given peer at regular intervals after the
first connection is made (or, if the remote is unreachable,
after spooling starts). The host <br>
statistics give totals over all connections that have been
active during the given time frame. For example (broken here
to fit the page, with &quot;vixie&quot; being the peer):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">May 23 12:49:08 news
innfeed[16015]: vixie checkpoint <br>
seconds 1381 offered 2744 accepted 1286 refused 1021
rejected 437 <br>
missing 0 accsize 8506220 rejsize 142129 spooled 990 <br>
on_close 0 unspooled 240 deferred 10/15.3 requeued 25 <br>
queue 42.1/100:14,35,13,4,24,10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meanings of these fields
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seconds <br>
The time since innfeed connected to the host or since the
statistics were reset by a &quot;final&quot; log entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offered <br>
The number of IHAVE commands sent to the host if it is not
in streaming mode. The sum of the number of TAKETHIS
commands sent when no-CHECK mode is in effect plus the
number <br>
of CHECK commands sent in streaming mode (when no-CHECK mode
is not in effect).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accepted <br>
The number of articles which were sent to the remote host
and accepted by it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refused <br>
The number of articles offered to the host that it indicated
it did not want because it had already seen the message-ID.
The remote host indicates this by sending a 435 <br>
response to an IHAVE command or a 438 response to a CHECK
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rejected <br>
The number of articles transferred to the host that it did
not accept because it determined either that it already had
the article or it did not want it because of the <br>
article&rsquo;s Newsgroups: or Distribution: header fields,
etc. The remote host indicates that it is rejecting the
article by sending a 437 or 439 response after innfeed sent
the <br>
entire article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing <br>
The number of articles which innfeed was told to offer to
the host but which were not present in the article spool.
These articles were probably cancelled or expired before
<br>
innfeed was able to offer them to the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accsize <br>
The number of bytes of all accepted articles transferred to
the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rejsize <br>
The number of bytes of all rejected articles transferred to
the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spooled <br>
The number of article entries that were written to the
.output backlog file because the articles either could not
be sent to the host or were refused by it. Articles are <br>
generally spooled either because new articles are arriving
more quickly than they can be offered to the host, or
because innfeed closed all the connections to the host and
<br>
pushed all the articles currently in progress to the .output
backlog file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on_close <br>
The number of articles that were spooled when innfeed closed
all the connections to the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unspooled <br>
The number of article entries that were read from the .input
backlog file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deferred <br>
The first number is the number of articles that the host
told innfeed to retry later by sending a 431 or 436
response. innfeed immediately puts these articles back on
the tail <br>
of the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second number is the average
(mean) size of deferred articles during the previous logging
interval</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">requeued <br>
The number of articles that were in progress on connections
when innfeed dropped those connections and put the articles
back on the queue. These connections may have been <br>
broken by a network problem or became unresponsive causing
innfeed to time them out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">queue <br>
The first number is the average (mean) queue size during the
previous logging interval. The second number is the maximum
allowable queue size. The third number is the <br>
percentage of the time that the queue was empty. The fourth
through seventh numbers are the percentages of the time that
the queue was &gt;0% to 25% full, 25% to 50% full, 50% to
<br>
75% full, and 75% to &lt;100% full. The last number is the
percentage of the time that the queue was totally full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -z option is used (see
below), then when the peer stats are generated, each
connection will log its stats too. For example, for
connection number zero (from a set of <br>
five):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">May 23 12:49:08 news
innfeed[16015]: vixie:0 checkpoint <br>
seconds 1381 offered 596 accepted 274 refused 225 <br>
rejected 97 accsize 773623 rejsize 86591</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you only open a maximum of
one connection to a remote, then there will be a close
correlation between connection numbers and host numbers, but
in general you cannot tie the <br>
two sets of number together in any easy or very meaningful
way. When a connection closes, it will always log its
stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all connections for a host
get closed together, then the host logs its stats as
&quot;final&quot; and resets its counters. If the feed is so
busy that there is always at least one <br>
connection open and running, then after some amount of time
(set via the config file), the host stats are logged as
final and reset. This is to make generating higher level
<br>
stats from log files, by other programs, easier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one log entry that is
emitted for a host just after its last connection closes and
innfeed is preparing to exit. This entry contains counts
over the entire life of the <br>
process. The &quot;seconds&quot; field is from the first
time a connection was successfully built, or the first time
spooling started. If a host has been completely idle, it
will have no <br>
such log entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final log entry is emitted

statistics over the entire life of the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
innfeed takes the following options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a spool-dir <br>
The -a flag is used to specify the top of the article spool
tree. innfeed does a chdir(2) to this directory, so it
should probably be an absolute path. The default is <br>
patharticles as set in inn.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b directory <br>
The -b flag may be used to specify a different directory for
backlog file storage and retrieval, as well as for lock
files. If the path is relative, then it is relative to <br>
pathspool as set in inn.conf. The default is
&quot;innfeed&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-file <br>
The -c flag may be used to specify a different config file
from the default value. If the path is relative, then it is
relative to pathetc as set in inn.conf. The default <br>
is innfeed.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C The -C flag is used to have
innfeed simply check the config file, report on any errors
and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d log-level <br>
The -d flag may be used to specify the initial logging
level. All debugging messages go to stderr (which may not be
what you want, see the -l flag below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e bytes <br>
The -e flag may be used to specify the size limit (in bytes)
for the .output backlog files innfeed creates. If the output
file gets bigger than 10% more than the given <br>
number, innfeed will replace the output file with the tail
of the original version. The default value is 0, which means
there is no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Use the -h flag to print the
usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
The -l flag may be used to specify a different log file from
stderr. As innd starts innfeed with stderr attached to
/dev/null, using this option can be useful in catching <br>
any abnormal error messages, or any debugging messages (all
&quot;normal&quot; errors messages go to syslog).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m The -m flag is used to turn
on logging of all missing articles. Normally, if an article
is missing, innfeed keeps a count, but logs no further
information. When this flag <br>
is used, details about message-IDs and expected path names
are logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M If innfeed has been built
with mmap support, then the -M flag turns OFF the use of
mmap(); otherwise, it has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o bytes <br>
The -o flag sets a value of the maximum number of bytes of
article data innfeed is supposed to keep in memory. This
does not work properly yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid-file <br>
The -p flag is used to specify the file name to write the
pid of the process into. A relative path is relative to
pathrun as set in inn.conf. The default is innfeed.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s command <br>
The -s flag specifies the name of a command to run in a
subprocess and read article information from. This is
similar to channel mode operation, only that command takes
the <br>
place usually occupied by innd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S status-file <br>
The -S flag specifies the name of the file to write the
periodic status to. If the path is relative, it is
considered relative to pathlog as set in inn.conf. The
default is <br>
innfeed.status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v When the -v flag is given,
version information is printed to stderr and then innfeed
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The -x flag is used to tell
innfeed not to expect any article information from innd but
just to process any backlog files that exist and then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y The -y flag is used to allow
dynamic peer binding. If this flag is used and article
information is received from innd that specifies an unknown
peer, then the peer name is <br>
taken to be the IP name too, and an association with it is
created. Using this, it is possible to only have the global
defaults in the innfeed.conf file, provided the peer <br>
name as used by innd is the same as the IP name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that innfeed with -y and no
peer in innfeed.conf would cause a problem that innfeed
drops the first article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z The -z flag is used to cause
each connection, in a parallel feed configuration, to report
statistics when the controller for the connections prints
its statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When using the -x option, the config file entry&rsquo;s
initial-connections field will be the total number of
connections created and used, no matter how many big the
batch file, and <br>
no matter how big the max-connections field specifies. Thus
a value of 0 for initial-connections means nothing will
happen in -x mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">innfeed does not automatically
grab the file out of pathoutgoing. This needs to be prepared
for it by external means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Probably too many other bugs to
count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALTERNATIVE <br>
An alternative to innfeed can be innduct, maintained by Ian
Jackson and available at
&lt;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ian/git-manpage/innduct.git/innduct.8&gt;.
It is <br>
intended to solve a design issue in the way innfeed works.
As a matter of fact, the program feed protocol spoken
between innd and innfeed is lossy: if innfeed dies <br>
unexpectedly, articles which innd has written to the pipe to
innfeed will be skipped. innd has no way of telling which
articles those are, no useful records, and no attempts to
<br>
resend these articles.</p>

pathbin/innfeed <br>
The binary program itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathetc/innfeed.conf <br>
