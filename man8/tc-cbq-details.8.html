<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Class Based Queueing is a classful qdisc that implements a
rich linksharing hierarchy of classes. It contains shaping
elements as well as prioritizing capabilities. Shaping is
<br>
performed using link idle time calculations based on the
timing of dequeue events and underlying link bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHAPING ALGORITHM <br>
Shaping is done using link idle time calculations, and
actions taken if these calculations deviate from set
limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When shaping a 10mbit/s
connection to 1mbit/s, the link will be idle 90% of the
time. If it isn&rsquo;t, it needs to be throttled so that it
IS idle 90% of the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the kernel&rsquo;s
perspective, this is hard to measure, so CBQ instead derives
the idle time from the number of microseconds (in fact,
jiffies) that elapse between requests from <br>
the device driver for more data. Combined with the knowledge
of packet sizes, this is used to approximate how full or
empty the link is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is rather circumspect and
doesn&rsquo;t always arrive at proper results. For example,
what is the actual link speed of an interface that is not
really able to transmit the full <br>
100mbit/s of data, perhaps because of a badly implemented
driver? A PCMCIA network card will also never achieve
100mbit/s because of the way the bus is designed - again,
how do <br>
we calculate the idle time?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The physical link bandwidth may
be ill defined in case of not-quite-real network devices
like PPP over Ethernet or PPTP over TCP/IP. The effective
bandwidth in that case is prob&acirc; <br>
ably determined by the efficiency of pipes to userspace -
which not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During operations, the effective
idletime is measured using an exponential weighted moving
average (EWMA), which considers recent packets to be
exponentially more important than <br>
past ones. The Unix loadaverage is calculated in the same
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calculated idle time is
subtracted from the EWMA measured one, the resulting number
is called &rsquo;avgidle&rsquo;. A perfectly loaded link has
an avgidle of zero: packets arrive <br>
exactly at the calculated interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An overloaded link has a
negative avgidle and if it gets too negative, CBQ throttles
and is then &rsquo;overlimit&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversely, an idle link might
amass a huge avgidle, which would then allow infinite
bandwidths after a few hours of silence. To prevent this,
avgidle is capped at maxidle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If overlimit, in theory, the CBQ
could throttle itself for exactly the amount of time that
was calculated to pass between packets, and then pass one
packet, and throttle again. <br>
Due to timer resolution constraints, this may not be
feasible, see the minburst parameter below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSIFICATION <br>
Within the one CBQ instance many classes may exist. Each of
these classes contains another qdisc, by default
tc-pfifo(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When enqueueing a packet, CBQ
starts at the root and uses various methods to determine
which class should receive the data. If a verdict is
reached, this process is repeated for <br>
the recipient class which might have further means of
classifying traffic to its children, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CBQ has the following methods
available to classify a packet to any child classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i) skb-&gt;priority class
encoding. Can be set from userspace by an application with
the SO_PRIORITY setsockopt. The skb-&gt;priority class
encoding only applies if the skb-&gt;pri&acirc; <br>
ority holds a major:minor handle of an existing class within
this qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(ii) tc filters attached to the
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(iii) The defmap of a class, as
set with the split &amp; defmap parameters. The defmap may
contain instructions for each possible Linux packet
priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each class also has a level.
Leaf nodes, attached to the bottom of the class hierarchy,
have a level of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM <br>
Classification is a loop, which terminates when a leaf class
is found. At any point the loop may jump to the fallback
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The loop consists of the
following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i) If the packet is generated
locally and has a valid classid encoded within its
skb-&gt;priority, choose it and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(ii) Consult the tc filters, if
any, attached to this child. If these return a class which
is not a leaf class, restart loop from the class returned.
If it is a leaf, choose <br>
it and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(iii) If the tc filters did not
return a class, but did return a classid, try to find a
class with that id within this qdisc. Check if the found
class is of a lower level than <br>
the current class. If so, and the returned class is not a
leaf node, restart the loop at the found class. If it is a
leaf node, terminate. If we found an upward reference <br>
to a higher level, enter the fallback algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(iv) If the tc filters did not
return a class, nor a valid reference to one, consider the
minor number of the reference to be the priority. Retrieve a
class from the defmap of <br>
this class for the priority. If this did not contain a
class, consult the defmap of this class for the BEST_EFFORT
class. If this is an upward reference, or no BEST_EFFORT
<br>
class was defined, enter the fallback algorithm. If a valid
class was found, and it is not a leaf node, restart the loop
at this class. If it is a leaf, choose it and ter&acirc;
<br>
minate. If neither the priority distilled from the classid,
nor the BEST_EFFORT priority yielded a class, enter the
fallback algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fallback algorithm resides
outside of the loop and is as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i) Consult the defmap of the
class at which the jump to fallback occurred. If the defmap
contains a class for the priority of the class (which is
related to the TOS field), <br>
choose this class and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(ii) Consult the map for a class
for the BEST_EFFORT priority. If found, choose it, and
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(iii) Choose the class at which
break out to the fallback algorithm occurred. Terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packet is enqueued to the
class which was chosen when either algorithm terminated. It
is therefore possible for a packet to be enqueued *not* at a
leaf node, but in the mid&acirc; <br>
dle of the hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINK SHARING ALGORITHM <br>
When dequeuing for sending to the network device, CBQ
decides which of its classes will be allowed to send. It
does so with a Weighted Round Robin process in which each
class <br>
with packets gets a chance to send in turn. The WRR process
starts by asking the highest priority classes (lowest
numerically - highest semantically) for packets, and will
con&acirc; <br>
tinue to do so until they have no more data to offer, in
which case the process repeats for lower priorities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CERTAINTY ENDS HERE, ANK PLEASE
HELP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each class is not allowed to
send at length though - they can only dequeue a configurable
amount of data during each round.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a class is about to go
overlimit, and it is not bounded it will try to borrow
avgidle from siblings that are not isolated. This process is
repeated from the bottom upwards. <br>
If a class is unable to borrow enough avgidle to send a
packet, it is throttled and not asked for a packet for
enough time for the avgidle to increase above zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I REALLY NEED HELP FIGURING THIS
OUT. REST OF DOCUMENT IS PRETTY CERTAIN AGAIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QDISC <br>
The root qdisc of a CBQ class tree has the following
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parent major:minor | root <br>
This mandatory parameter determines the place of the CBQ
instance, either at the root of an interface or within an
existing class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">handle major: <br>
Like all other qdiscs, the CBQ can be assigned a handle.
Should consist only of a major number, followed by a colon.
Optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avpkt bytes <br>
For calculations, the average packet size must be known. It
is silently capped at a minimum of 2/3 of the interface MTU.
Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bandwidth rate <br>
To determine the idle time, CBQ must know the bandwidth of
your underlying physical interface, or parent qdisc. This is
a vital parameter, more about it later. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cell The cell size determines he
granularity of packet transmission time calculations. Has a
sensible default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpu A zero sized packet may
still take time to transmit. This value is the lower cap for
packet transmission time calculations - packets smaller than
this value are still <br>
deemed to have this size. Defaults to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ewma log <br>
When CBQ needs to measure the average idle time, it does so
using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average which smooths
out measurements into a moving average. The EWMA <br>
LOG determines how much smoothing occurs. Defaults to 5.
Lower values imply greater sensitivity. Must be between 0
and 31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A CBQ qdisc does not shape out
of its own accord. It only needs to know certain parameters
about the underlying link. Actual shaping is done in
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSES <br>
Classes have a host of parameters to configure their
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parent major:minor <br>
Place of this class within the hierarchy. If attached
directly to a qdisc and not to another class, minor can be
omitted. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classid major:minor <br>
Like qdiscs, classes can be named. The major number must be
equal to the major number of the qdisc to which it belongs.
Optional, but needed if this class is going to have <br>
children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weight weight <br>
When dequeuing to the interface, classes are tried for
traffic in a round-robin fashion. Classes with a higher
configured qdisc will generally have more traffic to offer
<br>
during each round, so it makes sense to allow it to dequeue
more traffic. All weights under a class are normalized, so
only the ratios matter. Defaults to the configured <br>
rate, unless the priority of this class is maximal, in which
case it is set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allot bytes <br>
Allot specifies how many bytes a qdisc can dequeue during
each round of the process. This parameter is weighted using
the renormalized class weight described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">priority priority <br>
In the round-robin process, classes with the lowest priority
field are tried for packets first. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rate rate <br>
Maximum rate this class and all its children combined can
send at. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bandwidth rate <br>
This is different from the bandwidth specified when creating
a CBQ disc. Only used to determine maxidle and offtime,
which are only calculated when specifying maxburst or <br>
minburst. Mandatory if specifying maxburst or minburst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxburst <br>
This number of packets is used to calculate maxidle so that
when avgidle is at maxidle, this number of average packets
can be burst before avgidle drops to 0. Set it <br>
higher to be more tolerant of bursts. You can&rsquo;t set
maxidle directly, only via this parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minburst <br>
As mentioned before, CBQ needs to throttle in case of
overlimit. The ideal solution is to do so for exactly the
calculated idle time, and pass 1 packet. However, Unix
ker&acirc; <br>
nels generally have a hard time scheduling events shorter
than 10ms, so it is better to throttle for a longer period,
and then pass minburst packets in one go, and then <br>
sleep minburst times longer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time to wait is called the
offtime. Higher values of minburst lead to more accurate
shaping in the long term, but to bigger bursts at
millisecond timescales.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minidle <br>
If avgidle is below 0, we are overlimits and need to wait
until avgidle will be big enough to send one packet. To
prevent a sudden burst from shutting down the link for a
<br>
prolonged period of time, avgidle is reset to minidle if it
gets too low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minidle is specified in negative
microseconds, so 10 means that avgidle is capped at
-10us.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bounded <br>
Signifies that this class will not borrow bandwidth from its
siblings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isolated <br>
Means that this class will not borrow bandwidth to its
siblings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split major:minor &amp; defmap
bitmap[/bitmap] <br>
If consulting filters attached to a class did not give a
verdict, CBQ can also classify based on the packet&rsquo;s
priority. There are 16 priorities available, numbered from 0
<br>
to 15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defmap specifies which
priorities this class wants to receive, specified as a
bitmap. The Least Significant Bit corresponds to priority
zero. The split parameter tells <br>
CBQ at which class the decision must be made, which should
be a (grand)parent of the class you are adding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, &rsquo;tc class
add ... classid 10:1 cbq .. split 10:0 defmap c0&rsquo;
configures class 10:0 to send packets with priorities 6 and
7 to 10:1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complimentary configuration
would then be: &rsquo;tc class add ... classid 10:2 cbq ...
split 10:0 defmap 3f&rsquo; Which would send all packets 0,
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 to 10:1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">estimator interval timeconstant
<br>
CBQ can measure how much bandwidth each class is using,
which tc filters can use to classify packets with. In order
to determine the bandwidth it uses a very simple esti&acirc;
<br>
mator that measures once every interval microseconds how
much traffic has passed. This again is a EWMA, for which the
time constant can be specified, also in microseconds. <br>
The time constant corresponds to the sluggishness of the
measurement or, conversely, to the sensitivity of the
average to short bursts. Higher values mean less
sensitiv&acirc; <br>
ity.</p>
