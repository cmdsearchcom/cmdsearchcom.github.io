<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_read - read multiple blocks of data, optionally with SCSI
READ commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_read [blk_sgio=0|1] [bpt=BPT] [bs=BS] [cdbsz=6|10|12|16]
count=COUNT [dio=0|1] [dpo=0|1] [fua=0|1] if=IFILE
[mmap=0|1] [no_dxfer=0|1] [odir=0|1] [skip=SKIP] [time=TI]
[ver&acirc; <br>
bose=VERB] [--help] [--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Read data from a Linux SCSI generic (sg) device, a block
device or a normal file with each read command issued to the
same offset or logical block address (lba). This can be used
<br>
to test (or time) disk caching, SCSI (or some other)
transport throughput, and/or SCSI command overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the COUNT value is
positive, then up to BPT blocks are read at a time, until
the COUNT is exhausted. Each read operation starts at the
same lba which, if SKIP is not given, <br>
is the beginning of the file or device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The COUNT value may be negative
when IFILE is a sg device or is a block device with
&rsquo;blk_sgio=1&rsquo; set. Alternatively
&rsquo;bpt=0&rsquo; may be given. In these cases |COUNT|
&quot;zero block&quot; SCSI <br>
READ commands are issued. &quot;Zero block&quot; means
&quot;do nothing&quot; for SCSI READ 10, 12 and 16 byte
commands (but not for the 6 byte variant). In practice
&quot;zero block&quot; SCSI READ commands <br>
have low latency and so are one way to measure SCSI command
overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
blk_sgio=0 | 1 <br>
The default action of this utility is to use the Unix read()
command when the IFILE is a block device. In lk 2.6 many
block devices can handle SCSI commands issued via the <br>
SG_IO ioctl. So when this option is set the SG_IO ioctl
sends SCSI READ commands to IFILE if it is a block
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bpt=BPT <br>
where BPT is the maximum number of blocks each read
operation fetches. Fewer blocks will be fetched when the
remaining COUNT is less than BPT. The default value for BPT
<br>
is 128. Note that each read operation starts at the same lba
(as given by skip=SKIP or 0). If &rsquo;bpt=0&rsquo; then
the COUNT is interpreted as the number of zero block SCSI
READ <br>
commands to issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs=BS where BS is the size (in
bytes) of each block read. This must be the block size of
the physical device (defaults to 512) if SCSI commands are
being issued to IFILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdbsz=6 | 10 | 12 | 16 <br>
size of SCSI READ commands issued on sg device names, or
block devices if &rsquo;blk_sgio=1&rsquo; is given. Default
is 10 byte SCSI READ cdbs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count=COUNT <br>
when COUNT is a positive number, read that number of blocks,
typically with multiple read operations. When COUNT is
negative then |COUNT| SCSI READ commands are performed <br>
requesting zero blocks to be transferred. This option is
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dio=0 | 1 <br>
default is 0 which selects indirect IO. Value of 1 attempts
direct IO which, if not available, falls back to indirect IO
and notes this at completion. This option is only <br>
active if IFILE is an sg device. If direct IO is selected
and /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio has the value of 0 then a
warning is issued (and indirect IO is performed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpo=0 | 1 <br>
when set the disable page out (DPO) bit in SCSI READ
commands is set. Otherwise the DPO bit is cleared
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fua=0 | 1 <br>
when set the force unit access (FUA) bit in SCSI READ
commands is set. Otherwise the FUA bit is cleared
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if=IFILE <br>
read from this IFILE. This argument must be given. If the
IFILE is a normal file then it must be seekable (if (COUNT
&gt; BPT) or skip=SKIP is given). Hence stdin is not <br>
acceptable (and giving &quot;-&quot; as the IFILE argument
is reported as an error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmap=0 | 1 <br>
default is 0 which selects indirect IO. Value of 1 causes
memory mapped IO to be performed. Selecting both dio and
mmap is an error. This option is only active if IFILE is
<br>
an sg device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_dxfer=0 | 1 <br>
when set then DMA transfers from the device are made into
kernel buffers but no further (i.e. there is no second copy
into the user space). The default value is 0 in which <br>
case transfers are made into the user space. When neither
mmap nor dio is set then data transfer are copied via kernel
buffers (i.e. a double copy). Mainly for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">odir=0 | 1 <br>
when set opens an IFILE which is a block device with an
additional O_DIRECT flag. The default value is 0 (i.e.
don&rsquo;t open block devices O_DIRECT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip=SKIP <br>
all read operations will start offset by SKIP bs-sized
blocks from the start of the input file (or device).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time=TI <br>
When TI is 0 (default) doesn&rsquo;t perform timing. When 1,
times transfer and does throughput calculation, starting at
the first issued command until completion. When 2, <br>
times transfer and does throughput calculation, starting at
the second issued command until completion. When 3 times
from third command, etc. An average number of commands <br>
(SCSI READs or Unix read()s) executed per second is also
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose=VERB <br>
as VERB increases so does the amount of debug output sent to
stderr. Default value is zero which yields the minimum
amount of debug output. A value of 1 reports extra <br>
information that is not repetitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Output the usage message
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Output the version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Various numeric arguments (e.g. SKIP) may include
multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the
&quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data usually gets to the user
space in a 2 stage process: first the SCSI adapter DMAs into
kernel buffers and then the sg driver copies this data into
user memory. This is <br>
called &quot;indirect IO&quot; and there is a
&quot;dio&quot; option to select &quot;direct IO&quot; which
will DMA directly into user memory. Due to some issues
&quot;direct IO&quot; is disabled in the sg driver and <br>
needs a configuration change to activate it. This is
typically done with &quot;echo 1 &gt;
/proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio&quot;. An alternate way to avoid the
2 stage copy is to select memory mapped <br>
IO with &rsquo;mmap=1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT,
SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE output the number of remaining blocks to
be transferred; then they have their default action. SIGUSR1
<br>
causes the same information to be output yet the copy
continues. All output caused by signals is sent to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Let us assume that /dev/sg0 is a disk and we wish to time
the disk&rsquo;s cache performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sg_read if=/dev/sg0 bs=512
count=1MB mmap=1 time=2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will continually
read 128 512 byte blocks from block 0. The &quot;128&quot;
is the default value for &rsquo;bpt&rsquo; while &quot;block
0&quot; is chosen because the &rsquo;skip&rsquo; argument
was not <br>
given. This will continue until 1,000,000 blocks are read.
The idea behind using &rsquo;time=2&rsquo; is that the first
64 KiB read operation will involve reading the magnetic
media while <br>
the remaining read operations will &quot;hit&quot; the
disk&rsquo;s cache. The output of third command will look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time from second command to end
was 4.50 secs, 113.70 MB/sec <br>
Average number of READ commands per second was 1735.27 <br>
1000000+0 records in, SCSI commands issued: 7813</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_read is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
