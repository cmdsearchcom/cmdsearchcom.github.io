sg_read - read multiple blocks of data, optionally with SCSI READ commands
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>sg_read</b> [ <i>blk_sgio=</i>0|1] [<i>bpt=BPT</i>] [<i>bs=BS</i>]

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Read data from a Linux SCSI generic (sg) device, a block device or a normal file
  with each read command issued to the same offset or logical block address
  (lba). This can be used to test (or time) disk caching, SCSI (or some other)
  transport throughput, and/or SCSI command overhead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the <i>COUNT</i> value is positive, then up to <i>BPT</i> blocks are read
  at a time, until the <i>COUNT</i> is exhausted. Each read operation starts at
  the same lba which, if <i>SKIP</i> is not given, is the beginning of the file
  or device.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>COUNT</i> value may be negative when <i>IFILE</i> is a sg device or is a
  block device with 'blk_sgio=1' set. Alternatively 'bpt=0' may be given. In
  these cases | <i>COUNT</i>| &quot;zero block&quot; SCSI READ commands are
  issued. &quot;Zero block&quot; means &quot;do nothing&quot; for SCSI READ 10,
  12 and 16 byte commands (but not for the 6 byte variant). In practice
  &quot;zero block&quot; SCSI READ commands have low latency and so are one way
  to measure SCSI command overhead.

      this option is set the SG_IO ioctl sends SCSI READ commands to

Data usually gets to the user space in a 2 stage process: first the SCSI adapter
  DMAs into kernel buffers and then the sg driver copies this data into user
  memory. This is called &quot;indirect IO&quot; and there is a &quot;dio&quot;
  option to select &quot;direct IO&quot; which will DMA directly into user
  memory. Due to some issues &quot;direct IO&quot; is disabled in the sg driver
  and needs a configuration change to activate it. This is typically done with
  &quot;echo 1 &gt; /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio&quot;. An alternate way to avoid the
  2 stage copy is to select memory mapped IO with 'mmap=1'.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE
  output the number of remaining blocks to be transferred; then they have their
  default action. SIGUSR1 causes the same information to be output yet the copy
  continues. All output caused by signals is sent to stderr.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Let us assume that /dev/sg0 is a disk and we wish to time the disk's cache
  performance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 sg_read if=/dev/sg0 bs=512 count=1MB mmap=1 time=2
<div class="Pp"></div>
This command will continually read 128 512 byte blocks from block 0. The
  &quot;128&quot; is the default value for 'bpt' while &quot;block 0&quot; is
  chosen because the 'skip' argument was not given. This will continue until
  1,000,000 blocks are read. The idea behind using 'time=2' is that the first 64
  KiB read operation will involve reading the magnetic media while the remaining
  read operations will &quot;hit&quot; the disk's cache. The output of third
  command will look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 time from second command to end was 4.50 secs, 113.70 MB/sec
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Average number of READ commands per second was 1735.27
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 1000000+0 records in, SCSI commands issued: 7813

The exit status of sg_read is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
