<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
luksmeta - Utility for storing metadata in a LUKSv1
header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
luksmeta test -d DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luksmeta init -d DEVICE [-f]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luksmeta show -d DEVICE [-s
SLOT]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luksmeta save -d DEVICE [-s
SLOT] -u UUID DATA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luksmeta load -d DEVICE -s SLOT
[-u UUID] DATA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luksmeta wipe -d DEVICE -s SLOT
[-u UUID] [-f]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
The luksmeta utility enables an administrator to store
metadata in the gap between the end of the LUKSv1 header and
the start of the encrypted data. This is useful for storing
<br>
data that is available before the volume is unlocked,
usually for use during the volume unlock process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metadata is stored in a
series of UUID-typed slots, allowing multiple blocks of
metadata. Although the luksmeta slots are inspired by the
LUKS slots, they are functionally <br>
independent and share only a casual relationship. Slots
merely provide a hint that a given chunk of metadata is
associated with a specific LUKSv1 password (in a slot with
the <br>
same number). However, luksmeta itself is indifferent to the
relationship between a LUKSv1 slot and the correspondly
numbered luksmeta slot, with one exception (detailed
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a LUKSv1 volume is
initialized using cryptsetup(8), it must also be initialized
for metadata storage by luksmeta init. Once this is
complete, the device is ready to store <br>
medata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data can be written to a slot
using luksmeta save or read from a slot using luksmeta load.
You can also erase the data in an existing slot using
luksmeta wipe or query the slots <br>
using luksmeta show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUID GENERATION <br>
It is often presumed that saving metadata to a slot requires
a specific UUID or that there is an official registry of
UUID types. This is incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUID stands for Universally
Unique IDentifier. UUIDs are a standardized, widely-used
data type used for identification without a central
registry. For the relevant standards, see <br>
ISO 9834-8:2005 and RFC 4122.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUIDs are large enough that
collision is practically impossible. So if your application
wants to store data in a luksmeta slot, just generate your
own UUID and use it consis&acirc; <br>
tently to refer to your type of data. If you have multiple
types of data, feel free to generate multiple UUIDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easiest way to generate a
UUID is to use uuidgen(1). However, any compliant UUID
generator will suffice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION <br>
Before reading or writing metadata, the LUKSv1 block device
must be initialized for metadata storage. Two commands help
with this process: luksmeta test and luksmeta init.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The luksmeta test command simply
checks an existing block device to see if it is initialized
for metadata storage. This command does not provide any
output, so be sure to check <br>
its return code (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The luksmeta init command
initializes the LUKSv1 block device for metadata storage.
This process will wipe out any data in the LUKSv1 header
gap. For this reason, this command <br>
will require user confirmation before any data is written,
unless the -f option is supplied. Note that this command
succeeds if the device is already initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METADATA STATE <br>
The luksmeta show command displays the current state of
slots on the LUKSv1 block device. If no slot is specified,
it prints a table consisting of the slot number, the
corre&acirc; <br>
sponding LUKSv1 slot state and the UUID of the data stored
in the luksmeta slot (or &quot;empty&quot; if no data is
stored). If a slot is specified, this command simply prints
out the UUID <br>
of the data in the slot. If the slot does not contain data,
it prints nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANAGING METADATA <br>
Managing the metadata in the slots is performed with three
commands: luksmeta save, luksmeta load and luksmeta wipe.
These commands write metadata to a slot, read metadata from
a <br>
slot and erase metadata in a slot, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The luksmeta save command reads
metadata on standard input and writes it to the specified
slot using the specified UUID. If no slot is specified,
luksmeta will search for the <br>
first slot number for which the LUKSv1 slot is inactive and
the luksmeta slot is empty. This represents the only
official correlation between LUKSv1 slots and luksmeta
slots. In <br>
this case, the metadata is written to the first applicable
slot using the specified UUID and the slot number is printed
to standard output. In either case, this command will <br>
never overwrite existing data. To replace data in a slot you
will need to execute luksmeta wipe before luksmeta save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The luksmeta load command reads
data from the specified slot and writes it to standard
output. If a UUID is specified, the command will verify that
the UUID associated with the <br>
metadata in the slot matches the specified UUID. This type
check helps to ensure that you always receive the type of
data you are expecting as output. If the UUIDs do not match,
<br>
the command will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The luksmeta wipe command erases
the data from the given slot. If a UUID is specified, the
command will verify that the UUID associated with the
metadata in the slot matches the <br>
specified UUID. This type check helps to ensure that you
only erase the data you intended to erase. Because this is a
destructive operation, this command will require user
con&acirc; <br>
firmation before any data is erased, unless the -f option is
supplied. Note that this command succeeds if you attempt to
wipe a slot that is already empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The amount of storage in the LUKSv1 header gap is extremely
limited. It also varies based upon the configuration used by
LUKSv1 at device initialization time. In some LUKSv1
con&acirc; <br>
figurations, there is not even enough space for all the
metadata slots even at the smallest possible slot size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the design of this
utility, we considered it likely that users would want to
reduce the number of usable slots in exchange for more
storage space in the slots used. In <br>
order to provide this flexibility, the amount of storage
available per-slot is dynamic. Put simply, slots are not a
fixed size. This means that it is possible (and even
somewhat <br>
likely) to encounter an error during luksmeta save
indicating that there is insufficient space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This error is not a programming
bug. If you encounter this error it likely means that either
all space is being consumed by the already-written slots or
that the metadata you are <br>
attempting to write simply does not fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can attempt to resolve this
problem by calling luksmeta wipe on slots that are no longer
in use. This will release the storage space for use by other
slots. Note that <br>
luksmeta does not, however, currently perform
defragmentation since the number of usable blocks is rather
limited. You can attempt to manually get around this by
extracting all <br>
slot data, wiping the slots and reloading them in order.
However, this operation is potentially dangerous and should
be undertaken with great care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d DEVICE, --device=DEVICE <br>
The device on which to perform the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SLOT, --slot=SLOT <br>
The slot number on which to perform the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u UUID, --uuid=UUID <br>
The UUID to associate with the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Forcibly suppress all user prompting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
This command uses the return values as defined by sysexit.h.
The following are general errors whose meaning is shared by
all luksmeta commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_OK : The
operation was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_OSERR : An
undefined operating system error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_USAGE : The
program was called with invalid parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_IOERR : An IO
error occurred when writing to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_OSFILE : The
device is not initialized or is corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_NOPERM : The
user did not grant permission during confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_NOINPUT : An
error occured while reading from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_DATAERR : The
specified UUID does not match the slot UUID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EX_CANTCREAT :
There is insufficient space in LUKSv1 header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, luksmeta save will
return EX_UNAVAILABLE when you attempt to save data into a
slot that is already used. Likewise, luksmeta load will
return EX_UNAVAILABLE when you <br>
attempt to read from an empty slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Ensure that a device is initialized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ luksmeta test -d /dev/sdz ||
luksmeta init -f -d /dev/sdz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write some data to a slot:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ UUID=&lsquo;uuidgen&lsquo;
<br>
$ echo $UUID <br>
31c25e3b-b8e2-4eaa-a427-23aa882feef2 <br>
$ echo &quot;Hello, World&quot; | luksmeta save -d /dev/sdz
-s 0 -u $UUID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read the data back:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ luksmeta load -d /dev/sdz -s 0
-u $UUID <br>
Hello, World</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wipe the data from the slot:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ luksmeta wipe -d /dev/sdz -s 0
-u $UUID</p>
