<p>PROCINFO-NG(8) Linux System Manual PROCINFO-NG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
procinfo - display system statistics gathered from /proc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
procinfo [ -dDSbrhv ] [ -nN ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
procinfo gathers some system data from the /proc directory
and prints it nicely formatted on the standard output
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meanings of the fields are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory: <br>
See the man page for free(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bootup: <br>
The time the system was booted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load average: <br>
The average number of jobs running, followed by the number
of runnable processes and the total number of processes,
followed by the PID of the last process run. The pid of <br>
the last running process will probably always be
procinfo&rsquo;s PID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user: The amount of time spent
running jobs in user space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice: The amount of time spent
running niced jobs in user space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system: <br>
The amount of time spent running in kernel space. Note: the
time spent servicing interrupts is not counted by the kernel
(and nothing that procinfo can do about it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle: The amount of time spent
doing nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uptime: <br>
The time that the system has been up. The above four should
more or less add up to this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">page in: <br>
The number of disk blocks paged into core from disk. 1 block
is equal to 1 kiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">page out: <br>
The number of disk blocks paged out of core to disk. This
includes regular disk-writes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap in: <br>
The number of memory pages paged in from swap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap out: <br>
The number of memory pages paged out to swap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context: <br>
The number of context switches, either since bootup or per
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disk stats(hda, hdb, sda, sdb):
<br>
The number of reads and writes made to disks, whether
CD-ROM, hard-drive, or USB. Shows all disks if they either
are an hdX or sdX, or if they have a non-zero read/write
<br>
count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interrupts: <br>
Number of interrupts serviced since boot, or per interval,
listed per IRQ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-nN Pause N second between updates. This option implies -f.
It may contain a decimal point. The default is 5 seconds.
When run by root with a pause of 0 seconds, the program <br>
will run at the highest possible priority level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d For memory, CPU times,
paging, swapping, disk, context and interrupt stats, display
values per second rather than totals. This option implies
-f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Same as -d, except that
memory stats are displayed as totals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S When running with -d or -D,
always show values per second, even when running with -n N
with N greater than one second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Display numbers of bytes
rather than number of I/O requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r This option adds an extra
line to the memory info showing &rsquo;real&rsquo; free
memory, just as free(1) does. The numbers produced assume
that Buffers and Cache are disposable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Displays memory stats in
&rsquo;Human&rsquo; (base 1024) numbers (KiB, MiB, GiB),
instead of implied KBytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a brief help
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS <br>
When running procinfo fullscreen, you can change its
behaviour by pressing d, D, S, r and b, which toggle the
flags that correspond to their same-named
commandline-options. In <br>
addition you can press q which quits the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc The proc file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
All of these statistics are taken verbatim from the kernel,
without any scaling. Any case where the kernel specifies
that a particular field means something different from how
<br>
it is documented in this man-page, the kernel always
wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some features of the original
procinfo were elided, as they were considered non-useful,
especially as many of them don&rsquo;t change anymore, and
have better utilities for list&acirc; <br>
ing/displaying them.</p>
