<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
loopctrl - configure isdnloop ISDN driver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
loopctrl [-d Driver-Id] action options ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
loopctrl is used to setup the isdnloop ISDN driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Driver-Id <br>
selects the virtual S0 interface named by Driver-Id.
Driver-Ids are defined during driver initialisation. See
isdnloop(4) for a description of the syntax to be used for
<br>
modularised and monolithic driver versions. This option must
be used to identify the virtual S0 interface if more than
one S0 interface is existent. If a single virtual <br>
S0 interface is used, it may be omitted. If using more than
one virtual card, support for the other cards is enabled
with the add action of loopctrl. Ids may not start <br>
with digits or small x, because these values are
misinterpreted as numeric parameters by insmod. For loading
the module, always the newest modutils package should be
used <br>
to avoid problems during load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following actions may be
given to loopctrl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add [id] <br>
enables support for an additional virtual card in the
driver. If id is missing, adds a card with an id given by
the system. with id given, adds a card with an Id given by
<br>
the user. Ids are checked against conflicts, and if a
conflict happens, replaced by the system in the same manner
as if no Id was supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leased on|off <br>
switches between normal (dialup) and leased-line mode.
Leased-line mode is intended for usage with S64K-lines or -
if both channels are used - for S02. These lines do not <br>
have a D-channel. When leased-line mode is enabled, the
driver simulates incoming calls using special
&quot;phone-numbers&quot; for calling and called address
which are generated as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling number: <br>
LEASEDx <br>
where x is the internal slot-number of the S0 interface.
This number starts with 0 for the first S0 interface and is
incremented by one for every S0 inter&acirc; <br>
face configured using the add action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Called number: <br>
x <br>
where x is equal to the channel number of the calling S0
interface starting with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start protocol phone1 [phone2
phone3] <br>
starts the driver with the given D-channel protocol. If
protocol is 1tr6, only phone1 has to be given. It is meant
to be the base number of the virtual S0 interface to <br>
which the EAZ is appended. If protocol is dss1, phone1,
phone2 and phone3 have to be given and represent the three
MSNs of the virtual S0 interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump is available if the program
is configured using the --enable-dump option only. The
contents of internal driver variables is dumped on
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This program and the isdnloop driver are ALPHA code. The
main intention for this driver is for testing the link level
and applications.</p>
