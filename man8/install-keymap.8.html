<b>install-keymap</b> [<i>keymap-name</i> | NONE | KERNEL]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>install-keymap</b> usually takes a <i>keymap-name</i> as argument. The file
  is passed to <b>loadkeys</b> for loading, so that valid values for this
  argument are the same than that of arguments to <b>loadkeys</b>.
  <b>install-keymap</b> expands include-like statements in that file, and puts
  the result in <b>/etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz</b>, which will be loaded into
  the kernel at boot-time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One may also specify <b>KERNEL</b> instead of a keymap name, causing
  <b>/etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz</b> to be removed, making sure that no custom
  keymap will replace the kernel's builtin keymap at next reboot.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An argument of <b>NONE</b> tells the command to do nothing. It can be used by
  caller scripts to avoid handling this special case and needlessly duplicate
  code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The purpose of this processing is to solve an annoying problem, of 2 apparently
  conflicting issues. The first one is an important goal of keymap management in
  Debian, namely ensuring that whenever the user or admin is expected to use the
  keyboard, the keymap selected as boot-time keymap is in use; this means the
  keymap has to be loaded before a shell is ever proposed, which means very
  early in the booting process, and especially before all local filesystems are
  mounted ( <b>/etc/rcS.d/S10checkroot.sh</b> can spawn <b>sulogin</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second issue is that for flexibility we allow that <b>/usr</b> or
  <b>/usr/share</b> may live on their own partition(s), and thus
  <b>/usr/share/keymaps</b>, where keymap files live, may not be available for
  reading at the time we need a keymap file. And no, we won't put 1Mb of keymaps
  in the root partition just for this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
And the problem is, most keymap files are not self-contained, so it does not
  help to just copy the selected file into the root partition. The best known
  solution so far is to expand the keymap file so that it becomes
  self-contained, and put it in the root partition. That's what this tool does.
