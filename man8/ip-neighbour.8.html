<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ip-neighbour - neighbour/arp tables management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ip [ OPTIONS ] neigh { COMMAND | help }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neigh { add | del | change |
replace } { ADDR [ lladdr LLADDR ] [ nud STATE ] | proxy
ADDR } [ dev DEV ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neigh { show | flush } [
proxy ] [ to PREFIX ] [ dev DEV ] [ nud STATE ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATE := { permanent | noarp |
stale | reachable | none | incomplete | delay | probe |
failed }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ip neigh command manipulates neighbour objects that
establish bindings between protocol addresses and link layer
addresses for hosts sharing the same link. Neighbour entries
<br>
are organized into tables. The IPv4 neighbour table is also
known by another name - the ARP table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The corresponding commands
display neighbour bindings and their properties, add new
neighbour entries and delete old ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neighbour add <br>
add a new neighbour entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neighbour change <br>
change an existing entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neighbour replace <br>
add a new entry or change an existing one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These commands create new
neighbour records or update existing ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to ADDRESS (default) <br>
the protocol address of the neighbour. It is either an IPv4
or IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev NAME <br>
the interface to which this neighbour is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lladdr LLADDRESS <br>
the link layer address of the neighbour. LLADDRESS can also
be null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nud STATE <br>
the state of the neighbour entry. nud is an abbreviation for
&rsquo;Neighbour Unreachability Detection&rsquo;. The state
can take one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permanent <br>
the neighbour entry is valid forever and can be only be
removed administratively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noarp the neighbour entry is
valid. No attempts to validate this entry will be made but
it can be removed when its lifetime expires.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reachable <br>
the neighbour entry is valid until the reachability timeout
expires.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stale the neighbour entry is
valid but suspicious. This option to ip neigh does not
change the neighbour state if it was valid and the address
is not changed by <br>
this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none this is a pseudo state used
when initially creating a neighbour entry or after trying to
remove it before it becomes free to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">incomplete <br>
the neighbour entry has not (yet) been
validated/resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delay neighbor entry validation
is currently delayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">probe neighbor is being
probed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failed max number of probes
exceeded without success, neighbor validation has ultimately
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neighbour delete <br>
delete a neighbour entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments are the same as
with ip neigh add, except that lladdr and nud are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Attempts to delete or
manually change a noarp entry created by the kernel may
result in unpredictable behaviour. Particularly, the kernel
may try to resolve this <br>
address even on a NOARP interface or if the address is
multicast or broadcast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neighbour show <br>
list neighbour entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to ADDRESS (default) <br>
the prefix selecting the neighbours to list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev NAME <br>
only list the neighbours attached to this device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proxy list neighbour
proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unused only list neighbours
which are not currently in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nud STATE <br>
only list neighbour entries in this state. NUD_STATE takes
values listed below or the special value all which means all
states. This option may occur more than <br>
once. If this option is absent, ip lists all entries except
for none and noarp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neighbour flush <br>
flush neighbour entries <br>
This command has the same arguments as show. The differences
are that it does not run when no arguments are given, and
that the default neighbour states to be flushed do <br>
not include permanent and noarp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -statistics option, the
command becomes verbose. It prints out the number of deleted
neighbours and the number of rounds made to flush the
neighbour table. If the <br>
option is given twice, ip neigh flush also dumps all the
deleted neighbours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
ip neighbour <br>
Shows the current neighbour table in kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip neigh flush dev eth0 <br>
Removes entries in the neighbour table on device eth0.</p>
