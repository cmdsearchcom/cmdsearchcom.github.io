<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/var/spool/hylafax/bin/notify qfile why jobtime [ nextTry
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bin/notify is the command script invoked by the facsimile
server to notify a user about the status of an outbound job.
The default notification script sends the user electronic
<br>
mail describing the event or action. The arguments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qfile the pathname of the job
description file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">why a string that specifies why
the user is being notified; one of: <br>

requeued for retry <br>

&Acirc;&sup1; A final job state <br>
&Acirc;&sup2; A transcript of the failed communication is
returned to the sender. <br>
&Acirc;&sup3; No emails are sent for the block state, the
job has been neither requeued nor done, but remains waiting
in the queue for the ability to be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobtime the total transmission
time of a successful job or the connect time of a failed
request (passed as a string).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nextTry the time (passed as a
string) at which the next attempt will be made to complete
the job. This parameter is passed only if why is
&lsquo;&lsquo;requeued&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The behavior of notify is intended to be customizable via
the etc/FaxNotify script, if present. FaxNotify is sourced
after the q-file is parsed and all default values are
pre&acirc; <br>
set. Useful settings for FaxNotify are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY is identical to why
mentioned above and can be useful in determining under what
conditions various settings should take effect. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ &quot;$WHY&quot; !=
&quot;done&quot; ]; then <br>
RETURNFILETYPE=pdf; <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would only set
RETURNFILETYPE when the job did not complete
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURNFILETYPE <br>
can be set to &lsquo;&lsquo;tif&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;pdf&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;ps&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;original&rsquo;&rsquo;. If set, this causes
notify to return a copy of the submitted documents to the
SENDER address along with the noti&acirc; <br>
fication message. The &lsquo;&lsquo;original&rsquo;&rsquo;
setting uses the format type that was used in the
submission. Multiple values may be specified by separating
them with whitespace. In <br>
that case a separate attachment is created for each
filetype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPLATE <br>
the template subdirectory to use when sending e-mails.
HylaFAX ships with a base set of templates, and some direct
translations. To use the German translated templates, <br>
set TEMPLATE=de in FaxNotify. This is relative to the base
template directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY_FAXMASTER <br>
is used to deliver a notification message to TOADDR (which
defaults to &lsquo;&lsquo;FaxMaster&rsquo;&rsquo;) that
contains technical information about the job. This is useful
in allowing the <br>
administrator to be aware of any problems before those
problems are reported by the users. Possible settings are
&lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;always&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;never&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;errors&rsquo;&rsquo;. <br>
If &lsquo;&lsquo;errors&rsquo;&rsquo; is used then the
notification message is only sent to FaxMaster when the job
experienced an error. The default is
&lsquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The settings of the user in
$notify (read from the sendq job file) controls whether the
user will get the notification email. If you want to force
notification emails, irregard&acirc; <br>
less of the users selection, or force a blocked notification
(which is not sent by default), you can set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify=&quot;always&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will force the notify
script to send the email.</p>
