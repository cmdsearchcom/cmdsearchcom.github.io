<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipmiseld - IPMI SEL logging daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmiseld [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ipmiseld daemon polls the system event log (SEL) of
specified hosts and stores the logs into the local syslog.
By default, the daemon can also make best efforts to manage
the <br>
remote SEL&rsquo;s buffer to ensure events are never lost.
Recent logging data will be cached to disk to ensure that
SEL events are not missed in the event the client or server
is <br>
rebooted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the options for this
daemon are very similar to the ipmi-sel(8) tool. It can be
configured to log the local host, a remote host, or a range
of hosts to the local syslog. <br>
It can be configured via the command line arguments listed
below or via the /etc/freeipmi//ipmiseld.conf configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are general IPMI
options, tool specific options, trouble shooting
information, workaround information, examples, and known
issues. For a general introduction to <br>
FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
The following options are general options for configuring
IPMI communication and executing general tool commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D IPMIDRIVER,
--driver-type=IPMIDRIVER <br>

respectively. The currently available inband drivers are
KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI, and SUNBMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-auto-probe <br>
Do not probe in-band IPMI devices for default settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--driver-address=DRIVER-ADDRESS
<br>
Specify the in-band driver address to be used instead of the
probed value. DRIVER-ADDRESS should be prefixed with

optional port can be specified with each host, which may be
useful in port forwarding or similar situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
<br>
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the
remote host. If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous)
username is assumed. The user must have atleast USER
priv&acirc; <br>
ileges in order for this tool to operate fully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<br>
Specify the password to use when authenticationg with the
remote host. If not specified, a null password is assumed.
Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for <br>
IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --password-prompt <br>

--authentication-type=AUTHENTICATION-TYPE <br>
Specify the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The
currently available authentication types are NONE,
STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I CIPHER-SUITE-ID,
--cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID <br>
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0
communi&acirc; <br>
cation. The authentication algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signa&acirc; <br>
tures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The following cipher suite <br>
ids are currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Authentication Algorithm =
None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
= None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Authentication Algorithm =

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l PRIVILEGE-LEVEL,
--privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL <br>
Specify the privilege level to be used. The currently
available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-file=FILE <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W WORKAROUNDS,
--workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS <br>
Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
command line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
work&acirc; <br>
arounds (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Turn on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMISELD OPTIONS <br>
The following options are specific to Ipmiseld.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Log verbose information. This
option will log additional information. Most notably it will
output additional hex codes to given information on
ambiguous SEL entries or <br>
SEL records. For example, it will output Generator ID hex
codes for sensors without names. Additional non-critical SEL
errors or issues will also be logged. Somewhat com&acirc;
<br>
mon errors, such as timeouts or invalid hostnames, will
output with increased verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t SENSOR-TYPE-LIST,
--sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST <br>
Specify sensor types of SEL events to log. By default, all
sensor types are logged. A special command line type of
&quot;all&quot;, will indicate all types should be shown
(may be <br>
useful for overriding configured defaults). Multiple types
can be separated by commas or spaces. Users may specify
sensor types by string (see --list-sensor-types in <br>
ipmi-sel(8)) or by number (decimal or hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T SENSOR-TYPE-LIST,
--exclude-sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST <br>
Specify sensor types of SEL events to not log. By default,
no sensor types are filtered. A special command line type of
&quot;none&quot;, will indicate no types should be excluded
<br>
(may be useful for overriding configured defaults). Multiple
types can be separated by commas or spaces. Users may
specify sensor types by string (see --list-sensor-types <br>
in ipmi-sel(8)) or by number (decimal or hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system-event-only <br>
Log only system event records (i.e. don&rsquo;t log OEM
records).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oem-event-only <br>
Log only OEM event records (i.e. don&rsquo;t log system
event records).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--event-state-config-file=FILE
<br>
Specify an alternate event state configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interpret-oem-data <br>
Attempt to interpret OEM data, such as event data, sensor
readings, or general extra info, etc. If an OEM
interpretation is not available, the default output will be
gen&acirc; <br>
erated. Correctness of OEM interpretations cannot be
guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors may make in
products, firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION below for
<br>
confirmed supported motherboard interpretations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--entity-sensor-names <br>
Output sensor names prefixed with their entity id and
instance number when appropriate. This may be necessary on
some motherboards to help identify what sensors are
refer&acirc; <br>
encing. For example, a motherboard may have multiple sensors
named &rsquo;TEMP&rsquo;. The entity id and instance number
may help clarify which sensor refers to &quot;Processor
1&quot; vs. <br>
&quot;Processor 2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-abbreviated-units <br>
Output non-abbreviated units (e.g. &rsquo;Amps&rsquo;
instead of &rsquo;A&rsquo;). May aid in disambiguation of
units (e.g. &rsquo;C&rsquo; for Celsius or Coulombs).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--event-state-filter=FILTERSTRING
<br>
Specify event states to be filtered out and not logged.
Possible inputs are NOMINAL, WARNING, CRITICAL, and NA.
Multiple states can be listed separted by comma. The
spe&acirc; <br>
cial case string of &quot;none&quot; will indicate no event
states should be excluded (may be useful for overriding
configured defaults).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warning-threshold=PERCENTINT
<br>
Specify SEL fullness warning threshold as an integer
percentage. When the SEL is past this percentage full, a
warning will be output indicating that SEL is nearly full.
<br>
Specify 0 to disable warning logs. Defaults to 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear-threshold=PERCENTINT
<br>
Specify SEL fullness clear threshold as an integer
percentage. When the SEL is past this percentage full,
ipmiseld will attempt to clear the SEL. Specify 0 to disable
<br>
clearing. When the SEL is full, it will be the
responsibility of the user to clear the SEL manually if
clearing is disabled. Defaults to 0. If specified to a
non-zero <br>
value, be careful that the clearing of the SEL could affect
other applications that monitor the SEL, such as monitoring
applications that use ipmi-sel(8) or libipmimoni&acirc; <br>
toring(3).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system-event-format=FORMATSTRING
<br>
Specify the format of the log output when a SEL system event
is encountered. Defaults to &quot;SEL System Event: %d, %t,
%s, %I, %E&quot; if logging locally, &quot;SEL System
Event(%h): <br>
%d, %t, %s, %I, %E&quot; if logging outofband or with
hostranges. See SEL LOG FORMAT STRING below for formatting
details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oem-timestamped-event-format=FORMATSTRING
<br>
Specify the format of the log output when a SEL OEM
timestamped event is encountered. Defaults to &quot;SEL OEM
Event: %d, %t, %I, %o&quot; if logging locally, &quot;SEL
OEM Event(%h): <br>
%d, %t, %I, %o&quot; if logging outofband or with
hostranges.. See SEL LOG FORMAT STRING below for formatting
details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oem-non-timestamped-event-format=FORMATSTRING
<br>
Specify the format of the log output when a SEL OEM
non-timestamped event is encountered. Defaults to &quot;SEL
OEM Event: %I, %o&quot; if logging locally, &quot;SEL OEM
Event(%h): %I, <br>
%o&quot; if logging outofband or with hostranges.. See SEL
LOG FORMAT STRING below for formatting details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--poll-interval=SECONDS <br>
Specify the poll interval to check the SEL for new events.
Defaults to 300 seconds (i.e. 5 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-facility=STRING <br>
Specify the log facility to use. Defaults to LOG_DAEMON.
Legal inputs are LOG_DAEMON, LOG_USER, LOG_LOCAL0,
LOG_LOCAL1, LOG_LOCAL2, LOG_LOCAL3, LOG_LOCAL4, LOG_LOCAL5,
<br>
LOG_LOCAL6, LOG_LOCAL7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-priority=STRING <br>
Specify the log priority to use. Defaults to LOG_ERR. Legal
inputs are LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR,
LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache-directory=DIRECTORY <br>
Specify an alternate cache directory location for ipmiseld
to use. The cache directory will be used to cache a wide
variety of data, including the SDR and recent logging <br>
information to ensure log entries are not missed on reboots
and other system failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-sdr <br>
Ignore SDR related processing. May lead to incomplete or
less useful information being output, however it will allow
functionality for systems without SDRs or when the <br>
correct SDR cannot be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--re-download-sdr <br>
Re-download the SDR on start even if it is not out of date.
This may help work around systems that do not properly
timestamp SDR modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear-sel <br>
On startup, clear any SEL being monitored. May be useful the
first time running ipmiseld to avoid warning messages or SEL
clears until a long time in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--threadpool-count=NUM <br>
Specify the number of threads for parallel SEL polling. This
option is very similar to the --fanout option in ipmi-sel(8)
but the threads are created only once on initial&acirc; <br>
ization for faster processing. Defaults to 8, however the
threadpool count will always be decreased if the number of
nodes specified is less than the number of threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test-run <br>
Do not daemonize, output the current SEL of configured hosts
as a test of current settings and configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foreground <br>
Run daemon in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEL LOG FORMAT STRING <br>
The output format of log messages can be adjusted via the
--system-event-format, --oem-timestamped-event-format and
--oem-non-timestamped-event-format options. Options such as
<br>
--interpret-oem-data, --entity-sensor-names, and
--non-abbreviated-units can further adjust the output
format. The following conversion directives will allow the
user to output <br>
specifics of each SEL event that occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For System, OEM timestamped, and
OEM non-timestamped events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%h - target host, useful if
logging from multiple hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i - record ID in decimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%I - event state interpretation
(NOMINAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For System and OEM timestamped
events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t - time in format H:M:S using
24 hour clock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%d - date in format D-M-YEAR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For System events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T - sensor type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s - sensor name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%e - event data 1 string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%f - event data 2 string [2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%h - event data 3 string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c - combined event data 2 and
event data 3 string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%p - event data 2 previous state
string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%S - event data 2 severity
string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%E - combined event data 1, 2,
and 3 string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%k - event direction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For OEM timestamped events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m - manufacturer id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For OEM timestamped and OEM
non-timestamped events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%o - oem data in hex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%O - OEM supplied string
describing the event (depends on manufacturer)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTRANGED SUPPORT <br>
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma
separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the
general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt;
k, etc. The <br>
later form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19]
does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a
<br>
degenerate range: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This range syntax is meant only
as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming
convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list <br>
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of range usage
follow: <br>
foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 <br>
foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10 <br>
foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a reminder to the reader,
some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern
matching. Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to
enclose ranged lists within <br>
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In-band IPMI Communication will
be used when the host &quot;localhost&quot; is specified.
This allows the user to add the localhost into the
hostranged output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN problems involve a
misconfiguration of the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double
check to make sure the following are configured properly in
the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC: IP <br>
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connec&acirc; <br>
tions, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration <br>
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inband IPMI problems are
typically caused by improperly configured drivers or
non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to
also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listed below are many of the
common issues for error messages. For additional support,
please e-mail the &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;username invalid&quot; -
The username entered (or a NULL username if none was
entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also
be possible the remote BMC&rsquo;s username con&acirc; <br>
figuration is incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password invalid&quot; -
The password entered (or a NULL password if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the
password for the user is not correctly configured <br>
on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;password verification
timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed out. A
&quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above) or a
generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. <br>
During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The
K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is
not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level
insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher user
privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may <br>
require authenticating to a different user which has a
higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege level cannot be
obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege level you are
attempting to authenticate with is higher than the maximum
allowed for this user. Please try <br>
again with a lower privilege. It may also be possible the
maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try <br>
again with an alternate authentication type or alternate
privilege level. It may also be possible the available
authentication types you can authenticate with are not
correctly <br>
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher suite id
unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may <br>
also be possible the available cipher suite ids are not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
- IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please
try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection timeout&quot; -
Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of potential
errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be <br>
resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the
network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration
and connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;session timeout&quot; -
The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect. If this
error occurs often, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are con&acirc; <br>
siderably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;device not found&quot; -
The specified device could not be found. Please check
configuration or inputs and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;message timeout&quot; -
Communication with the driver or device has timed out.
Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC busy&quot; - The BMC
is currently busy. It may be processing information or have
too many simultaneous sessions to manage. Please wait and
try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;could not find inband
device&quot; - An inband device could not be found. Please
check configuration or specify specific device or driver on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver timeout&quot; - The
inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC
or service processor. The BMC or service processor may be
busy or (worst case) possibly non- <br>
functioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;internal IPMI error&quot;
- An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how
to handle. Please e-mail &lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; to
report the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPMISELD TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Some timestamps in the SEL may report a date of 1-Jan-1970,
the epoch for SEL timestamps. This timestamp is not
necessarily incorrect. It usually indicates a hardware event
that <br>
occurred before a timestamp in firmware has been
initialized. For example, certain hardware components will
have their internal clocks reset during a power cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the internal clock
of the SEL appears to be regularly incorrect, you may need
to set the SEL time. This can be done using
bmc-device(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are common SEL
related messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;sel config file parse
error&quot; - A parse error was found in the sel event
interpretation configuration file. Please see
freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKAROUNDS <br>
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI
solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of
work&acirc; <br>
arounds currently available to handle discovered compliance
issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented so
they will be transparent to the user. However, some will
<br>
require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardware listed below may
only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on.
Newer versions of hardware may fix the problems indicated
below. Similar machines from <br>
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds <br>
listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe your hardware has
an additional compliance issue that needs a workaround to be
implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI maintainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or <br>
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumeio - This workaround flag
will assume inband interfaces communicate with system I/O
rather than being memory-mapped. This will work around
systems that report invalid base <br>
addresses. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;device not
supported&quot; or &quot;could not find inband device&quot;
errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spinpoll - This workaround flag
will inform some inband drivers (most notably the KCS
driver) to spin while polling rather than putting the
process to sleep. This may signifi&acirc; <br>
cantly improve the wall clock running time of tools because
an operating system scheduler&rsquo;s granularity may be
much larger than the time it takes to perform a single IPMI
message <br>
transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool
for a more useful task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authcap - This workaround flag
will skip early checks for username capabilities,
authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI
authentication to succeed. It works <br>
around multiple issues in which the remote system does not
properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see <br>
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel <br>
SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochecksumcheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums <br>
due to implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise
valid. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes validation of packet integrity in a number of
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most
situations. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification time&acirc; <br>
out&quot; errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the
&quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround may also needed too.
Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F,
and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idzero - This workaround flag
will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client.
It works around IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs
to the client. Those hitting <br>
this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpectedauth - This workaround
flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked
as though they were expected. It works around an issue when
packets contain non-null <br>
authentication data when they should be null due to disabled
per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell
Pow&acirc; <br>
erEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forcepermsg - This workaround
flag will force per-message authentication to be used no
matter what is advertised by the remote system. It works
around an issue when per-message <br>
authentication is advertised as disabled on the remote
system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue <br>
observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endianseq - This workaround flag
will flip the endian of the session sequence numbers to
allow the session to continue properly. It works around IPMI
1.5 session sequence numbers <br>
that are the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noauthcodecheck - This
workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command
responses. It works around systems that return <br>
invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the validity <br>
of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is
unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting this issue
may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session
timeout&quot;, or &quot;password veri&acirc; <br>
fication timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Xyratex
FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intel20 - This workaround flag
will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include padding of usernames, and
password truncation if the <br>
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with <br>
Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermicro20 - This workaround
flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0
authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI
firmware. The issues covered include han&acirc; <br>
dling invalid length authentication codes. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors.
Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card.
Confirmed <br>
fixed on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sun20 - This workaround flag
will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication
issues. The issues covered include invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and <br>
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround <br>
automatically includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot;
workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opensesspriv - This workaround
flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s IPMI 2.0
connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing
algorithm used by the remote system. The privi&acirc; <br>
lege level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those
hit&acirc; <br>
ting this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;,
&quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status
code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500
with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu <br>
II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and
Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is
automatically trig&acirc; <br>
gered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integritycheckvalue - This
workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check
value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using
Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity <br>
check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermi&acirc; <br>
cro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assumesystemevent - This
workaround option will assume invalid SEL record types are
system event records. Records may be formatted correctly but
report invalid record types. <br>
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;Unknown SEL Record
Type&quot; errors. Output may be unknown, pray for the best.
This option is confirmed to work around compliances issues
on HP DL <br>
380 G5 motherboards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some
motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not
support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection <br>
timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be worked around by
using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
--driver-type=LAN_2_0. Issue observed on HP Proliant DL
145.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OEM INTERPRETATION <br>
The following motherboards are confirmed to have atleast
some support by the --interpret-oem-data option. While
highly probable the OEM data interpretations would work
across <br>
other motherboards by the same manufacturer, there are no
guarantees. Some of the motherboards below may be rebranded
by vendors/distributors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
On older operating systems, if you input your username,
password, and other potentially security relevant
information on the command line, this information may be
discovered by <br>
other users when using tools like the ps(1) command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K <br>
options. Configuring security relevant information in the
FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way
to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent brute force
attacks, some BMCs will temporarily &quot;lock up&quot;
after a number of remote authentication errors. You may need
to wait awhile in order to this tempo&acirc; <br>
rary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may authenticate
again.</p>
