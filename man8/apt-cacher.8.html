<p>APT-CACHER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
APT-CACHER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apt-cacher - caching proxy for Debian packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Server: <br>
apt-cacher [-h|--help] [-i|-d] [-c configfile] [-p pidfile]
[-r directory] [-R retries] [config_option=foo]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client: <br>

http://apt-cacher.server:3142[/apt-cacher]/{mirror}/{distribution}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Apt-cacher is a caching proxy for Debian packages, allowing
a number of computers to share a single cache. Packages
requested from the cache only need to be downloaded from the
<br>
Debian mirrors once, no matter how many local machines need
to install them. This saves network bandwidth, improves
performance for users, and reduces the load on the
mirrors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to proxying and
caching HTTP requests, apt-cacher can proxy and cache FTP
and HTTPS GET/HEAD requests, Debian bugs SOAP requests and
proxy (but not cache) HTTPS CON&acirc; <br>
NECT requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config_option=value <br>
Override values in configuration file. Can be given multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Setting up apt-cacher involves two stages: installing
apt-cacher itself on a single machine on your network to act
as a server and configuring all client machines to use the
<br>
server&rsquo;s cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apt-cacher can be installed to
run either as a daemon [preferred] or as a CGI script on a
web server such as Apache [deprecated]. When a client
(apt-get(1), aptitude(8), synap&acirc; <br>
tic(8) etc.) requests a package from the cache machine, the
request is handled by apt-cacher which checks whether it
already has that particular package. If so, the package is
<br>
returned immediately to the client for installation. If not,
or if the package in the local cache has been superseded by
a more recent version, the package is fetched from the <br>
specified mirror. While being fetched it is simultaneously
streamed to the client, and also saved to the local cache
for future use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other client machines on your
network do not need apt-cacher installed in order to use the
server cache. The only modification on each client computer
is to direct it to use the <br>
server cache. See CLIENT CONFIGURATION below for ways of
doing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER INSTALLATION <br>
Apt-cacher can be installed in various ways on the server.
The recommended way is by running the program as a daemon.
This should give the best performance and the lowest overall
<br>
memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daemon Mode <br>
Stand-alone Daemon: <br>
Edit the file /etc/default/apt-cacher and change
AUTOSTART=1, then run (as root)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/init.d/apt-cacher start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to start the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inetd Daemon: <br>
Edit /etc/inetd.conf and add the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3142 stream tcp nowait www-data
/usr/sbin/apt-cacher apt-cacher -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restart or send SIGHUP to inetd
after saving the file. This is a good method if you do not
wish the daemon to be loaded all the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In either daemon mode, clients
can access the server using
http://apt-cacher.server:port/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: in inetd mode access
control checks are not performed and the allowed_hosts and
denied_hosts options have no effect. Access controls for
inetd can be implemented using <br>
using inetd or tcpd wrapper. See inetd.conf(5) and
hosts_access(5) for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CGI Mode <br>
This mode is deprecated and not recommended for long-term
use because it brings a visible performance impact on the
network and server speed. To use it you will need to ensure
<br>
your webserver supports CGI. Clients can access the server
using
http://apt-cacher.server[:port]/cgi-bin/apt-cacher/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Migration away from deprecated
CGI mode can be smoothed using the following configuration
options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi_advise_to_use [] <br>
This is a custom error message that is used to advise
clients to use an alternative to CGI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi_redirect [] <br>
If set, this option is an absolute URL that is used to
redirect any CGI requests. It can be used to seamlessly
redirect CGI access to an instance of apt-cacher running as
<br>
an INETD or stand-alone daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
<br>
Apt-cacher uses a configuration file for setting important
options. Additionally there are few command line options to
control behaviour. See COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default configuration file
is /etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf. It is read every time
the daemon starts or an inetd/CGI instance is executed.
Therefore a stand-alone daemon <br>
may need to be restarted or reloaded using the init script
in order to reread its configuration. A running daemon will
also reread the configuration file on receiving SIGHUP (see
<br>
SIGNALS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an alternative to editing the
configuration file, configuration fragments to override the
defaults can also be placed in a directory named conf.d in
the same directory as the <br>
main configuration file, e.g.
&rsquo;/etc/apt-cacher/conf.d/&rsquo;. Files placed here can
have an arbitrary name. They are read using glob(7)
semantics: case-insensitive, ascending ASCII <br>
order; dot-files (beginning with &rsquo;.&rsquo;) ignored.
Also, backup files ending with &rsquo;~&rsquo; and any files
ending with &Acirc;&acute;.disabled&rsquo; or
&rsquo;.dpkg-{old,new,dist,tmp}&rsquo; are also ignored.
Duplicate <br>
settings read later will override any previous ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in the file consists
of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configuration_option = value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long lines can be split by
preceding the newlines with &rsquo;&acute;. Whitespace is
ignored. Lines beginning with &rsquo;#&rsquo; are comments
and are ignored. If multiple assignments of the same <br>
option occur, only the last one will take effect. For binary
options, 0 means off or disabled, any other integer means on
or enabled. Options which can accept lists may use <br>
either &rsquo;;&rsquo; or &rsquo;,&rsquo; to separate the
individual list members. To include these separators within
a list item escape them with &rsquo;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options available in the
config file (and their default settings) are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Universal Options <br>
admin_email [root@localhost] <br>
The email address of the administrator is displayed in the
info page and traffic reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed_locations <br>
Only allow access to specific upstream mirrors. The
requested URL must match an item in this list for access to
be granted. The part of the URL referring to the apt-cacher
<br>
server itself (http://apt-cacher.server:port[/apt-cacher]/)
is ignored. Matching begins immediately after that. If
&rsquo;%PATH_MAP%&rsquo; in included in this option, it will
be <br>
expanded to the keys of the path_map setting. Note this item
contains string(s), not regexps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed_ssl_locations [] <br>
Only allow HTTPS/SSL proxy CONNECT to hosts or IPs which
match an item in this list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed_ssl_ports [443] <br>
Only allow HTTPS/SSL proxy CONNECT to ports which match an
item in this list. Adding further items to this can pose a
significant security risk. DO NOT do it unless you <br>
understand the full implications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache_dir
[/var/cache/apt-cacher] <br>
The directory where apt-cacher will store local copies of
all packages requested. This can grow to many hundreds of
MB, so make sure it is on a partition with plenty of <br>
room. NOTE: the cache directory needs to contain some
subdirectories for correct storage management. If you try to
create a custom directory, please use the script <br>
/usr/share/apt-cacher/install.pl or use the initially
created cache directory as example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">concurrent_import_limit [Number
of CPU cores from /proc/cpuinfo or 0] <br>
Importing new checksums can cause high CPU usage on slower
systems. This option sets a limit to the number of index
files that are imported simultaneously, thereby limit&acirc;
<br>
ing CPU load average, but, possibly, taking longer. Leave
unset or set to 0 for no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checksum [0] <br>
Switches on checksum validation of cached files. Checksum
validation will slow apt-cacher response as requested files
have to be downloaded completely before validation <br>
can occur. This slow down can be prevented by setting this
value to &rsquo;lazy&rsquo; in which case files will be
passed on as they are received and checked afterwards.
Requires <br>
package libberkeleydb-perl to be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checksum_files_regexp [see
default /etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
Perl regular expression (perlre(1)) which matches the URL
filename of all index files from which checksums are
imported into the checksum database if checksum mode is <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean_cache [1] <br>
Whether to flush obsolete versions of packages from your
cache daily. You can check what will be done by running</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-cleanup.pl
-s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will just show what would
be done to the contents of the cache. A package is only
obsolete if none of the (optional) namespaces, distributions
(stable, testing, etc) <br>
or architectures you use reference it. It should be safe to
leave this on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl_idle_timeout [120] <br>
The maximum time in seconds the libcurl backend will wait,
unused, before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl_ssl_insecure [] <br>
If this is set to 1, HTTPS GET requests (which are
inherently insecure as transfer from the proxy to the client
is unverified) is even less secure as the libcurl backend
<br>
skips peer verification with the upstream source. You really
shouldn&rsquo;t use this. HTTPS CONNECT proxying is more
secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl_throttle [10] <br>
Controls how fast the libcurl process runs. Increasing this
setting will reduce the CPU load of the libcurl process,
possibly at the expense of slower response times and a <br>
lower throughput. On most systems this option should be left
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data_timeout [120] <br>
Time in seconds which, if no data is received from upstream,
a request will timeout. This option used to be known as
fetch_timeout. The old name is still recognised for <br>
backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug [0] <br>
Whether debug mode is enabled. Off by default. When turned
on (non-nil), lots of extra debug information will be
written to the error log. This can make the error log <br>
become quite big, so only use it when trying to debug
problems. Additional information from the libcurl backend
can be obtained by increasing this parameter. The
corre&acirc; <br>
spondence between this setting and curl_infotype is:-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 CURLINFO_TEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 CURLINFO_HEADER_IN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 CURLINFO_HEADER_OUT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 CURLINFO_DATA_IN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 CURLINFO_DATA_OUT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 CURLINFO_SSL_DATA_IN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 CURLINFO_SSL_DATA_OUT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION in
curl_easy_setopt(3) for further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disk_usage_limit [] <br>
Optional upper limit for the disk space usage of cache_dir
in bytes. Units (k, KiB, M, MiB etc.) are recognised with
the same semantics as the rate limit option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distinct_namespaces [0] <br>
Set this to 1 to enable support for caching multiple
Distributions (e.g Debian and Ubuntu) from a single
apt-cacher instance. When enabled, package files are stored
in a <br>
subdirectory, the name of which is derived from the matching
key of path_map or the part of the URL preceding
&rsquo;pool&rsquo; or &rsquo;dists&rsquo;. This is typically
&Acirc;&acute;debian&rsquo;, &rsquo;ubuntu&rsquo; or <br>
&rsquo;security&rsquo;. This mechanism prevents clashes
between the Distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you enable this option, any
existing namespace specific package files which are not in
the correct subdirectory of cache_dir would be deleted by
apt-cacher-cleanup.pl. <br>
If you wish to keep them and import them into the correct
namespace then run (as root)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-import.pl
-u {cache_dir}/packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to limit the
possible namespaces see path_map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expire_hours [0] <br>
How many hours Package and Release files are cached before
they are assumed to be too old and must be re-fetched.
Setting 0 means that the validity of these files is <br>
checked on each access by comparing time stamps in HTTP
headers on the server with those stored locally. Use of this
setting is deprecated as HTTP header validation and <br>
sending If-Modified-Requests is much more efficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generate_reports [1] <br>
Whether to generate traffic reports daily. Traffic reports
can be accessed by pointing a browser to</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://apt-cacher.server:3142/report/
[daemon mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://apt-cacher.server[:port]/apt-cacher/report/
[CGI mode].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group [www-data] <br>
The effective group id to change to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_proxy [] <br>
Apt-cacher can pass all its requests to an external http
proxy like Squid, which could be very useful if you are
using an ISP that blocks port 80 and requires all web <br>
traffic to go through its proxy. The option takes a URI of
the form</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[protocol://][user[:password]@]hostname[:port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default protocol is http and
the default port is 1080.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_proxy_auth [] <br>
External http proxy sometimes need authentication to get
full access. The format is &rsquo;username:password&rsquo;,
eg: &rsquo;proxyuser:proxypass&rsquo;. This option is
deprecated. Proxy <br>
authentication details should be specified in the http_proxy
URI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index_files_regexp [see default
/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
Perl regular expression (perlre(1)) which matches the URL
filename of all index-type files (files that are uniquely
identified by their full path and need to be checked <br>
for freshness).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">installer_files_regexp [see
default /etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
Perl regular expression (perlre(1)) which matches the URL
filename of all files used by Aptitude, Apt, the
Debian/Ubuntu installer or Debian Live (files that are
uniquely <br>
identified by their full path but don&rsquo;t need to be
checked for freshness). Within this item the shorthand
&rsquo;%VALID_UBUNTU_RELEASE_NAMES%&rsquo; will be expanded
to the list con&acirc; <br>
figured in ubuntu_release_names as regexp alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface [] <br>
Specify a particular interface to use for the upstream
connection. Can be an interface name, IP address or host
name. If unset, the default route is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libcurl [] <br>
This is a list of configuration options for the libcurl
backend. Each item consists of the curl_easy_setopt(3)
option (without the CURLOPT_ prefix) and the desired
set&acirc; <br>
ting. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libcurl = dns_cache_timeout 300,
maxredirs 10, noproxy localhost;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be very careful with this.
Apt-cacher depends on the libcurl backend working in a
predictable way. You can very easily break things by
configuring this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit [0] <br>
Rate limiting sets the maximum rate in bytes per second used
for fetching files from the upstream mirrors. Optionally,
use SI unit abbreviations (&rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo;,
&rsquo;G&rsquo; etc.) for <br>
decimal multiples (1000) or &rsquo;KiB&rsquo;,
&rsquo;MiB&rsquo;, or &rsquo;GiB&rsquo; etc. for binary
(1024) multiples. Legacy lowercase suffixes based on wget(1)
syntax are interpreted as decimal for back&acirc; <br>
wards compatibility, but should be avoided in new
configurations. Use 0 for no rate limiting. By default this
setting is per libcurl connection. For global limiting, see
<br>
limit_global below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit_global [0] <br>
If set, this makes the specified rate limit apply overall.
The libcurl backend does not have good support for this, so
it is implemented by a simple division of the rate <br>
by the total number of downloads. There is no way for
downloads, dynamically, to use bandwidth released by another
idle/finished download. If you really want good global <br>
bandwidth control, don&rsquo;t use this option at all; use
traffic shaping instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_dir [/var/log/apt-cacher]
<br>
Directory to use for the access and error log files and
traffic report. The access log records all successful
package requests using a timestamp, whether the request was
<br>
fulfilled from cache, the IP address of the requesting
computer, the size of the package transferred, and the name
of the package. The error log records major faults, and <br>
is also used for debug messages if the debug directive is
set to 1. Debugging is toggled by sending SIGUSR1 (see
SIGNALS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was formerly named
&rsquo;logdir&rsquo;, but was renamed for consistency.
logdir is still recognised but should not be used for new
installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_loadavg [] <br>
If set this limits the maximum 1 minute loadavg permitted
for apt-cacher to attempt to handle an client
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offline_mode [0] <br>
Avoid making any outgoing connections, return files
available in the cache or just return errors if they are
missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package_files_regexp [see
default /etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
Perl regular expression (refer to the perlre(1) manpage)
which matches the URL filename of all package-type files
(files that are uniquely identified, within their
Distri&acirc; <br>
bution, by their filename).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_map [] <br>
A mapping scheme to rewrite URLs, which converts the first
part of the URL after the apt-cacher server name (the key)
to a remote mirror. For example, if you set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_map = debian
ftp.debian.org/debian</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retrieving</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://apt-cacher.server:3142/debian/dists/stable/Release</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will actually fetch</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://apt-cacher.server:3142/ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/Release</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If distinct_namespaces is set,
then you can use multiple mappings to cache different
Distributions separately. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_map = debian
ftp.debian.org/debian; ubuntu archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple, space separated,
mirrors can be given for each mapping. They will be tried in
order in the event of failure/unavailability of the previous
one. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_map = debian
ftp.uk.debian.org/debian ftp.debian.org/debian ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All path_map keys need to be
included in allowed_locations, if the latter is used. The
shorthand &rsquo;%PATH_MAP%&rsquo; can be used to simplify
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 4 internal path_map
settings for the Debian and Ubuntu changelog and AppStream
servers which will be merged with the specified
configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian-changelogs
packages.debian.org metadata.ftp-master.debian.org;
ubuntu-changelogs changelogs.ubuntu.com; debian-appstream
appstream.debian.org; ubuntu-app&acirc; <br>
stream appstream.ubuntu.com;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These can be overridden by
specifying an alternative mirror for that key, or deleted by
just specifying the key with no mirror.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdiff_files_regexp [see default
/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
Perl regular expression (perlre(1)) which matches APT pdiff
files. These are ed(1) scripts which APT use to patch index
files rather than redownloading the whole file <br>
afresh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return_buffer_size [1048576]
<br>
The buffer size that is used for reads when returning a file
using slower read/write loop. The default is 1MB. You may
wish to adjust this to trade speed against memory <br>
consumption. By default files are returned using sendfile(2)
which is much faster and does not make use of this
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reverse_path_map [1] <br>
This setting enables a reverse map from the requested URL to
the path_map key. It helps prevent having multiple copies of
the same file cached under different file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip_checksum_files_regexp [see
default /etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
Perl regular expression (perlre(1)) which matches the URL
filename for which checksum validation is not performed.
Note that all files matched by installer_files_regexp <br>
are automatically skipped and do not need to be added here
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soap_url_regexp [see default
/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
Perl regular expression (perlre(1)) which matches URLs that
are permitted as upstream source for apt-listbugs(1)
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-listbugs(1) makes requests
to the Debian Bugs server via SOAP POST requests. These are
not cached, but are simply passed through as a
convenience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supported_archs [see default
/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf] <br>
A list of Architectures that is supported and you wish to
allow in fetched filenames. &Acirc;&acute;all&Acirc;&acute;
and &Acirc;&acute;any&Acirc;&acute; are automatically added
to this list which is then used to expand <br>
%VALID_ARCHS% in *_files_regexp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_proxy use_proxy_auth
[obsolete] <br>
Use of external proxy and proxy authentication used to be
turned on or off with these options. They are now ignored
and an upstream proxy will always be used if config&acirc;
<br>
ured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_sendfile
[Sys::Syscall::sendfile_defined()] <br>
By default, if sendfile(2) is available on the system, it is
used to return files to client and is much more efficient
than read/write. The default, which is determined by <br>
the value returned by Sys::Syscall::sendfile_defined() can
be explicitly overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user [www-data] <br>
The effective user id to change to after allocating the
ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stand-alone Daemon-mode Options
<br>
allowed_hosts [] <br>
If your apt-cacher server is directly connected to the
Internet and you are worried about unauthorised fetching of
packages through it, you can specify a range of IP <br>
addresses that are allowed to use it. Localhost
(127.0.0.1/8, ::1) is always allowed, other addresses must
be matched by allowed_hosts and not by denied_hosts to be
per&acirc; <br>
mitted to use the cache. This option can be a single item,
list, IP address with netmask or IP range, resolvable
hostname, or &Acirc;&acute;*&rsquo; to allow all access. See
the default con&acirc; <br>
figuration file for further details and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed_hosts_6 <br>
Deprecated option analogous to allowed_hosts, but for IPv6
clients. allowed_hosts can now take IPv6 addresses
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daemon_addr [] <br>
The daemon can be restricted to listen only on particular
local IP address(es). If unset, the daemon will listen on
all available addresses. Single item or list of IPs. <br>
Use with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daemon_port [3142] <br>
The TCP port to bind to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">denied_hosts <br>
The opposite of allowed_hosts setting, excludes hosts from
the list of allowed hosts. Not used in inetd daemon
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">denied_hosts_6 <br>
Deprecated option analogous to denied_hosts, but for IPv6
clients. denied_hosts can now take IPv6 addresses
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">request_empty_lines [5] <br>
The number of empty lines tolerated before an incoming
connection is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">request_timeout [10] <br>
Maximum time in seconds that will be waited for a incoming
request before closing the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT CONFIGURATION <br>
There are two different ways of configuring clients to use
apt-cacher&rsquo;s cache. Ensure that you do not use a
mixture of both methods. Changing both proxy settings and
base URLs <br>
can create some confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access cache like a mirror <br>
To use the cache in this way, edit /etc/apt/sources.list on
each client and prepend the address of the apt-cacher server
to each deb/src line. This mode is limited to <br>
using HTTP protocol for the upstream source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you have:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deb http://ftp.debian.org stable
main</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change it to read either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deb
http://apt-cacher.server[:port]/ftp.debian.org stable main
[server in daemon mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deb
http://apt-cacher.server[:port]/apt-cacher/ftp.debian.org
stable main [server in CGI mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access cache like a proxy <br>
For clients to use the cache in this way, set the apt-cacher
server as a proxy on each client by setting the proxy URL in
apt.conf. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acquire::http::Proxy
&quot;http://apt-cacher.server:port&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See apt.conf(5) for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not recommended to set the
http_proxy environment variable as this may effect a wide
variety of applications using a variety of URLs. Apt-cacher
will not work as a <br>
general purpose web cache!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode apt-cacher supports
HTTP, FTP, HTTPS CONNECT, HTTPS GET and Debian Bugs SOAP
proxying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAQ <br>
Q: Can I just copy some .debs into the cache dir and have it
work?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Almost! A bit additional work
is also required to make them usable and persistent in the
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First: alongside with the .debs
apt-cacher stores the HTTP headers that were sent from the
server. If you copy .debs straight into the storage
directory and don&rsquo;t add those <br>
things, fetching them *will* fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately Apt-cacher now comes
with an import helper script to make things easier. Just put
a bunch of .debs into /var/cache/apt-cacher/import (or a
directory called &rsquo;import&rsquo; <br>
inside whatever you&rsquo;ve set your cache dir to be), and
run /usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-import.pl (you can
specify alternative source directory with the first
parameter). The <br>
script will run through all the package files it finds in
that dir and move them around to the correct locations plus
create additional flag/header files. Run it with
&quot;-h&quot; to get <br>
more information about how to use additional features -- it
can work in recursive mode while discovering the files and
save space by making links to files located elsewhere in
<br>
the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second: if the daily cleanup
operation is enabled (see clean_cache option above) and
there is no Packages.gz (or .bz2) file that refers to the
new files, the package files will <br>
be removed really soon. From another point of view: if there
are potential clients that would download these packages and
the clients did run &quot;apt-get update&quot; using
apt-cacher <br>
once, there is no reason to worry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I have an invalid/corrupt
file in the cache, how can I remove it?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: There are several
possibilities for this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) In either daemon mode,
apt-cacher tries to be a well-behaved cache and respects
Cache-Control and Pragma headers. Refreshing a file can be
forced by adding Cache-Control: <br>
no-cache to the request. The easiest way of doing this is
with the --no-cache option of wget(1), for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -O/dev/null --no-cache
http://localhost:3142/debian/dists/stable/Release</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Enable checksumming which
will validate cached files as they are fetched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) Wait until after
apt-cacher-cleanup.pl has run (which should remove invalid
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) Manually delete the file from
/var/cache/apt-cacher/packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: Does the daily generation of
reports or cleaning the cache depend on whether apt-cacher
is running continuously as a daemon?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: No, the regular maintenance
jobs are independent of a running server. They are executed
by cron(8) and use only static data like logs and cached
index files and package direc&acirc; <br>
tory listing. However, apt-cacher should be configured
correctly because cleanup runs it directly (in inetd mode)
to refresh the Packages/Sources files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: Are host names permissible in
the configuration file?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Since 1.7.0 DNS resolvable
hostnames are permissible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike with some other software
like Apache, the access control is slightly different
because there is no configurable checking order. Instead, a
client host is checked using <br>
both filters, allowed_hosts and denied_hosts. Following
combinations are possible: allowed_hosts=* and denied_hosts
is empty, then every host is allowed; allowed_hosts=&lt;ip
data&gt; <br>
and denied_hosts=empty, then only defined hosts are
permitted; allowed_hosts=* and denied_hosts=&lt;ip data&gt;,
then every host is accepted except of those matched by
denied_hosts; <br>
allowed_hosts=&lt;ip data&gt; and denied_hosts=&lt;ip
data&gt;, then only the clients from allowed_hosts are
accepted except of those matched by denied_hosts.
allowed_hosts=&lt;empty&gt; blocks <br>
everything (except localhost). denied_hosts must not have an
&quot;*&quot; value, use empty allowed_hosts setting if you
want that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: generate_reports: how does
being able to view the reports depend on the web server you
are running? Are they only available if apt-cacher is
running on port 80?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report is generated using a
script (started by a cron job, see above) and is stored as
$log_dir/report.html. You can access it using the
&quot;/report&quot; path in the access URL. If <br>
apt-cacher is running in CGI mode, then the URL for the
browser looks like
http://apt-cacher.server[:port]/apt-cacher/report/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Apt-cacher currently handles forwarding GET requests to
HTTP, FTP and HTTPS sources. Support for other access
methods (ssh, rsync) is not currently planned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Apt-cacher handles the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HUP Causes the configuration
file to be re-read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USR1 Toggles printing of debug
output to /var/log/apt-cacher/error.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/apt-cacher/conf.d/ <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/apt-cacher <br>
