<p>isdnlog(8) Linux System Administration isdnlog(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
isdnlog - isdn log system (and more)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Isdnlog gets information from your isdn card, decodes this
information, and can do anything with it, such as logging,
starting programs, and more. All options to isdnlog can be
<br>
given as command line flags, or you can specify a file with
options (recommended).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTION <br>
Isdnlog only works with the HiSax isdn driver. Other cards
with their own driver are not supported. Additionally you
need to enable d-channel logging (you can use
&quot;hisaxctrl <br>
&lt;DriverId&gt; 1 4&quot; to do that, e.g. &quot;hisaxctrl
line0 1 4&quot;). Isdnlog can only log outgoing calls that
originate from your isdn card, and incoming calls. To get
information about out&acirc; <br>
going calls from other isdn devices (e.g. telephones), you
need a second Teles isdn card, with crossed lines. Such a
card is not usable for communicating, but can log outgoing
<br>
calls from any device (see dual option below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
-V show version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fFILE read options from the
config file FILE. This file is also called the parameter
file of isdnlog. The first line should be
&quot;[options]&quot;. You may use blank lines and
com&acirc; <br>
ments (starting with a #). All config files for isdnlog have
the format described in isdn.conf(5). Debug options must be
given on the command line, they cannot be stored <br>
in a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/DEVICE <br>
isdnlog will read from this device and from /dev/isdninfo.
You should give /dev/isdnctrl0 for the first isdn card (or
/dev/isdnctrl2 for the second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Isdnlog has a replay mode for
debugging, where you can simulate previous recorded events.
In that case use &quot;-&quot; instead of a device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ax amt=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Set digits necessary to get an outside line, when connected
through a PABX. You can give several codes padded with a
&quot;:&quot; (e.g. -A0:80:81:82).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">areacode=&quot;value&quot; <br>
(There is no commandline option for this.) Overwrite area
code from isdn.conf. A machine connected to subscriber lines
with different area codes and thus several <br>
isdnlogs running requires this non global setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bvbn vbn=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Set the provider preselection to the given value. More
prefixes may be separated by a &quot;:&quot;. <br>
Values are e.g. &quot;010&quot; for DE, &quot;10&quot; for
AT, &quot;16:17&quot; for NL, &quot;9&quot; for FR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rprefix
preselected=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Set the preselected (i.e the provider chosen, if no prefix
is dialed) provider to value. Value should be without
vbn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipProv=skiplist <br>
(There is no commandline option for this.) Ignore certain
providers from the rate-file. The format of skiplist is the
same as for Q: tags in rate.conf and described in <br>
rate.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0x:y
trim=&quot;value[:value]&quot; <br>
Suppress leading digits. If isdnlog is connected through a
PABX, it is sometimes not possible to let isdnlog
distinguish between a national and an international call,
even <br>
with help of the -A option. <br>
This option requires two values separated with &quot;:&quot;
as an argument. These values tell isdnlog how many leading
digits to remove from incoming and outgoing calls
respec&acirc; <br>
tively. If only one value is given, it is used for both
incoming and outgoing calls. <br>
Don&rsquo;t use this in combination with the -A option! This
will confuse the system (and possibly you).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: a PABX in Germany shows
the number of an incoming call from Hamburg as
&quot;00040...&quot;. When calling out to Hamburg, it shows
the number as &quot;0040...&quot;. This means <br>
that on incoming calls, three zeroes must be removed, and on
outgoing calls two zeroes must be removed (the number must
be normalized to be without any leading zeroes in <br>
the case of a national number; international numbers must
have one leading zero). So, in this case, the option -03:2
would be correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ix internS0=&quot;value&quot;
<br>
Telephone numbers shorter then value are considered to be
internal numbers on your PABX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o other={yes|no} <br>
Normally &quot;causes&quot; (e.g. &quot;non-selected user
clearing&quot;) for other connected ISDN devices are not
displayed, only those which are related to the connection
will be shown. <br>
With this option the causes for the other devices are also
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Hx watchdog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N use new config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q sqldump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a any</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ux ignoreRR=&quot;value&quot;
<br>
Ignore &quot;housekeeping&quot; frames. x may be 1 (ignore
RR=Receiver ready) or 2 (ignore EMP=Euracom Management
Protokoll) frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ux[:y]
ignoreCOLP=&quot;value[:value]&quot; <br>
Ignore COLP/CLIP frames when value is 1 or greater. Value 0
is default, and tells isdnlog to not ignore COLP/CLIP
frames. With value 2 the ignored COLP/CLIP number is <br>
displayed. <br>
The first value applies to COLP the second to CLIP. If only
one value is given, it applies to COLP and CLIP. <br>
Sometimes the COLP number is a number in a different
areacode to the number that was dialled, and then the cost
calculation would be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreUPD={yes|no} <br>
(There is no commandline option for this.) A PABX may cause
numerous messages like &quot;Unexpected discriminator 0x47
-- ignored!&quot; resulting from protocol discriminator
val&acirc; <br>
ues in layer 3 not known to isdnlog. Set ignoreUPD to yes to
suppress this messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2x dual=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Enable dual mode. You need this if you have a second isdn
card attached with crossed lines so it can listen to what
other isdn devices like telephones are doing. With x=2 <br>
you can increase the debug output - every single digit will
be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some setups may require
workarounds for reliable logging. These workarounds are
enabled by addition of the following numbers to the dual
value. They are intended for the <br>
dualmode but may also be useful without. In this case,
specify only the sum of the following numbers without 1 or 2
for the dual mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x100 Enable this when the
destination number of an outgoing call contains the number
of the previous call, e.g. calling 222 after calling 111
before results in 111222 <br>
for the second call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may also help in situations
where an unanswered incoming call causes incorrect logging
of the following outgoing call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x200 Enable this when outgoing
calls are logged without a source number (own MSN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x400 Enable this when
unanswered incoming calls are logged multiple times
(revealed by isdnrep -E).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 A HFC-based card is used for
echo mode. Enable echo mode for the HFC card with <br>
hisaxctrl id 10 1 <br>
hisaxctrl id 12 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG MODULE <br>
-r Replay a debug file (e.g. /tmp/isdnctrl0) to find bugs.
With this flag you should give a filename with the debug
information instead of a device. It will also work with <br>
files not created by isdnlog (e.g. &quot;cat
/dev/isdnctrl0&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n newline={yes|no} <br>
Display throughput messages on the same line (only useful
with logging to stderr or a console device).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-WX width=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Limit all messages to X characters per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vX log=X <br>
Isdnlog can copy all information to /tmp/DEVICE (e.g.
/tmp/isdnctrl0 if you started isdnlog with /dev/isdnctrl0).
Choose what debugging you want from the following list, <br>
add the corresponding numbers together and use that for
X:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 copy all &quot;HEX:&quot;
lines from the hisax isdn device driver. <br>
2 copy /dev/isdnctrl output (or whatever device you
specified). <br>
4 copy /dev/isdninfo output <br>
8 copy transfer values
(&quot;ibyte&quot;,&quot;obyte&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Isdnlog will close and reopen
this file after a &quot;kill -HUP&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s flush={yes|no} <br>
Isdnlog will flush the debug file /tmp/DEVICE (e.g.
/tmp/isdnctrl0) after each write access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P pipe={yes|no} <br>
Copy the debug information to stdout. This way you can run
isdnlog as the source of a pipe like &quot;isdnlog -P
/dev/isdnctrl0 |prog ... &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D daemon={yes|no} <br>
Start isdnlog as daemon: it will fork into the background,
and use syslog as the default logging method (if you did not
specify -m).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Trace mode: isdnlog will wait
for a key after processing a line from /dev/isdnctrl0 (or
whatever device you specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Print for every pressed key
the thruput. Can not used together with option -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b If you are using a bilingual
network terminator (NT), you must give this flag, or isdnlog
will show the own MSN&rsquo;s incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUMBER REWRITE MODULE <br>
You can define aliases for telephone numbers (see
callerid.conf(5) and isdn.conf(5) for more information).
Isdnlog will compare all numbers to the list of aliases, and
when a <br>
match is found, the alias is displayed instead of the
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG MODULE <br>
Isdnlog can log information via syslog, to stdout, and send
information to x11 clients. Calculate a code from these
numbers by adding them, and activate logging with -s, -m or
<br>
-x. You can use normal numbers or hex numbers. Default is
stderr mode -m, unless daemon mode is enabled; then
it&rsquo;s syslog mode -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x1 Errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x2 Warnings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x4 Notice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x8 Log messages to /tmp/DEVICE
(e.g. /tmp/isdnctrl0 if isdnlog is started with
/dev/isdnctrl0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x10 Show telephone numbers
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x20 Show charge int and
telephone costs with every charge signal (in Germany, and
perhaps other countries, you have to pay to get these
signals).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x40 Show connect messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x80 Show hang up messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x100 Show cause message on hang
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x200 Show time messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x400 Show throughput in bytes
(every -wX seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x800 Show state of B-channels
(use with -M monitor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x1000 Show service indicator.
<br>
You should log at least 0x7 (errors, warnings, notice)
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x2000 Log estimated time till
next charge signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x4000 Show chargemax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x8000 Enable core file on
SIGSEGV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x10000 ... 0x800000, show more
diagnostic and debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mX stdout=&quot;value&quot;
<br>
Log to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-OX outfile=&quot;path&quot;
<br>
Log to file X instead of stderr. Isdnlog will close this
device when it gets a signal -SIGHUP (-1). Only valid with
-m option. <br>
If the name starts with a &quot;+&quot;, new data will be
appended to the existing file. Default behaviour is to
truncate the file when isdnlog opens it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C X console=&quot;path&quot;
<br>
Log to console X instead of stderr. You can use -O and -C
together, so that isdnlog copies output to both. Specify a
full pathname. Beware: you must put a space between <br>
-C and X !</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M monitor={yes|no} <br>
With this flag, isdnlog will generate output for monitor
programs like imon, imontty or isdnmon. You must also give
-m with 0x800 enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lX syslog=&quot;value&quot;
<br>
Log to syslog. X is the log code. You can log to syslog and
to stdout at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xX xisdn=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Pass information to x11 client. X is the log code. You can
pass information to x11 clients and log to syslog and/or
stdout at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pPORT port=&quot;value&quot;
<br>
Pass information to x11 client on this PORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cX calls=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Only with -xX : save the last X calls and pass this
information to an x11 client. Default value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-LX xlog=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Only with -xX : save the last X messages and pass this
information to an x11 client. Default value is 500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wX thruput=&quot;value&quot;
<br>
If you enabled throughput logging (0x400), isdnlog will log
the throughput every X seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ix:y
ciinterval=&quot;value[:value]&quot; <br>
Interval for printing of charge messages (0x20). <br>
The first value is the interval for the calculated CI, the
second value for the EH (AOC-D) messages. If only one value
is given, both intervals are set to this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LCR <br>
-dx abclcr=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Value is a bitmap: <br>
0 ... off <br>
1 ... calls to different area / country <br>
2 ... local calls too <br>
4 ... special numbers e.g. ISP <br>
This needs a kernel patch to work. If the kernel patch is
not found a simulation is done. <br>
Note: depending on your telephone provider local area calls
may or may not be routed to alternate providers. For
changing the ISP a script is called. s. next option <br>
&rsquo;providerchange&rsquo;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">providerchange=&quot;path_top_script&quot;
<br>
(There is no commandline option for this.) This script is
called with 3 parameters, the new provider number (from
rate-CC.dat), the number, which would be dialed, and the
<br>
servicename. The script should adjust routing, name
resolution and so on to connect to the ISP. If the script
returns non zero, LCR will not be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME MODULE <br>
-tX time={0|1|2} <br>
Isdnlog will set your local system time to the time
transmitted by your isdn service provider: -t1 = once, -t2 =
every time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHARGEHUP MODULE <br>
-hX hangup=&quot;value&quot; <br>
The isdn kernel system has a chargehup system, so it will
hang up a few seconds before the next charge signal. If you
don&rsquo;t get a charge signal from your phone company,
<br>
isdnlog can emulate it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On every outgoing connection,
isdnlog will calculate the charge time from day of week,
time of day and the distance zone of the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The kernel needs to know how
long the charge time is, and how many seconds before the
next charge signal it should hang up. You have to set the
second parameter with X in <br>
the form number:number (hang up seconds before next charge
signal for charge times greater than or equal to 20 seconds
: for charge times of less than 20 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this information, isdnlog
will call &quot;isdnctrl chargeint &lt;device&gt; &lt;charge
time&gt;&quot; and &quot;isdnctrl huptimeout &lt;device&gt;
&lt;seconds before charge signal&gt;&quot; (it actually
commu&acirc; <br>
nicates directly with isdn, without calling isdnctrl, but
this would have the same effect).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should run isdnlog with -t1
or better with -t2, so isdnlog sets the local time in sync
with telephone switching office.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a third number in
value, this is the minimum connection time for providers
charging a basic rate per connection. <br>
e.g. hangup 3:5:60</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">START MODULE <br>
isdnlog can react on any event and start programs. This
feature is disabled unless you activate it with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S start={yes|no} <br>
active &quot;START&quot; feature. Please read
callerid.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">closefds={yes|no} <br>
(There is no commandline option for this.) If set to yes,
isdnlog will close all unnecessarily opened file descriptors
before a &quot;START&quot; program is executed. This closing
<br>
will also take place at isdnlog&rsquo;s restart after
SIGHUP. Default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION LOG MODULE <br>
isdnlog will log all connections in /var/log/isdn.log.
isdnrep can parse this file and calculate costs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEVERAL ISDN CARDS <br>
If you have more than one isdn card, you need to run one
isdnlog for each card. And every process must have a
different name, so you should create a symbolic link
isdnlog1 -&gt; <br>
isdnlog, and start isdnlog1 for the second card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNLOADING KERNEL MODULES <br>
You cannot unload isdn kernel modules while an isdn device
is in use, e.g. a PPP interface is defined or isdnlog is
running. Look at /var/run for a file isdnlog.DEVICE.pid with
<br>
the process id of isdnlog, and kill that. After that you
should be able to unload your isdn kernel modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/DEVICE <br>
isdnlog requires a device as a parameter to read from (e.g.
/dev/isdnctrl0 for the 1st isdn card).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/DEVICE <br>
isdnlog can copy everything it reads to this file as debug
information (e.g. /tmp/isdnctrl0 if you started isdnlog with
/dev/isdnctrl0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/isdnlog.DEVICE.pid <br>
isdnlog creates this file with its process id. Useful to see
if isdnlog is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lock/LCK..DEVICE <br>
isdnlog creates a lock file for the device, so no other
processes will access that device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/isdn/isdn.conf <br>
isdnlog config file. Options to isdnlog can be given on the
command line, can be stored in this file in [options] (with
command line option -f/etc/isdn/isdn.conf), or in a <br>
different config file, but isdnlog will look at this file
for sections [global] [variables] [isdnlog].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGHUP (-1) <br>
On SIGHUP isdnlog restarts, and does therefore reread
it&rsquo;s config files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT (-2), SIGTERM (-15),
SIGQUIT (-3) <br>
Isdnlog quits gracefully on receiving these termination
signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGSEGV (-11) <br>
If the log level contains 0x8000 (and your ulimits permit
this) isdnlog will generate a core file before
terminating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
I start isdnlog with &quot;isdnlog -f/etc/isdn/isdn.conf
/dev/isdnctrl0&quot;. This file contains a [options]
section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[options] <br>
