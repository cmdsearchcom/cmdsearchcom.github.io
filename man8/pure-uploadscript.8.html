<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pure-uploadscript - Automatically run an external program
after a successful upload</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
pure-uploadscript [-p &lt;/path/to/pidfile&gt;] [-B] [-g
&lt;gid&gt;] [-h] -r &lt;program to run&gt; [-u
&lt;uid&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If Pure-FTPd is compiled with --with-uploadscript (default
in binary distributions), and if the -o (or --uploadscript)
is passed to the server, a named pipe called <br>
/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.pipe is created. You will also
notice an important file called
/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.lock, used for locking. <br>
After a successful upload, the file name is written to the
pipe. <br>
pure-uploadscript reads this pipe to automatically run any
program or script to process the newly uploaded file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-B Daemonize the process and fork it in background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g &lt;gid&gt; <br>
Switch the group ID to &lt;gid&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or --help <br>
Display available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;program to run&gt; <br>
Tell what program/script to run. It has to be an absolute
filename, the PATH environment variable is ignored. The
first argument of that program will be the unquoted name
<br>
of the newly uploaded file. Environment variables
aren&rsquo;t cleared. So don&rsquo;t put sensitive data in
them before calling pure-uploadscript if you switch uid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;uid&gt; <br>
Switch the user ID to &lt;uid&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
When the upload script is run, the name of the newly
uploaded file is the first argument passed to the script
(referenced as $1 by most shells) . Some environment
variables are <br>
also filled by useful info about the file. UPLOAD_SIZE The
size of the file, in bytes. UPLOAD_PERMS The permissions, as
an octal integer. UPLOAD_UID The numerical UID of the <br>
owner. UPLOAD_GID The numerical GID of the owner.
UPLOAD_USER The login of the owner. UPLOAD_GROUP The group
name the files belongs to. UPLOAD_VUSER The full user name,
or <br>
the virtual user name (127 chars max) .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.pipe
/var/run/pure-ftpd.upload.lock
/var/run/pure-uploadscript.pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
pure-ftpd and pure-uploadscript are trying to limit security
implications of such a feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The pipe can only be created
and opened by root. It must have perms 600, with uid 0, or
it will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The argument passed to an
external program/script is always an exact absolute path
name. It doesn&rsquo;t get fooled by chroot()ed
environments, and by absolute or relative paths <br>
added to the STOR command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- UID and GID are set just after
parsing command-line options, and pure-uploadscript never
gets back supervisor privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Descriptors to the pipe are
never passed to external programs/scripts. So when UID
switched, the target user can&rsquo;t mess the pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Only regular files are
processed, control characters are rejected, and a
header+footer avoid partial file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Two external programs/scripts
can&rsquo;t run at the same time. Uploads are always
processed sequentially, in chronological order. This is to
avoid denial-of-services by issuing a <br>
lot of simultaneous STOR commands in order to launch a fork
bomb on the server. For this reason, your programs
shouldn&rsquo;t take a long time to complete (but they can
run themselves <br>
in background) .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
A sample script could be :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! /bin/sh <br>
echo &quot;$1 uploaded&quot; | /usr/bin/mutt -s &quot;New
upload : $1&quot; &nbsp;ftpadmin@dom.ai.n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Never forget to quote
(&quot;variable&quot;) all variables in all your shell
scripts to avoid security flaws.</p>
