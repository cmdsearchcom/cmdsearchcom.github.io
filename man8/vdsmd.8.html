<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vdsmd - Virtual Desktops and Servers Manager <br>
@ENGINENAME@ host agent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
service vdsmd start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The VDSM service is required by a @ENGINENAME@ to manage
oVirt Nodes and Linux hosts. Currently, only Fedora and Red
Hat Enterprise Linux are supported. VDSM manages and
monitors <br>
the host&rsquo;s storage, memory and networks as well as
virtual machine creation, other host administration tasks,
statistics gathering, and log collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VDSM should be run as a daemon
on each node managed by @ENGINENAME@. It answers XML-RPC
calls from clients (mostly @ENGINENAME@).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOOKS <br>
VDSM is extendible: it has hooks in strategic locations,
where it executes external scripts. Hooks API is new and is
subject to future changes. Currently-supported hooks have
<br>
self-explanatory names: <br>
before_vm_start, after_vm_start, <br>
before_vm_cont, after_vm_cont, <br>
before_vm_pause, after_vm_pause, <br>
before_vm_hibernate, after_vm_hibernate, <br>
before_vm_dehibernate, after_vm_dehibernate, <br>
before_vm_migrate_source, after_vm_migrate_source, <br>
before_vm_migrate_destination, after_vm_migrate_destination,
<br>
before_device_migrate_source, after_device_migrate_source,
<br>
before_device_migrate_destination,
after_device_migrate_destination, <br>
before_vm_destroy, after_vm_destroy, <br>
before_vm_set_ticket, after_vm_set_ticket, <br>
before_device_create, after_device_create, <br>
before_device_destroy, after_device_destroy, <br>
before_nic_hotplug, after_nic_hotplug,
after_nic_hotplug_fail, <br>
before_nic_hotunplug, after_nic_hotunplug,
after_nic_hotunplug_fail, <br>
before_update_device, after_update_device,
after_update_device_fail, <br>
before_disk_hotplug, after_disk_hotplug, <br>
before_disk_hotunplug, after_disk_hotunplug, <br>
before_vdsm_start, after_vdsm_stop, <br>
before_network_setup, after_network_setup,
after_network_setup_fail, <br>
before_set_num_of_cpus, after_set_num_of_cpus, <br>
before_get_vm_stats, after_get_vm_stats, <br>
before_get_all_vm_stats, after_get_all_vm_stats, <br>
before_get_caps, after_get_caps, <br>
before_get_stats, after_get_stats, <br>
after_hostdev_list_by_caps, <br>
before_memory_hotplug, after_memory_hotplug, <br>
before_ifcfg_write, after_ifcfg_write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each hook executes the scripts
under /usr/libexec/vdsm/hooks/&lt;hook-name&gt;/ in
lexicographic order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook environment <br>
Each hook script (except before_vdsm_start, after_vdsm_stop,
before_network_setup, after_network_setup and
after_network_setup_fail, before_get_vm_stats,
after_get_vm_stats, <br>
before_get_all_vm_stats, after_get_all_vm_stats,
before_get_caps, after_get_caps, before_get_stats,
after_get_stats, after_hostdev_list_by_caps,
before_ifcfg_write and <br>
after_ifcfg_write) inherit the environment of the VDSM
process, with an additional variable _hook_domxml which
holds the path of libvirt&rsquo;s domain xml representation
of the rele&acirc; <br>
vant virtual machine. The uuid of the virtual machine may be
deduced from that xml, but it is also available as the
environment variable vmId.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The before_network_setup,
after_network_setup, after_network_setup_fail,
before_ifcfg_write and after_ifcfg_write hooks do also
include an extra environment variable _hook_json <br>
which holds a pointer to a file with the network parameters
that vdsm is setting up ( request ) , the request may be
modified by the before_network_setup hook as thus affect the
<br>
operation ultimately taken place by Vdsm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JSON format of this file for
before_network_setup, after_network_setup and
after_network_setup_fail has one section: request, this
section contains networks, bondings and <br>
options, those parameters are specified in the setupNetworks
VDSM API call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&quot;request&quot;: <br>
{ <br>
&quot;networks&quot;: {&quot;virtnet&quot;:
{&quot;bonding&quot; : &quot;bond0&quot;,
&quot;bridged&quot;: true, &quot;vlan&quot;:27}}, <br>
&quot;bondings&quot;: {&quot;bond0&quot;:
{&quot;nics&quot;:[&quot;eth1&quot;,&quot;eth2&quot;]}},
<br>
&quot;options&quot;: {&quot;conectivityCheck&quot;:false}
<br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JSON format of this file for
before_ifcfg_write and after_ifcfg_write has the following
parameters: ifcfg_file and config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
&quot;ifcfg_file&quot;:
&quot;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0&quot;, <br>
&quot;config&quot;:
&quot;IPADDR=192.168.1.20ETMASK=255.255.255.0&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hooks that handle NIC hotplug,
hotunplug and update device have the _hook_domxml variable
but it contains the representation of the NIC rather than
the VM. Hotplug/hotunplug disk <br>
hooks also have the _hook_dom_xml variable, which contains
the drive definition (not the VM). All hook points that are
device specific get the xml of the device instead of the
<br>
entire VM. Such hooks are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On top of these, @ENGINENAME@
allows to set a collection of &quot;custom parameters&quot;
for each virtual machine. Each of these parameters is
provided to hooks as an environment vari&acirc; <br>
able.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before_migration_destination
(and before_dehibernation) hooks currently receive the xml
of the domain from the source host. The xml of the domain at
the destination will differ <br>
in various details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment of
before_vm_set_ticket and after_vm_set_ticket hooks is
augmented with a set of params passed by the caller of
setVmTicket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment of
before_vm_dehibernate and after_vm_dehibernate hooks have
FROM_SNAPSHOT variable set to True if the VM is being
restored from a live snapshot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment of hooks
specific to devices: <br>
before_nic_hotplug, after_nic_hotplug,
after_nic_hotplug_fail, <br>
before_nic_hotunplug, after_nic_hotunplug,
after_nic_hotunplug_fail, <br>
before_update_device, after_update_device,
after_update_device_fail, <br>
before_disk_hotplug, after_disk_hotplug, <br>
before_disk_hotunplug, after_disk_hotunplug, <br>
before_device_create, after_device_create, <br>
before_device_destroy, after_device_destroy, <br>
before_device_migrate_source, after_device_migrate_source,
<br>
before_device_migrate_destination,
after_device_migrate_destination, <br>
before_memory_hotplug, after_memory_hotplug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Are all augmented by custom
properties specific to those devices, sent by the caller of
the hook. For example if before_nic_hotplug is called with
custom: {qos: &rsquo;0.5&rsquo;, color: <br>
&rsquo;red&rsquo;} then qos and color will be directly
available as environment variables when before_nic_hotplug
is called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before_get_vm_stats and
before_get_all_vm_stats are called upon API request to get
VM statistics, before getVmStats and getAllVmStats
respectively. Those hooks do not receive any <br>
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">after_get_vm_stats and
after_get_all_vm_stats are called upon getVmStats and
getAllVmStats respectively. Both receive a parameter in
_hook_json containing a list of dictionaries <br>
of VM stats (in case of after_get_vm_stats the list will
have a single element): <br>
[ <br>
{&quot;vm_id&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, ... }, <br>
{&quot;vm_id&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, ... }, <br>
... <br>
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before_get_caps and
after_get_caps are called before (and after) a
getVdsCapabilities API request. after_get_caps receives the
complete capabilities dictionary within <br>
_hook_json.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before_get_stats and
after_get_stats are called before (and after) a getVdsStats
API request. after_get_stats receives the complete host
statistics dictionary within _hook_json.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook execution <br>
before_vdsm_start and after_vdsm_stop scripts are executed
as user root. All the other hooks are executed as user
vdsm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before_vm_start scripts may edit
the domain xml file (pointed by _hook_domxml ) in order to
change VDSM&rsquo;s definition of a virtual machine before
it reaches libvirt. As with all <br>
hooks, the China Store Rule applies - if you break
something, you own it. Any script can mess up VDSM&rsquo;s
operation badly. In particular, you may never change the
uuid of the <br>
domain, and should better know what you are doing if you
remove a device from the domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before_vm_start and
before_device_create may alter the vm start behavior by
modifying the vm libvirt vm startup flags. The flag must be
written to the /var/run/vdsm/hook/&lt;vm <br>
id&gt;/launchflags file, the required value being a decimal
based on the libvirt virDomainCreateFlags enum values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard error of hook scripts
is collected into VDSM&rsquo;s log, which may be used by
scripts for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a somewhat silly example, let
us think of a script that warns when a domain with too much
memory is started on a host:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/bash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mem=&lsquo;/usr/bin/xpath
$_hook_domxml &rsquo;/domain/memory/text()&rsquo; 2&gt;
/dev/null&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ &quot;$mem&quot; -gt
1073741824 ]; then <br>
echo &quot;Domain with more than Gb!&quot; &gt;&amp;2 <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook return code <br>
Hook script must return one of the following return
codes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 the hook script ended
successfully. <br>
1 the hook script failed, other hooks should be processed.
<br>
2 the hook script failed, no further hooks should be
processed. <br>
&gt;2 reserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a before_&lt;action&gt; hook
fails, the &lt;action&gt; would be aborted. <br>
However, before_vm_destroy&rsquo;s failure does not abort
destroy().</p>
