<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nrparms - Configure the NET/ROM interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nrparms -nodes node +|- ident quality count port neighbour
[digicall...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nrparms -routes port nodecall
[digicall...] +|- quality</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nrparms -version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is used to manipulate the routing tables of the
NET/ROM network layer, or to get and set many of the network
and transport layer parameters for the NET/ROM protocol.
<br>
The program has three basic modes of operation, node
setting, neighbour setting and general parameter setting.
The syntax for the node and neighbour setting is taken from
the <br>
original NET/ROM manual and is therefore not very UNIXy but
should be familiar to those familiar with NET/ROMs or
TheNet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set up a new route to a
NET/ROM node in the routing tables you must use the nodes
option. All of the parameters are needed to add the node. It
is probably best to illustrate <br>
with an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nrparms -nodes GB7BPQ + NMCLUS
120 6 vhf G8ROU-3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This creates a new route to a
distant node with the callsign GB7BPQ and the alias NMCLUS,
it has a quality of 120 (out of 255) and has an obsolescence
count of six and packets <br>
for that node should be sent on the AX.25 port named vhf to
my immediate neighbour G8ROU-3. The callsigns of the node
and the neighbour may be the same. For example to set up the
<br>
node G8ROU-3 which is also my immediate neighbour, I would
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nrparms -nodes G8ROU-3 + MATLCK
200 6 vhf G8ROU-3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the ident of the remote node
is not known, it is possible to add a node with a blank
ident. To do this an ident of &rsquo;*&rsquo; must be
entered on the command line. Because of the com&acirc; <br>
mand line expansion that shells do, the * must be escaped by
enclosing it in quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to remove a
route to a distant node with the same command except that
the + is replaced by a -. The other parameters must also be
present. If the node has not <br>
other routes then the node will be deleted, and the
neighbour node that the connections go via may also be
deleted if no other node route uses it, and it is not a
locked neigh&acirc; <br>
bour entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When setting up a new node, a
new neighbour entry may also be created. This will have a
default value. For that neighbour to be meaningful in the
automatic routing process, it <br>
must have a more reasonable entry in the neighbours list. To
do this the routes option of the command must be used. An
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nrparms -routes ax0 G8ROU-3 +
120</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will create (or update) the
neighbour entry for G8ROU-3 with a quality of 120 and it
will be locked, it will not create a node entry for the
neighbour. This quality will be <br>
used by the netromd(8) program when calculating route
qualities via this neighbour. Normally once a neighbour has
zero node routes going via it, it will be deleted. Locking a
<br>
neighbour prevents the deletion from occurring. To unlock a
neighbour entry, the same command is used but with the +
replaced by a -.</p>
