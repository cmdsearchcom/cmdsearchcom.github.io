This program is used to manipulate the routing tables of the NET/ROM network
  layer, or to get and set many of the network and transport layer parameters
  for the NET/ROM protocol. The program has three basic modes of operation, node
  setting, neighbour setting and general parameter setting. The syntax for the
  node and neighbour setting is taken from the original NET/ROM manual and is
  therefore not very UNIXy but should be familiar to those familiar with
  NET/ROMs or TheNet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To set up a new route to a NET/ROM node in the routing tables you must use the
  nodes option. All of the parameters are needed to add the node. It is probably
  best to illustrate with an example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>	nrparms -nodes GB7BPQ + NMCLUS 120 6 vhf G8ROU-3</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This creates a new route to a distant node with the callsign GB7BPQ and the
  alias NMCLUS, it has a quality of 120 (out of 255) and has an obsolescence
  count of six and packets for that node should be sent on the AX.25 port named
  vhf to my immediate neighbour G8ROU-3. The callsigns of the node and the
  neighbour may be the same. For example to set up the node G8ROU-3 which is
  also my immediate neighbour, I would use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>	nrparms -nodes G8ROU-3 + MATLCK 200 6 vhf G8ROU-3</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the ident of the remote node is not known, it is possible to add a node with
  a blank ident. To do this an ident of '*' must be entered on the command line.
  Because of the command line expansion that shells do, the * must be escaped by
  enclosing it in quotes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is also possible to remove a route to a distant node with the same command
  except that the + is replaced by a -. The other parameters must also be
  present. If the node has not other routes then the node will be deleted, and
  the neighbour node that the connections go via may also be deleted if no other
  node route uses it, and it is not a locked neighbour entry.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When setting up a new node, a new neighbour entry may also be created. This will
  have a default value. For that neighbour to be meaningful in the automatic
  routing process, it must have a more reasonable entry in the neighbours list.
  To do this the routes option of the command must be used. An example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>	nrparms -routes ax0 G8ROU-3 + 120</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will create (or update) the neighbour entry for G8ROU-3 with a quality of
  120 and it will be locked, it will not create a node entry for the neighbour.
  This quality will be used by the <b>netromd</b>(8) program when calculating
  route qualities via this neighbour. Normally once a neighbour has zero node
  routes going via it, it will be deleted. Locking a neighbour prevents the
  deletion from occurring. To unlock a neighbour entry, the same command is used
  but with the + replaced by a -.
