<p>fuse(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual fuse(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fuse - format and options for the fuse file systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a simple interface for
userspace programs to export a virtual filesystem to the
Linux kernel. FUSE also aims to provide a secure method for
non <br>
privileged users to create and mount their own filesystem
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Some options regarding mount policy can be set in the file
/etc/fuse.conf. Currently these options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount_max = NNN <br>
Set the maximum number of FUSE mounts allowed to non-root
users. The default is 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user_allow_other <br>
Allow non-root users to specify the allow_other or
allow_root mount options (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Most of the generic mount options described in mount are
supported (ro, rw, suid, nosuid, dev, nodev, exec, noexec,
atime, noatime, sync, async, dirsync). Filesystems are
mounted <br>
with nodev,nosuid by default, which can only be overridden
by a privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General mount options: <br>
These are FUSE specific mount options that can be specified
for all filesystems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default_permissions <br>
By default FUSE doesn&rsquo;t check file access permissions,
the filesystem is free to implement it&rsquo;s access policy
or leave it to the underlying file access mechanism (e.g. in
<br>
case of network filesystems). This option enables permission
checking, restricting access based on file mode. This is
option is usually useful together with the <br>
allow_other mount option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_other <br>
This option overrides the security measure restricting file
access to the user mounting the filesystem. So all users
(including root) can access the files. This option <br>
is by default only allowed to root, but this restriction can
be removed with a configuration option described in the
previous section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_root <br>
This option is similar to allow_other but file access is
limited to the user mounting the filesystem and root. This
option and allow_other are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_cache <br>
This option disables flushing the cache of the file contents
on every open(2). This should only be enabled on
filesystems, where the file data is never changed externally
<br>
(not through the mounted FUSE filesystem). Thus it is not
suitable for network filesystems and other intermediate
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: if this option is not
specified (and neither direct_io) data is still cached after
the open(2), so a read(2) system call will not always
initiate a read operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_cache <br>
This option enables automatic flushing of the data cache on
open(2). The cache will only be flushed if the modification
time or the size of the file has changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large_read <br>
Issue large read requests. This can improve performance for
some filesystems, but can also degrade performance. This
option is only useful on 2.4.X kernels, as on 2.6 <br>
kernels requests size is automatically determined for
optimum performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direct_io <br>
This option disables the use of page cache (file content
cache) in the kernel for this filesystem. This has several
affects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Each read(2) or write(2)
system call will initiate one or more read or write
operations, data will not be cached in the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The return value of the
read() and write() system calls will correspond to the
return values of the read and write operations. This is
useful for example if the file size <br>
is not known in advance (before reading it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_read=N <br>
With this option the maximum size of read operations can be
set. The default is infinite. Note that the size of read
requests is limited anyway to 32 pages (which is <br>
128kbyte on i386).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_readahead=N <br>
Set the maximum number of bytes to read-ahead. The default
is determined by the kernel. On linux-2.6.22 or earlier
it&rsquo;s 131072 (128kbytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_write=N <br>
Set the maximum number of bytes in a single write operation.
The default is 128kbytes. Note, that due to various
limitations, the size of write requests can be much <br>
smaller (4kbytes). This limitation will be removed in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">async_read <br>
Perform reads asynchronously. This is the default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync_read <br>
Perform all reads (even read-ahead) synchronously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hard_remove <br>
The default behavior is that if an open file is deleted, the
file is renamed to a hidden file (.fuse_hiddenXXX), and only
removed when the file is finally released. This <br>
relieves the filesystem implementation of having to deal
with this problem. This option disables the hiding behavior,
and files are removed immediately in an unlink oper&acirc;
<br>
ation (or in a rename operation which overwrites an existing
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that you not
use the hard_remove option. When hard_remove is set, the
following libc functions fail on unlinked files (returning
errno of ENOENT): <br>
read(2), write(2), fsync(2), close(2), f*xattr(2),
ftruncate(2), fstat(2), fchmod(2), fchown(2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Turns on debug information
printing by the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsname=NAME <br>
Sets the filesystem source (first field in /etc/mtab). The
default is the mount program name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtype=TYPE <br>
Sets the filesystem type (third field in /etc/mtab). The
default is the mount program name. If the kernel suppports
it, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts will show the filesystem <br>
type as fuse.TYPE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the kernel doesn&rsquo;t
support subtypes, the source filed will be TYPE#NAME, or if
fsname option is not specified, just TYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_ino <br>
Honor the st_ino field in kernel functions getattr() and
fill_dir(). This value is used to fill in the st_ino field
in the stat(2), lstat(2), fstat(2) functions and the <br>
d_ino field in the readdir(2) function. The filesystem does
not have to guarantee uniqueness, however some applications
rely on this value being unique for the whole <br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdir_ino <br>
If use_ino option is not given, still try to fill in the
d_ino field in readdir(2). If the name was previously looked
up, and is still in the cache, the inode number found <br>
there will be used. Otherwise it will be set to -1. If
use_ino option is given, this option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nonempty <br>
Allows mounts over a non-empty file or directory. By default
these mounts are rejected to prevent accidental covering up
of data, which could for example prevent auto&acirc; <br>
matic backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask=M <br>
Override the permission bits in st_mode set by the
filesystem. The resulting permission bits are the ones
missing from the given umask value. The value is given in
octal <br>
representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid=N Override the st_uid field
set by the filesystem (N is numeric).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gid=N Override the st_gid field
set by the filesystem (N is numeric).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blkdev Mount a filesystem backed
by a block device. This is a privileged option. The device
must be specified with the fsname=NAME option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entry_timeout=T <br>
The timeout in seconds for which name lookups will be
cached. The default is 1.0 second. For all the timeout
options, it is possible to give fractions of a second as
well <br>
(e.g. entry_timeout=2.8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">negative_timeout=T <br>
The timeout in seconds for which a negative lookup will be
cached. This means, that if file did not exist (lookup
retuned ENOENT), the lookup will only be redone after the
<br>
timeout, and the file/directory will be assumed to not exist
until then. The default is 0.0 second, meaning that caching
negative lookups are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attr_timeout=T <br>
The timeout in seconds for which file/directory attributes
are cached. The default is 1.0 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ac_attr_timeout=T <br>
The timeout in seconds for which file attributes are cached
for the purpose of checking if auto_cache should flush the
file data on open. The default is the value of <br>
attr_timeout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intr Allow requests to be
interrupted. Turning on this option may result in unexpected
behavior, if the filesystem does not support request
interruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intr_signal=NUM <br>
Specify which signal number to send to the filesystem when a
request is interrupted. The default is hardcoded to
USR1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modules=M1[:M2...] <br>
Add modules to the filesystem stack. Modules are pushed in
the order they are specified, with the original filesystem
being on the bottom of the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUSE MODULES (STACKING) <br>
Modules are filesystem stacking support to high level API.
Filesystem modules can be built into libfuse or loaded from
shared object</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconv <br>
Perform file name character set conversion. Options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from_code=CHARSET <br>
Character set to convert from (see iconv -l for a list of
possible values). Default is UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to_code=CHARSET <br>
Character set to convert to. Default is determined by the
current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subdir <br>
Prepend a given directory to each path. Options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subdir=DIR <br>
Directory to prepend to all paths. This option is
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rellinks <br>
Transform absolute symlinks into relative</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norellinks <br>
Do not transform absolute symlinks into relative. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
The fusermount program is installed set-user-gid to fuse.
This is done to allow users from fuse group to mount their
own filesystem implementations. There must however be some
<br>
limitations, in order to prevent Bad User from doing nasty
things. Currently those limitations are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The user can only mount on a
mountpoint, for which it has write permission</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The mountpoint is not a
sticky directory which isn&rsquo;t owned by the user (like
/tmp usually is)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. No other user (including
root) can access the contents of the mounted filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
FUSE filesystems are unmounted using the fusermount(1)
command (fusermount -u mountpoint).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The main author of FUSE is Miklos Szeredi
&lt;mszeredi@inf.bme.hu&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This man page was written by
Bastien Roucaries &lt;roucaries.bastien+debian@gmail.com&gt;
for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but it may be used by
others) from README file.</p>
