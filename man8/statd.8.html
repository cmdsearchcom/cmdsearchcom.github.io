<p>RPC.STATD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
RPC.STATD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rpc.statd - NSM service daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rpc.statd [-dh?FLNvV] [-H prog] [-n my-name] [-o
outgoing-port] <br>
[-p listener-port] [-P path] <br>
[--nlm-port port] [--nlm-udp-port port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
File locks are not part of persistent file system state.
Lock state is thus lost when a host reboots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network file systems must also
detect when lock state is lost because a remote host has
rebooted. After an NFS client reboots, an NFS server must
release all file locks held by <br>
applications that were running on that client. After a
server reboots, a client must remind the server of file
locks held by applications running on that client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For NFS version 2 [RFC1094] and
NFS version 3 [RFC1813], the Network Status Monitor protocol
(or NSM for short) is used to notify NFS peers of reboots.
On Linux, two separate <br>
user-space components constitute the NSM service:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpc.statd <br>
A daemon that listens for reboot notifications from other
hosts, and manages the list of hosts to be notified when the
local system reboots</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sm-notify <br>
A helper program that notifies NFS peers after the local
system reboots</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local NFS lock manager
alerts its local rpc.statd of each remote peer that should
be monitored. When the local system reboots, the sm-notify
command notifies the NSM service <br>
on monitored peers of the reboot. When a remote reboots,
that peer notifies the local rpc.statd, which in turn passes
the reboot notification back to the local NFS lock
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NSM OPERATION IN DETAIL <br>
The first file locking interaction between an NFS client and
server causes the NFS lock managers on both peers to contact
their local NSM service to store information about the <br>
opposite peer. On Linux, the local lock manager contacts
rpc.statd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpc.statd records information
about each monitored NFS peer on persistent storage. This
information describes how to contact a remote peer in case
the local system reboots, how <br>
to recognize which monitored peer is reporting a reboot, and
how to notify the local lock manager when a monitored peer
indicates it has rebooted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An NFS client sends a hostname,
known as the client&rsquo;s caller_name, in each file lock
request. An NFS server can use this hostname to send
asynchronous GRANT calls to a client, <br>
or to notify the client it has rebooted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Linux NFS server can provide
the client&rsquo;s caller_name or the client&rsquo;s network
address to rpc.statd. For the purposes of the NSM protocol,
this name or address is known as <br>
the monitored peer&rsquo;s mon_name. In addition, the local
lock manager tells rpc.statd what it thinks its own hostname
is. For the purposes of the NSM protocol, this hostname is
<br>
known as my_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no equivalent
interaction between an NFS server and a client to inform the
client of the server&rsquo;s caller_name. Therefore NFS
clients do not actually know what mon_name <br>
an NFS server might use in an SM_NOTIFY request. The Linux
NFS client uses the server hostname from the mount command
to identify rebooting NFS servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reboot notification <br>
When the local system reboots, the sm-notify command reads
the list of monitored peers from persistent storage and
sends an SM_NOTIFY request to the NSM service on each listed
<br>
remote peer. It uses the mon_name string as the destination.
To identify which host has rebooted, the sm-notify command
sends the my_name string recorded when that remote was <br>
monitored. The remote rpc.statd matches incoming SM_NOTIFY
requests using this string, or the caller&rsquo;s network
address, to one or more peers on its own monitor list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rpc.statd does not find a
peer on its monitor list that matches an incoming SM_NOTIFY
request, the notification is not forwarded to the local lock
manager. In addition, each <br>
peer has its own NSM state number, a 32-bit integer that is
bumped after each reboot by the sm-notify command. rpc.statd
uses this number to distinguish between actual reboots <br>
and replayed notifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Part of NFS lock recovery is
rediscovering which peers need to be monitored again. The
sm-notify command clears the monitor list on persistent
storage after each reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --no-syslog <br>
Causes rpc.statd to write log messages on stderr instead of
to the system log, if the -F option was also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --foreground <br>
Keeps rpc.statd attached to its controlling terminal so that
NSM operation can be monitored directly or run under a
debugger. If this option is not specified, rpc.statd <br>
backgrounds itself soon after it starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -?, --help <br>
Causes rpc.statd to display usage information on stderr and
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --ha-callout prog <br>
Specifies a high availability callout program. If this
option is not specified, no callouts are performed. See the
High-availability callouts section below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --no-notify <br>
Prevents rpc.statd from running the sm-notify command when
it starts up, preserving the existing NSM state number and
monitor list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the sm-notify command
contains a check to ensure it runs only once after each
system reboot. This prevents spurious reboot notification if
rpc.statd restarts with&acirc; <br>
out the -L option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --name ipaddr | hostname
<br>
Specifies the bind address used for RPC listener sockets.
The ipaddr form can be expressed as either an IPv4 or an
IPv6 presentation address. If this option is not spec&acirc;
<br>
ified, rpc.statd uses a wildcard address as the transport
bind address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This string is also passed to
the sm-notify command to be used as the source address from
which to send reboot notification requests. See sm-notify(8)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Causes rpc.statd to run the
sm-notify command, and then exit. Since the sm-notify
command can also be run directly, this option is
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --outgoing-port port <br>
Specifies the source port number the sm-notify command
should use when sending reboot notifications. See
sm-notify(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --port port <br>
Specifies the port number used for RPC listener sockets. If
this option is not specified, rpc.statd will try to consult
/etc/services, if gets port succeed, set the same <br>
port for all listener socket, otherwise chooses a random
ephemeral port for each listener socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to fix
the port value of its listeners when SM_NOTIFY requests must
traverse a firewall between clients and servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --nlm-port port <br>
Specifies the port number that lockd should listen on for
NLM requests. This sets both the TCP and UDP ports unless
the UDP port is set separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --nlm-udp-port port <br>
Specifies the UDP port number that lockd should listen on
for NLM requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --state-directory-path
pathname <br>
Specifies the pathname of the parent directory where NSM
state information resides. If this option is not specified,
rpc.statd uses /var/lib/nfs/statd by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After starting, rpc.statd
attempts to set its effective UID and GID to the owner and
group of this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, -V, --version <br>
Causes rpc.statd to display version information on stderr
and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
The rpc.statd daemon must be started as root to acquire
privileges needed to create sockets with privileged source
ports, and to access the state information database. Because
<br>
rpc.statd maintains a long-running network service, however,
it drops root privileges as soon as it starts up to reduce
the risk of a privilege escalation attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During normal operation, the
effective user ID it chooses is the owner of the state
directory. This allows it to continue to access files in
that directory after it has dropped <br>
its root privileges. To control which user ID rpc.statd
chooses, simply use chown(1) to set the owner of the state
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also protect your
rpc.statd listeners using the tcp_wrapper library or
iptables(8). To use the tcp_wrapper library, add the
hostnames of peers that should be allowed <br>
access to /etc/hosts.allow. Use the daemon name statd even
if the rpc.statd binary has a different filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further information see the
tcpd(8) and hosts_access(5) man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDITIONAL NOTES <br>
Lock recovery after a reboot is critical to maintaining data
integrity and preventing unnecessary application hangs. To
help rpc.statd match SM_NOTIFY requests to NLM requests,
<br>
a number of best practices should be observed,
including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UTS nodename of your systems
should match the DNS names that NFS peers use to contact
them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UTS nodenames of your
systems should always be fully qualified domain names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The forward and reverse DNS
mapping of the UTS nodenames should be consistent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hostname the client uses to
mount the server should match the server&rsquo;s mon_name in
SM_NOTIFY requests it sends</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unmounting an NFS file system
does not necessarily stop either the NFS client or server
from monitoring each other. Both may continue monitoring
each other for a time in case <br>
subsequent NFS traffic between the two results in fresh
mounts and additional file locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, if the lockd kernel
module is unloaded during normal operation, all remote NFS
peers are unmonitored. This can happen on an NFS client, for
example, if an automounter <br>
removes all NFS mount points due to inactivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">High-availability callouts <br>
rpc.statd can exec a special callout program during
processing of successful SM_MON, SM_UNMON, and SM_UNMON_ALL
requests, or when it receives SM_NOTIFY. Such a program may
be <br>
used in High Availability NFS (HA-NFS) environments to track
lock state that may need to be migrated after a system
reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the callout program
is specified with the -H option. The program is run with 3
arguments: The first is either add-client del-client or
sm-notify depending on the <br>
reason for the callout. The second is the mon_name of the
monitored peer. The third is the caller_name of the
requesting lock manager for add-client or del-client ,
otherwise <br>
it is IP_address of the caller sending SM_NOTIFY. The forth
is the state_value in the SM_NOTIFY request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 and TI-RPC support <br>
TI-RPC is a pre-requisite for supporting NFS on IPv6. If
TI-RPC support is built into rpc.statd, it attempts to start
listeners on network transports marked &rsquo;visible&rsquo;
in <br>
/etc/netconfig. As long as at least one network transport
listener starts successfully, rpc.statd will operate.</p>
