<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debbuild attempts to build Debian-friendly semi-native
packages from RPM spec files, RPM-friendly tarballs, and RPM
source packages (.src.rpm files). It accepts most of the
<br>
options rpmbuild does, and should be able to interpret most
spec files usefully. Perl modules should be handled via
CPAN+dh-make-perl instead as it&acirc;s simpler than even
tweaking <br>
a .spec template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As far as possible, the
command-line options are identical to those from rpmbuild,
although several rpmbuild options are not supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clean <br>
--rmsource <br>
--rmspec <br>
--showrc <br>
--target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of these could probably be
trivially added. Feel free to send me a patch. ;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Complex spec files will most
likely not work well, if at all. Rewrite them from scratch
&acirc; you&acirc;ll have to make heavy modifications
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you see something you
don&acirc;t like, mail me. Send a patch if you feel
inspired. I don&acirc;t promise I&acirc;ll do anything other
than say &acirc;Yup, that&acirc;s broken&acirc; or
&acirc;Got your message&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source package container I
invented for debbuild, the .sdeb file, can be installed with
&quot;debbuild -i&quot; exactly the same way as a .src.rpm
can be installed with &quot;rpm -i&quot;. Both <br>
will unpack the file and place the source(s) and .spec file
in the appropriate places in %_topdir/SOURCES and
%_topdir/SPECS respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASSUMPTIONS <br>
As with rpmbuild, debbuild makes some assumptions about your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Either you have
rights to do as you please under /usr/src/debian, or you
have created a file ~/.debmacros containing a suitable
&acirc;%_topdir&acirc; definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both rpmbuild and debbuild
require the directories %_topdir/{BUILD,SOURCES,SPECS}.
However, where rpmbuild requires the %_topdir/{RPMS,SRPMS}
directories, debbuild requires <br>
%_topdir/{DEBS,SDEBS} instead. Create them in advance; some
subdirectories are created automatically as needed, but most
are not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; /var/tmp must
allow script execution &acirc; rpmbuild and debbuild both
rely on creating and executing shell scripts for much of
their functionality. By default, debbuild also <br>
creates install trees under /var/tmp &acirc; however this is
(almost) entirely under the control of the package&acirc;s
.spec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you wish to
--rebuild a .src.rpm file, your %_topdir for both debbuild
and rpmbuild must either match, or be suitably symlinked one
direction or another so that both <br>
programs are effectively working in the same tree. (Or you
could just manually wrestle files around your system.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could symlink ~/.rpmmacros
to ~/.debmacros (or vice versa) and save yourself some
hassle if you need to rebuild .src.rpm packages on a regular
basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRATA <br>
debbuild deliberately does a few things differently from
rpmbuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finding out what packages should
be built (--showpkgs) <br>
rpmbuild does not include any convenient method I know of to
list the packages a spec file will produce. Since I needed
this ability for another tool, I added it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It requires the .spec file for
the package, and produces a list of full package filenames
(without path data) that would be generated by one of
--rebuild, -ta, -tb, -ra, -rb, <br>
-ba, or -bb. This includes the .sdeb source package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
debbuild was written by Kris Deugau
&lt;kdeugau@deepnet.cx&gt;. The present version was
developed by Andreas Scherer
&lt;http://ascherer.github.io&gt; and is available at <br>
&lt;http://github.com/ascherer/debbuild&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Funky Things Happen if you forget a command-line option or
two. I&acirc;ve been too lazy to bother fixing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many macro expansions are
supported, some are incompletely supported, some not at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated scriptlets
don&acirc;t quite match those from rpmbuild exactly. There
are extra environment variables and preprocessing that I
haven&rsquo;t needed (yet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation, such as it is,
will likely remain perpetually out of date (in which way it
follows in RPM&acirc;s tradition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%_topdir and the five
&acirc;working&acirc; directories under %_topdir could
arguably be created by debbuild. However, rpmbuild
doesn&rsquo;t create these directories either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
rpm(8), rpmbuild(8), and pretty much any document describing
how to write a .spec file.</p>
