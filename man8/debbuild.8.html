<b>debbuild</b> attempts to build Debian-friendly semi-native packages from RPM
  spec files, RPM-friendly tarballs, and RPM source packages (.src.rpm files).
  It accepts <i>most</i> of the options <b>rpmbuild</b> does, and should be able
  to interpret most spec files usefully. Perl modules should be handled via
  CPAN+dh-make-perl instead as it&#x2019;s simpler than even tweaking a .spec
  template.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As far as possible, the command-line options are identical to those from
  <b>rpmbuild</b>, although several <b>rpmbuild</b> options are not supported:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 --clean
 --rmsource
 --rmspec
 --showrc
 --target
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some of these could probably be trivially added. Feel free to send me a patch.
  ;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Complex spec files will most likely <i>not</i> work well, if at all. Rewrite
  them from scratch &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll have to make heavy modifications
  anyway.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you see something you don&#x2019;t like, mail me. Send a patch if you feel
  inspired. I don&#x2019;t promise I&#x2019;ll do anything other than say
  &#x201C;Yup, that&#x2019;s broken&#x201D; or &#x201C;Got your message&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The source package container I invented for <b>debbuild</b>, the .sdeb file, can
  be installed with &quot;debbuild -i&quot; exactly the same way as a .src.rpm
  can be installed with &quot;rpm -i&quot;. Both will unpack the file and place
  the source(s) and .spec file in the appropriate places in %_topdir/SOURCES and
  %_topdir/SPECS respectively.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ASSUMPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#ASSUMPTIONS">ASSUMPTIONS</a></h1>
As with <b>rpmbuild</b>, <b>debbuild</b> makes some assumptions about your
  system.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Either you have rights to do as you please under
      /usr/src/debian, or you have created a file <i>~/.debmacros</i> containing
      a suitable &#x201C;%_topdir&#x201D; definition.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Both <b>rpmbuild</b> and <b>debbuild</b> require the directories
      <b></b><b>%_topdir</b> <b>/{BUILD,SOURCES,SPECS}</b>. However, where
      <b>rpmbuild</b> requires the <b></b><b>%_topdir</b><b>/{RPMS,SRPMS}</b>
      directories, <b>debbuild</b> requires
      <b></b><b>%_topdir</b><b>/{DEBS,SDEBS}</b> instead. Create them in
      advance; <i>some</i> subdirectories are created automatically as needed,
      but most are not.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>/var/tmp</b> must allow script execution &#x2013;
      <b>rpmbuild</b> and <b>debbuild</b> both rely on creating and executing
      shell scripts for much of their functionality. By default, <b>debbuild</b>
      also creates install trees under <b>/var/tmp</b> &#x2013; however this is
      (almost) entirely under the control of the package&#x2019;s .spec
    file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">If you wish to <b>--rebuild</b> a .src.rpm file, your
      <b></b> <b>%_topdir</b><b></b> for both <b>debbuild</b> and
      <b>rpmbuild</b> must either match, or be suitably symlinked one direction
      or another so that both programs are effectively working in the same tree.
      (Or you could just manually wrestle files around your system.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You could symlink <i>~/.rpmmacros</i> to <i>~/.debmacros</i> (or vice versa)
      and save yourself some hassle if you need to rebuild .src.rpm packages on
      a regular basis.</dd>

<b>debbuild</b> deliberately does a few things differently from <b>rpmbuild</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Finding_out_what_packages_should_be_built_(--showpkgs)"><a class="selflink" href="#Finding_out_what_packages_should_be_built_(--showpkgs)">Finding
  out what packages should be built (--showpkgs)</a></h2>
<b>rpmbuild</b> does not include any convenient method I know of to list the
  packages a spec file will produce. Since I needed this ability for another
  tool, I added it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It requires the .spec file for the package, and produces a list of full package
  filenames (without path data) that would be generated by one of
  <b>--rebuild</b>, <b>-ta</b>, <b>-tb</b>, <b>-ra</b>, <b>-rb</b>, <b>-ba</b>,
  or <b>-bb</b>. This includes the .sdeb source package.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUTHOR"><a class="selflink" href="#AUTHOR">AUTHOR</a></h1>
<b>debbuild</b> was written by Kris Deugau &lt;kdeugau@deepnet.cx&gt;. The
  present version was developed by Andreas Scherer
  &lt;http://ascherer.github.io&gt; and is available at
  &lt;http://github.com/ascherer/debbuild&gt;.

Funky Things Happen if you forget a command-line option or two. I&#x2019;ve been
  too lazy to bother fixing this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many macro expansions are supported, some are incompletely supported, some not
  at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The generated scriptlets don&#x2019;t quite match those from <b>rpmbuild</b>
  exactly. There are extra environment variables and preprocessing that I
  haven't needed (yet).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Documentation, such as it is, will likely remain perpetually out of date (in
  which way it follows in RPM&#x2019;s tradition).
<div class="Pp"></div>
%_topdir and the five &#x201C;working&#x201D; directories under %_topdir could
  arguably be created by <b>debbuild</b>. However, <b>rpmbuild</b> doesn't
  create these directories either.
