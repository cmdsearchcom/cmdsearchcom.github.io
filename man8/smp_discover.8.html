<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smp_discover - invoke DISCOVER SMP function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
smp_discover [--adn] [--brief] [--cap] [--help] [--hex]
[--ignore] [--interface=PARAMS] [--list] [--multiple] [--my]
[--num=NUM] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--summary]
<br>
[--verbose] [--version] [--zero] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sends one or more SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP)
DISCOVER function requests to an SMP target and decodes or
outputs the responses. The SMP target is identified by the
<br>
SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the
SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt
interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP
initiator) <br>
and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between HBAs if
there are multiple present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --phy=ID option is not
given then --summary is assumed. When --summary is given or
assumed, this utility shows the disposition of each active
expander phy in table form. <br>
One row is shown for each phy and is described in the SINGLE
LINE PER PHY FORMAT section below. For this purpose disabled
expander phys and those with errors are considered <br>
&quot;active&quot; and can be suppressed from the output by
adding the --brief option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
options as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --adn <br>
causes the &quot;attached device name&quot; field to be
output when the --multiple or --summary option is also
given. See the section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT.
Note the <br>
&quot;attached device name&quot; field was added is
SAS-2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --brief <br>
reduce the decoded response output. If used twice will exit
if there is no attached device (after outputting that). When
used with --multiple, unattached phys are not <br>
listed; when used twice, trims attached phys output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cap <br>
decode and print phy capabilities bits fields (see SNW-3 in
draft). Each expander phy has three of these fields:
programmed, current and attached. By default these fields
<br>
are only printed out in hex, or not at all if the --brief
option is given or implied. Of the three the attached phy
capability field is probably the most interesting. If <br>
the --verbose option is given, then the various
&quot;G&quot; identifiers are expanded (e.g. instead of
&quot;G4:&quot; it prints &quot;G4 (12 Gbps):&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hex <br>
output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore <br>
sets the Ignore Zone Group bit in the SMP Discover request.
Expander phys hidden by zoning will appear as &quot;phy
vacant&quot; unless this option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --interface=PARAMS <br>
interface specific parameters. In this case
&quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through the
operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man
page for more informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
list attributes in &quot;name=value&quot; form, one entry
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --multiple <br>
loops over multiple phys within SMP target (typically an
expander) and does a DISCOVER request and outputs a one line
summary. Phy 0 is queried first, then phy 1, continu&acirc;
<br>
ing until an error occurs. The starting phy and the number
of phys &quot;discovered&quot; can be controlled by --phy=ID
and --num=NUM. If --brief is given then there is no output
<br>
for phys that indicate there is no attached device. When
this option is used twice then multi-line output is produced
for each phy. See the section below on SINGLE LINE <br>
PER PHY FORMAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --my <br>
outputs my (this expander&rsquo;s) SAS address in hex
(prefixed by &quot;0x&quot;). This is obtained from the
DISCOVER response of phy id 0 (unless --phy=ID is given).
The expander&rsquo;s SAS <br>
address is typically available even if a phy is not
connected, &quot;vacant&quot; or disabled. This option
overrides most other options (e.g. overrides --multiple and
--summary <br>
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --num=NUM <br>
number of phys to fetch, starting at --phy=ID when the
--multiple option is given. The default value is 0 which is
interpreted as &quot;the rest&quot; (i.e. until a &quot;phy
does not <br>
exist&quot; function result is received). This option is
ignored in the absence of the --multiple option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --phy=ID <br>
phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and 254. If this
option is not given then the --summary option is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary.
All error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR <br>
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device.
Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed
if the SMP_DEVICE has the target&rsquo;s SAS address within
it. <br>
The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are shown
in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either
prefix it with &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or put a trailing
&rsquo;h&rsquo; on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --summary <br>
output a multi line summary, with one line per active phy.
Checks all phys (or less is --num=NUM is given), starting at
phy 0 (unless --phy=ID is given). Equivalent to <br>
&rsquo;--multiple --brief&rsquo; (&rsquo;-mb&rsquo;). See
the section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT. If the
--phy=ID is not given then this option is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple
times</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
print the version string and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --zero <br>
zero the Allocated Response Length field in the request.
This option also zeros the Request Length field in the
request. This is required for strict SAS-1.1 compliance.
<br>
However this option should not be given in SAS-2 and later;
if it is given an abridged response may result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT <br>
The --summary option causes SMP DISCOVER responses to be
compressed to a header followed by one line per phy. To save
space SAS addresses are shown in hex without a
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; prefix <br>
or &rsquo;h&rsquo; suffix. The header line gives the SAS
address of the SMP target itself and assumes it is an
expander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line starts with &quot; phy
&lt;n&gt;:&quot; where &lt;n&gt; is the phy identifier (and
they are origin zero). That is followed by the routing
attribute represented by a single letter which is <br>
either &quot;D&quot; for direct routing, &quot;S&quot; for
subtractive routing, &quot;T&quot; or &quot;U&quot;. Both
&quot;T&quot; and &quot;U&quot; imply table routing, the
difference is that if REPORT GENERAL indicates &quot;table
to table <br>
supported&quot; then &quot;U&quot; is output to indicate
that phy can be part of an enclosure universal port;
otherwise &quot;T&quot; is used. Next comes the negotiated
physical link rate which is either <br>
&quot;disabled&quot;, &quot;reset problem&quot; or
&quot;spinup hold&quot;. Other states are mapped to
&quot;attached&quot;. This includes enabled phys with
nothing connected which appear as <br>
&quot;attached:[0000000000000000:00]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information shown between the
brackets is for the attached device. Phys that are connected
display something like: &quot;attached:[5000c50000520a2a:01
&quot; where the first number is the <br>
attached SAS address (in hex) and the second number is the
attached device&rsquo;s phy identifier. If the attached
device type is other than a SAS or SATA device then one of
these <br>
abbreviations is output: &quot;exp&quot; (for expander),
&quot;fex&quot; (for fanout expander) or &quot;res&quot;
(for unknown attached device type). If a phy is flagged as
&quot;virtual&quot; then the letter &quot;V&quot; <br>
appears next. Next are the protocols supported by the
attached device which are shown as
&quot;i(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for initiator protocols and/or
&quot;t(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for target protocols. The
&lt;list&gt; <br>
is made up of &quot;PORT_SEL&quot;, &quot;SSP&quot;,
&quot;STP&quot;, &quot;SMP&quot; and &quot;SATA&quot; with
&quot;+&quot; used as a separator. For example a SAS host
adapter will most likely appear as:
&quot;i(SSP+STP+SMP)&quot;. This completes <br>
the information about the attached phy, hence the closing
right bracket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If appropriate, the negotiated
physical link rate is shown in gigabits per second. Here is
an example of a line for expander phy identifier 11
connected to a SATA target (or SATA <br>
&quot;device&quot; to use the t13.org term):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phy
11:T:attached:[500605b000000afb:00 t(SATA)] 1.5 Gbps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the expander has zoning
enabled (i.e. REPORT GENERAL response bit for &rsquo;zoning
enabled&rsquo; is set) and a phy&rsquo;s zone group is other
than zg 1 then the phy&rsquo;s zone group is shown <br>
(e.g. &quot;ZG:2&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --adn option is given
then after the attached SAS address and the attached
device&rsquo;s phy identifier are output an extra field is
inserted containing the &quot;attached device <br>
name&quot; field. For a SAS disk this should be its target
device name (in NAA-5 format) and for a SATA disk its WWN
(if provided, also in NAA-5 format). Also when the --adn
option is <br>
given the phy speed and zone group are not output in order
to keep the line length reasonable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
In SAS-2 and later both the DISCOVER and DISCOVER LIST
functions are available. The DISCOVER LIST function should
be favoured for several reasons: its response can hold up to
40 <br>
descriptors each describing the state of one expander phy.
The vast majority of expander chips on the market support 36
phys or less so one DISCOVER LIST response will summarize
<br>
the states of all its phys. With the DISCOVER function only
one expander phy&rsquo;s state is returned in its response.
Other advantages of the DISCOVER LIST function are its
&quot;phy fil&acirc; <br>
ter&quot; and &quot;descriptor type&quot; function request
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
See &quot;Examples&quot; section in
http://sg.danny.cz/sg/smp_utils.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFORMING TO <br>
The SMP DISCOVER function was introduced in SAS-1, with
small additions in SAS-1.1 . There were a large number of
additions in SAS-2 . After SAS-2 the protocol sections of
SAS <br>
were split into another document series known as SPL. Now
SPL and SPL-2 are standards and SPL-3 is in the draft
stage.</p>
