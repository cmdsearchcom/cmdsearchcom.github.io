<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fsck - check and repair a Linux filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fsck [-lrsAVRTMNP] [-C [fd]] [-t fstype] [filesystem...]
[--] [fs-specific-options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more
Linux filesystems. filesys can be a device name (e.g.
/dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2), a mount point (e.g. /, /usr, /home),
or an <br>
ext2 label or UUID specifier (e.g.
UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root).
Normally, the fsck program will try to handle filesystems on
different physical <br>
disk drives in parallel to reduce the total amount of time
needed to check all of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no filesystems are specified
on the command line, and the -A option is not specified,
fsck will default to checking filesystems in /etc/fstab
serially. This is equivalent to <br>
the -As options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit code returned by fsck
is the sum of the following conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No errors <br>
1 Filesystem errors corrected <br>
2 System should be rebooted <br>
4 Filesystem errors left uncorrected <br>
8 Operational error <br>
16 Usage or syntax error <br>
32 Checking canceled by user request <br>
128 Shared-library error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit code returned when
multiple filesystems are checked is the bit-wise OR of the
exit codes for each filesystem that is checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In actuality, fsck is simply a
front-end for the various filesystem checkers (fsck.fstype)
available under Linux. The filesystem-specific checker is
searched for in /sbin first, <br>
then in /etc/fs and /etc, and finally in the directories
listed in the PATH environment variable. Please see the
filesystem-specific checker manual pages for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l Lock the whole-disk device by an exclusive flock(2). This
option can be used with one device only (this means that -A
and -l are mutually exclusive). This option is rec&acirc;
<br>
ommended when more fsck(8) instances are executed in the
same time. The option is ignored when used for multiple
devices or for non-rotating disks. fsck does not lock <br>
underlying devices when executed to check stacked devices
(e.g. MD or DM) -- this feature is not implemented yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Report certain statistics for
each fsck when it completes. These statistics include the
exit status, the maximum run set size (in kilobytes), the
elapsed all-clock time <br>
and the user and system CPU time used by the fsck run. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/sda1: status 0, rss 92828,
real 4.002804, user 2.677592, sys 0.86186</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Serialize fsck operations.
This is a good idea if you are checking multiple filesystems
and the checkers are in an interactive mode. (Note:
e2fsck(8) runs in an interac&acirc; <br>
tive mode by default. To make e2fsck(8) run in a
non-interactive mode, you must either specify the -p or -a
option, if you wish for errors to be corrected
automatically, <br>
or the -n option if you do not.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t fslist <br>
Specifies the type(s) of filesystem to be checked. When the
-A flag is specified, only filesystems that match fslist are
checked. The fslist parameter is a comma-sepa&acirc; <br>
rated list of filesystems and options specifiers. All of the
filesystems in this comma-separated list may be prefixed by
a negation operator &rsquo;no&rsquo; or &rsquo;!&rsquo;,
which requests <br>
that only those filesystems not listed in fslist will be
checked. If none of the filesystems in fslist is prefixed by
a negation operator, then only those listed filesys&acirc;
<br>
tems will be checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options specifiers may be
included in the comma-separated fslist. They must have the
format opts=fs-option. If an options specifier is present,
then only filesystems <br>
which contain fs-option in their mount options field of
/etc/fstab will be checked. If the options specifier is
prefixed by a negation operator, then only those
filesys&acirc; <br>
tems that do not have fs-option in their mount options field
of /etc/fstab will be checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if opts=ro appears
in fslist, then only filesystems listed in /etc/fstab with
the ro option will be checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with Mandrake
distributions whose boot scripts depend upon an unauthorized
UI change to the fsck program, if a filesystem type of loop
is found in <br>
fslist, it is treated as if opts=loop were specified as an
argument to the -t option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the filesystem type is
deduced by searching for filesys in the /etc/fstab file and
using the corresponding entry. If the type can not be
deduced, and there is <br>
only a single filesystem given as an argument to the -t
option, fsck will use the specified filesystem type. If this
type is not available, then the default filesystem <br>
type (currently ext2) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Walk through the /etc/fstab
file and try to check all filesystems in one run. This
option is typically used from the /etc/rc system
initialization file, instead of multi&acirc; <br>
ple commands for checking a single filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The root filesystem will be
checked first unless the -P option is specified (see below).
After that, filesystems will be checked in the order
specified by the fs_passno <br>
(the sixth) field in the /etc/fstab file. Filesystems with a
fs_passno value of 0 are skipped and are not checked at all.
Filesystems with a fs_passno value of greater <br>
than zero will be checked in order, with filesystems with
the lowest fs_passno number being checked first. If there
are multiple filesystems with the same pass number, <br>
fsck will attempt to check them in parallel, although it
will avoid running multiple filesystem checks on the same
physical disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsck does not check stacked
devices (RAIDs, dm-crypt, ...) in parallel with any other
device. See below for FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL setting. The
/sys filesystem is used <br>
to detemine dependencies between devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hence, a very common
configuration in /etc/fstab files is to set the root
filesystem to have a fs_passno value of 1 and to set all
other filesystems to have a fs_passno <br>
value of 2. This will allow fsck to automatically run
filesystem checkers in parallel if it is advantageous to do
so. System administrators might choose not to use this <br>
configuration if they need to avoid multiple filesystem
checks running in parallel for some reason --- for example,
if the machine in question is short on memory so that <br>
excessive paging is a concern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsck normally does not check
whether the device actually exists before calling a
filesystem specific checker. Therefore non-existing devices
may cause the system to enter <br>
filesystem repair mode during boot if the filesystem
specific checker returns a fatal error. The /etc/fstab mount
option nofail may be used to have fsck skip non-existing
<br>
devices. fsck also skips non-existing devices that have the
special filesystem type auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C [fd] <br>
Display completion/progress bars for those filesystem
checkers (currently only for ext2 and ext3) which support
them. fsck will manage the filesystem checkers so that <br>
only one of them will display a progress bar at a time. GUI
front-ends may specify a file descriptor fd, in which case
the progress bar information will be sent to that <br>
file descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Do not check mounted
filesystems and return an exit code of 0 for mounted
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Don&rsquo;t execute, just
show what would be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P When the -A flag is set,
check the root filesystem in parallel with the other
filesystems. This is not the safest thing in the world to
do, since if the root filesystem <br>
is in doubt things like the e2fsck(8) executable might be
corrupted! This option is mainly provided for those
sysadmins who don&rsquo;t want to repartition the root
filesystem <br>
to be small and compact (which is really the right
solution).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R When checking all filesystems
with the -A flag, skip the root filesystem. (This is useful
in case the root filesystem has already been mounted
read-write.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Don&rsquo;t show the title on
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Produce verbose output,
including all filesystem-specific commands that are
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fs-specific-options <br>
Options which are not understood by fsck are passed to the
filesystem-specific checker. These options must not take
arguments, as there is no way for fsck to be able to <br>
properly guess which options take arguments and which
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and arguments which
follow the -- are treated as filesystem-specific options to
be passed to the filesystem-specific checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that fsck is not
designed to pass arbitrarily complicated options to
filesystem-specific checkers. If you&rsquo;re doing
something complicated, please just execute <br>
the filesystem-specific checker directly. If you pass fsck
some horribly complicated options and arguments, and it
doesn&rsquo;t do what you expect, don&rsquo;t bother
reporting it <br>
as a bug. You&rsquo;re almost certainly doing something that
you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing with fsck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to different
filesystem-specific fsck&rsquo;s are not standardized. If in
doubt, please consult the man pages of the
filesystem-specific checker. Although not guaranteed, the
<br>
following options are supported by most filesystem
checkers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Automatically repair the
filesystem without any questions (use this option with
caution). Note that e2fsck(8) supports -a for backward
compatibility only. This option is <br>
mapped to e2fsck&rsquo;s -p option which is safe to use,
unlike the -a option that some filesystem checkers
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n For some filesystem-specific
checkers, the -n option will cause the fs-specific fsck to
avoid attempting to repair any problems, but simply report
such problems to stdout. <br>
This is however not true for all filesystem-specific
checkers. In particular, fsck.reiserfs(8) will not report
any corruption if given this option. fsck.minix(8) does <br>
not support the -n option at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Interactively repair the
filesystem (ask for confirmations). Note: It is generally a
bad idea to use this option if multiple fsck&rsquo;s are
being run in parallel. Also note <br>
that this is e2fsck&rsquo;s default behavior; it supports
this option for backward compatibility reasons only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y For some filesystem-specific
checkers, the -y option will cause the fs-specific fsck to
always attempt to fix any detected filesystem corruption
automatically. Sometimes <br>
an expert may be able to do better driving the fsck
manually. Note that not all filesystem-specific checkers
implement this option. In particular fsck.minix(8) and <br>
fsck.cramfs(8) do not support the -y option as of this
writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/fstab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The fsck program&rsquo;s behavior is affected by the
following environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL <br>
If this environment variable is set, fsck will attempt to
check all of the specified filesystems in parallel,
regardless of whether the filesystems appear to be on the
<br>
same device. (This is useful for RAID systems or high-end
storage systems such as those sold by companies such as IBM
or EMC.) Note that the fs_passno value is still <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FSCK_MAX_INST <br>
This environment variable will limit the maximum number of
filesystem checkers that can be running at one time. This
allows configurations which have a large number of <br>
disks to avoid fsck starting too many filesystem checkers at
once, which might overload CPU and memory resources
available on the system. If this value is zero, then an <br>
unlimited number of processes can be spawned. This is
currently the default, but future versions of fsck may
attempt to automatically determine how many filesystem
checks <br>
can be run based on gathering accounting data from the
operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH The PATH environment
variable is used to find filesystem checkers. A set of
system directories are searched first: /sbin, /sbin/fs.d,
/sbin/fs, /etc/fs, and /etc. Then <br>
the set of directories found in the PATH environment are
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FSTAB_FILE <br>
This environment variable allows the system administrator to
override the standard location of the /etc/fstab file. It is
also useful for developers who are testing fsck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBBLKID_DEBUG=0xffff <br>
enables debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBMOUNT_DEBUG=0xffff <br>
enables debug output.</p>
