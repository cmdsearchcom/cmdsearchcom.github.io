<p>faxrunqd(1) mgetty+sendfax manual faxrunqd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faxrunqd - daemon to send fax jobs queued by faxspool(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
faxrunqd [-v] [-d] [-l &lt;ttys&gt;] [-u &lt;user&gt;]
[-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Runs in the background, and regularily checks the fax queue
set up by faxspool(1). Sends all jobs that are due, records
results, and takes appropriate action (notify mails
etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxrunqd basically does the same
as faxrunq(1), just more so. Please read the faxrunq(1) man
page if you&rsquo;re not already familiar with the
concept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantages of faxrunqd
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- runs all the time, so you
don&rsquo;t have to set up a cron job (but you have to set
up an entry in /etc/inittab or start it from /etc/rc*)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- quicker response to new faxes
in queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- can sensibly handle more than
one modem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- can handle prioritized fax
jobs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- can do &rsquo;policy
routing&rsquo; of faxes depending on the fax number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The disadvantages are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- needs more system ressources
if you have only little fax traffic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- requires Perl 5.004</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- more tricky to set up and to
debug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP <br>
faxrunqd is started at system boot from /etc/rc.*, or from
/etc/inittab. You can also start it from the command line.
It does not put itself in the background, so you have to
<br>
start it with an &quot;&amp;&quot;, or from a
&quot;:respawn:&quot; line in /etc/inittab. Using
/etc/inittab has the advantage that faxrunqd is restarted
automatically if something goes wrong and <br>
faxrunqd is stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxrunqd will first read a
global configuration file (see below), then (optionally) the
faxrunqd policy file (see further below). From then on, it
will sit in a loop. It will <br>
check the fax queue every 60 seconds for new jobs, and will
then distribute them over all available modems. If the job
is sent, or fails, it will do the same thing faxrunq(1) <br>
would do (send a mail, delete the JOB directory, execute a
named program, etc.). Both programs are fully compatible in
this respect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxrunqd [-v] [-d] [-l
&lt;ttys&gt;] [-u &lt;user&gt;] [-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Tells faxrunqd to write progress information to the log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Tells faxrunqd to write
debugging information to stdout and the log file (usually
used together with -v)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;ttyS&gt; <br>
Specifies the list of modem devices to use. Multiple devices
are separated with &rsquo;:&rsquo;, e.g. &rsquo;-l
ttyS0:ttyS1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;user&gt; <br>
faxrunqd can now (since 1.1.29) run as unprivileged user. If
you start it as root from /etc/inittab or from one of the
/etc/rc* scripts, it&rsquo;s strongly recommended to use
<br>
&rsquo;-u fax&rsquo; (to be precise: the user that is owning
the outgoing fax spool directory). This will make faxrunqd
drop all its privileges at startup, and run as the specified
<br>
user. Running faxrunqd as root user might lead to security
problems - don&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print version number and
exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
Some aspects of the behaviour of faxrunqd can be controlled
by a configuration file, usually named
/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxrunq.config (this is the same file
that faxrunq(1) uses, <br>
but there are additional options for faxrunqd). In this
file, you can use the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">success-send-mail [y/n] <br>
A boolean parameter that controls whether a mail will be
sent after successful completition of the fax job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failure-send-mail [y/n] <br>
A boolean parameter that controls whether a mail will be
sent after the fax job has failed more than the maximum
number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">success-call-program
&lt;name&gt; <br>
Here, you can specify a program that will be run when the
fax has been successfully sent. It will be passed two
command line parameters. The first is the full path to the
<br>
fax JOB file (see faxq(5)), the second is the last exit code
from sendfax (for success-call-program, this is always
&quot;0&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failure-call-program
&lt;name&gt; <br>
Similar to the &quot;success-call-program&quot;, this
program will be run when the fax has been failed too often
and faxrunqd gives up. This script could, for example, print
out the <br>
fax on a printer so that it can be sent manually on a paper
fax machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-call-program &lt;name&gt;
<br>
This is, again, similar to &quot;success-call-program&quot;.
It will be called for interim status updates
(&quot;we&rsquo;ve tried and it was BUSY&quot;), so that
frontend programs can display <br>
this information. &quot;update-call-program&quot; will only
be called for jobs that will be kept in the fax queue for at
least one more try.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxfail-costly &lt;n&gt; <br>
This specifies the number of times that a fax may fail
&quot;fatally&quot;, that is, causing telephone costs
(explained above). The default value is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxfail-total &lt;m&gt; <br>
This is the absolute maximum number of times that faxrunqd
will try to send any given fax. The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-sent-jobs [y/n] <br>
Determines whether faxrunqd should delete jobs after
sending, or leave them in the fax queue (while moving the
&quot;JOB&quot; file to &quot;JOB.done&quot;) so that they
can be seen at by <br>
&quot;faxq -o&quot;. The default value is &quot;do not
delete sent faxes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acct-log &lt;path&gt; <br>
Specifies where faxrunqd should protocol success and failure
of each try to send a fax job. The default location is
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/acct.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options that are specific to
faxrunqd are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fax-devices [tty(s)] <br>
Specifies which ttys should be used for sending jobs.
faxrunqd will always explicitely tell sendfax which modem to
use, so the settings in sendfax.config are ignored. If <br>
you use policy routing (see below), this applies only to fax
jobs that do not have a tty set by faxrunqd.policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxrunqd-log [filename] <br>
Specifies where logging information is written to. This is
only used if faxrunqd is called with the -v or -d
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policy-config [filename] <br>
Specifies a file containing rules for &quot;policy
routing&quot;, see below. Default is &quot;no
file&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxrunqd-max-pages [n] <br>
If this is set to something greater 1 (default is 10),
faxrunqd will combine multiple jobs to the same receipient
telephone number into one telephone call. The maximum <br>
number of pages that the resulting job may have is specified
here. Usually it makes no sense to increase this, but in
some surroundings it might make sense to turn off <br>
this feature by setting it to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfax-tty-map [tty] [program
path] [args] <br>
Some special cases might require running a non-default
sendfax binary for specific ttys (like &quot;testing new
version&quot; or &quot;some other call-compatible sendfax
applications for <br>
non-class-2 modems&quot;). If you want mappings for more
than one &quot;special&quot; tty devices, just use the
option multiple times. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfax-tty-map capi0
/usr/sbin/sendfax.capi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">queue-length-high [number]
[program path] [args] <br>
run the specified command when the number of jobs in the fax
queue exceeds number (this could be used to send out a
warning by syslog or e-mail when too many modems fail <br>
on a busy system, and faxes get stuck). The script will be
run only once, unless the queue length falls below the
&lsquo;&lsquo;low water mark&rsquo;&rsquo; threshold and
rises again later on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">queue-length-low [number]
[program path] [args] <br>
run the specified command when the queue length has been
over the &lsquo;&lsquo;high water&rsquo;&rsquo; threshold,
and is back below this number. This can be used to send
&lsquo;&lsquo;everything is back <br>
to normal&rsquo;&rsquo; e-mails, or just to reset the alarm
threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modem-error-threshold [number]
[program path] [args] <br>
this script is called whenever a given modem has more than
number consecutive errors. Every successfully sent fax
always resets the counter for a given modem to 0. This <br>
can be used to notify the sysadmin when a modem breaks (by
default, faxrunqd just phases out a problematic modem, but
will not report the problem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICY ROUTING <br>
faxrunqd can do some things differently, depending on the
phone number where the fax is supposed to be sent to. For
example, this might be useful to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- send in-house faxes over a
specific modem connected to a PABX (to avoid paying telco
charges)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- send long-distance faxes to
the US over a special LD provider, that is, use a specific
dial-prefix for those</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- use extra high debugging when
sending to a known-to-be problematic receipient</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is controlled by a
file, containing match / substitute rules. The name of the
file is specified with the &quot;policy-config&quot; option
in faxrunq.config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file is read from top to
bottom. Each line starting with a &quot;#&quot; sign is a
comment, and is skipped. In every other line, the first
field of the line is interpreted as a <br>
&quot;match&quot; clause, and compared to the telefone
number of an to-be-sent fax job. Regular expressions can be
used (see perlre(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the telefone number is
matched, the second field is used to substitute parts of the
telefone number, for example, cut off a local prefix, or
change a digit, or whatever. If <br>
you do not want any substitutions, put a &quot;-&quot; in
that field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third field specifies the
tty lines to use for faxes matched by this line (for
example, you might have one modem connected to a
long-distance provider, and others for local <br>
use or so). Put a &quot;-&quot; in this field if you want to
use the default fax modems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining part of the line
are appended to the sendfax command line. With those, you
can set a different dial-string (&quot;-D ATD&quot;), or a
higher debug level (&quot;-x 9&quot;), or what&acirc; <br>
ever else you can imagine. Do NOT set a tty to use here
(&quot;-l ttyS1&quot;), because that would confuse the
internal tty handling of faxrunqd, leading to weird effects
processing the <br>
fax queue!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># 12345-nnn is sent to
&quot;nnn&quot; over a local PABX, modem on tty2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^12345 s/12345// tty2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># fax to 56789 (exact match) is
sent with higher debugging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^56789$ - - -x 8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/stop <br>
if this file exists, faxrunqd will stop whatever it&rsquo;s
doing at the moment, wait for all outstanding jobs, and then
fall asleep until the file is removed. You can use this <br>
to stop queue processing while testing something, or if you
know that the modem(s) are unavailable and do not want to
run into any error messages, etc.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/fax/outgoing/faxqueue_done
<br>
Every time faxrunqd runs the fax queue, a time stamp is
written into that file. It is used by faxspool to display a
warning if the queue hasn&rsquo;t been run recently (so <br>
faxes may get stuck).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
To control faxrunqd&rsquo;s behaviour, you can send it the
following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM <br>
remove lock file, remove pid file, terminate
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP finish all fax jobs that
are currently being sent, then terminate (this is used to
signal faxrunqd &quot;I want you to terminate&quot; without
disturbing the normal flow of opera&acirc; <br>
tion - SIGINT/TERM etc. can lead to some faxes being sent
twice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
close, roll, and re-open log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
dump current modem success/failure statistics to log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
faxrunqd does not report if a modem goes bad - instead it
will just stop using it (which is good for reliable faxing,
but bad for error recovery).</p>
