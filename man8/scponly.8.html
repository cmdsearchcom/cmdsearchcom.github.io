<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> is an alternative &quot;shell&quot; (of
  sorts) for system administrators who would like to provide access to remote
  users to both read and write local files without providing any remote
  execution privileges. Functionally, it is best described as a wrapper to the
  trusted suite of ssh applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A typical usage of <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> is in creating a
  semi-public account not unlike the concept of anonymous login for ftp. This
  allows an administrator to share files in the same way an anonymous ftp setup
  would, only employing all the protection that ssh provides. This is especially
  significant if you consider that ftp authentications traverse public networks
  in a plaintext format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead of just a single anonymous user, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b>
  supports configuring potentially many users, each of which could be set up to
  provide access to distinct directory trees. Aside from the installation
  details, each of these users would have their default shell in /etc/passwd set
  to &quot;/usr/bin/scponly&quot; (or wherever you choose to install it). This
  would mean users with this shell can neither login interactively or execute
  commands remotely. They can however, scp files in and out, governed by the
  usual Unixish file permissions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FEATURES"><a class="selflink" href="#FEATURES">FEATURES</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li class="It-bullet">Logging: <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> logs time,
      client IP address, username, and the actual request to syslog.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">chroot: <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> can chroot
      to the user's home directory (or any other directory the user has
      permissions for), disallowing access to the rest of the filesystem.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">sftp compatibility: My testing of sftp against an
      <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> user worked great. This is probably
      the cleanest and most usable way for an
      <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> user to access files.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">Security checks: root login is disallowed (though root
      should never be configured to be using
      <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> as the default shell.)</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">WinSCP 2.0 compatibility:
      <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> can be compiled in WinSCP
      compatibility mode that will permit a &quot;semi-interactive&quot; shell
      that WinSCP can use.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">gftp compatibility: <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b>
      is compatible with gftp if you set &quot;use ssh2 sftp subsys&quot; in
      your gftp options.</li>
</ul>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> doesn't do anything to manage read/write
  permissions. The ssh applications already do that just fine. If you use
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b>, be aware that good old Unix-style file
  permissions are still doing the work of protecting your files.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li class="It-bullet">As recent as June 26, 2002, vulnerabilities have been
      discovered in OpenSSH. There is also a SSH1 protocol vulnerability. If
      you're going to use <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> , be aware it is
      no more secure than the ssh installation it runs on.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">I've since discovered that ssh.com's commercial ssh
      offering supports BOTH &quot;dummy users&quot; as well as functionality
      paralleling <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b>. I have not been able to
      find any notes on these features, but I did read that they exist. I will
      make a point to include more information later. It appears that OpenSSH
      does not yet support these features. At this time, I have no plans to
      end-of-life <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b>, though ultimately, I
      recognize that <b class="Nm" title="Nm">scponly</b> should eventually
      become just a feature of whichever sshd you may run.</li>
