  [ <i>...</i>]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This module can be plugged into the <i>password</i> stack of a given application
  to provide some plug-in strength-checking for passwords.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The action of this module is to prompt the user for a password and check its
  strength against a system dictionary and a set of rules for identifying poor
  choices.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first action is to prompt for a single password, check its strength and
  then, if it is considered strong, prompt for the password a second time (to
  verify that it was typed correctly on the first occasion). All being well, the
  password is passed on to subsequent modules to be installed as the new
  authentication token.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The strength checks works in the following manner: at first the <b>Cracklib</b>
  routine is called to check if the password is part of a dictionary; if this is
  not the case an additional set of strength checks is done. These checks are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Palindrome
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Is the new password a palindrome?</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Case Change Only
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Is the new password the the old one with only
  a change of case?</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similar
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Is the new password too much like the old one?
  This is primarily controlled by one argument, <b>difok</b> which is a number
  of character changes (inserts, removals, or replacements) between the old and
  new password that are enough to accept the new password. This defaults to 5
  changes.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Simple
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Is the new password too small? This is
  controlled by 6 arguments <b>minlen</b>, <b>maxclassrepeat</b>,
  <b>dcredit</b>, <b>ucredit</b>, <b>lcredit</b>, and <b>ocredit</b>. See the
  section on the arguments for the details of how these work and there
  defaults.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Rotated
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Is the new password a rotated version of the
  old password?</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Same consecutive characters
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Optional check for same consecutive
  characters.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Too long monotonic character sequence
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Optional check for too long monotonic
  character sequence.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Contains user name
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Optional check whether the password contains
  the user's name in some form.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This module with no arguments will work well for standard unix password
  encryption. With md5 encryption, passwords can be longer than 8 characters and
  the default settings for this module can make it hard for the user to choose a
  satisfactory new password. Notably, the requirement that the new password
  contain no more than 1/2 of the characters in the old password becomes a
  non-trivial constraint. For example, an old password of the form &quot;the
  quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs&quot; would be difficult to
  change... In addition, the default action is to allow passwords as small as 5
  characters in length. For a md5 systems it can be a good idea to increase the
  required minimum size of a password. One can then allow more credit for
  different kinds of characters but accept that the new password may share most
  of these characters with the old password.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>debug</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option makes the module write information
  to <b>syslog</b>(3) indicating the behavior of the module (this option does
  not write password information to the log file).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>authtok_type=</b><b></b><i>XXX</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The default action is for the module to use
  the following prompts when requesting passwords: &quot;New UNIX password:
  &quot; and &quot;Retype UNIX password: &quot;. The example word <i>UNIX</i>
  can be replaced with this option, by default it is empty.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>retry=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prompt user at most <i>N</i> times before
  returning with error. The default is <i>1</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>difok=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This argument will change the default of
  <i>5</i> for the number of character changes in the new password that
  differentiate it from the old password.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>minlen=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The minimum acceptable size for the new
  password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). In
  addition to the number of characters in the new password, credit (of +1 in
  length) is given for each different kind of character ( <i>other</i>,
  <i>upper</i>, <i>lower</i> and <i>digit</i>). The default for this parameter
  is <i>9</i> which is good for a old style UNIX password all of the same type
  of character but may be too low to exploit the added security of a md5 system.
  Note that there is a pair of length limits in <i>Cracklib</i> itself, a
  &quot;way too short&quot; limit of 4 which is hard coded in and a defined
  limit (6) that will be checked without reference to <b>minlen</b>. If you want
  to allow passwords as short as 5 characters you should not use this
  module.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dcredit=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for
  having digits in the new password. If you have less than or <i>N</i> digits,
  each digit will count +1 towards meeting the current <b>minlen</b> value. The
  default for <b>dcredit</b> is 1 which is the recommended value for
  <b>minlen</b> less than 10.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum number of digits that must be met for a new
  password.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ucredit=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for
  having upper case letters in the new password. If you have less than or
  <i>N</i> upper case letters each letter will count +1 towards meeting the
  current <b>minlen</b> value. The default for <b>ucredit</b> is <i>1</i> which
  is the recommended value for <b>minlen</b> less than 10.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum number of upper case letters that must be met for
  a new password.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>lcredit=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for
  having lower case letters in the new password. If you have less than or
  <i>N</i> lower case letters, each letter will count +1 towards meeting the
  current <b>minlen</b> value. The default for <b>lcredit</b> is 1 which is the
  recommended value for <b>minlen</b> less than 10.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum number of lower case letters that must be met for
  a new password.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ocredit=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for
  having other characters in the new password. If you have less than or <i>N</i>
  other characters, each character will count +1 towards meeting the current
  <b>minlen</b> value. The default for <b>ocredit</b> is 1 which is the
  recommended value for <b>minlen</b> less than 10.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum number of other characters that must be met for a
  new password.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>minclass=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The minimum number of required classes of
  characters for the new password. The default number is zero. The four classes
  are digits, upper and lower letters and other characters. The difference to
  the <b>credit</b> check is that a specific class if of characters is not
  required. Instead <i>N</i> out of four of the classes are required.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>maxrepeat=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reject passwords which contain more than N
  same consecutive characters. The default is 0 which means that this check is
  disabled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>maxsequence=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reject passwords which contain monotonic
  character sequences longer than N. The default is 0 which means that this
  check is disabled. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that
  most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is
  only a minor part of the password.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>maxclassrepeat=</b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reject passwords which contain more than N
  consecutive characters of the same class. The default is 0 which means that
  this check is disabled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>reject_username</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Check whether the name of the user in straight
  or reversed form is contained in the new password. If it is found the new
  password is rejected.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>gecoscheck</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Check whether the words from the GECOS field
  (usualy full name of the user) longer than 3 characters in straight or
  reversed form are contained in the new password. If any such word is found the
  new password is rejected.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>enforce_for_root</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The module will return error on failed check
  also if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default
  which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root
  can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old
  password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not
  performed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>use_authtok</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This argument is used to <i>force</i> the
  module to not prompt the user for a new password but use the one provided by
  the previously stacked <i>password</i> module.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dictpath=</b><b></b><i>/path/to/dict</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Path to the cracklib dictionaries.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODULE_TYPES_PROVIDED"><a class="selflink" href="#MODULE_TYPES_PROVIDED">MODULE
  TYPES PROVIDED</a></h1>
Only the <b>password</b> module type is provided.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUES"><a class="selflink" href="#RETURN_VALUES">RETURN
  VALUES</a></h1>
PAM_SUCCESS
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The new password passes all checks.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">No new password was entered, the username
  could not be determined or the new password fails the strength checks.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The old password was not supplied by a
  previous stacked module or got not requested from the user. The first error
  can happen if <b>use_authtok</b> is specified.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
PAM_SERVICE_ERR
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A internal error occurred.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
For an example of the use of this module, we show how it may be stacked with the
  password component of <b>pam_unix</b>(8)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
#
# These lines stack two password type modules. In this example the
# user is given 3 opportunities to enter a strong password. The
# &quot;use_authtok&quot; argument ensures that the pam_unix module does not
# prompt for a password, but instead uses the one provided by
# pam_cracklib.
#
passwd  password required       pam_cracklib.so retry=3
passwd  password required       pam_unix.so use_authtok
      
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another example (in the /etc/pam.d/passwd format) is for the case that you want
  to use md5 password encryption:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
#%PAM-1.0
#
# These lines allow a md5 systems to support passwords of at least 14
# bytes with extra credit of 2 for digits and 2 for others the new
# password must have at least three bytes that are not present in the
# old password
#
password  required pam_cracklib.so \
               difok=3 minlen=15 dcredit= 2 ocredit=2
password  required pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5
      
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And here is another example in case you don't want to use credits:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
#%PAM-1.0
#
# These lines require the user to select a password with a minimum
# length of 8 and with at least 1 digit number, 1 upper case letter,
# and 1 other character
#
password  required pam_cracklib.so \
               dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=0 minlen=8
password  required pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5
      
</pre>
</div>
