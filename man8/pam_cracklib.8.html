<p>PAM_CRACKLIB(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_CRACKLIB(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pam_cracklib - PAM module to check the password against
dictionary words</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pam_cracklib.so [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This module can be plugged into the password stack of a
given application to provide some plug-in strength-checking
for passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action of this module is to
prompt the user for a password and check its strength
against a system dictionary and a set of rules for
identifying poor choices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first action is to prompt
for a single password, check its strength and then, if it is
considered strong, prompt for the password a second time (to
verify that it was typed <br>
correctly on the first occasion). All being well, the
password is passed on to subsequent modules to be installed
as the new authentication token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The strength checks works in the
following manner: at first the Cracklib routine is called to
check if the password is part of a dictionary; if this is
not the case an additional <br>
set of strength checks is done. These checks are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Palindrome <br>
Is the new password a palindrome?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case Change Only <br>
Is the new password the the old one with only a change of
case?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar <br>
Is the new password too much like the old one? This is
primarily controlled by one argument, difok which is a
number of character changes (inserts, removals, or
replacements) <br>
between the old and new password that are enough to accept
the new password. This defaults to 5 changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple <br>
Is the new password too small? This is controlled by 6
arguments minlen, maxclassrepeat, dcredit, ucredit, lcredit,
and ocredit. See the section on the arguments for the <br>
details of how these work and there defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotated <br>
Is the new password a rotated version of the old
password?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same consecutive characters <br>
Optional check for same consecutive characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too long monotonic character
sequence <br>
Optional check for too long monotonic character
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contains user name <br>
Optional check whether the password contains the
user&rsquo;s name in some form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This module with no arguments
will work well for standard unix password encryption. With
md5 encryption, passwords can be longer than 8 characters
and the default settings for <br>
this module can make it hard for the user to choose a
satisfactory new password. Notably, the requirement that the
new password contain no more than 1/2 of the characters in
the <br>
old password becomes a non-trivial constraint. For example,
an old password of the form &quot;the quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dogs&quot; would be difficult to change... In
<br>
addition, the default action is to allow passwords as small
as 5 characters in length. For a md5 systems it can be a
good idea to increase the required minimum size of a <br>
password. One can then allow more credit for different kinds
of characters but accept that the new password may share
most of these characters with the old password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
debug <br>
This option makes the module write information to syslog(3)
indicating the behavior of the module (this option does not
write password information to the log file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authtok_type=XXX <br>
The default action is for the module to use the following
prompts when requesting passwords: &quot;New UNIX password:
&quot; and &quot;Retype UNIX password: &quot;. The example
word UNIX can be <br>
replaced with this option, by default it is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retry=N <br>
Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The
default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">difok=N <br>
This argument will change the default of 5 for the number of
character changes in the new password that differentiate it
from the old password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minlen=N <br>
The minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one
if credits are not disabled which is the default). In
addition to the number of characters in the new password,
<br>
credit (of +1 in length) is given for each different kind of
character (other, upper, lower and digit). The default for
this parameter is 9 which is good for a old style UNIX <br>
password all of the same type of character but may be too
low to exploit the added security of a md5 system. Note that
there is a pair of length limits in Cracklib itself, a <br>
&quot;way too short&quot; limit of 4 which is hard coded in
and a defined limit (6) that will be checked without
reference to minlen. If you want to allow passwords as short
as 5 <br>
characters you should not use this module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcredit=N <br>
(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for having digits in
the new password. If you have less than or N digits, each
digit will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen <br>
value. The default for dcredit is 1 which is the recommended
value for minlen less than 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum
number of digits that must be met for a new password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ucredit=N <br>
(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for having upper case
letters in the new password. If you have less than or N
upper case letters each letter will count +1 towards meeting
<br>
the current minlen value. The default for ucredit is 1 which
is the recommended value for minlen less than 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum
number of upper case letters that must be met for a new
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcredit=N <br>
(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for having lower case
letters in the new password. If you have less than or N
lower case letters, each letter will count +1 towards <br>
meeting the current minlen value. The default for lcredit is
1 which is the recommended value for minlen less than
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum
number of lower case letters that must be met for a new
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ocredit=N <br>
(N &gt;= 0) This is the maximum credit for having other
characters in the new password. If you have less than or N
other characters, each character will count +1 towards
meeting <br>
the current minlen value. The default for ocredit is 1 which
is the recommended value for minlen less than 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(N &lt; 0) This is the minimum
number of other characters that must be met for a new
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minclass=N <br>
The minimum number of required classes of characters for the
new password. The default number is zero. The four classes
are digits, upper and lower letters and other <br>
characters. The difference to the credit check is that a
specific class if of characters is not required. Instead N
out of four of the classes are required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxrepeat=N <br>
Reject passwords which contain more than N same consecutive
characters. The default is 0 which means that this check is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxsequence=N <br>
Reject passwords which contain monotonic character sequences
longer than N. The default is 0 which means that this check
is disabled. Examples of such sequence are
&rsquo;12345&rsquo; or <br>
&rsquo;fedcb&rsquo;. Note that most such passwords will not
pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a
minor part of the password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxclassrepeat=N <br>
Reject passwords which contain more than N consecutive
characters of the same class. The default is 0 which means
that this check is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reject_username <br>
Check whether the name of the user in straight or reversed
form is contained in the new password. If it is found the
new password is rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gecoscheck <br>
Check whether the words from the GECOS field (usualy full
name of the user) longer than 3 characters in straight or
reversed form are contained in the new password. If any <br>
such word is found the new password is rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enforce_for_root <br>
The module will return error on failed check also if the
user changing the password is root. This option is off by
default which means that just the message about the failed
<br>
check is printed but root can change the password anyway.
Note that root is not asked for an old password so the
checks that compare the old and new password are not <br>
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_authtok <br>
This argument is used to force the module to not prompt the
user for a new password but use the one provided by the
previously stacked password module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dictpath=/path/to/dict <br>
Path to the cracklib dictionaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULE TYPES PROVIDED <br>
Only the password module type is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
PAM_SUCCESS <br>
The new password passes all checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR <br>
No new password was entered, the username could not be
determined or the new password fails the strength
checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR <br>
The old password was not supplied by a previous stacked
module or got not requested from the user. The first error
can happen if use_authtok is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM_SERVICE_ERR <br>
A internal error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
For an example of the use of this module, we show how it may
be stacked with the password component of pam_unix(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# These lines stack two password type modules. In this
example the <br>
# user is given 3 opportunities to enter a strong password.
The <br>
# &quot;use_authtok&quot; argument ensures that the pam_unix
module does not <br>
# prompt for a password, but instead uses the one provided
by <br>
# pam_cracklib. <br>
# <br>
passwd password required pam_cracklib.so retry=3 <br>
passwd password required pam_unix.so use_authtok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example (in the
/etc/pam.d/passwd format) is for the case that you want to
use md5 password encryption:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#%PAM-1.0 <br>
# <br>
# These lines allow a md5 systems to support passwords of at
least 14 <br>
# bytes with extra credit of 2 for digits and 2 for others
the new <br>
# password must have at least three bytes that are not
present in the <br>
# old password <br>
# <br>
password required pam_cracklib.so difok=3 minlen=15 dcredit=
2 ocredit=2 <br>
password required pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And here is another example in
case you don&rsquo;t want to use credits:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#%PAM-1.0 <br>
# <br>
# These lines require the user to select a password with a
minimum <br>
# length of 8 and with at least 1 digit number, 1 upper case
letter, <br>
# and 1 other character <br>
# <br>
password required pam_cracklib.so dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1
ocredit=-1 lcredit=0 minlen=8 <br>
password required pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5</p>
