<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dacs_notices - DACS notice presentation and acknowledgement
handler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dacs_notices [dacsoptions[1]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This web service is part of the DACS suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some web service providers have
a requirement that users must acknowledge a notice of some
sort before access can be granted to an associated resource.
A user attempting to <br>
access such a resource is shown a web page containing the
notice and asked to acknowledge it or accept its conditions,
typically by pressing an &quot;I Accept&quot; button on the
web page. <br>
These notices are commonly legal notices, such as copyright
notices, licensing notices, restricted access notices, and
terms-of-use notices. This can also be applied to alert <br>
users to news (a warning about upcoming system maintenance,
for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dacs_acs(8)[2] (the DACS access
control service, or ACS) can be configured to invoke
dacs_notices when access control processing determines that
one or more notices have not been <br>
acknowledged. dacs_notices acts as both a generic notice
presentation handler (it retrieves notices, presents them to
the user, and requests the user to acknowledge the notices)
<br>
and a matching notice acknowledgement handler (executed to
process the user&rsquo;s response and take appropriate
action). The presentation aspect of the program can be
customized. It <br>
takes steps to defeat attempts to bypass notice
presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the DACS implementation, a
notice (N) is usually some text, identified by a URL. A
notice is associated with one or more resources (R) such
that an attempt to access any of <br>
these resources requires the user to first explicitly
acknowledge the textual material. A DACS event handler (H)
is responsible for presenting the notice to the user. The
basic <br>
flow of control is roughly as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER | Apache/DACS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) --- Request for R
---&gt;|---&gt; (DACS Access Control Service) <br>
b) &lt;--- Redirect to H ---|&lt;--</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c) --- Request for H
---&gt;|---&gt; (a notice presentation handler) <br>
d) &lt;--- Return N ----|&lt;---</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e) --- Submit Ack N
---&gt;|--&gt; (a notice acknowledgement handler) <br>
f) &lt;--- Redirect to R ---|&lt;--</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g) --- Request for R
---&gt;|---&gt; (DACS access control service) <br>
h) &lt;--- R ---|&lt;--</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More than one notice can be
associated with a resource, in which case they are
effectively concatenated for presentation purposes and
collectively acknowledged (so N may be N1, <br>
N2, ..., Nn and Ack N acknowledges all of them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having already acknowledged N in
a session, a user should not need to do so again.
dacs_notices uses a purely client-side approach; cookies are
issued to remember that resources <br>
have been acknowledged. These cookies are called notice
acknowledgement tokens or NATs. The implementation handles
both authenticated and unauthenticated (anonymous) users.
The <br>
cookie name consists of a prefix, the federation name, the
jurisdiction name, and a unique component; see
dacs.conf(5)[3] for a description of configuration
directives used by <br>
this program, including the NOTICES_NAT_NAME_PREFIX[4]
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program accepts the standard
FORMAT argument (see dacs(1)[5]) to select between
generation of an HTML presentation page intended for display
by a browser (the default) or XML <br>
output intended for middleware. Output customization applies
only to the former. When generating HTML output,
dacs_notices emits instructions, the content of the notices,
and an <br>
HTML form by which the user submits a response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Of course, apart from answering a skill-testing question or
the like, there&rsquo;s no way of knowing that a user has
actually read and understood the notices. It is unclear to
<br>
what extent it is necessary to go in this regard with
respect to providing support. DACS cannot guarantee that a
human user has actually read these notices and indicated
<br>
acceptance of them, but it can guarantee (optionally, using
secure mode[6]) that a NAT cannot be obtained by a client
without the client having received a copy of the <br>
notices. If the client wants to &quot;trick the system&quot;
by not actually presenting the notices to the user or
soliciting a response it can, and in this event the service
provider <br>
might consider legal recourse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In future versions of DACS, the
idea of notice/acknowledgement processing may be generalized
so that an arbitrary condition can be tested for by access
control rules, remembered <br>
through client-side state (for example), and made available
via a seamless workflow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation <br>
Configuring notice acknowledgement processing involves:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configuring an
ACS_ERROR_HANDLER[7] directive to catch ACK_NEEDED (error
code 905) events and invoke dacs_notices;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calling the
ack[8] predicate from an access control rule to specify the
notices that must be acknowledged; and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configuring
dacs_notices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following configuration
directives are examined by dacs_notices. All of these
directives are optional. Refer to the individual directives
for additional details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
NOTICES_ACK_HANDLER[9]: the URL of the notice
acknowledgement handler, if not dacs_notices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
NOTICES_ACCEPT_HANDLER[10]: the URL (absolute or relative)
to which a user agent will be redirected after a positive
acknowledgement to a notice has been received (i.e., the
<br>
notice or notices were &quot;accepted&quot;), if it is not
possible to redirect the user agent to the request that
initiated notice acknowledgement processing (e.g., if that
request <br>
used the POST method).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
NOTICES_DECLINE_HANDLER[11]: the URL (absolute or relative)
to which a user agent will be redirected after a negative
acknowledgement to a notice has been received (i.e., the
<br>
notice or notices were &quot;declined&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
When determining whether a resource has already been
acknowledged, the query component of a resource URI is not
considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When emitting HTML, the web page
generated by dacs_notices can be customized through the
notices VFS item type. The following items are emitted if
they exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; header: Initial
HTML to emit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; prologue: HTML
to emit immediately after the header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; instructions:
HTML to emit immediately after the prologue and before the
notices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; epilogue: HTML
to emit immediately after the form that follows the
notices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; trailer: Final
HTML to emit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, given the
configuration directives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VFS
&quot;[notices]dacs-fs:${Conf::DACS_HOME}/notices&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files named header and trailer
in the directory ${Conf::DACS_HOME}/notices would be
expected to contain the initial and final HTML content,
respectively. Note that these consist <br>
of text and HTML markup but are not complete HTML
documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customization of the form is
possible using configuration variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
notices_prompt_text: This label appears immediately before
the HTML form. The default is something like &quot;Your
response to the preceding notices is
requested:&lt;p&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
notices_accept_label: This label appears next to the radio
button corresponding to the &quot;accepted&quot; response.
The default is something like &quot;I Accept&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
notices_decline_label: This label appears next to the radio
button corresponding to the &quot;declined&quot; response.
The default is something like &quot;I Decline&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
notices_submit_label: This label appears in the submit
button. The default is something like &quot;Send&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples of how
these variables might be set to customize the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVAL
${Conf::notices_prompt_text} = &quot;My
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;custom&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; prompt:&quot; <br>
EVAL ${Conf::notices_accept_label} = &quot;I really do
accept&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot; <br>
EVAL ${Conf::notices_submit_label} = &quot;Submit
me!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Web Service Arguments <br>
In addition to the standard CGI arguments[12], dacs_notices
understands the following CGI arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCEPT_LABEL <br>
The value of this optional parameter is used by the notice
presentation handler and overrides the value of the
${Conf::notices_accept_label} variable, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DECLINE_LABEL <br>
The value of this optional parameter is used by the notice
presentation handler and overrides the value of the
${Conf::notices_decline_label} variable, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HMAC <br>
This value is a secure keyed hash. It is computed by
dacs_acs for use by the notice presentation handler. A hash
is also computed (over different material) by the <br>
presentation handler and passed to the notice
acknowledgement handler with the user&rsquo;s response and
other information. Its purpose is to make it difficult to
obtain a notice <br>
acknowledgement token directly by side-stepping notice
acknowledgement processing. The federation-wide HMAC key is
used. Please refer to the description of Secure Mode[6].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither this argument nor the
TIME[13] argument are used or required if the
NOTICES_SECURE_HANDLER[14] configuration directive has the
value &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTICE_URIS <br>
The value of this argument is a space-separated list of
URIs, each of which is invoked using the GET method and is
expected to return a notice document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The notices are expected to be fragments of HTML text, not
complete HTML documents; each notice is &quot;pasted&quot;
into the presentation page exactly as obtained from its
URI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME <br>
This is the Unix time at which dacs_acs invoked the notice
presentation handler for this workflow. It is used to limit
the lifetime of the workflow so that it cannot easily <br>
be rerun to obtain notice acknowledgement tokens at
will.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCE_URIS <br>
The value of this argument is a space-separated list of
URIs, each of which is associated with the notice(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESPONSE <br>
Passed to the notice acknowledgement handler, this argument
is the user&rsquo;s response and must either be accepted or
declined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Middleware Support <br>
dacs_notices can be asked to emit various flavours of XML in
support of middleware or thick clients. This is useful when
middleware would prefer to prompt the user itself (acting
<br>
as a notice presentation handler) and then invoke a
acknowledgement handler (such as dacs_notices) to obtain a
NAT. Any customizations specified for HTML output are
ignored when <br>
XML is being produced and are not passed to middleware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The XML emitted by dacs_notices
conforms to the DTD dacs_notices.dtd[15]. When acting as a
notice presentation handler, it returns a presentation_reply
element and when acting as <br>
a notice acknowledgement handler, it returns a ack_reply
element; in either mode of operation an error reply is
possible (via the common_status element).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In conjunction with
dacs_acs(8)[2], dacs_notices can optionally operate in a
&quot;secure&quot; mode, where a particular control flow is
enforced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simple (non-secure) mode
will be described first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple Mode <br>
The presentation_reply element lists one or more notices
that must be acknowledged by the user. It includes a
space-separated list of the URIs of the notices and a <br>
space-separated list of the URIs of resources that require
these notices to be acknowledged. The text of the notices
are base-64 encoded within the notice element, as <br>
specified by RFC 2045[16] (Section 6.8). The notice&rsquo;s
URI is included as an attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ack_reply element returns
the user&rsquo;s response and, optionally, a URI to which
the user can be redirected (depending on the context, this
may be the URI of the request <br>
that required notices to be acknowledged, the value of the
NOTICES_ACCEPT_HANDLER[10] directive, or the value of the
NOTICES_DECLINE_HANDLER[11] directive). If a NAT is <br>
issued, it is returned (as an HTTP cookie) by the notice
presentation handler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secure Mode <br>
The secure mode of operation, which may not be necessary in
some environments, serves two main purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. a NAT can be
cryptographically protected against forgery and alteration.
Refer to dacs.nat(5)[17].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. DACS can enforce a flow of
control so that a client cannot obtain a NAT without having
received a copy of the notice(s); this is the purpose of the
hmac and time <br>
attributes. That is, DACS can make it necessary for the
client to first call dacs_acs(8)[2] with -check_only or
-check_fail, then call the notice presentation handler to
<br>
get the text of the notices, and then call the notice
acknowledgement handler to request the NAT. No other control
flow is possible (ignoring errors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When combined, these protections
make it difficult for an attacker or unfriendly user to
bypass having to acknowledge notices by manufacturing NATs
or having DACS simply <br>
issue arbitrary NATs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of the
NOTICES_SECURE_HANDLER[14] configuration directive
determines whether the secure mode is disabled; it is
enabled by default (see dacs.conf(5)[3]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In secure mode, the total
duration of the work flow is limited to 120 seconds by
default. This limit can be set using the
NOTICES_WORKFLOW_LIFETIME_SECS[18] directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the selected
output format, the required flow of control is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. dacs_acs receives a service
request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to the requested resource
will not be granted by dacs_acs(8)[2] until one or more
notices have been acknowledged by the user. dacs_acs either
redirects the client <br>
to the notice presentation handler or returns an XML
document (dacs_acs.dtd[19]) that describes which notices
must be displayed and acknowledged; the behaviour depends on
<br>
the service request. The notice presentation handler must be
invoked and will expect to be passed the HMAC[20] and
TIME[13] arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provided they are in the same
federation, the notice presentation handler may be in a
different jurisdiction from dacs_acs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Notice presentation handler
is invoked</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user is expected to be
presented with the notices and asked to accept or decline
them. The handler either returns a web page containing an
HTML form or an XML <br>
document (dacs_notices.dtd[15]). In either case, the handler
will verify that dacs_acs had been called
&quot;recently&quot; (the security-related arguments expire
after a set <br>
amount of time and cannot be reused). Its output will
include HMAC[20] and TIME[13] arguments, either of which may
differ from the values passed into the program; the <br>
notice acknowledgement handler expects to be passed these
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Notice acknowledgement
handler is invoked</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user&rsquo;s response is
directed to the notice acknowledgement handler, which
verifies that the notice presentation handler has been
called. The handler either redirects <br>
the user appropriately or returns an XML document
(dacs_notices.dtd[15]). If no error has occurred and the
user has accepted the notices, a NAT will also be
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
In secure mode, presentation handling and acknowledgement
handling are &quot;matched&quot;. If dacs_notices provides
the latter functionality but not the former, presentation
<br>
handling must behave as dacs_notices expects (in its
acknowledgement handling mode) with respect to security.
When secure mode is used with middleware that performs its
<br>
own presentation handling, for example, middleware will
likely need to invoke dacs_notices in its presentation
handling mode solely to obtain security parameters to pass
<br>
to dacs_notices in its acknowledgement handling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dacs_notices acts as a
notice presentation handler, it will validate its arguments
(which originate from dacs_acs) and emit values that may be
validated by the <br>
notice acknowledgement handler. When dacs_notices acts as a
notice acknowledgement handler, it will validate its
arguments. Therefore, if the notice acknowledgement <br>
handler runs in secure mode, the notice presentation handler
must also run in secure mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The presentation handling mode
and the acknowledgement handling mode of dacs_notices must
agree on the URL of the acknowledgement handler. This means
that either the <br>
identical URL must be used for both modes or both modes must
find the NOTICES_ACK_HANDLER directive configured to the
same value (as when two different jurisdictions are <br>
involved).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The program exits 0 if everything was fine, 1 if an error
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
A client-side approach is used to note that resources have
been acknowledged. While this is probably the simplest
approach that works with both authenticated and
unauthenticated <br>
users, it does not offer much support if one wants
acknowledgements by authenticated users to be remembered
across sessions (i.e., permanently). One possible solution
is to allow <br>
persistent notice acknowledgements to be enabled for
authenticated users, suppressing NAT cookies and causing a
record to be written to a configured VFS item type when an
<br>
authenticated user has accepted a notice. The ack()
predicate would be extended so that the existence of
persistent acknowledgement records could be checked, and
some means of <br>
maintaining the persistent records might be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method used for generation
of custom web pages is clunky and should be
reconsidered.</p>
