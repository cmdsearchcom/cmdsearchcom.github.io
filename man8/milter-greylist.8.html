<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
milter-greylist - grey listing filter for sendmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
milter-greylist [-A] [-a autowhite_delay] [-c] [-D] [-d
dumpfile] [-f configfile] [-h] [-l] [-q] [-r] [-S] [-T] [-u
username[:groupname]] [-v] [-w greylist_delay] [-L cidrmask]
<br>
[-M prefixlen] [-P pidfile] -p socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
milter-greylist is a mail filter for sendmail that
implements grey listing, a spam filtering technique proposed
by Evan Harris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grey listing works by assuming
that contrarily to legitimate MTA, spam engines will not
retry sending their junk mail on a temporary error. The
filter will always temporarily <br>
reject mail on a first attempt, and accept it after some
time has elapsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If spammers ever try to resend
rejected messages, we can assume they will not stay idle
between the two sends. Odds are good that the spammer will
send a mail to an honey pot <br>
address and get blacklisted in a distributed black list
before the second attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, the filter can be
configured to not apply grey listing to some hosts or
networks. You can whitelist friendly SMTP servers, and you
should whitelist your own network, <br>
otherwise your SMTP clients will have real trouble to send
e-mail. Whitelisting localhost is also a must.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">milter-greylist works with two
files. greylist.conf is the configuration file. It holds the
whitelist of addresses that will not suffer grey list
filtering. It is read once <br>
upon milter-greylist startup, then it will be automatically
reloaded whenever a new message gets in and if it had been
modified. You should not send milter-greylist a kill -1 as
<br>
it will just terminate it (libmilter works that way).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See greylist.conf(5) for
documentation on the file&rsquo;s format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second file is greylist.db.
milter-greylist will regularly dump its grey list database
into this file, which is used on startup to restore the
previous grey list state. If <br>
the file does not exist or is unreadable, milter-greylist
will start with an empty grey list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default location for the
grey list database and the socket for communicating with
sendmail is /var/milter-greylist/. That directory must be
owned and writeable by the user <br>
id under which milter-greylist runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available; if present, they override their equivalents
specified in the configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Normally, milter-greylist
does not greylist senders that succeeded SMTP AUTH. This
option disables that feature and causes authentication to be
ignored. Equivalent to the <br>
noauth option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a autowhite_delay <br>
Configure auto-whitelisting. After a tuple (sender IP,
sender e-mail, recipient e-mail) has been accepted, other
identical tuples will get accepted for autowhite_delay. <br>
The default is one day. Use zero to disable
auto-whitelisting. A suffix can be added to specify seconds
(s), minutes (m), hours (h), days (d) or weeks (w). Without
any <br>
suffix, values are treated as seconds. Equivalent to the
autowhite option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Only check the configuration
file and exit. Return value is 0 if the configuration is
valid, or an error code from &lt;sysexit.h&gt;
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not fork; run in the
foreground instead. Without this flag, milter-greylist will
become a daemon. Equivalent to the nodetach option in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dumpfile <br>
Location of the dump file. Default is
/var/lib/milter-greylist/db/greylist.db. Equivalent to the
dumpfile option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f configfile <br>
Location of the config file. Default is
/etc/mail/greylist.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L cidrmask <br>
Use cidrmask as a matching mask when checking IPv4 addresses
entries in the greylist. This is aimed as a workaround to
mail farms that re-emit messages from different IP <br>
addresses. With -L 24, the matching mask is 255.255.255.0,
and all addresses within the same class C network are
considered the same. Default is -L 32, which corresponds
<br>
to all addresses considered different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M prefixlen <br>
Use prefixlen as a matching mask when checking IPv6
addresses entries in the greylist. This is aimed as a
workaround to mail farms that re-emit messages from
different IP <br>
addresses. With -M 64, the matching mask is
ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::, and all addresses within the same
subnet are considered the same. Default is -M 128, which
corresponds <br>
to all IPv6 addresses considered different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enable debug output in the
access-list management code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P pidfile <br>
write the daemon&rsquo;s PID to pidfile. Equivalent to the
pidfile option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p socket <br>
Use socket as the socket used by sendmail(8) to communicate
with milter-greylist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode. milter-greylist
will not tell SMTP clients how much time they have to wait
before the message will be accepted. Equivalent to the quiet
option in the config&acirc; <br>
uration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Display milter-greylist
version and build environment, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S If milter-greylist was built
with SPF support, then SPF-compliant senders bypass
greylisting. This flag causes messages to be greylisted
regardless of whether they are <br>
SPF-compliant or not. Equivalent to the nospf option in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Enable test mode. This alters
the meaning of rcpt lines in greylist.conf, so that only
messages sent to recipient addresses listed there are
selected for greylisting. This <br>
option and the rcpt lines have been deprecated in favor of
ACL, so do not use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username[:groupname] <br>
Drop root privileges and switch to username (and optionally
groupname) credentials. Make sure this user (and group) has
write access to greylist.db. Equivalent to the <br>
user option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enable debug output.
milter-greylist will send messages (and debug output if it
is given the -v flag) to syslogd(8) with facility LOG_MAIL.
Equivalent to the verbose <br>
option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w greylist_delay <br>
sets the minimum delay between the first attempt and the
time the message can be accepted. Default is 30 minutes. A
suffix can be added to specify seconds (s), minutes <br>
(m), hours (h), days (d) or weeks (w). Without any suffix,
values are treated as seconds. Equivalent to the greylist
option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GREYLIST MX SYNC <br>
milter-greylist is now able to sync the greylist between
multiple MX. In order to enable this feature, you need to
list the peer MXs in greylist.conf(5) like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">peer 192.0.2.17 <br>
peer 192.0.2.18</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When peers are configured,
milter-greylist will listen on the port defined for the
mxglsync service in /etc/services (defaults to 5252), and it
will connect to peers at this <br>
port. Each time an entry is added or deleted on one MX, it
will be propagated to the others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol is quite simple,
just telnet to your MX at port 5252, and type help to see
how it works. Note that connections will only be accepted
from peer MXs, even localhost <br>
will be rejected (and don&rsquo;t ever add localhost as a
peer for MX sync, as you will cause each entry in the
greylist to be added twice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an MX is down, changes to the
greylist will be queued until it gets back up again. The
queue length is limited (default is 1024 entries), and if it
overflows, newer entries <br>
will be discarded.</p>
