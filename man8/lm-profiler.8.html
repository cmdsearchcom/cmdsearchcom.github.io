This manual page documents briefly the <i>/usr/sbin/lm-profiler</i> command.
  lm-profiler is a tool for profiling disk operations. It is a part of laptop
  mode tools and is useful only in relation to rest of laptop mode tools. It
  helps you to detect programs and services that use up system resources and
  that cause disk activity, and it allows you to disable them when laptop mode
  is active.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When you start lm-profiler, it will execute a &quot;profiling run&quot;, which
  can take some time. Start lm-profiler when you are working on batteries,
  preferably, because that will allow it to analyze the actual situation that it
  is supposed to optimize. During the profiling run, you can use your system
  normally; however, any disk activity caused by your actions will end up in the
  profiler's results. When the profiling run is finished, you will be presented
  with a list of programs that deserve your attention, either because they
  listen on a network (which is not usually useful when you are working offline)
  or because they caused disk activity in a disk-spindown-unfriendly pattern.
  When lm-profiler can guess an init script that belongs to a program, it
  presents you with the opportunity to disable the program when you are working
  on battery. It does this by placing a link to the init script in
  /etc/laptop-mode/batt-stop. Any programs that lm-profiler cannot find an init
  script for is simply reported, so that you can stop the program manually if
  you want to.

<b>WARNING ABOUT DISABLING PROGRAMS:</b> It may not be safe to disable some
  programs. They may be needed for proper operation of your system. Disable
  services only if you know what they do and why you don't need them.
