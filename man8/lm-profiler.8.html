<p>LM-PROFILER(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
LM-PROFILER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
/usr/sbin/lm-profiler - laptop mode profiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/lm-profiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the /usr/sbin/lm-profiler
command. lm-profiler is a tool for profiling disk
operations. It is a part of laptop mode tools and is useful
only in <br>
relation to rest of laptop mode tools. It helps you to
detect programs and services that use up system resources
and that cause disk activity, and it allows you to disable
them <br>
when laptop mode is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you start lm-profiler, it
will execute a &quot;profiling run&quot;, which can take
some time. Start lm-profiler when you are working on
batteries, preferably, because that will allow <br>
it to analyze the actual situation that it is supposed to
optimize. During the profiling run, you can use your system
normally; however, any disk activity caused by your actions
<br>
will end up in the profiler&rsquo;s results. When the
profiling run is finished, you will be presented with a list
of programs that deserve your attention, either because they
listen <br>
on a network (which is not usually useful when you are
working offline) or because they caused disk activity in a
disk-spindown-unfriendly pattern. When lm-profiler can guess
an <br>
init script that belongs to a program, it presents you with
the opportunity to disable the program when you are working
on battery. It does this by placing a link to the init <br>
script in /etc/laptop-mode/batt-stop. Any programs that
lm-profiler cannot find an init script for is simply
reported, so that you can stop the program manually if you
want to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING ABOUT DISABLING
PROGRAMS: It may not be safe to disable some programs. They
may be needed for proper operation of your system. Disable
services only if you know what they <br>
do and why you don&rsquo;t need them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/lm-profiler.conf <br>
lm-profiler retrieves its profiling rules from this
file.</p>
