<p>FTPD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual FTPD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ftpd &acirc; Internet File Transfer Protocol server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ftpd [-AdDhlMnPSU] [-T maxtimeout] [-t timeout] [-u
mask]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ftpd is the Internet File Transfer Protocol server process.
The server uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port
specified in the &acirc;ftp&acirc; service specification;
see services(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Use IPv4 addressing only. The
default is to offer service for both families, IPv6 and
IPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Only provide IPv6 addressing
capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Permit only anonymous ftp
connections or accounts listed in /etc/ftpchroot. Other
connection attempts are refused. This option is no longer
effective if PAM is enabled. <br>
Please refer to the README file for instructions to doing
this with PAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debugging information is
written to the syslog using LOG_FTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D With this option set, ftpd
will detach and become a daemon, accepting connections on
the FTP port and forking child processes to handle them.
This has lower overhead than <br>
starting ftpd from inetd(8) and is thus useful on busy
servers to reduce load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h The server will use data
ports in the high port range for passive connections. This
range is defined by the IPPORT_HIFIRSTAUTO and
IPPORT_HILASTAUTO defines in <br>
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;. In OpenBSD they are set to 49152 and
65535 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Each successful and failed
ftp(1) session is logged using syslog with a facility of
LOG_FTP. If this option is specified twice, the retrieve
(get), store (put), append, <br>
delete, make directory, remove directory and rename
operations and their filename arguments are also logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Enables multihomed mode.
Instead of simply using ~ftp for anonymous transfers, a
directory matching the fully qualified name of the IP number
the client connected to, and <br>
located inside ~ftp is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Use numeric IP addresses in
logs instead of doing hostname lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Permit illegal port numbers
or addresses for PORT command initiated connects. By default
ftpd(8) violates the RFC and thus constrains the PORT
command to non-reserved <br>
ports and requires it use the same source address as the
connection came from. This prevents the &quot;FTP bounce
attack&quot; against services on both the local machine and
other <br>
local machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S With this option set, ftpd
logs all anonymous transfers to the file /var/log/ftpd when
this file exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Each concurrent ftp(1)
session is logged to the file /var/run/utmp, making them
visible to commands such as who(1). This option at present
is unsupporte and will always <br>
silently fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T A client may also request a
different timeout period; the maximum period allowed may be
set to timeout seconds with the -T option. The default limit
is 2 hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The inactivity timeout period
is set to timeout seconds (the default is 15 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Change the default umask from
027 to mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file /etc/nologin can be
used to disable ftp access. If the file exists, ftpd
displays it and exits. If the file /etc/ftpwelcome exists,
ftpd prints it before issuing the <br>
&acirc;ready&acirc; message. If the file /etc/motd exists,
ftpd prints it after a successful login. If the file
.message exists in a directory, ftpd prints it when that
directory is entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ftp server currently
supports the following ftp requests. The case of the
requests is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Request Description <br>
ABOR abort previous command <br>
ACCT specify account (ignored) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following non-standard or
UNIX specific commands are supported by the SITE
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Request Description <br>
UMASK change umask, e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;SITE UMASK
002&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
IDLE set idle-timer, e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;SITE IDLE
60&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
CHMOD change mode of a file, e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;SITE CHMOD
755 filename&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
HELP give help information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining ftp requests
specified in Internet RFC 959 are recognized, but not
implemented. MDTM and SIZE are not specified in RFC 959, but
will appear in the next updated FTP <br>
RFC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ftp server will abort an
active file transfer only when the ABOR command is preceded
by a Telnet &quot;Interrupt Process&quot; (IP) signal and a
Telnet &quot;Synch&quot; signal in the command Tel&acirc;
<br>
net stream, as described in Internet RFC 959. If a STAT
command is received during a data transfer, preceded by a
Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ftpd interprets file names
according to the &acirc;globbing&acirc; conventions used by
csh(1). This allows users to utilize the metacharacters
&acirc;*?[]{}~&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ftpd authenticates users
according to five rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The login name must be in the
password data base, /etc/passwd, and not have a null
password. In this case a password must be provided by the
client before any file <br>
operations may be performed. If the user has an S/Key key,
the response from a successful USER command will include an
S/Key challenge. The client may choose to respond <br>
with a PASS command giving either a standard password or an
S/Key one-time password. The server will automatically
determine which type of password it has been given and <br>
attempt to authenticate accordingly. See skey(1) for more
information on S/Key authentication. S/Key is a Trademark of
Bellcore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The login name must not
appear in the file /etc/ftpusers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The user must have a standard
shell returned by getusershell(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the user name appears in
the file /etc/ftpchroot the session&rsquo;s root will be
changed to the user&rsquo;s login directory by chroot(2) as
for an &acirc;anonymous&acirc; or &acirc;ftp&acirc; account
<br>
(see next item). However, the user must still supply a
password. This feature is intended as a compromise between a
fully anonymous account and a fully privileged <br>
account. The account should also be set up as for an
anonymous account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If the user name is
&acirc;anonymous&acirc; or &acirc;ftp&acirc;, an anonymous
ftp account must be present in the password file (user
&acirc;ftp&acirc;). In this case the user is allowed to log
in by <br>
specifying any password (by convention an email address for
the user should be used as the password).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the last case, ftpd takes
special measures to restrict the client&rsquo;s access
privileges. The server performs a chroot(2) to the home
directory of the &acirc;ftp&acirc; user. In order that <br>
system security is not breached, it is recommended that the
&acirc;ftp&acirc; subtree be constructed with care,
following these rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ftp Make the home directory
owned by &acirc;root&acirc; and unwritable by anyone (mode
555).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ftp/bin Make this directory
owned by &acirc;root&acirc; and unwritable by anyone (mode
511). This directory is required, and should contain at
least a statically linked copy of ls(1.) <br>
Any programs in this directory should be mode 111
(executable only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ftp/etc Make this directory
owned by &acirc;root&acirc; and unwritable by anyone (mode
511). The files passwd(5) and group(5) must be present for
the ls command to be able to produce <br>
owner names rather than numbers. The password field in
passwd is not used, and should not contain real passwords.
The file motd, if present, will be printed after <br>
a successful login. These files should be mode 444.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ftp/lib Make this directory
owned by &acirc;root&acirc; and unwritable by anyone (mode
511). The libraries ld-linux.so.2 and libc.so.6 (or whatever
your ls command is linked to) must <br>
be present. In order to read passwd(5) and group(5), the
library libnss_files.so.2 is also needed. Note that if
you&rsquo;re using a 2.2.* or later Linux kernel, <br>
ld-linux.so.2 must be executable as well as readable (555).
All other files should be mode 444.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ftp/pub Make this directory
mode 555 and owned by &acirc;root&acirc;. This is
traditionally where publically accessible files are stored
for download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/ftpusers List of unwelcome/restricted users. <br>
/etc/ftpchroot List of normal users who should be
chroot&rsquo;d. <br>
/etc/ftpwelcome Welcome notice. <br>
/etc/motd Welcome notice after login. <br>
/etc/nologin Displayed and access refused. <br>
/var/run/utmp List of users on the system. <br>
/var/log/ftpd Log file for anonymous transfers.</p>

syslogd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The server must run as the super-user to create sockets with
privileged port numbers. It maintains an effective user ID
of the logged in user, reverting to the super-user only <br>
when binding addresses to sockets. The possible security
holes have been extensively scrutinized, but are possibly
incomplete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The ftpd command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
