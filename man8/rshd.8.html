The <b class="Nm" title="Nm">rshd</b> server is the server for the
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">rcmd(3)</a> routine and, consequently, for the
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">rsh(1)</a> program. The server provides remote
  execution facilities with authentication based on privileged port numbers from
  trusted hosts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b class="Nm" title="Nm">rshd</b> server listens for service requests at the
  port indicated in the ``cmd'' service specification; see
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">services(5)</a>. When a service request is received
  the following protocol is initiated:
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li class="It-enum">The server checks the client's source port. If the port is
      not in the range 512-1023, the server aborts the connection.</li>
  <li class="It-enum">The server reads characters from the socket up to a null
      (`\0') byte. The resultant string is interpreted as an ASCII number, base
      10.</li>
  <li class="It-enum">If the number received in step 2 is non-zero, it is
      interpreted as the port number of a secondary stream to be used for the
      <i class="Em" title="Em">stderr</i>. A second connection is then created
      to the specified port on the client's machine. The source port of this
      second connection is also in the range 512-1023.</li>
  <li class="It-enum">The server checks the client's source address and requests
      the corresponding host name (see
      <a class="Xr" title="Xr">gethostbyaddr(3)</a>,
      <a class="Xr" title="Xr">hosts(5)</a> and
      <a class="Xr" title="Xr">named(8)</a>). If the hostname cannot be
      determined, the dot-notation representation of the host address is used.
      If the hostname is in the same domain as the server (according to the last
      two components of the domain name), or if the
      <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-a</b> option is given, the addresses for the
      hostname are requested, verifying that the name and address correspond. If
      address verification fails, the connection is aborted with the message,
      ``Host address mismatch.''</li>
  <li class="It-enum">A null terminated user name of at most 16 characters is
      retrieved on the initial socket. This user name is interpreted as the user
      identity on the <i class="Em" title="Em">client</i>'s machine.</li>
  <li class="It-enum">A null terminated user name of at most 16 characters is
      retrieved on the initial socket. This user name is interpreted as a user
      identity to use on the <b class="Sy" title="Sy">server</b>'s machine.</li>
  <li class="It-enum">A null terminated command to be passed to a shell is
      retrieved on the initial socket. The length of the command is limited by
      the upper bound on the size of the system's argument list.</li>
  <li class="It-enum"><b class="Nm" title="Nm">Rshd</b> then validates the user
      using <a class="Xr" title="Xr">ruserok(3)</a>, which uses the file
      <i class="Pa" title="Pa">/etc/hosts.equiv</i> and the
      <i class="Pa" title="Pa">.rhosts</i> file found in the user's home
      directory. The <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-l</b> option prevents
      <a class="Xr" title="Xr">ruserok(3)</a> from doing any validation based on
      the user's ``.rhosts'' file (unless the user is the superuser and the
      <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-h</b> option is used.) If the
      <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-h</b> option is not used, superuser accounts may
      not be accessed via this service at all.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    The <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-l</b> option should not be trusted without
      verifying that it works as expected with the particular version of libc
      installed on your system (and should be tested again after any libc
      update) because some versions of libc may not honor the flags used by
      <b class="Nm" title="Nm">rshd</b>.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Also note that the design of the <i class="Pa" title="Pa">.rhosts</i> system
      is COMPLETELY INSECURE except on a carefully firewalled private network.
      Under all other circumstances, <b class="Nm" title="Nm">rshd</b> should be
      disabled entirely.</li>
  <li class="It-enum">A null byte is returned on the initial socket and the
      command line is passed to the normal login shell of the user. The shell
      inherits the network connections established by
      <b class="Nm" title="Nm">rshd</b>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Transport-level keepalive messages are enabled unless the
  <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-n</b> option is present. The use of keepalive
  messages allows sessions to be timed out if the client crashes or becomes
  unreachable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-L</b> option causes all successful accesses to be
  logged to <a class="Xr" title="Xr">syslogd(8)</a> as
  <code class="Li">auth.info</code> messages and all failed accesses to be
  logged as <code class="Li">auth.notice</code>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
Except for the last one listed below, all diagnostic messages are returned on
  the initial socket, after which any network connections are closed. An error
  is indicated by a leading byte with a value of 1 (0 is returned in step 9
  above upon successful completion of all the steps prior to the execution of
  the login shell).

The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity of each client
  machine and the connecting medium. This is insecure, but is useful in an
  ``open'' environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted should be present.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A more extensible protocol (such as Telnet) should be used.</div>
