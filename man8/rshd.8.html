<p>RSHD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual RSHD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rshd &acirc; remote shell server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rshd [-ahlnL]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The rshd server is the server for the rcmd(3) routine and,
consequently, for the rsh(1) program. The server provides
remote execution facilities with authentication based on
priv&acirc; <br>
ileged port numbers from trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rshd server listens for
service requests at the port indicated in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;cmd&rsquo;&rsquo; service specification; see
services(5). When a service request is received the
following protocol <br>
is initiated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The server checks the
client&rsquo;s source port. If the port is not in the range
512-1023, the server aborts the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The server reads characters
from the socket up to a null (&lsquo; &rsquo;) byte. The
resultant string is interpreted as an ASCII number, base
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the number received in
step 2 is non-zero, it is interpreted as the port number of
a secondary stream to be used for the stderr. A second
connection is then created to the <br>
specified port on the client&rsquo;s machine. The source
port of this second connection is also in the range
512-1023.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The server checks the
client&rsquo;s source address and requests the corresponding
host name (see gethostbyaddr(3), hosts(5) and named(8)). If
the hostname cannot be determined, <br>
the dot-notation representation of the host address is used.
If the hostname is in the same domain as the server
(according to the last two components of the domain name),
or <br>
if the -a option is given, the addresses for the hostname
are requested, verifying that the name and address
correspond. If address verification fails, the connection is
<br>
aborted with the message, &lsquo;&lsquo;Host address
mismatch.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. A null terminated user name
of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.
This user name is interpreted as the user identity on the
client&rsquo;s machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. A null terminated user name
of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.
This user name is interpreted as a user identity to use on
the server&rsquo;s machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. A null terminated command to
be passed to a shell is retrieved on the initial socket. The
length of the command is limited by the upper bound on the
size of the system&rsquo;s <br>
argument list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Rshd then validates the user
using ruserok(3), which uses the file /etc/hosts.equiv and
the .rhosts file found in the user&rsquo;s home directory.
The -l option prevents ruserok(3) <br>
from doing any validation based on the user&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;.rhosts&rsquo;&rsquo; file (unless the user is
the superuser and the -h option is used.) If the -h option
is not used, superuser accounts <br>
may not be accessed via this service at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option should not be
trusted without verifying that it works as expected with the
particular version of libc installed on your system (and
should be tested again after <br>
any libc update) because some versions of libc may not honor
the flags used by rshd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that the design of the
.rhosts system is COMPLETELY INSECURE except on a carefully
firewalled private network. Under all other circumstances,
rshd should be disabled <br>
entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. A null byte is returned on
the initial socket and the command line is passed to the
normal login shell of the user. The shell inherits the
network connections established by <br>
rshd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transport-level keepalive
messages are enabled unless the -n option is present. The
use of keepalive messages allows sessions to be timed out if
the client crashes or becomes <br>
unreachable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -L option causes all
successful accesses to be logged to syslogd(8) as auth.info
messages and all failed accesses to be logged as
auth.notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Except for the last one listed below, all diagnostic
messages are returned on the initial socket, after which any
network connections are closed. An error is indicated by a
lead&acirc; <br>
ing byte with a value of 1 (0 is returned in step 9 above
upon successful completion of all the steps prior to the
execution of the login shell).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locuser too long. <br>
The name of the user on the client&rsquo;s machine is longer
than 16 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ruser too long. <br>
The name of the user on the remote machine is longer than 16
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command too long. <br>
The command line passed exceeds the size of the argument
list (as configured into the system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote directory. <br>
The chdir command to the home directory failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permission denied. <br>
The authentication procedure described above failed, or the
user requested did not exist. (These conditions are
intentionally conflated.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t make pipe. <br>
The pipe needed for the stderr, wasn&rsquo;t created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t fork; try again.
<br>
A fork by the server failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;shellname&gt;: ... <br>
The user&rsquo;s login shell could not be started. This
message is returned on the connection associated with the
stderr, and is not preceded by a flag byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
rsh(1), rcmd(3), ruserok(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity
of each client machine and the connecting medium. This is
insecure, but is useful in an
&lsquo;&lsquo;open&rsquo;&rsquo; environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A facility to allow all data
exchanges to be encrypted should be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more extensible protocol (such
as Telnet) should be used.</p>
