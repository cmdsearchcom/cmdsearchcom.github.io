<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smartd - SMART Disk Monitoring Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
smartd [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FULL PATH <br>
/usr/sbin/smartd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGE VERSION <br>
smartmontools-6.2 2013-07-26 r3841</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
[This man page is generated for the Linux version of
smartmontools. It does not contain info specific to other
platforms.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartd is a daemon that monitors
the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
(SMART) system built into most ATA/SATA and SCSI/SAS hard
drives and solid-state drives. <br>
The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the
hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out
different types of drive self-tests. This version of smartd
is <br>
compatible with ACS-2, ATA8-ACS, ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier
standards (see REFERENCES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartd will attempt to enable
SMART monitoring on ATA devices (equivalent to smartctl -s
on) and polls these and SCSI devices every 30 minutes
(configurable), logging SMART <br>
errors and changes of SMART Attributes via the SYSLOG
interface. The default location for these SYSLOG
notifications and warnings is system-dependent (typically
/var/log/mes&acirc; <br>
sages or /var/log/syslog). To change this default location,
please see the &Acirc;&acute;-l&Acirc;&acute; command-line
option described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to logging to a
file, smartd can also be configured to send email warnings
if problems are detected. Depending upon the type of
problem, you may want to run self- <br>
tests on the disk, back up the disk, replace the disk, or
use a manufacturer&Acirc;&acute;s utility to force
reallocation of bad or unreadable disk sectors. If disk
problems are detected, <br>
please see the smartctl manual page and the smartmontools
web page/FAQ for further guidance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you send a USR1 signal to
smartd it will immediately check the status of the disks,
and then return to polling the disks every 30 minutes. See
the &Acirc;&acute;-i&Acirc;&acute; option below for
addi&acirc; <br>
tional details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartd can be configured at
start-up using the configuration file
/etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf (Windows:
EXEDIR/smartd.conf). If the configuration file is
subsequently modi&acirc; <br>
fied, smartd can be told to re-read the configuration file
by sending it a HUP signal, for example with the command:
<br>
killall -HUP smartd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup, if smartd finds a
syntax error in the configuration file, it will print an
error message and then exit. However if smartd is already
running, then is told with a HUP <br>
signal to re-read the configuration file, and then find a
syntax error in this file, it will print an error message
and then continue, ignoring the contents of the (faulty)
con&acirc; <br>
figuration file, as if the HUP signal had never been
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When smartd is running in debug
mode, the INT signal (normally generated from a shell with
CONTROL-C) is treated in the same way as a HUP signal: it
makes smartd reload its con&acirc; <br>
figuration file. To exit smartd use CONTROL- <br>
On startup, in the absence of the configuration file
/etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf, the smartd daemon first
scans for all devices that support SMART. The scanning is
done as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINUX: Examine all entries
&quot;/dev/hd[a-t]&quot; for IDE/ATA devices, and
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;, &quot;/dev/sd[a-c][a-z]&quot; for
SCSI or SATA devices. Disks behind RAID controllers are not
<br>
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartd then monitors for all
possible SMART errors (corresponding to the
&Acirc;&acute;-a&Acirc;&acute; Directive in the
configuration file; see the smartd.conf(5) man page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A PREFIX, --attributelog=PREFIX <br>
Writes smartd attribute information (normalized and raw
attribute values) to files
&Acirc;&acute;PREFIX&Acirc;&acute;&Acirc;&acute;MODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv&Acirc;&acute;
or
&Acirc;&acute;PREFIX&Acirc;&acute;&Acirc;&acute;VENDOR-MODEL-SERIAL.scsi.csv&Acirc;&acute;.
At each check <br>
cycle attributes are logged as a line of semicolon separated
triplets of the form
&quot;attribute-ID;attribute-norm-value;attribute-raw-value;&quot;.
For SCSI devices error coun&acirc; <br>
ters and temperature recorded in the form
&quot;counter-name;counter-value;&quot; Each line is led by
a date string of the form &quot;yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS&quot;
(in UTC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODEL and SERIAL are build from
drive identify information, invalid characters are replaced
by underline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the PREFIX has the form
&Acirc;&acute;/path/dir/&Acirc;&acute; (e.g.
&Acirc;&acute;/var/lib/smartd/&Acirc;&acute;), then files
&Acirc;&acute;MODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv&Acirc;&acute; are created
in directory &Acirc;&acute;/path/dir&Acirc;&acute;. If the
PREFIX has the form <br>
&Acirc;&acute;/path/name&Acirc;&acute; (e.g.
&Acirc;&acute;/var/lib/misc/attrlog-&Acirc;&acute;), then
files &rsquo;nameMODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv&rsquo; are created in
directory &rsquo;/path/&rsquo;. The path must be absolute,
except if debug mode is <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B [+]FILE, --drivedb=[+]FILE
<br>
[ATA only] Read the drive database from FILE. The new
database replaces the built in database by default. If
&Acirc;&acute;+&Acirc;&acute; is specified, then the new
entries prepend the built in <br>
entries. Please see the smartctl(8) man page for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILE, --configfile=FILE <br>
Read smartd configuration Directives from FILE, instead of
from the default location /etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf
(Windows: EXEDIR/smartd.conf). If FILE does not exist, <br>
then smartd will print an error message and exit with
nonzero status. Thus, &Acirc;&acute;-c
/etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf&Acirc;&acute; can be used to
verify the existence of the default config&acirc; <br>
uration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using
&Acirc;&acute;-&Acirc;&acute; for FILE, the configuration is
read from standard input. This is useful for commands like:
<br>
echo /dev/hdb -m user@home -M test | smartd -c - -q onecheck
<br>
to perform quick and simple checks without a configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --capabilities <br>
Use capabilities(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Mail notification does
not work when used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Runs smartd in &quot;debug&quot; mode. In this mode, it
displays status information to STDOUT rather than logging it
to SYSLOG and does not fork(2) into the background and
detach <br>
from the controlling terminal. In this mode, smartd also
prints more verbose information about what it is doing than
when operating in &quot;daemon&quot; mode. In this mode, the
<br>
INT signal (normally generated from a terminal with
CONTROL-C) makes smartd reload its configuration file.
Please use CONTROL-&nbsp;to exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --showdirectives <br>
Prints a list (to STDOUT) of all the possible Directives
which may appear in the configuration file
/etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf, and then exits. These
Directives are <br>
also described later in this man page. They may appear in
the configuration file following the device name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help, --usage <br>
Prints usage message to STDOUT and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i N, --interval=N <br>
Sets the interval between disk checks to N seconds, where N
is a decimal integer. The minimum allowed value is ten and
the maximum is the largest positive integer that <br>
can be represented on your system (often 2^31-1). The
default is 1800 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the superuser can make
smartd check the status of the disks at any time by sending
it the SIGUSR1 signal, for example with the command: <br>
kill -SIGUSR1 &lt;pid&gt; <br>
where &lt;pid&gt; is the process id number of smartd. One
may also use: <br>
killall -USR1 smartd <br>
for the same purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l FACILITY,
--logfacility=FACILITY <br>
Uses syslog facility FACILITY to log the messages from
smartd. Here FACILITY is one of local0, local1, ..., local7,
or daemon [default]. If this command-line option is <br>
not used, then by default messages from smartd are logged to
the facility daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to have smartd
messages logged somewhere other than the default location,
this can typically be accomplished with (for example) the
following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1] Modify the script that
starts smartd to include the smartd command-line argument
&Acirc;&acute;-l local3&Acirc;&acute;. This tells smartd to
log its messages to facility local3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2] Modify the syslogd
configuration file (typically /etc/syslog.conf) by adding a
line of the form: <br>
local3.* /var/log/smartd.log <br>
This tells syslogd to log all the messages from facility
local3 to the designated file: /var/log/smartd.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[3] Tell syslogd to re-read its
configuration file, typically by sending the syslogd process
a SIGHUP hang-up signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[4] Start (or restart) the
smartd daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detailed information,
please refer to the man pages for syslog.conf, syslogd, and
syslog. You may also want to modify the log rotation
configuration files; see <br>
the man pages for logrotate and examine your
system&Acirc;&acute;s /etc/logrotate.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-fork <br>
Do not fork into background; this is useful when executed
from modern init methods like initng, minit or
supervise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p NAME, --pidfile=NAME <br>
Writes pidfile NAME containing the smartd Process ID number
(PID). To avoid symlink attacks make sure the directory to
which pidfile is written is only writable for root. <br>
Without this option, or if the --debug option is given, no
PID file is written on startup. If smartd is killed with a
maskable signal then the pidfile is removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q WHEN, --quit=WHEN <br>
Specifies when, if ever, smartd should exit. The valid
arguments are to this option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodev - Exit if there are no
devices to monitor, or if any errors are found at startup in
the configuration file. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errors - Exit if there are no
devices to monitor, or if any errors are found in the
configuration file /etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf at startup
or whenever it is <br>
reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodevstartup - Exit if there are
no devices to monitor at startup. But continue to run if no
devices are found whenever the configuration file is
reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">never - Only exit if a fatal
error occurs (no remaining system memory, invalid command
line arguments). In this mode, even if there are no devices
to monitor, or if the <br>
configuration file /etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf has
errors, smartd will continue to run, waiting to load a
configuration file listing valid devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onecheck - Start smartd in debug
mode, then register devices, then check
device&Acirc;&acute;s SMART status once, and then exit with
zero exit status if all of these steps worked cor&acirc;
<br>
rectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This last option is intended for
&Acirc;&acute;distribution-writers&Acirc;&acute; who want to
create automated scripts to determine whether or not to
automatically start up smartd after installing <br>
smartmontools. After starting smartd with this command-line
option, the distribution&Acirc;&acute;s install scripts
should wait a reasonable length of time (say ten seconds).
If <br>
smartd has not exited with zero status by that time, the
script should send smartd a SIGTERM or SIGKILL and assume
that smartd will not operate correctly on the host. <br>
Conversely, if smartd exits with zero status, then it is
safe to run smartd in normal daemon mode. If smartd is
unable to monitor any devices or encounters other problems
<br>
then it will return with non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showtests - Start smartd in
debug mode, then register devices, then write a list of
future scheduled self tests to stdout, and then exit with
zero exit status if all of <br>
these steps worked correctly. Device&rsquo;s SMART status is
not checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is intended to test
whether the &rsquo;-s REGEX&rsquo; directives in smartd.conf
will have the desired effect. The output lists the next test
schedules, limited to 5 tests <br>
per type and device. This is followed by a summary of all
tests of each device within the next 90 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r TYPE, --report=TYPE <br>
Intended primarily to help smartmontools developers
understand the behavior of smartmontools on non-conforming
or poorly-conforming hardware. This option reports details
<br>
of smartd transactions with the device. The option can be
used multiple times. When used just once, it shows a record
of the ioctl() transactions with the device. When <br>
used more than once, the detail of these ioctl()
transactions are reported in greater detail. The valid
arguments to this option are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ioctl - report all ioctl()
transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ataioctl - report only ioctl()
transactions with ATA devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scsiioctl - report only ioctl()
transactions with SCSI devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any argument may include a
positive integer to specify the level of detail that should
be reported. The argument should be followed by a comma then
the integer with no <br>
spaces. For example, ataioctl,2 The default level is 1, so
&Acirc;&acute;-r ataioctl,1&Acirc;&acute; and
&Acirc;&acute;-r ataioctl&Acirc;&acute; are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s PREFIX, --savestates=PREFIX
<br>
Reads/writes smartd state information from/to files
&Acirc;&acute;PREFIX&Acirc;&acute;&Acirc;&acute;MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state&Acirc;&acute;
or
&Acirc;&acute;PREFIX&Acirc;&acute;&Acirc;&acute;VENDOR-MODEL-SERIAL.scsi.state&Acirc;&acute;.
This preserves SMART attributes, drive <br>
min and max temperatures (-W directive), info about last
sent warning email (-m directive), and the time of next
check of the self-test REGEXP (-s directive) across boot
<br>
cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODEL and SERIAL are build from
drive identify information, invalid characters are replaced
by underline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the PREFIX has the form
&Acirc;&acute;/path/dir/&Acirc;&acute; (e.g.
&Acirc;&acute;/var/lib/smartd/&Acirc;&acute;), then files
&Acirc;&acute;MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state&Acirc;&acute; are
created in directory &Acirc;&acute;/path/dir&Acirc;&acute;.
If the PREFIX has the form <br>
&Acirc;&acute;/path/name&Acirc;&acute; (e.g.
&Acirc;&acute;/var/lib/misc/smartd-&Acirc;&acute;), then
files &rsquo;nameMODEL-SERIAL.ata.state&rsquo; are created
in directory &rsquo;/path/&rsquo;. The path must be
absolute, except if debug mode is <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The state information files are
read on smartd startup. The files are always (re)written
after reading the configuration file, before rereading the
configuration file <br>
(SIGHUP), before smartd shutdown, and after a check forced
by SIGUSR1. After a normal check cycle, a file is only
rewritten if an important change (which usually results <br>
in a SYSLOG output) occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w PATH, --warnexec=PATH <br>
[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE] Run the executable PATH
instead of the default script when smartd needs to send
warning messages. PATH must point to an executable <br>
binary file or script. The default script is
/etc/smartmontools/smartd_warning.sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version, --license,
--copyright <br>
Prints version, copyright, license, home page and SVN
revision information for your copy of smartd to STDOUT and
then exits. Please include this information if you are <br>
reporting bugs or problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
smartd <br>
Runs the daemon in forked mode. This is the normal way to
run smartd. Entries are logged to SYSLOG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartd -d -i 30 <br>
Run in foreground (debug) mode, checking the disk status
every 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartd -q onecheck <br>
Registers devices, and checks the status of the devices
exactly once. The exit status (the bash $? variable) will be
zero if all went well, and nonzero if no devices were <br>
detected or some other problem was encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that smartmontools provides
a start-up script in /smartd which is responsible for
starting and stopping the daemon via the normal init
interface. Using this script, you can <br>
start smartd by giving the command: <br>
/smartd start <br>
and stop it by using the command: <br>
/smartd stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The syntax of the smartd.conf(5) file is discussed
separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
smartd will make log entries at loglevel LOG_INFO if the
Normalized SMART Attribute values have changed, as reported
using the &Acirc;&acute;-t&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;-p&Acirc;&acute;, or
&Acirc;&acute;-u&Acirc;&acute; Directives. For example: <br>
&Acirc;&acute;Device: /dev/hda, SMART Attribute: 194
Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 to 93&Acirc;&acute; <br>
Note that in this message, the value given is the
&Acirc;&acute;Normalized&Acirc;&acute; not the
&Acirc;&acute;Raw&Acirc;&acute; Attribute value (the disk
temperature in this case is about 22 Celsius). The
&Acirc;&acute;-R&Acirc;&acute; and
&Acirc;&acute;-r&Acirc;&acute; Direc&acirc; <br>
tives modify this behavior, so that the information is
printed with the Raw values as well, for example: <br>
&Acirc;&acute;Device: /dev/hda, SMART Attribute: 194
Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 [Raw 22] to 93 [Raw
23]&Acirc;&acute; <br>
Here the Raw values are the actual disk temperatures in
Celsius. The way in which the Raw values are printed, and
the names under which the Attributes are reported, is
governed <br>
by the various &Acirc;&acute;-v
Num,Description&Acirc;&acute; Directives described
previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please see the smartctl manual
page for further explanation of the differences between
Normalized and Raw Attribute values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smartd will make log entries at
loglevel LOG_CRIT if a SMART Attribute has failed, for
example: <br>
&Acirc;&acute;Device: /dev/hdc, Failed SMART Attribute: 5
Reallocated_Sector_Ct&Acirc;&acute; <br>
This loglevel is used for reporting enabled by the
&Acirc;&acute;-H&Acirc;&acute;, -f&Acirc;&acute;,
&Acirc;&acute;-l selftest&Acirc;&acute;, and
&Acirc;&acute;-l error&Acirc;&acute; Directives. Entries
reporting failure of SMART Prefailure Attributes should not
be <br>
ignored: they mean that the disk is failing. Use the
smartctl utility to investigate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG TIMESTAMP TIMEZONE <br>
When smartd makes log entries, these are time-stamped. The
time stamps are in the computer&rsquo;s local time zone,
which is generally set using either the environment variable
&Acirc;&acute;TZ&Acirc;&acute; <br>
or using a time-zone file such as /etc/localtime. You may
wish to change the timezone while smartd is running (for
example, if you carry a laptop to a new time-zone and
don&rsquo;t <br>
reboot it). Due to a bug in the tzset(3) function of many
unix standard C libraries, the time-zone stamps of smartd
might not change. For some systems, smartd will work around
<br>
this problem if the time-zone is set using /etc/localtime.
The work-around fails if the time-zone is set using the
&Acirc;&acute;TZ&Acirc;&acute; variable (or a file that it
points to).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
The return value (exit status) of smartd can have the
following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0: Daemon startup successful, or
smartd was killed by a SIGTERM (or in debug mode, a
SIGQUIT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: Commandline did not
parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2: There was a syntax error in
the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3: Forking the daemon
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4: Couldn&Acirc;&acute;t create
PID file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5: Config file does not exist
(only returned in conjunction with the
&Acirc;&acute;-c&Acirc;&acute; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6: Config file exists, but
cannot be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8: smartd ran out of memory
during startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9: A compile time constant of
smartd was too small. This can be caused by an excessive
number of disks, or by lines in
/etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf that are too long. <br>
Please report this problem to
smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10: An inconsistency was found
in smartd&Acirc;&acute;s internal data structures. This
should never happen. It must be due to either a coding or
compiler bug. Please report such failures <br>
to smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16: A device explicitly listed
in /etc/smartmontools/smartd.conf can&Acirc;&acute;t be
monitored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17: smartd didn&Acirc;&acute;t
find any devices to monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">254: When in daemon mode, smartd
received a SIGINT or SIGQUIT. (Note that in debug mode,
SIGINT has the same effect as SIGHUP, and makes smartd
reload its configuration file. <br>
SIGQUIT has the same effect as SIGTERM and causes smartd to
exit with zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">132 and above <br>
smartd was killed by a signal that is not explicitly listed
above. The exit status is then 128 plus the signal number.
For example if smartd is killed by SIGKILL (signal <br>
9) then the exit status is 137.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFERENCES FOR SMART <br>
An introductory article about smartmontools is Monitoring
Hard Disks with SMART, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal,
January 2004, pages 74-77. This is
http://www.linuxjour&acirc; <br>
nal.com/article/6983 online.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to understand
better how SMART works, and what it does, a good place to
start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first volume of
the &Acirc;&acute;AT Attachment with <br>
Packet Interface-7&Acirc;&acute; (ATA/ATAPI-7) specification
Revision 4b. This documents the SMART functionality which
the smartmontools utilities provide access to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functioning of SMART was
originally defined by the SFF-8035i revision 2 and the
SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications. These are
publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) <br>
Committee.</p>
