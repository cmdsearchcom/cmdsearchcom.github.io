apt-secure - Archive authentication support for APT
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Starting with version 0.6, <b>APT</b> contains code that does signature checking
  of the Release file for all repositories. This ensures that data like packages
  in the archive can't be modified by people who have no access to the Release
  file signing key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an archive has an unsigned Release file or no Release file at all current APT
  versions will raise a warning in <b>update</b> operations and front-ends like
  <b>apt-get</b> will require explicit confirmation if an installation request
  includes a package from such an unauthenticated archive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the future APT will refuse to work with unauthenticated repositories by
  default until support for them is removed entirely. Users have the option to
  opt-in to this behavior already by setting the configuration option
  <b>Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories</b> to false.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: All APT-based package management front-ends like <b>apt-get</b>(8),
  <b>aptitude</b>(8) and <b>synaptic</b>(8) support this authentication feature,
  so this manpage uses APT to refer to them all for simplicity only.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TRUSTED_REPOSITORIES"><a class="selflink" href="#TRUSTED_REPOSITORIES">TRUSTED
  REPOSITORIES</a></h1>
The chain of trust from an APT archive to the end user is made up of several
  steps. <b>apt-secure</b> is the last step in this chain; trusting an archive
  does not mean that you trust its packages not to contain malicious code, but
  means that you trust the archive maintainer. It's the archive maintainer's
  responsibility to ensure that the archive's integrity is preserved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
apt-secure does not review signatures at a package level. If you require tools
  to do this you should look at <b>debsig-verify</b> and <b>debsign</b>
  (provided in the debsig-verify and devscripts packages respectively).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The chain of trust in Debian starts (e.g.) when a maintainer uploads a new
  package or a new version of a package to the Debian archive. In order to
  become effective, this upload needs to be signed by a key contained in one of
  the Debian package maintainer keyrings (available in the debian-keyring
  package). Maintainers' keys are signed by other maintainers following
  pre-established procedures to ensure the identity of the key holder. Similar
  procedures exist in all Debian-based distributions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once the uploaded package is verified and included in the archive, the
  maintainer signature is stripped off, and checksums of the package are
  computed and put in the Packages file. The checksums of all of the Packages
  files are then computed and put into the Release file. The Release file is
  then signed by the archive key for this Ubuntu release, and distributed
  alongside the packages and the Packages files on Ubuntu mirrors. The keys are
  in the Ubuntu archive keyring available in the ubuntu-keyring package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
End users can check the signature of the Release file, extract a checksum of a
  package from it and compare it with the checksum of the package they
  downloaded by hand - or rely on APT doing this automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice that this is distinct from checking signatures on a per package basis. It
  is designed to prevent two possible attacks:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Network &quot;man in the middle&quot;
  attacks. Without signature checking, malicious agents can introduce themselves
  into the package download process and provide malicious software either by
  controlling a network element (router, switch, etc.) or by redirecting traffic
  to a rogue server (through ARP or DNS spoofing attacks).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Mirror network compromise. Without
  signature checking, a malicious agent can compromise a mirror host and modify
  the files in it to propagate malicious software to all users downloading
  packages from that host.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, it does not defend against a compromise of the master server itself
  (which signs the packages) or against a compromise of the key used to sign the
  Release files. In any case, this mechanism can complement a per-package
  signature.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USER_CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#USER_CONFIGURATION">USER
  CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<b>apt-key</b> is the program that manages the list of keys used by APT to trust
  repositories. It can be used to add or remove keys as well as list the trusted
  keys. Limiting which key(s) are able to sign which archive is possible via the
  <b>Signed-By</b> in <b>sources.list</b>(5).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that a default installation already contains all keys to securely acquire
  packages from the default repositories, so fiddling with <b>apt-key</b> is
  only needed if third-party repositories are added.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to add a new key you need to first download it (you should make sure
  you are using a trusted communication channel when retrieving it), add it with
  <b>apt-key</b> and then run <b>apt-get update</b> so that apt can download and
  verify the InRelease or Release.gpg files from the archives you have
  configured.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARCHIVE_CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#ARCHIVE_CONFIGURATION">ARCHIVE
  CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
If you want to provide archive signatures in an archive under your maintenance
  you have to:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;<i>Create a toplevel Release file</i>,
  if it does not exist already. You can do this by running <b>apt-ftparchive
  release</b> (provided in apt-utils).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;<i>Sign it</i>. You can do this by
  running <b>gpg --clearsign -o InRelease Release</b> and <b>gpg -abs -o
  Release.gpg Release</b>.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;<i>Publish the key fingerprint</i>, so
  that your users will know what key they need to import in order to
  authenticate the files in the archive. It is best to ship your key in its own
  keyring package like Ubuntu does with ubuntu-keyring to be able to distribute
  updates and key transitions automatically later.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;<i>Provide instructions on how to add
  your archive and key</i>. If your users can't acquire your key securely the
  chain of trust described above is broken. How you can help users add your key
  depends on your archive and target audience ranging from having your keyring
  package included in another archive users already have configured (like the
  default repositories of their distribution) to leveraging the web of
  trust.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whenever the contents of the archive change (new packages are added or removed)
  the archive maintainer has to follow the first two steps outlined above.
