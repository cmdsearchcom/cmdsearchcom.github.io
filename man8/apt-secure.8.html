<p>APT-SECURE(8) APT APT-SECURE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apt-secure - Archive authentication support for APT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Starting with version 0.6, APT contains code that does
signature checking of the Release file for all repositories.
This ensures that data like packages in the archive
can&rsquo;t be <br>
modified by people who have no access to the Release file
signing key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an archive has an unsigned
Release file or no Release file at all current APT versions
will raise a warning in update operations and front-ends
like apt-get will require <br>
explicit confirmation if an installation request includes a
package from such an unauthenticated archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the future APT will refuse to
work with unauthenticated repositories by default until
support for them is removed entirely. Users have the option
to opt-in to this behavior <br>
already by setting the configuration option
Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: All APT-based package
management front-ends like apt-get(8), aptitude(8) and
synaptic(8) support this authentication feature, so this
manpage uses APT to refer to them all <br>
for simplicity only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRUSTED REPOSITORIES <br>
The chain of trust from an APT archive to the end user is
made up of several steps. apt-secure is the last step in
this chain; trusting an archive does not mean that you trust
<br>
its packages not to contain malicious code, but means that
you trust the archive maintainer. It&rsquo;s the archive
maintainer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the
archive&rsquo;s integrity <br>
is preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-secure does not review
signatures at a package level. If you require tools to do
this you should look at debsig-verify and debsign (provided
in the debsig-verify and <br>
devscripts packages respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The chain of trust in Debian
starts (e.g.) when a maintainer uploads a new package or a
new version of a package to the Debian archive. In order to
become effective, this upload <br>
needs to be signed by a key contained in one of the Debian
package maintainer keyrings (available in the debian-keyring
package). Maintainers&rsquo; keys are signed by other <br>
maintainers following pre-established procedures to ensure
the identity of the key holder. Similar procedures exist in
all Debian-based distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the uploaded package is
verified and included in the archive, the maintainer
signature is stripped off, and checksums of the package are
computed and put in the Packages <br>
file. The checksums of all of the Packages files are then
computed and put into the Release file. The Release file is
then signed by the archive key for this Ubuntu release, and
<br>
distributed alongside the packages and the Packages files on
Ubuntu mirrors. The keys are in the Ubuntu archive keyring
available in the ubuntu-keyring package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End users can check the
signature of the Release file, extract a checksum of a
package from it and compare it with the checksum of the
package they downloaded by hand - or rely <br>
on APT doing this automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that this is distinct
from checking signatures on a per package basis. It is
designed to prevent two possible attacks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Network
&quot;man in the middle&quot; attacks. Without signature
checking, malicious agents can introduce themselves into the
package download process and provide malicious software <br>
either by controlling a network element (router, switch,
etc.) or by redirecting traffic to a rogue server (through
ARP or DNS spoofing attacks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mirror network
compromise. Without signature checking, a malicious agent
can compromise a mirror host and modify the files in it to
propagate malicious software to all users <br>
downloading packages from that host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, it does not defend
against a compromise of the master server itself (which
signs the packages) or against a compromise of the key used
to sign the Release files. In any <br>
case, this mechanism can complement a per-package
signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER CONFIGURATION <br>
apt-key is the program that manages the list of keys used by
APT to trust repositories. It can be used to add or remove
keys as well as list the trusted keys. Limiting which <br>
key(s) are able to sign which archive is possible via the
Signed-By in sources.list(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a default installation
already contains all keys to securely acquire packages from
the default repositories, so fiddling with apt-key is only
needed if third-party <br>
repositories are added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to add a new key you
need to first download it (you should make sure you are
using a trusted communication channel when retrieving it),
add it with apt-key and then run <br>
apt-get update so that apt can download and verify the
InRelease or Release.gpg files from the archives you have
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARCHIVE CONFIGURATION <br>
If you want to provide archive signatures in an archive
under your maintenance you have to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Create a
toplevel Release file, if it does not exist already. You can
do this by running apt-ftparchive release (provided in
apt-utils).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sign it. You can
do this by running gpg --clearsign -o InRelease Release and
gpg -abs -o Release.gpg Release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Publish the key
fingerprint, so that your users will know what key they need
to import in order to authenticate the files in the archive.
It is best to ship your key in its <br>
own keyring package like Ubuntu does with ubuntu-keyring to
be able to distribute updates and key transitions
automatically later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Provide
instructions on how to add your archive and key. If your
users can&rsquo;t acquire your key securely the chain of
trust described above is broken. How you can help users <br>
add your key depends on your archive and target audience
ranging from having your keyring package included in another
archive users already have configured (like the default <br>
repositories of their distribution) to leveraging the web of
trust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever the contents of the
archive change (new packages are added or removed) the
archive maintainer has to follow the first two steps
outlined above.</p>
