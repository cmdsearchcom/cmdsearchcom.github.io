<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This VOMS poolaccount acquisition plugin is a
&rsquo;VOMS-aware&rsquo; modification of the
lcmaps_poolaccount.mod.8 plugin. The plugin tries to find a
local account (more specifically a <br>
UserID) based on the VOMS information that has available
from the LCMAPS, in particular the Fully Qualified Attribute
Names (FQAN). The account is acquired from an account pool.
<br>
The accounts in the account pool must exist on the system,
either locally or through a centralized account database,
e.g. LDAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gridmapdir directory is
going to be used as a persistent and open mapping database.
A pool is defined as being a set of accounts following a
particular pattern in their nam&acirc; <br>
ing, i.e. pool001 or atlas001. In the directory the plug-in
will make a new filename build-up of the Subject-DN of the
user, in URL-encode form, followed by the name of the Unix
<br>
groups that are already mapped by other plug-ins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example showing the output of ls
-li: <br>
1836080 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root
%2fdc%3dorg%2fdc%3dterena%2fdc%3dtcs%2fc%3dnl%2fo%3dnikhef%2fcn%3doscar%20koeroo%20okoeroo%40nikhef%2enl:pool:group004
<br>
1836080 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root pool003 <br>
This filename is hardlinked to the mapped accountname.
Creating this hardlink is designed to be an atomic operation
and verified to work on large installations serving multiple
<br>
services from one NFS-share.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VOMS credentials need to be
available from the LCMAPS framework.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-gridmapfile gridmapfile <br>
This file must contain FQANs to (local) user account names.
If this option is set, it will override the default path of
the gridmapfile. It is advised to use an absolute <br>
path to the gridmapfile to avoid usage of the wrong
file(path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gridmapdir gridmapdir <br>
A directory used for the mapping database.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-primary-gid-from-mapped-account
<br>
After the account is mapped, add the primary Group ID from
the passwd-file/LDAP of the mapped account as a part of the
mapping result. Default is to not add the primary <br>
Group ID.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--do-not-add-primary-gid-from-mapped-account
<br>
After the account is mapped, explicitly avoid adding the
primary Group ID from the passwd-file/LDAP of the mapped
account as a part of the mapping result.. Default is to <br>
not add the primary Group ID.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-primary-gid-as-secondary-gid-from-mapped-account
<br>
After the account is mapped, add the primary Group ID from
the passwd-file/LDAP of the mapped account as a secondary
Group ID as a part of the mapping result.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-secondary-gids-from-mapped-account
<br>
After the account is mapped, add the secondary Group ID from
the groups-file/LDAP of the mapped account as a secondary
Group ID(s) as a part of the mapping result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--do-not-require-primary-gid
<br>
This option will inspect the LCMAPS mapping store and fail
enforce the existence of a primary Group ID prior to running
this plug-in. When enabled the plug-in will ignore <br>
the absence of the primary Group ID prior to its own mapping
sequences. This plugin or the next plug-in must map the
user&rsquo;s credentials to a primary Group ID in an LCMAPS
<br>
plug-in execution policy. Default is: do not require a
primary GID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--require-primary-gid <br>
This option will inspect the LCMAPS mapping store and fail
enforce the existence of a primary Group ID prior to running
this plug-in. When enabled the plug-in will fail <br>
before doing anything on the grounds of the primary Group ID
nonexistence. The solution is to make sure that another
plug-in is ensured to map the user&rsquo;s credentials to a
<br>
primary Group ID. Default is: do not require a primary
GID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-override_inconsistency <br>
If the poolaccount is mapped from an URL-encoded Subject DN
and Unix Group names to an account, and when the gridmapfile
states that this user needs to move to another <br>
pool, then the plug-in will remap the user to the new pool.
Without this option the plug-in will fail if an existing
mapping for the user credentials exist, but do not map <br>
the configured mapping pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-max_mappings_per_credential
max_mappings_per_credential <br>
This feature is deprecated. It was intended to work together
with the Globus Dynamic Account Service/Workspace Service.
This value indicates the maximum number of ac&acirc; <br>
counts a user, or more specifically a set of credentials
(=DN + FQANS), can be mapped to. Normally this number is 1.
But if each job should run under its own account the <br>
number should be increased. The leasename (or poolindex) in
this case looks like:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">url_encoded(&lt;DN&gt;):gid1[:gid2[:gid3[...]]]:mapcount=&lt;mapnumber&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strict_poolprefix_match yes/no
<br>
If this is set to &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, a line in the
gridmapfile like &lt;FQAN&gt; .pool will result in accounts
matching the regexp pool[0-9]+. Otherwise it will be allowed
to match pool.* <br>
(legacy behaviour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS <br>
Success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL <br>
Failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Since version 1.6.0 the voms_poolaccount plugin also takes
the requested username (such as forwarded by gsissh) into
consideration. When present, the resulting poolaccount has
<br>
to match it in order for the plugin to succeed. This
requires LCMAPS version 1.6.0 or newer.</p>
