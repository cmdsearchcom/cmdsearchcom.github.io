<p>PASSWORD-PROMPT(8mandos) Mandos Manual
PASSWORD-PROMPT(8mandos)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
password-prompt - Prompt for a password and output it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
password-prompt [--prefix PREFIX | -p PREFIX] <br>
[--debug]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password-prompt {--help |
-?}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password-prompt --usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password-prompt {--version |
-V}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
All password-prompt does is prompt for a password and output
any given password to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is not very useful
on its own. This program is really meant to run as a plugin
in the Mandos client-side system, where it is used as a
fallback and alternative to <br>
retrieving passwords from a Mandos server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is little more than
a getpass(3) wrapper, although actual use of that function
is not guaranteed or implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program is commonly not invoked from the command line;
it is normally started by the Mandos plugin runner, see
plugin-runner(8mandos). Any command line options this
program <br>
accepts are therefore normally provided by the plugin
runner, and not directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix=PREFIX, -p PREFIX <br>
Prefix string shown before the password prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Enable debug mode. This will enable a lot of output to
standard error about what the program is doing. The program
will still perform all other functions normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -? <br>
Gives a help message about options and their meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Gives a short usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version, -V <br>
Prints the program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If exit status is 0, the output from the program is the
password as it was read. Otherwise, if exit status is other
than 0, the program has encountered an error, and any output
<br>
so far could be corrupt and/or truncated, and should
therefore be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
CRYPTTAB_SOURCE, CRYPTTAB_NAME <br>
If set, these environment variables will be assumed to
contain the source device name and the target device mapper
name, respectively, and will be shown as part of the <br>
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These variables will normally be
inherited from plugin-runner(8mandos), which will normally
have inherited them from /scripts/local-top/cryptroot in the
initial RAM disk <br>
environment, which will have set them from parsing kernel
arguments and /conf/conf.d/cryptroot (also in the initial
RAM disk environment), which in turn will have been <br>
created when the initial RAM disk image was created by
/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptroot, by extracting
the information of the root file system from
/etc/crypttab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior is meant to
exactly mirror the behavior of askpass, the default password
prompter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report bugs to the Mandos development mailing list:
&lt;mandos-dev@recompile.se&gt; (subscription required).
Note that this list is public. The developers can be reached
<br>
privately at &lt;mandos@recompile.se&gt; (OpenPGP key
fingerprint 153A 37F1 0BBA 0435 987F 2C4A 7223 2973 CA34
C2C4 for encrypted mail).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Note that normally, command line options will not be given
directly, but via options for the Mandos
plugin-runner(8mandos).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal invocation needs no
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password-prompt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show a prefix before the prompt;
in this case, a host name. It might be useful to be reminded
of which host needs a password, in case of KVM switches,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password-prompt
--prefix=host.example.org:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run in debug mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password-prompt --debug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
On its own, this program is very simple, and does not
exactly present any security risks. The one thing that could
be considered worthy of note is this: This program is meant
to <br>
be run by plugin-runner(8mandos), and will, when run
standalone, outside, in a normal environment, immediately
output on its standard output any presumably secret password
it <br>
just received. Therefore, when running this program
standalone (which should never normally be done), take care
not to type in any real secret password by force of habit,
since <br>
it would then immediately be shown as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To further alleviate any risk of
being locked out of a system, the plugin-runner(8mandos) has
a fallback mode which does the same thing as this program,
only with less features.</p>
