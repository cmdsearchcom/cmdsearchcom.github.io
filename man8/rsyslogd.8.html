<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rsyslogd - reliable and extended syslogd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rsyslogd [ -4 ] [ -6 ] [ -A ] [ -d ] [ -D ] [ -f config file
] <br>
[ -i pid file ] [ -l hostlist ] [ -n ] [ -N level ] <br>
[ -q ] [ -Q ] [ -s domainlist ] [ -u userlevel ] [ -v ] [ -w
] [ -x ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rsyslogd is a system utility providing support for message
logging. Support of both internet and unix domain sockets
enables this utility to support both local and remote
log&acirc; <br>
ging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this version of
rsyslog ships with extensive documentation in html format.
This is provided in the ./doc subdirectory and probably in a
separate package if you <br>
installed rsyslog via a packaging system. To use
rsyslog&rsquo;s advanced features, you need to look at the
html documentation, because the man pages only cover basic
aspects of oper&acirc; <br>
ation. For details and configuration examples, see the
rsyslog.conf (5) man page and the online documentation at
http://www.rsyslog.com/doc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rsyslogd(8) is derived from the
sysklogd package which in turn is derived from the stock BSD
sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rsyslogd provides a kind of
logging that many modern programs use. Every logged message
contains at least a time and a hostname field, normally a
program name field, too, but <br>
that depends on how trusty the logging program is. The
rsyslog package supports free definition of output formats
via templates. It also supports precise timestamps and
writing <br>
directly to databases. If the database option is used, tools
like phpLogCon can be used to view the log data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the rsyslogd sources have
been heavily modified a couple of notes are in order. First
of all there has been a systematic attempt to ensure that
rsyslogd follows its <br>
default, standard BSD behavior. Of course, some
configuration file changes are necessary in order to support
the template system. However, rsyslogd should be able to use
a stan&acirc; <br>
dard syslog.conf and act like the original syslogd. However,
an original syslogd will not work correctly with a
rsyslog-enhanced configuration file. At best, it will
generate <br>
funny looking file names. The second important concept to
note is that this version of rsyslogd interacts
transparently with the version of syslog found in the
standard <br>
libraries. If a binary linked to the standard shared
libraries fails to function correctly we would like an
example of the anomalous behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main configuration file
/etc/rsyslog.conf or an alternative file, given with the -f
option, is read at startup. Any lines that begin with the
hash mark (&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo;) and empty <br>
lines are ignored. If an error occurs during parsing the
error element is ignored. It is tried to parse the rest of
the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A When sending UDP messages, there are potentially multiple
paths to the target destination. By default, rsyslogd only
sends to the first target it can successfully send to. <br>
If -A is given, messages are sent to all targets. This may
improve reliability, but may also cause message duplication.
This option should be enabled only if it is fully <br>
understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Causes rsyslogd to listen to
IPv4 addresses only. If neither -4 nor -6 is given, rsyslogd
listens to all configured addresses of the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Causes rsyslogd to listen to
IPv6 addresses only. If neither -4 nor -6 is given, rsyslogd
listens to all configured addresses of the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c version <br>
This option has been obsoleted and has no function any
longer. It is still accepted in order not to break existing
scripts. However, future versions may not support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Runs the Bison config parser
in debug mode. This may help when hard to find syntax errors
are reported. Please note that the output generated is
deeply technical and orig&acirc; <br>
nally targeted towards developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Turns on debug mode. See the
DEBUGGING section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config file <br>
Specify an alternative configuration file instead of
/etc/rsyslog.conf, which is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i pid file <br>
Specify an alternative pid file instead of the default one.
This option must be used if multiple instances of rsyslogd
should run on a single machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l hostlist <br>
Specify a hostname that should be logged only with its
simple hostname and not the fqdn. Multiple hosts may be
specified using the colon (&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;)
separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Avoid auto-backgrounding.
This is needed especially if the rsyslogd is started and
controlled by init(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N level <br>
Do a coNfig check. Do NOT run in regular mode, just check
configuration file correctness. This option is meant to
verify a config file. To do so, run rsyslogd interac&acirc;
<br>
tively in foreground, specifying -f &lt;config-file&gt; and
-N level. The level argument modifies behaviour. Currently,
0 is the same as not specifying the -N option at all (so
<br>
this makes limited sense) and 1 actually activates the code.
Later, higher levels will mean more verbosity (this is a
forward-compatibility option). rsyslogd is started <br>
and controlled by init(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q add hostname if DNS fails
during ACL processing <br>
During ACL processing, hostnames are resolved to IP
addresses for performance reasons. If DNS fails during that
process, the hostname is added as wildcard text, which <br>
results in proper, but somewhat slower operation once DNS is
up again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q do not resolve hostnames
during ACL processing <br>
Do not resolve hostnames to IP addresses during ACL
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s domainlist <br>
Specify a domainname that should be stripped off before
logging. Multiple domains may be specified using the colon
(&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;) separator. Please be advised
that no sub- <br>
domains may be specified but only entire domains. For
example if -s north.de is specified and the host logging
resolves to satu.infodrom.north.de no domain would be cut,
<br>
you will have to specify two domains like: -s
north.de:infodrom.north.de.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u userlevel <br>
This is a &quot;catch all&quot; option for some very
seldomly-used user settings. The &quot;userlevel&quot;
variable selects multiple things. Add the specific values to
get the combined <br>
effect of them. A value of 1 prevents rsyslogd from parsing
hostnames and tags inside messages. A value of 2 prevents
rsyslogd from changing to the root directory. This <br>
is almost never a good idea in production use. This option
was introduced in support of the internal testbed. To
combine these two features, use a userlevel of 3 (1+2). <br>
Whenever you use an -u option, make sure you really
understand what you do and why you do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Suppress warnings issued when
messages are received from non-authorized machines (those,
that are in no AllowedSender list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Disable DNS for remote
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Rsyslogd reacts to a set of signals. You may easily send a
signal to rsyslogd using the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill -SIGNAL $(cat
/var/run/rsyslogd.pid)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -SIGNAL must be
replaced with the actual signal you are trying to send, e.g.
with HUP. So it then becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill -HUP $(cat
/var/run/rsyslogd.pid)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HUP This lets rsyslogd perform
close all open files. Also, in v3 a full restart will be
done in order to read changed configuration files. Note that
this means a full rsys&acirc; <br>
logd restart is done. This has, among others, the
consequence that TCP and other connections are torn down.
Also, if any queues are not running in disk assisted mode or
<br>
are not set to persist data on shutdown, queue data is lost.
HUPing rsyslogd is an extremely expensive operation and
should only be done when actually necessary. Actually, <br>
it is a rsyslgod stop immediately followed by a restart.
Future versions will remove this restart functionality of
HUP (it will go away in v5). So it is advised to use HUP
<br>
only for closing files, and a &quot;real restart&quot; (e.g.
/etc/rc.d/rsyslogd restart) to activate configuration
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM , INT , QUIT <br>
Rsyslogd will die.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USR1 Switch debugging on/off.
This option can only be used if rsyslogd is started with the
-d debug option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHLD Wait for childs if some
were born, because of wall&rsquo;ing messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY THREATS <br>
There is the potential for the rsyslogd daemon to be used as
a conduit for a denial of service attack. A rogue
program(mer) could very easily flood the rsyslogd daemon
with sys&acirc; <br>
log messages resulting in the log files consuming all the
remaining space on the filesystem. Activating logging over
the inet domain sockets will of course expose a system to
<br>
risks outside of programs or individuals on the local
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of methods of
protecting a machine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Implement kernel firewalling
to limit which hosts or networks have access to the 514/UDP
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Logging can be directed to an
isolated or non-root filesystem which, if filled, will not
impair the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The ext2 filesystem can be
used which can be configured to limit a certain percentage
of a filesystem to usage by root only. NOTE that this will
require rsyslogd to be <br>
run as a non-root process. ALSO NOTE that this will prevent
usage of remote logging on the default port since rsyslogd
will be unable to bind to the 514/UDP socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Disabling inet domain sockets
will limit risk to the local machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message replay and spoofing <br>
If remote logging is enabled, messages can easily be spoofed
and replayed. As the messages are transmitted in clear-text,
an attacker might use the information obtained from the <br>
packets for malicious things. Also, an attacker might replay
recorded messages or spoof a sender&rsquo;s IP address,
which could lead to a wrong perception of system activity.
These <br>
can be prevented by using GSS-API authentication and
encryption. Be sure to think about syslog network security
before enabling it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING <br>
When debugging is turned on using the -d option, rsyslogd
produces debugging information according to the
RSYSLOG_DEBUG environment variable and the signals received.
When run in <br>
foreground, the information is written to stdout. An
additional output file can be specified using the
RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/rsyslog.conf <br>
Configuration file for rsyslogd. See rsyslog.conf(5) for
exact information. <br>
/dev/log <br>
The Unix domain socket to from where local syslog messages
are read. <br>
/var/run/rsyslogd.pid <br>
The file containing the process id of rsyslogd. <br>
prefix/lib/rsyslog <br>
Default directory for rsyslogd modules. The prefix is
specified during compilation (e.g. /usr/local). ENVIRONMENT
<br>
RSYSLOG_DEBUG <br>
Controls runtime debug support. It contains an option string
with the following options possible (all are case
insensitive):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debug Turns on debugging and
prevents forking. This is processed earlier in the startup
than command line options (i.e. -d) and as such enables
earlier debugging output. <br>
Mutually exclusive with DebugOnDemand. <br>
DebugOnDemand <br>
Enables debugging but turns off debug output. The output can
be toggled by sending SIGUSR1. Mutually exclusive with
Debug. <br>
LogFuncFlow <br>
Print out the logical flow of functions (entering and
exiting them) <br>
FileTrace <br>
Specifies which files to trace LogFuncFlow. If not set (the
default), a LogFuncFlow trace is provided for all files. Set
to limit it to the files specified.File&acirc; <br>
Trace may be specified multiple times, one file each (e.g.
export RSYSLOG_DEBUG=&quot;LogFuncFlow FileTrace=vm.c
FileTrace=expr.c&quot; <br>
PrintFuncDB <br>
Print the content of the debug function database whenever
debug information is printed (e.g. abort case)! <br>
PrintAllDebugInfoOnExit <br>
Print all debug information immediately before rsyslogd
exits (currently not implemented!) <br>
PrintMutexAction <br>
Print mutex action as it happens. Useful for finding
deadlocks and such. <br>
NoLogTimeStamp <br>
Do not prefix log lines with a timestamp (default is to do
that). <br>
NoStdOut <br>
Do not emit debug messages to stdout. If RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG is
not set, this means no messages will be displayed at all.
<br>
Help Display a very short list of commands - hopefully a
life saver if you can&rsquo;t access the
documentation...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG <br>
If set, writes (almost) all debug message to the specified
log file in addition to stdout. <br>
RSYSLOG_MODDIR <br>
Provides the default directory in which loadable modules
reside.</p>
