<i>Innd</i>, the InterNetNews daemon, handles all incoming NNTP feeds. It reads
  the <i>active</i>(5), <i>newsfeeds</i>(5), and <i>hosts.nntp</i>(5) files into
  memory. It then opens the NNTP port to receive articles from remote sites (see
  the `` <b>-p</b>'' option), a Unix-domain stream socket to receive articles
  from local processes such as <i>nnrpd</i>(8) and <i>rnews</i>(1), and a
  Unix-domain datagram socket for use by <i>ctlinnd</i>(8) to direct the server
  to perform certain actions. It also opens the <i>history</i>(5) database and
  two log files to replace its standard output and standard error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once the files and sockets have been opened, <i>innd</i> waits for connections
  and data to be ready on its ports by using <i>select</i>(2) and non-blocking
  I/O. If no data is available, then it will flush its in-core data structures.
  The default number of seconds to timeout before flushing is 300 seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>innd</i> gets an NOSPC error (see <i>intro</i>(2)) while trying to write
  the <i>active</i> file, an article file, or the history database, it will send
  itself a ``throttle'' command. This will also happen if it gets too many I/O
  errors while writing to any files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any sub-processes spawned by the server will get a <i>nice</i>(2) value of 10.

<i>Inndstart</i> is a small front-end program that opens the NNTP port, sets its
  userid and groupid to the news maintainer, and then execs <i>innd</i> with the
  `` <b>-p</b>'' flag and a minimal secure, environment. This is a small,
  easily-understood front-end program that can be used if a site does not want
  to run <i>innd</i> with root privileges.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONTROL_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONTROL_MESSAGES">CONTROL
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
Arriving articles that have a Control header or have a Subject header that
  starts with the five characters ``cmsg&#x00A0;'' are called <i>control
  messages</i>. Except for the cancel message, these messages are implemented by
  external programs in the <i>/usr/lib/news/control</i> directory. (Cancel
  messages update the history database, so they must be handled internally; the
  cost of syncing, locking, then unlocking would be too high given the number of
  cancel messages that are received.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a control message arrives, the first word of the text is converted to
  lowercase and used as the name of the program to execute; if the named program
  does not exist, then a program named <i>default</i> is executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All control programs are invoked with four parameters. The first is the address
  of the person who posted the message; this is taken from the Sender header. If
  that header is empty, then it is taken from the From header. The second
  parameter is the address to send replies to; this is taken from the Reply-To
  header. If that header is empty then the poster's address is used. The third
  parameter will be a name under which the article is filed, relative to the
  news spool directory. The fourth parameter is the host that sent the article,
  as specified on the Path line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The distribution of control message is also different from those of standard
  articles.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control messages are normally filed in the newsgroup named <i>control</i>. They
  can be filed in subgroups, however, based on the control message command. For
  example, a newgroup message will be filed in <i>control.newgroup</i> if that
  group exists, otherwise it will be filed in <i>control</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sites may explicitly have the ``control'' newsgroup in their subscription list,
  although it is usually best to exclude it. If a control message is posted to a
  group whose name ends with the four characters ``.ctl'' then the suffix is
  stripped off and what is left is used as the group name. For example, a cancel
  message posted to ``news.admin.ctl'' will be sent to all sites that subscribe
  to ``control'' or ``news.admin.'' Newgroup and rmgroup messages receive
  additional special treatment. If the message is approved and posted to the
  name of the group being created or removed, then the message will be sent to
  all sites whose subscription patterns would cause them to receive articles
  posted in that group.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROTOCOL_DIFFERENCES"><a class="selflink" href="#PROTOCOL_DIFFERENCES">PROTOCOL
  DIFFERENCES</a></h1>
<i>Innd</i> implements the NNTP commands defined in RFC 977, with the following
  differences:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>``list''</i> maybe followed by an optional
      <i>``active''</i>, <i>``active.times''</i>, or <i>``newsgroups''</i>
      argument. This common extension is not fully supported; see
      <i>nnrpd</i>(8).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>``authinfo user''</i> and <i>``authinfo pass''</i>
      commands are implemented. These are based on the reference Unix
      implementation; no other documentation is available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A new command, <i>``mode reader''</i>, is provided. This
      command will cause the server to pass the connection on to <i>nnrpd</i>.
      The command <i>``mode query''</i> is intended for future use, and is
      currently treated the same way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A new command, <i>``xreplic
      news.group/art[,news.group/art]''</i>, is provided. This is similar to the
      <i>``ihave''</i> command (the same reply codes are used) except for the
      data that follows the command word. The data consists of entries separated
      by a single comma. Each entry consists of a newsgroup name, a slash, and
      an article number. Once processed, the article will be filed in the
      newsgroup and article numbers specified in the command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A new command, <i>``xpath messageid''</i>, is provided. The
      server responds with a 223 response and a space-separated list of
      filenames where the article was filed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">6.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The only other commands implemented are <i>``head''</i>,
      <i>``help''</i>, <i>``ihave''</i>, <i>``quit''</i>, and
    <i>``stat''</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HEADER_MODIFICATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#HEADER_MODIFICATIONS">HEADER
  MODIFICATIONS</a></h1>
<i>Innd</i> modifies as few article headers as possible, although it could be
  better in this area.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following headers, if present, are removed:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
Date-Received
Posted
Posting-Version
Received
Relay-Version
</pre>
</div>
Empty headers and headers that consist of nothing but whitespace are also
  dropped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The local site's name (as determined by the ``pathhost'' value in
  <i>inn.conf</i>(5)) and an exclamation point are prepended to the Path header.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Xref header is removed. If the article is cross-posted a new header is
  generated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Lines header will be added if it is missing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Innd</i> does not rewrite incorrect headers. For example, it will not replace
  an incorrect Lines header, but will reject the article.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#LOGGING">LOGGING</a></h1>
<i>Innd</i> reports all incoming articles in its log file. This is a text file
  with a variable number of space-separated fields in one of the following
  formats:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
mon dd hh:mm:ss.mmm + feed &lt;Message-ID&gt; site...
mon dd hh:mm:ss.mmm j feed &lt;Message-ID&gt; site...
mon dd hh:mm:ss.mmm c feed &lt;Message-ID&gt; site...
mon dd hh:mm:ss.mmm - feed &lt;Message-ID&gt; reason...
</pre>
</div>
The first three fields are the date and time to millisecond resolution. The
  fifth field is the site that sent the article (based on the Path header) and
  the sixth field is the article's Message-ID; they will be a question mark if
  the information is not available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fourth field indicates whether the article was accepted or not. If it is a
  plus sign, then the article was accepted. If it is the letter ``j'' then the
  article was accepted, but all of newsgroups have an ``j'' in their
  <i>active</i> field, so the article was filed into the ``junk'' newsgroup. If
  the fourth field is the letter ``c'', then a cancel message was accepted
  before the original article arrived. In all three cases, the article has been
  accepted and the ``site..'' field contains the space-separated list of sites
  to which the article is being sent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the fourth field is a minus sign, then the article was rejected. The reasons
  for rejection include:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
&quot;%s&quot; header too long
&quot;%s&quot; wants to cancel &lt;%s&gt; by &quot;%s&quot;
Article exceeds local limit of %s bytes
Article posted in the future -- &quot;%s&quot;
Bad &quot;%s&quot; header
Can't write history
Duplicate
Duplicate &quot;%s&quot; header
EOF in headers
Linecount %s != %s +- %s
Missing %s header
No body
No colon-space in &quot;%s&quot; header
No space
Space before colon in &quot;%s&quot; header
Too old -- &quot;%s&quot;
Unapproved for &quot;%s&quot;
Unwanted newsgroup &quot;%s&quot;
Unwanted distribution &quot;%s&quot;
Whitespace in &quot;Newsgroups&quot; header -- &quot;%s&quot;
</pre>
</div>
Where ``%s'', above, is replaced by more specific information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if an article is accepted and none of the newsgroups are valid, it
  will be logged with two lines, a ``j'' line and a minus sign line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Innd</i> also makes extensive reports through <i>syslog</i>. The first word
  of the log message will be the name of the site if the entry is site-specific
  (such as a ``connected'' message). The first word will be ``ME'' if the
  message relates to the server itself, such as when a read error occurs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the second word is the four letters ``cant'' then an error is being reported.
  In this case, the next two words generally name the system call or library
  routine that failed, and the object upon which the action was being performed.
  The rest of the line may contain other information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In other cases, the second word attempts to summarize what change has been made,
  while the rest of the line gives more specific information. The word
  ``internal'' generally indicates an internal logic error.
