<p>CRACK(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual CRACK(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Crack, Reporter - programs to break password files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Crack [options] [-fmt format] [file ...] <br>
Crack-Reporter [-quiet] [-html]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the Crack, and
Crack-Reporter commands. This manual page was written for
the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original
program does <br>
not have a manual page. Instead, there is some documentation
available at /usr/share/doc/crack which you are encouraged
to read</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Crack is not a program designed
to break the password of every user in the file. Rather, it
is designed to find weak passwords in the file, by attacking
those sorts of bad pass&acirc; <br>
words which are most likely to be used, in the order in
which they would most easily be found (ie: are most likely
to be used by a moronic user).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Crack is not designed to break
user passwords; it is designed to break password files. This
is a subtle but important distinction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Crack-Reporter will show what
passwords have been cracked, as well as view errors that
have been detected in the source password files, etc.
Guesses are listed chronologically, <br>
so users who wish to see incremental changes in the output
as Crack continues to run over a course of days or weeks,
are encouraged to wrap invocations of Crack-Reporter in a
<br>
script with diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A summary of options are included below. For Crack:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-makedict <br>
Creates and compresses the dictionaries Crack will use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-makeonly <br>
Compiles the binaries for Crack (not necessary for Debian
GNU/Linux since they are already provided)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Lets you see what the
Crack script is doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-recover <br>
Used when restarting an abnormally-terminated run;
suppresses rebuild of the gecos-derived dictionaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgnd Runs the password cracker
in the foreground, with stdin, stdout and stderr attached to
the usual places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmt format <br>
Specifies the input file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-from N <br>
Starts password cracking from rule number &quot;N&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep Prevents deletion of the
temporary file used to store the password cracker&rsquo;s
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mail E-Mail a warning message
to anyone whose password is cracked. See the script
nastygram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-network <br>
Runs the password cracker in network mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nice N <br>
Runs the password cracker at a reduced priority, so that
other jobs can take priority over the CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kill filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remote <br>
Internal options used to support networking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Crack-Reporter -html
Produces output in a fairly basic HTML-readable format.
-quiet Suppresses the reporting of errors in the password
file (corrupt entries, etc)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To run Crack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Crack -nice 10 /etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a Crack session is killed
accidentally, it can be restarted with moderate efficiency
by doing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv run/Dhostname.N
run/tempfilename <br>
Crack -recover -fmt spf run/tempfilename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However if all you wish to do is
start cracking passwords from some specific rule number, or
to restart a run whilst skipping over a few rulesets,
try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Crack [-recover] -from N
filename ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...where N is the number of the
rule to start working from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/Crack Location of the Crack program and scripts.
/var/lib/Crack/ Location for the temporary files used by
Crack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
You will find more documentation about Crack in the text
files available in /usr/share/doc/crack-common Documentation
includes the program&rsquo;s Manual (in HTML and Text
files), the <br>
User&rsquo;s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), examples,
articles and even some humour.</p>
