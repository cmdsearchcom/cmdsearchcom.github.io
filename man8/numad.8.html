<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Numad is a system daemon that monitors NUMA topology and
resource usage. It will attempt to locate processes for
efficient NUMA locality and affinity, dynamically adjusting
to <br>
changing system conditions. Numad also provides guidance to
assist management applications with initial manual binding
of CPU and memory resources for their processes. Note <br>
that numad is primarily intended for server consolidation
environments, where there might be multiple applications or
multiple virtual guests running on the same server system.
<br>
Numad is most likely to have a positive effect when
processes can be localized in a subset of the system&rsquo;s
NUMA nodes. If the entire system is dedicated to a large
in-memory <br>
database application, for example -- especially if memory
accesses will likely remain unpredictable -- numad will
probably not improve performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C &lt;0|1&gt; <br>
This option controls whether or not numad treats inactive
file cache as available memory. By default, numad assumes it
can count inactive file cache as &quot;free&quot; memory
when <br>
considering resources to match with processes. Specify -C 0
if numad should instead consider inactive file cache as a
consumed resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debug output in log, sets the
log level to LOG_DEBUG. Same effect as -l 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display usage help
information and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H &lt;THP_scan_sleep_ms&gt;
<br>
Set the desired transparent hugepage scan interval in ms.
The
/sys/kernel/mm/tranparent_hugepage/khugepaged/scan_sleep_millisecs
tunable is usually set to 10000ms by the <br>
operating system. The default is changed by numad to be
1000ms since it is helpful for the hugepage daemon to be
more aggressive when memory moves between nodes.
Speci&acirc; <br>
fying (-H 0) will cause numad to retain the system default
value. You can also make the hugepage daemon more or less
aggressive by specifying an alternate value with this <br>
option. For example, setting this value to 100ms (-H 100)
might improve the performance of workloads which use many
transparent hugepages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i
&lt;[min_interval:]max_interval&gt; <br>
Sets the time interval that numad waits between system
scans, in seconds to &lt;max_interval&gt;. Default
&lt;max_interval&gt; is 15 seconds, default
&lt;min_interval&gt; is 5 seconds. <br>
Setting a &lt;max_interval&gt; of zero will cause the daemon
to exit. (This is the normal mechanism to terminate the
daemon.) A bigger &lt;max_interval&gt; will decrease numad
over&acirc; <br>
head but also decrease responsiveness to changing loads. The
default numad max_interval can be changed in the numad.conf
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K &lt;0|1&gt; <br>
This option controls whether numad keeps interleaved memory
spread across NUMA nodes, or attempts to merge interleaved
memory to local NUMA nodes. The default is to merge <br>
interleaved memory. This is the appropriate setting to
localize processes in a subset of the system&rsquo;s NUMA
nodes. If you are running a large, single-instance
application <br>
that allocates interleaved memory because the workload will
have continuous unpredictable memory access patterns (e.g. a
large in-memory database), you might get better <br>
results by specifying -K 1 to instruct numad to keep
interleaved memory distributed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;log_level&gt; <br>
Sets the log level to &lt;log_level&gt;. Reasonable choices
are 5, 6, or 7. The default value is 5. Note that CPU values
are scaled by a factor of 100 internally and in the <br>
numad log files. Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t actually
have that many CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m
&lt;target_memory_locality&gt; <br>
Set the desired memory locality threshold to stop moving
process memory. Numad might stop retrying to coalesce
process memory when more than this percentage of the <br>
process&rsquo;s memory is already localized in the target
node(s). The default is 90%. Numad will frequently localize
more than the localization threshold percent, but it will
<br>
not necessarily do so. Decrease the threshold to allow numad
to leave more process memory distributed on various nodes.
Increase the threshold to instruct numad to try <br>
to localize more memory. Acceptable values are between 50
and 100 percent. Note that setting the target memory
locality to 100% might cause numad to continually retry to
<br>
move memory that the kernel will never succesfully move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;PID&gt; <br>
Add PID to explicit inclusion list of processes to consider
for managing, if the process also uses significant
resources. Multiple -p PID options can be specified at
dae&acirc; <br>
mon start, but after daemon start, only one PID can be added
to the inclusion list per subsequent numad invocation. Use
with -S to precisely control the scope of pro&acirc; <br>
cesses numad can manage. Note that the specified process
will not necessarily be actively managed unless it also
meets numad&rsquo;s significance threshold -- which is
cur&acirc; <br>
rently 300MB and half of a CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;PID&gt; <br>
Remove PID from both the explicit inclusion and the
exclusion lists of processes. After daemon start, only one
PID can be removed from the explicit process lists per
sub&acirc; <br>
sequent numad invocation. Use with -S and -p and -x to
precisely control the scope of processes numad can
manage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &lt;CPU_LIST&gt; <br>
Specify a list of CPUs that numad should assume are reserved
for non-numad use. No processes will be bound to the
specified CPUs by numad. This option is effective only <br>
when starting numad. You cannot change reserved CPUs
dynamically while numad is already running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;0|1&gt; <br>
This option controls whether numad scans all system
processes or only the processes on the explicit inclusion
PID list. The default is to scan all processes. Use -S 0 to
<br>
scan only the explicit inclusion PID list. Use -S 1 to again
scan all system processes (excepting those on the explicit
exclusion list). Starting numad as <br>
numad -S 0 -p &lt;PID-1&gt; -p &lt;PID-2&gt; -p
&lt;PID-3&gt; <br>
will limit scanning, and thus also automatic NUMA
management, to only those three explicitly specified
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;logical_CPU_percent&gt;
<br>
Specify the resource value of logical CPUs. Hardware threads
typically share most core resources, and so logical CPUs add
only a fraction of CPU power for many workloads. <br>
By default numad considers logical CPUs to be only 20
percent of a dedicated hardware core.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;target_utilization&gt;
<br>
Set the desired maximum consumption percentage of a node.
Default is 85%. Decrease the target value to maintain more
available resource margin on each node. Increase the <br>
target value to more exhaustively consume node resources. If
you have sized your workloads to precisely fit inside a NUMA
node, specifying (-u 100) might improve system <br>
performance by telling numad to go ahead and consume all the
resources in each node. It is possible to specify values up
to 130 percent to oversubscribe CPUs in the <br>
nodes, but memory utilization is always capped at 100%. Use
oversubscription values very carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output in log, sets
the log level to LOG_INFO. Same effect as -l 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;NCPUS[:MB]&gt; <br>
Queries numad for the best NUMA nodes to bind an entity that
needs &lt;NCPUS&gt;. The amount of memory (in MBs) is
optional, but should normally be specified as well
&lt;:MB&gt; so <br>
numad can recommend NUMA nodes with available CPU capacity
and adequate free memory. This query option can be used
regardless of whether numad is running as a daemon. <br>
(An invocation using this option when numad is not running
as a daemon, will not cause the daemon to start.) Output of
this option is a string that contains a NUMA node <br>
list. For example: 2-3,6. The recommended node list could be
saved in a shell variable (e.g., NODES) and then used as the
node list parameter in a <br>
numactl -m $NODES -N $NODES ... <br>
command. See numactl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x &lt;PID&gt; <br>
Add PID to explicit exclusion list of processes to blacklist
from managing. Multiple -x PID options can be specified at
daemon start, but after daemon start, only one PID <br>
can be added to the exclusion list per subsequent numad
invocation. Use with -S to precisely control the scope of
processes numad can manage.</p>

/var/run/numad.pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Numad can be run as a system daemon and can be managed by
the standard init mechanisms of the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If interactive (manual) control
is desired, you can start the daemon manually by typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/numad</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subsequent numad invocations
while the daemon is running can be used to dynamically
change most run-time options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can terminate numad from
running by typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/numad -i0</p>
