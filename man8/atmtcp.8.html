<p>ATMTCP(8) Maintenance Commands ATMTCP(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
atmtcp - set up ATM over TCP connections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
atmtcp [-d] [-v] command ... <br>
atmtcp -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The main purpose of atmtcp is to establish TCP connections
and to configure them as virtual ATM devices. Such pairs of
&quot;ATM over TCP&quot; devices are connected as if they
were real <br>
ATM adapters linked by a cable or fiber, i.e. SDUs sent on a
given VPI/VCI are received at the other end on the same
VPI/VCI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virtual interfaces and ATM over
TCP connections are called links. Other link types supported
by atmtcp are real interfaces, files for recording and
playback of ATM traffic, and <br>
printing a hex dump of the PDU content on standard output.
Any pair of such links can be connected with atmtcp. If
additional links are attached to such a connection, they
send <br>
to all other links, except to the first link and the
respective sender, and they receive from all other
links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atmtcp can operate with two
types of virtual interfaces: ephemeral or persistent. By
default, atmtcp interfaces are ephemeral. When the atmtcp
process that created an interface <br>
terminates, the virtual ATM device is removed as soon all
VCs are closed. However, if the interface was previously
created as a persistent interface, only the communication
<br>
stops, but the interface and all VCs on it remain intact.
Attempts to send data on an atmtcp interface in this state
fail silently, i.e. the interface behaves just like a real
<br>
ATM interface without a wire. A new atmtcp process can then
attach to the interface and resume operation. Persistent
interfaces need to be removed explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If atmtcp has any readable links
after processing the command line, it enters a loop to
perform the data forwarding. If no readable links have been
specified, atmtcp terminates <br>
after processing the command line. If any setup operation
fails, atmtcp terminates at this point and does not attempt
to cancel previous operations (e.g. creation of permanent
<br>
interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d print detailed progress information on standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v print some progress
information on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print version number of
atmtcp on standard output and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
create [itf] <br>
create a persistent interface. If no interface number is
specified, atmtcp uses the default value 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove [itf] <br>
remove a persistent interface. If the interface is still in
use, it is marked as ephemeral and will be removed as soon
as all VCs are closed. If no interface number is <br>
specified, atmtcp uses the default value 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virtual [itf] <br>
link to the corresponding virtual (ATM over TCP) interface.
If no interface number is specified, the kernel assigns the
first available number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">real [itf] <br>
link to the corresponding ATM interface. If no interface
number is specified, atmtcp uses the default value 0. If a
link requests that a VC be opened, atmtcp will attempt <br>
to open a VC with the specified QoS parameters on that
interface. If the operation succeeds, data can be sent or
received on that VC. If the operation fails, an error code
<br>
is returned to the requester. Note that only data arriving
on open VCs can be received and that a real ATM interface
never initiates a connection. atmtcp can share ATM <br>
interfaces with other applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect host [port] <br>
connect to an instance of atmtcp running on the specified
host. If the port argument is omitted, atmtcp uses the
default port 2812.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch host line [port] <br>
like connect, but connects to an ATM over TCP
&quot;switch&quot; and selects the specified virtual
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listen [port] <br>
listen for an incoming ATM over TCP connection. If the port
argument is omitted, atmtcp uses the default port 2812.
atmtcp waits until the connection is established. <br>
Only one connection is accepted per listen command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listen-bg [port] <br>
like listen, but run in background after beginning to
listen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read file [stream] <br>
play back all streams from the specified file. If a stream
number is specified, only that stream is played back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write file <br>
record the traffic of all links in the specified file. The
PDUs from each link are stored in a stream with the same
number as the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print print a hex dump of the
content of all received PDUs on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bg continue to run in background
(i.e. in a forked child process).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait [seconds] <br>
wait for the specified number of seconds. If no time is
specified, atmtcp waits for a newline on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Due to recent protocol changes, atmtcp is currently not
compatible with the ATM over TCP &quot;switch&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only AAL SDUs are exchanged, no
segmentation or reassembly is performed. That implies that
using different AALs (e.g. AAL5 and AAL0) on either side
will reveal limitations of <br>
this emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The atmtcp process needs to run
during the the whole lifetime of the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Create a pair of virtual ATM over TCP interfaces on the
local host and connect them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># session A <br>
atmtcp virtual listen <br>
# session B <br>
atmtcp virtual connect localhost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create virtual interface 1,
connect it to real ATM interface 0, then start atmsigd on
the virtual interface, and log all the traffic in a
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atmtcp virtual 1 real 0 write
/tmp/log <br>
atmsigd 1.0.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Take the previously created file
and examine the traffic sent from atmsigd using
saaldump:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># session A <br>
atmtcp virtual 1 read /tmp/log 0 wait <br>
# session B <br>
saaldump 1.0.5 <br>
# press [Enter] in session A</p>
