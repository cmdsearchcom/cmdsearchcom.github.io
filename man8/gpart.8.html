<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpart - guess PC-type hard disk partitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpart [options] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options: [-b &lt;backup

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpart tries to guess which partitions are on a hard disk. If
the primary partition table has been lost, overwritten or
destroyed the partitions still exist on the disk but the
<br>
operating system cannot access them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart ignores the primary
partition table and scans the disk (or disk image, file)
sector after sector for several filesystem/partition types.
It does so by &quot;asking&quot; filesystem <br>
recognition modules if they think a given sequence of
sectors resembles the beginning of a filesystem or partition
type. Currently the following filesystem types are known to
<br>
gpart (listed by module names) :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beos BeOS filesystem type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsddl FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD
disklabel sub-partitioning scheme used on Intel
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ext2 Linux second extended
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fat MS-DOS FAT12/16/32
&quot;filesystems&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hpfs IBM OS/2 High Performance
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hmlvm Linux LVM physical volumes
(LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lswap Linux swap partitions
(versions 0 and 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minix The Minix operating system
filesystem type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfs MS Windows NT/2000
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qnx4 QNX 4.x filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reiserfs <br>
The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X &gt; 11, 3.6.X).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s86dl Sun Solaris on Intel
platforms uses a sub-partitioning scheme on PC hard disks
similar to the BSD disklabels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfs Silicon Graphic&rsquo;s
journalling filesystem for Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More filesystem guessing modules
can be added at runtime (see the -t option). Please consult
the gpart README file for detailed explanations on how to
create guessing modules. <br>
All modules are accompanied by a guessing weight factor
which denotes how &quot;educated&quot; their guesses are
compared to other modules. This weight can be changed if a
certain module <br>
keeps on mis-identifying a partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Naturally only partitions which
have been formatted in some way can be recognized. If the
type of a partition entry in the primary partition table is
changed from x to y while <br>
the filesystem is still of type x, gpart will also still
guess a type x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No checks are performed whether
a found filesystem is clean or even consistent/mountable, so
it is quite possible that gpart may identify partitions
which existed prior to the <br>
current partitioning scheme of the disk. Especially on large
disks old file system headers/superblocks may be present a
long time until they are finally overwritten with user <br>
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be stressed that gpart
does a very heuristic job, never believe its output without
any plausability checks. It can be easily right in its
guesswork but it can also be <br>
terribly wrong. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After having found a list of
possible partition types, the list is checked for
consistency. For example, a partition which overlaps with
the previous one will be discarded. All <br>
remaining partitions are labelled with one of the following
attributes: &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;logical&quot;,
&quot;orphaned&quot; or &quot;invalid&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A partition labelled
&quot;orphaned&quot; is a logical partition which seems ok
but is missed in the chain of logical partitions. This may
occur if a logical partition is deleted from the <br>
extended partition table without overwriting the actual disk
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;invalid&quot; partition
is one that cannot be accepted because of various reasons.
If a consistent primary partition table was created in this
process it is printed and can be <br>
written to a file or device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED PARTITIONS <br>
If the disk/file to be examined consists of primary
partitions only, gpart has quite a good chance to identify
them. Extended partitions on the other hand can result in a
lot of <br>
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended partitions are realized
as a linked list of extended partition tables, each of which
include an entry pointing to a logical partition. The size
of an extended partition <br>
depends on where the last logical partition ends. This means
that extended partitions may include &quot;holes&quot;,
unallocated disk space which should only be assigned to
logical, not <br>
primary partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart tries to do its best to
check a found chain of logical partitions but there are very
many possible points of failure. If &quot;good&quot; fdisk
programs are used to create extended <br>
partitions, the resulting tables consist of a zeroed boot
record and the four partition entries of which at least two
should be marked unused. Unfortunately e.g. the fdisk
pro&acirc; <br>
gram shipped with Windows NT does not seem to zero out the
boot record area so gpart has to be overly tolerant in
recognizing extended partition tables. This tolerance may
result <br>
in quite stupid guesses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISK TRANSFERS <br>
If you want to investigate hard disks from other systems you
should note down the geometry (number of cylinders, heads
per cylinder and sectors per head) used for that disk, and
<br>
tell gpart about this geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Investigating disks from
machines with a different endianness than the scanning one
has not been tested at all, and is currently not
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LARGE DISKS <br>
gpart relies on the OS reporting the correct disk geometry.
Unfortunately sometimes the OS may report a geometry smaller
the the actual one (e.g. disks with more than 1024 or <br>
16384 cylinder).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart checks if guessed
partitions extend beyond the disk size and marks those
&quot;invalid&quot;, but may be mistaken in case the disk
size is calculated from an incorrect geometry. For <br>
instance if a disk with the geometry 1028/255/63 should be
scanned, and the OS reports 1024/255/63 gpart should be
called like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -C 1028,255,63 &lt;other
options&gt; &lt;device&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRECAUTIONS <br>
gpart may be of some help when the primary partition table
was lost or destroyed but it can under no circumstances
replace proper disk/partition table backups. To save the
mas&acirc; <br>
ter boot record (MBR) including the primary partition table
to a file type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/hda of=mbr bs=512
count=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exchanging /dev/hda with the
block device name of the disk in question. This should be
done for all disks in the system. To restore the primary
partition table without overwrit&acirc; <br>
ing the MBR type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=mbr of=/dev/hda bs=1
count=64 skip=446 seek=446</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: make sure that all
parameters are typed as shown and that the disk device is
correct. Failing to do so may result in severe filesystem
corruption. The saved file should <br>
be stored in a safe place like a floppy disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b backupfile <br>
If the guessed primary partition table seems consistent and
should be written (see the -W option) backup the current MBR
into the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C c,h,s <br>
Set the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, sectors) for the
scan. This is useful if a disk should be scanned which was
partitioned using a different geometry, if the device <br>
is a disk-image or if the disk geometry cannot be retrieved
through the PCs BIOS. No spaces are allowed between the
numbers, unless all three are enclosed in quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Check/compare mode (implies
the -q quiet option). After the scan is done, the resulting
primary partition table is compared to the existing one. The
return code of gpart <br>
then contains the number of differences (0 if they are
identical except for the boot/active flag which cannot be
guessed). This option has no effect if -d is given on the
<br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not start the guessing
loop. Useful if the partition table should be printed (in
combination with the -v option) without actually scanning
for partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Do not try to identify
extended partition tables. If there are extended partitions
on the given device gpart will most certainly complain about
too many primary partitions <br>
because there can be only four primary partitions. Existing
logical partitions will be listed as primary ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Do not skip disk read errors.
If this option is given, and short disk reads or general
disk read errors (EIO) are encountered, gpart will exit. If
not given, the program <br>
tries to continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Full scan. When a possible
partition is found, gpart normally skips all sectors this
entry seems to occupy and continues the scan from the end of
the last possible parti&acirc; <br>
tion. The disk scan can take quite a while if this option is
given, be patient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Do not try to get the disk
geometry from the OS. If the device is no block or character
device but a plain file this option should be supplied. If
the file to be scanned <br>
is an image of a disk, the geometry can be given by the -C
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show some help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Run interactively. Each time
a possible partition is identified the user is asked for
confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K last sector <br>
Scan only up to the given sector or the end of the file or
device whichever comes first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k sectors <br>
Skip given number of sectors before the scan. Potentially
useful if a partition is looked for at the end of a large
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L List available
filesystem/partition type modules and their weights, then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
Log output to the given file (even if -q was supplied).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n increment <br>
Scan increment: number of sectors or &quot;s&quot; for
single sector increment, &quot;h&quot; for an increment of
sectors per head (depends on geometry) or &quot;c&quot; for
cylinder increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The increment also influences
the condition where extended partition tables are searched:
if the scan increment is &quot;s&quot; (i.e. 1) extended
partition tables are required to <br>
be on a head boundary, otherwise they must be on a cylinder
boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the disk geometry could not
be retrieved and no geometry was given on the command line,
the default increment is one sector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet/no output mode. However
if a logfile was specified (see -l option) all output is
written to that file. This option overrides the -i
interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sector size <br>
Preset medium sector size. gpart tries to find out the
sector size but may fail in doing so. Probed sector sizes
are 2^i, i=9..14 (512 to 16384 bytes). The default medium
<br>
sector size is 512 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. This option can
be given more than once resulting in quite a lot of
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W device <br>
Write partition table. If a consistent primary partition
table has been guessed it can be written to the specified
file or device. The supplied device can be the same as <br>
the scanned one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally the guessed
partition entries can be edited. No checks are performed on
the entered values, thus the resulting table is allowed to
be highly inconsistent. <br>
Please beware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The guessed partition
table should be checked very carefully before writing it
back. You can always write the guessed partition table into
a plain file and write <br>
this into sector 0 using dd(1) (see section PRECAUTIONS
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w module name,weight <br>
Put the given module at the head of the module chain and
assign a new weight to that module. All modules are given an
initial weight of 1.0. Again no spaces are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default settings are &quot;-n
h&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
- To scan the first IDE hard disk under Linux using default
settings type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart /dev/hda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- To print the primary partition
table of the third IDE drive without starting the scan loop
in FreeBSD type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -vvd /dev/wd2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If lilo(8) was installed in
the master boot record (MBR) of a hard disk it saves the
contents of the first sector in a file called
/boot/boot.&lt;major/minor&gt;. To list the parti&acirc;
<br>
tions contained in such a file type e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -vdg /boot/boot.0300</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the partition table contains
an extended partition, gpart will complain about invalid
extended partition tables because the extended entry points
to sectors not within that <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Usually the first primary
partition starts on the second head. If gpart cannot
identify the first partition properly this may not be the
case. gpart can be told to start the <br>
scan directly from sector one of the disk, using the
sector-wise scan mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -k 1 -n s /dev/hdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Suppose gpart identifies an
NTFS partition as FAT on a certain disk. In this situation
the &quot;ntfs&quot; module should be made the first module
to be probed and given a weight higher <br>
than the usual weight of 1.0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -w ntfs,1.5 /dev/hdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list the available modules
and their weights use the -L option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- After having checked the
output of gpart at least thrice, the primary partition table
can be written back to the device this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -W /dev/sdc /dev/sdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This of course may be extremely
dangerous to your health and social security, so beware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A hard disk with 63 sectors
per head is scanned in steps of 63 sectors. To perform the
scan on every second head while skipping the first 1008
sectors type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -k 1008 -n 126
/dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If you want to see how easily
gpart can be mislead, and how many probable partition starts
are on a disk, search the whole disk really sector by
sector, writing all output to a <br>
logfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpart -vvfn s -ql /tmp/gpart.log
/dev/sd2 &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually gpart will not be able
to produce an educated guess of the primary partition table
in this mode. The logfile however may contain enough hints
to manually reconstruct the <br>
partition table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/* <br>
Hard disk block devices. The naming scheme of hard disk
block devices is OS dependent, consult your system manuals
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
There are many error message types, all of them should be
self-explanatory. Complain if they are not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
gpart is beta software, so expect buggy behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- gpart only accepts extended
partition links with one logical partition. There may be
fdisk variants out there creating links with up to three
logical partition entries but <br>
these are not accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TO DO <br>
- Support big-endian architectures. <br>
- Test on 64-bit architectures. <br>
- Look for boot manager partitions (e.g. OS/2 BM). <br>
- Think about reconstructing logical partition chains.</p>
