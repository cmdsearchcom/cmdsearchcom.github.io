<p>FAXSEND(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual FAXSEND(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faxsend - HylaFAX facsimile transmit program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/sbin/faxsend [ -l ] [ -p ] [ -c config ] -m device-ID
qfile [qfile [qfile [...]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
faxsend is the program that implements the facsimile
transmission protocol for the HylaFAX system. faxsend is
invoked by the faxq scheduler process for each facsimile
transmit <br>
attempt. faxsend assumes that its current working directory
is the top of the spooling hierarchy, that a suitable modem
device has been allocated for its use, and that all
docu&acirc; <br>
ments to be sent are already converted to TIFF/F (TIFF Class
F) at the appropriate resolution and with an appropriate
data encoding. In normal use faxsend will inherit a
lock&acirc; <br>
file for the modem from the faxq process. The format of the
job description file specified on the command line is
described in sendq(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxsend initializes the modem
before attempting to transmit the facsimile using the
information in the appropriate modem configuration file. If
the modem does not respond to <br>
this initialization, faxsend will repeatedly try to
initialize the modem. This behaviour is required for
send-only environments in which a faxgetty(8) process is not
run (and <br>
the modem would be known to be in a properly initialized
state). faxsend catches SIGINT and SIGTERM and cleans up any
resources it controls; this is the mechanism used by faxq
<br>
to abort a job while it is in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple fax jobs of documents
with varying formatting may be sent in one fax call by
&lsquo;&lsquo;batching&rsquo;&rsquo; them by supplying
faxsend with multiple qfile entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many aspects of faxsend
operation are controlled through a configuration file. The
configuration file is located in the spooler hierarchy in
the etc subdirectory and is named <br>
config.device-ID; consult hylafax-config(5) for detailed
information on the contents of configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config Treat config as a
configuration parameter specification that is interpreted
after reading the per-device configuration file. For
example, &lsquo;&lsquo;-c sessiontracing:0x4f&rsquo;&rsquo;
<br>
would set the SessionTracing configuration parameter to
&lsquo;&lsquo;0x4f&rsquo;&rsquo;, overriding any setting in
the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m devID The device to use in
processing the job. Note that this is a device identifier
and not the pathname of the tty special file. A device
identifier is formed from a <br>
device filename by removing any leading
&lsquo;&lsquo;/dev/&rsquo;&rsquo; and converting any
&lsquo;&lsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo; characters to
&lsquo;&lsquo;_&rsquo;&rsquo; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Do the UUCP lockfile protocol
in faxsend. By default faxsend assumes that it is invoked
with the device already locked and that it does not need to
manage the lock&acirc; <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Do not change the process
priority when transmitting. Normally faxsend will raise its
priority to reduce i/o latency. This option is useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
faxsend returns the new job status to faxq through the
returned value in the associated qfile: send_retry, retry
job; send_failed, job finished without success, send_done,
job <br>
completed successfully, send_reformat, job should be retried
after documents are reformatted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/spool/hylafax/etc/config.devID device-specific
configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consult hylafax-server(5) for a
complete discussion of the structure and content of the
spooling area.</p>
