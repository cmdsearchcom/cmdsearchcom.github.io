<p>IFCONFIG(8) Linux System Administrator&rsquo;s Manual
IFCONFIG(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ifconfig - configure a network interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ifconfig [-v] [-a] [-s] [interface] <br>
ifconfig [-v] interface [aftype] options | address ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
This program is obsolete! For replacement check ip addr and
ip link. For statistics use ip -s link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ifconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network
interfaces. It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as
necessary. After that, it is usually only needed when <br>
debugging or when system tuning is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no arguments are given,
ifconfig displays the status of the currently active
interfaces. If a single interface argument is given, it
displays the status of the given inter&acirc; <br>
face only; if a single -a argument is given, it displays the
status of all interfaces, even those that are down.
Otherwise, it configures an interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address Families <br>
If the first argument after the interface name is recognized
as the name of a supported address family, that address
family is used for decoding and displaying all protocol <br>
addresses. Currently supported address families include inet
(TCP/IP, default), inet6 (IPv6), ax25 (AMPR Packet Radio),
ddp (Appletalk Phase 2), ipx (Novell IPX) and netrom <br>
(AMPR Packet radio). All numbers supplied as parts in IPv4
dotted decimal notation may be decimal, octal, or
hexadecimal, as specified in the ISO C standard (that is, a
leading <br>
0x or 0X implies hexadecimal; otherwise, a leading
&rsquo;0&rsquo; implies octal; otherwise, the number is
interpreted as decimal). Use of hexadecimal and octal
numbers is not RFC-compliant <br>
and therefore its use is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a display all interfaces which are currently available,
even if down</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s display a short list (like
netstat -i)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v be more verbose for some
error conditions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface <br>
The name of the interface. This is usually a driver name
followed by a unit number, for example eth0 for the first
Ethernet interface. If your kernel supports alias <br>
interfaces, you can specify them with eth0:0 for the first
alias of eth0. You can use them to assign a second address.
To delete an alias interface use ifconfig eth0:0 <br>
down. Note: for every scope (i.e. same net with
address/netmask combination) all aliases are deleted, if you
delete the first (primary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">up This flag causes the
interface to be activated. It is implicitly specified if an
address is assigned to the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down This flag causes the driver
for this interface to be shut down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]arp Enable or disable the use
of the ARP protocol on this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]promisc <br>
Enable or disable the promiscuous mode of the interface. If
selected, all packets on the network will be received by the
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]allmulti <br>
Enable or disable all-multicast mode. If selected, all
multicast packets on the network will be received by the
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtu N This parameter sets the
Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of an interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dstaddr addr <br>
Set the remote IP address for a point-to-point link (such as
PPP). This keyword is now obsolete; use the pointopoint
keyword instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netmask addr <br>
Set the IP network mask for this interface. This value
defaults to the usual class A, B or C network mask (as
derived from the interface IP address), but it can be set to
<br>
any value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add addr/prefixlen <br>
Add an IPv6 address to an interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del addr/prefixlen <br>
Remove an IPv6 address from an interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tunnel ::aa.bb.cc.dd <br>
Create a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) device, tunnelling to the
given destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">irq addr <br>
Set the interrupt line used by this device. Not all devices
can dynamically change their IRQ setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">io_addr addr <br>
Set the start address in I/O space for this device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mem_start addr <br>
Set the start address for shared memory used by this device.
Only a few devices need this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">media type <br>
Set the physical port or medium type to be used by the
device. Not all devices can change this setting, and those
that can vary in what values they support. Typical
val&acirc; <br>
ues for type are 10base2 (thin Ethernet), 10baseT
(twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet), AUI (external transceiver)
and so on. The special medium type of auto can be used to
<br>
tell the driver to auto-sense the media. Again, not all
drivers can do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]broadcast [addr] <br>
If the address argument is given, set the protocol broadcast
address for this interface. Otherwise, set (or clear) the
IFF_BROADCAST flag for the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]pointopoint [addr] <br>
This keyword enables the point-to-point mode of an
interface, meaning that it is a direct link between two
machines with nobody else listening on it. <br>
If the address argument is also given, set the protocol
address of the other side of the link, just like the
obsolete dstaddr keyword does. Otherwise, set or clear the
<br>
IFF_POINTOPOINT flag for the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hw class address <br>
Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device
driver supports this operation. The keyword must be followed
by the name of the hardware class and the printable <br>
ASCII equivalent of the hardware address. Hardware classes
currently supported include ether (Ethernet), ax25 (AMPR
AX.25), ARCnet and netrom (AMPR NET/ROM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multicast <br>
Set the multicast flag on the interface. This should not
normally be needed as the drivers set the flag correctly
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address <br>
The IP address to be assigned to this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">txqueuelen length <br>
Set the length of the transmit queue of the device. It is
useful to set this to small values for slower devices with a
high latency (modem links, ISDN) to prevent fast <br>
bulk transfers from disturbing interactive traffic like
telnet too much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Since kernel release 2.2 there are no explicit interface
statistics for alias interfaces anymore. The statistics
printed for the original address are shared with all alias
<br>
addresses on the same device. If you want per-address
statistics you should add explicit accounting rules for the
address using the iptables(8) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since net-tools 1.60-4 ifconfig
is printing byte counters and human readable counters with
IEC 60027-2 units. So 1 KiB are 2^10 byte. Note, the numbers
are truncated to one deci&acirc; <br>
mal (which can by quite a large error if you consider 0.1
PiB is 112.589.990.684.262 bytes :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interrupt problems with Ethernet
device drivers fail with EAGAIN (SIOCSIIFLAGS: Resource
temporarily unavailable) it is most likely a interrupt
conflict. See <br>
http://www.scyld.com/expert/irq-conflict.html for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc/net/dev <br>
/proc/net/if_inet6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Ifconfig uses the ioctl access method to get the full
address information, which limits hardware addresses to 8
bytes. Because Infiniband hardware address has 20 bytes,
only the <br>
first 8 bytes are displayed correctly. Please use ip link
command from iproute2 package to display link layer
informations including the hardware address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While appletalk DDP and IPX
addresses will be displayed they cannot be altered by this
command.</p>
