<p>DNSSEC-SIGNZONE(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-SIGNZONE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-signzone - DNSSEC zone signing tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-signzone [-a] [-c class] [-d directory] [-D] [-E
engine] [-e end-time] [-f output-file] [-g] [-h] [-K
directory] [-k key] [-L serial] [-l domain] [-i interval]
<br>
[-I input-format] [-j jitter] [-N soa-serial-format] [-o
origin] [-O output-format] [-P] [-p] [-R] [-r randomdev]
[-S] [-s start-time] [-T ttl] [-t] [-u] <br>
[-v level] [-X extended end-time] [-x] [-z] [-3 salt] [-H
iterations] [-A] {zonefile} [key...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnssec-signzone signs a zone. It generates NSEC and RRSIG
records and produces a signed version of the zone. The
security status of delegations from the signed zone (that
is, <br>
whether the child zones are secure or not) is determined by
the presence or absence of a keyset file for each child
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a <br>
Verify all generated signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c class <br>
Specifies the DNS class of the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
Compatibility mode: Generate a keyset-zonename file in
addition to dsset-zonename when signing a zone, for use by
older versions of dnssec-signzone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory <br>
Look for dsset- or keyset- files in directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Output only those record types automatically managed by
dnssec-signzone, i.e. RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM
records. If smart signing (-S) is used, DNSKEY records are
<br>
also included. The resulting file can be included in the
original zone file with $INCLUDE. This option cannot be
combined with -O raw or serial number updating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E engine <br>
Uses a crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine) for the crypto
operations it supports, for instance signing with private
keys from a secure key store. When compiled with PKCS#11
<br>
support it defaults to pkcs11; the empty name resets it to
no engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
Generate DS records for child zones from dsset- or keyset-
file. Existing DS records will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K directory <br>
Key repository: Specify a directory to search for DNSSEC
keys. If not specified, defaults to the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k key <br>
Treat specified key as a key signing key ignoring any key
flags. This option may be specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l domain <br>
Generate a DLV set in addition to the key (DNSKEY) and DS
sets. The domain is appended to the name of the records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s start-time <br>
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records
become valid. This can be either an absolute or relative
time. An absolute start time is indicated by a number in
<br>
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation; 20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC
on May 30th, 2000. A relative start time is indicated by +N,
which is N seconds from the current time. If no <br>
start-time is specified, the current time minus 1 hour (to
allow for clock skew) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e end-time <br>
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records
expire. As with start-time, an absolute time is indicated in
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time relative to the start <br>
time is indicated with +N, which is N seconds from the start
time. A time relative to the current time is indicated with
now+N. If no end-time is specified, 30 days from the <br>
start time is used as a default. end-time must be later than
start-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X extended end-time <br>
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records
for the DNSKEY RRset will expire. This is to be used in
cases when the DNSKEY signatures need to persist longer <br>
than signatures on other records; e.g., when the private
component of the KSK is kept offline and the KSK signature
is to be refreshed manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with start-time, an absolute
time is indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time
relative to the start time is indicated with +N, which is N
seconds from the start time. <br>
A time relative to the current time is indicated with now+N.
If no extended end-time is specified, the value of end-time
is used as the default. (end-time, in turn, defaults <br>
to 30 days from the start time.) extended end-time must be
later than start-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f output-file <br>
The name of the output file containing the signed zone. The
default is to append .signed to the input filename. If
output-file is set to &quot;-&quot;, then the signed zone is
written <br>
to the standard output, with a default output format of
&quot;full&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
dnssec-signzone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
When a previously-signed zone is passed as input, records
may be resigned. The interval option specifies the cycle
interval as an offset from the current time (in seconds).
<br>
If a RRSIG record expires after the cycle interval, it is
retained. Otherwise, it is considered to be expiring soon,
and it will be replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default cycle interval is
one quarter of the difference between the signature end and
start times. So if neither end-time or start-time are
specified, dnssec-signzone <br>
generates signatures that are valid for 30 days, with a
cycle interval of 7.5 days. Therefore, if any existing RRSIG
records are due to expire in less than 7.5 days, they <br>
would be replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I input-format <br>
The format of the input zone file. Possible formats are
&quot;text&quot; (default) and &quot;raw&quot;. This option
is primarily intended to be used for dynamic signed zones so
that the dumped <br>
zone file in a non-text format containing updates can be
signed directly. The use of this option does not make much
sense for non-dynamic zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j jitter <br>
When signing a zone with a fixed signature lifetime, all
RRSIG records issued at the time of signing expires
simultaneously. If the zone is incrementally signed, i.e. a
<br>
previously-signed zone is passed as input to the signer, all
expired signatures have to be regenerated at about the same
time. The jitter option specifies a jitter window <br>
that will be used to randomize the signature expire time,
thus spreading incremental signature regeneration over
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signature lifetime jitter also
to some extent benefits validators and servers by spreading
out cache expiration, i.e. if large numbers of RRSIGs
don&rsquo;t expire at the same time <br>
from all caches there will be less congestion than if all
validators need to refetch at mostly the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L serial <br>
When writing a signed zone to &rsquo;raw&rsquo; format, set
the &quot;source serial&quot; value in the header to the
specified serial number. (This is expected to be used
primarily for testing <br>
purposes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n ncpus <br>
Specifies the number of threads to use. By default, one
thread is started for each detected CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N soa-serial-format <br>
The SOA serial number format of the signed zone. Possible
formats are &quot;keep&quot; (default),
&quot;increment&quot; and &quot;unixtime&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;keep&quot; <br>
Do not modify the SOA serial number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;increment&quot; <br>
Increment the SOA serial number using RFC 1982
arithmetics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unixtime&quot; <br>
Set the SOA serial number to the number of seconds since
epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o origin <br>
The zone origin. If not specified, the name of the zone file
is assumed to be the origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O output-format <br>
The format of the output file containing the signed zone.
Possible formats are &quot;text&quot; (default)
&quot;full&quot;, which is text output in a format suitable
for processing by external <br>
scripts, and &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;raw=N&quot;, which
store the zone in a binary format for rapid loading by
named. &quot;raw=N&quot; specifies the format version of the
raw zone file: if N is 0, the <br>
raw file can be read by any version of named; if N is 1, the
file can be read by release 9.9.0 or higher. The default is
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
Use pseudo-random data when signing the zone. This is
faster, but less secure, than using real random data. This
option may be useful when signing large zones or when the
<br>
entropy source is limited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
Disable post sign verification tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The post sign verification test
ensures that for each algorithm in use there is at least one
non revoked self signed KSK key, that all revoked KSK keys
are self signed, and <br>
that all records in the zone are signed by the algorithm.
This option skips these tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R <br>
Remove signatures from keys that no longer exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, when a
previously-signed zone is passed as input to the signer, and
a DNSKEY record has been removed and replaced with a new
one, signatures from the old key that <br>
are still within their validity period are retained. This
allows the zone to continue to validate with cached copies
of the old DNSKEY RRset. The -R forces dnssec-signzone to
<br>
remove all orphaned signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r randomdev <br>
Specifies the source of randomness. If the operating system
does not provide a /dev/random or equivalent device, the
default source of randomness is keyboard input. <br>
randomdev specifies the name of a character device or file
containing random data to be used instead of the default.
The special value keyboard indicates that keyboard input
<br>
should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
Smart signing: Instructs dnssec-signzone to search the key
repository for keys that match the zone being signed, and to
include them in the zone if appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a key is found, its timing
metadata is examined to determine how it should be used,
according to the following rules. Each successive rule takes
priority over the prior <br>
ones:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no timing metadata has been
set for the key, the key is published in the zone and used
to sign the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the key&rsquo;s publication
date is set and is in the past, the key is published in the
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the key&rsquo;s activation
date is set and in the past, the key is published
(regardless of publication date) and used to sign the
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the key&rsquo;s revocation
date is set and in the past, and the key is published, then
the key is revoked, and the revoked key is used to sign the
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either of the key&rsquo;s
unpublication or deletion dates are set and in the past, the
key is NOT published or used to sign the zone, regardless of
any other metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T ttl <br>
Specifies a TTL to be used for new DNSKEY records imported
into the zone from the key repository. If not specified, the
default is the TTL value from the zone&rsquo;s SOA record.
<br>
This option is ignored when signing without -S, since DNSKEY
records are not imported from the key repository in that
case. It is also ignored if there are any pre-existing <br>
DNSKEY records at the zone apex, in which case new
records&rsquo; TTL values will be set to match them, or if
any of the imported DNSKEY records had a default TTL value.
In the <br>
event of a a conflict between TTL values in imported keys,
the shortest one is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
Print statistics at completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
Update NSEC/NSEC3 chain when re-signing a previously signed
zone. With this option, a zone signed with NSEC can be
switched to NSEC3, or a zone signed with NSEC3 can be <br>
switch to NSEC or to NSEC3 with different parameters.
Without this option, dnssec-signzone will retain the
existing chain when re-signing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v level <br>
Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
Only sign the DNSKEY RRset with key-signing keys, and omit
signatures from zone-signing keys. (This is similar to the
dnssec-dnskey-kskonly yes; zone option in named.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z <br>
Ignore KSK flag on key when determining what to sign. This
causes KSK-flagged keys to sign all records, not just the
DNSKEY RRset. (This is similar to the update-check-ksk <br>
no; zone option in named.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 salt <br>
Generate an NSEC3 chain with the given hex encoded salt. A
dash (salt) can be used to indicate that no salt is to be
used when generating the NSEC3 chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H iterations <br>
When generating an NSEC3 chain, use this many interations.
The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
When generating an NSEC3 chain set the OPTOUT flag on all
NSEC3 records and do not generate NSEC3 records for insecure
delegations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option twice (i.e.,
-AA) turns the OPTOUT flag off for all records. This is
useful when using the -u option to modify an NSEC3 chain
which previously had OPTOUT <br>
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonefile <br>
The file containing the zone to be signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key <br>
Specify which keys should be used to sign the zone. If no
keys are specified, then the zone will be examined for
DNSKEY records at the zone apex. If these are found and
there <br>
are matching private keys, in the current directory, then
these will be used for signing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following command signs the example.com zone with the
DSA key generated by dnssec-keygen
(Kexample.com.+003+17247). Because the -S option is not
being used, the zone&rsquo;s keys <br>
must be in the master file (db.example.com). This invocation
looks for dsset files, in the current directory, so that DS
records can be imported from them (-g).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dnssec-signzone -g -o
example.com db.example.com Kexample.com.+003+17247 <br>
db.example.com.signed <br>
%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example,
dnssec-signzone creates the file db.example.com.signed. This
file should be referenced in a zone statement in a
named.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example re-signs a
previously signed zone with default parameters. The private
keys are assumed to be in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% cp db.example.com.signed
db.example.com <br>
% dnssec-signzone -o example.com db.example.com <br>
db.example.com.signed <br>
%</p>
