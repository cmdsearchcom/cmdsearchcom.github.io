<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
slapd - Stand-alone LDAP Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
slapd [-4|-6] [-T {acl|a[dd]|auth|c[at]|
d[n]|i[ndex]|p[asswd]|s[chema]|t[est]}] [-d debug-level] [-f
slapd-config-file] [-F slapd-config-directory] [-h URLs] [-n
service-name] <br>
[-s syslog-level] [-l syslog-local-user] [-o option[=value]]
[-r directory] [-u user] [-g group] [-c cookie]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Slapd is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for LDAP
connections on any number of ports (default 389), responding
to the LDAP operations it receives over these connections.
<br>
slapd is typically invoked at boot time, usually out of
/etc/rc.local. Upon startup, slapd normally forks and
disassociates itself from the invoking tty. If configured in
the <br>
config file (or config directory), the slapd process will
print its process ID (see getpid(2)) to a .pid file, as well
as the command line options during invocation to an .args
<br>
file (see slapd.conf(5)). If the -d flag is given, even with
a zero argument, slapd will not fork and disassociate from
the invoking tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the &quot;OpenLDAP
Administrator&rsquo;s Guide&quot; for more details on
slapd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-4 Listen on IPv4 addresses only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Listen on IPv6 addresses
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T tool <br>
Run in Tool mode. The tool argument selects whether to run
as slapadd, slapcat, slapdn, slapindex, slappasswd,
slapschema, or slaptest (slapacl and slapauth need the <br>
entire acl and auth option value to be spelled out, as a is
reserved to slapadd). This option should be the first option
specified when it is used; any remaining options <br>
will be interpreted by the corresponding slap tool program,
according to the respective man pages. Note that these tool
programs will usually be symbolic links to slapd. <br>
This option is provided for situations where symbolic links
are not provided or not usable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d debug-level <br>
Turn on debugging as defined by debug-level. If this option
is specified, even with a zero argument, slapd will not fork
or disassociate from the invoking terminal. Some <br>
general operation and status messages are printed for any
value of debug-level. debug-level is taken as a bit string,
with each bit corresponding to a different kind of <br>
debugging information. See &lt;ldap_log.h&gt; for details.
Comma-separated arrays of friendly names can be specified to
select debugging output of the corresponding debugging <br>
information. All the names recognized by the loglevel
directive described in slapd.conf(5) are supported. If
debug-level is ?, a list of installed debug-levels is <br>
printed, and slapd exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that if you turn on
packet logging, packets containing bind passwords will be
output, so if you redirect the log to a logfile, that file
should be read-protected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s syslog-level <br>
This option tells slapd at what debug-level debugging
statements should be logged to the syslog(8) facility. The
value syslog-level can be set to any value or combination
<br>
allowed by the -d switch. Slapd logs all messages selected
by syslog-leveli at the syslog(3) severity debug-level
DEBUG, on the unit specified with -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n service-name <br>
Specifies the service name for logging and other purposes.
Defaults to basename of argv[0], i.e.:
&quot;slapd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l syslog-local-user <br>
Selects the local user of the syslog(8) facility. Value can
be LOCAL0, through LOCAL7, as well as USER and DAEMON. The
default is LOCAL4. However, this option is only <br>
permitted on systems that support local users with the
syslog(8) facility. Logging to syslog(8) occurs at the
&quot;DEBUG&quot; severity debug-level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f slapd-config-file <br>
Specifies the slapd configuration file. The default is
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F slapd-config-directory <br>
Specifies the slapd configuration directory. The default is
/etc/openldap/slapd.d. If both -f and -F are specified, the
config file will be read and converted to config <br>
directory format and written to the specified directory. If
neither option is specified, slapd will attempt to read the
default config directory before trying to use the <br>
default config file. If a valid config directory exists then
the default config file is ignored. All of the slap tools
that use the config options observe this same behav&acirc;
<br>
ior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h URLlist <br>
slapd will by default serve ldap:/// (LDAP over TCP on all
interfaces on default LDAP port). That is, it will bind
using INADDR_ANY and port 389. The -h option may be <br>
used to specify LDAP (and other scheme) URLs to serve. For
example, if slapd is given -h &quot;ldap://127.0.0.1:9009/
ldaps:/// ldapi:///&quot;, it will listen on 127.0.0.1:9009
<br>
for LDAP, 0.0.0.0:636 for LDAP over TLS, and LDAP over IPC
(Unix domain sockets). Host 0.0.0.0 represents INADDR_ANY
(any interface). A space separated list of URLs is <br>
expected. The URLs should be of the LDAP, LDAPS, or LDAPI
schemes, and generally without a DN or other optional
parameters (excepting as discussed below). Support for <br>
the latter two schemes depends on selected configuration
options. Hosts may be specified by name or IPv4 and IPv6
address formats. Ports, if specified, must be numeric. <br>
The default ldap:// port is 389 and the default ldaps://
port is 636.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For LDAP over IPC, name is the
name of the socket, and no port is required, nor allowed;
note that directory separators must be URL-encoded, like any
other characters that <br>
are special to URLs; so the socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/var/ldapi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">must be specified as</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ldapi://%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fvar%2Fldapi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default location for the IPC
socket is /var/run/ldapi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listener permissions are
indicated by &quot;x-mod=-rwxrwxrwx&quot;,
&quot;x-mod=0777&quot; or &quot;x-mod=777&quot;, where any
of the &quot;rwx&quot; can be &quot;-&quot; to suppress the
related permission, while any <br>
of the &quot;7&quot; can be any legal octal digit, according
to chmod(1). The listeners can take advantage of the
&quot;x-mod&quot; extension to apply rough limitations to
operations, e.g. <br>
allow read operations (&quot;r&quot;, which applies to
search and compare), write operations (&quot;w&quot;, which
applies to add, delete, modify and modrdn), and execute
operations (&quot;x&quot;, <br>
which means bind is required). &quot;User&quot; permissions
apply to authenticated users, while &quot;other&quot; apply
to anonymous users; &quot;group&quot; permissions are
ignored. For example, <br>
&quot;ldap:///????x-mod=-rw-------&quot; means that read and
write is only allowed for authenticated connections, and
bind is required for all operations. This feature is
experi&acirc; <br>
mental, and requires to be manually enabled at configure
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r directory <br>
Specifies a directory to become the root directory. slapd
will change the current working directory to this directory
and then chroot(2) to this directory. This is done <br>
after opening listeners but before reading any configuration
file or initializing any backend. When used as a security
mechanism, it should be used in conjunction with -u <br>
and -g options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
slapd will run slapd with the specified user name or id, and
that user&rsquo;s supplementary group access list as set
with initgroups(3). The group ID is also changed to this
<br>
user&rsquo;s gid, unless the -g option is used to override.
Note when used with -r, slapd will use the user database in
the change root environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on some systems,
running as a non-privileged user will prevent passwd
back-ends from accessing the encrypted passwords. Note also
that any shell back-ends will <br>
run as the specified non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g group <br>
slapd will run with the specified group name or id. Note
when used with -r, slapd will use the group database in the
change root environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cookie <br>
This option provides a cookie for the syncrepl replication
consumer. The cookie is a comma separated list of name=value
pairs. Currently supported syncrepl cookie fields <br>
are rid, sid, and csn. rid identifies a replication thread
within the consumer server and is used to find the syncrepl
specification in slapd.conf(5) or slapd-config(5) <br>
having the matching replication identifier in its
definition. The rid must be provided in order for any other
specified values to be used. sid is the server id in a <br>
multi-master/mirror-mode configuration. csn is the commit
sequence number received by a previous synchronization and
represents the state of the consumer replica content <br>
which the syncrepl engine will synchronize to the current
provider content. In case of mirror-mode or multi-master
replication agreement, multiple csn values, semicolon <br>
separated, can appear. Use only the rid part to force a full
reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o option[=value] <br>
This option provides a generic means to specify options
without the need to reserve a separate letter for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It supports the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slp={on|off|slp-attrs} <br>
When SLP support is compiled into slapd, disable it (off),
<br>
enable it by registering at SLP DAs without specific SLP
attributes (on), or with specific SLP attributes slp-attrs
that must be an SLP attribute list definition <br>
according to the SLP standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,
&quot;slp=(tree=production),(server-type=OpenLDAP),(server-version=2.4.15)&quot;
registers at SLP DAs with the three SLP attributes tree,
server-type and server- <br>
version that have the values given above. This allows to
specifically query the SLP DAs for LDAP servers holding the
production tree in case multiple trees are <br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To start slapd and have it fork and detach from the terminal
and start serving the LDAP databases defined in the default
config file, just type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slapd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start slapd with an alternate
configuration file, and turn on voluminous debugging which
will be printed on standard error, type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slapd -f /var/tmp/slapd.conf -d
255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To test whether the
configuration file is correct or not, type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slapd -Tt</p>
