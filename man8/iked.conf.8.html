begin with a keyword optionally followed by a parameter list
and are terminated with the &acirc;;&acirc; <br>
character. Lines that begin with the &acirc;#&acirc;
character are treated as comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document denotes keywords
using this font and user supplied parameters using this
font. Optional parameters are enclosed using the
&acirc;[&acirc; and &acirc;]&acirc; characters. Multiple
keywords <br>
that may be valid for a single parameter are enclosed using
the &acirc;(&acirc; and &acirc;)&acirc; characters and
separated using the &acirc;|&acirc; character.</p>

will attempt to negotiate and use IKE Fragmentation when
appropriate. If force is used, the daemon will use IKE
Fragmentation even if the peer does not negotiate <br>
support for this feature. The default value for this
parameter is disable. <br>
frag_ike_size number; <br>
Specifies the maximum number of bytes for an IKE Fragment.

address used during phase1 negotiations is used. <br>
fqdn quoted; <br>
A Fully Qualified Domain Name string. <br>
ufqdn quoted; <br>
A User Fully Qualified Domain Name string. <br>
asn1dn [quoted]; <br>
An ASN.1 Distinguished Name string. If the quoted value is
omitted, the daemon will aquire the DN from the subject
field contained within the certificate. <br>
authdata type ...; <br>
Specifies the authentication data to use during phase1
negotiations. The valid authentication data types are as
follows ... <br>
psk quoted; <br>
A Pre Shared Secret. <br>
ca quoted [quoted]; <br>
A path to a OpenSSL PEM or PSK12 file that contains the
Remote Certificate Autority. In the case where a PSK12 file
is encrypted, the second quoted parame&acirc; <br>
ter specifies the file password. <br>
cert quoted [quoted]; <br>
A path to a OpenSSL PEM or PSK12 file that contains the
Local Public Certificate. In the case where a PSK12 file is
encrypted, the second quoted parameter <br>
specifies the file password. <br>
pkey quoted [quoted]; <br>
A path to a OpenSSL PEM or PSK12 file that contains the
Local Private Key. In the case where a PSK12 file is
encrypted, the second quoted parameter speci&acirc; <br>
fies the password. <br>
life_check level; <br>
Specifies the behavior when validating peer lifetime
proposal values. The default level is claim. The valid
levels are as follows ... <br>
obey A responder will always use the initiators value. <br>
strict A responder will use the initiators value if it is
shorter than the responders. A responder will reject the
proposal if the initiators value is greater <br>
than the responders. <br>
claim A responder will use the initiators value if it is
shorter than the responders. A responder will use its own
value if it is shorter than the initiators. In <br>
the second case, the responder will send a
RESPONDER-LIFETIME notification to the initiator when
responding to phase2 proposals. <br>
exact; A responder will reject the proposal if the
initiators value is not equal to the responders. <br>
xauth_source (local | ldap) [quoted]; <br>
Sepcifies the Extended Authentication source to be used for
user authentication post phase1 negotitations. The optional
quoted value specifies a group name that can <br>
be used to restrict access to only users that are valid
members of the group. If local is used, the peer supplied
credentials will be compared to the local account <br>
database. If ldap is used, the peer supplied credentials
will be compared to an LDAP account database. The LDAP
source configuration is defined in the xauth_ldap <br>
section. The default value for this parameter is local. <br>
xconf_source local [(push | pull)]; <br>
Sepcifies the Configuration Exchange source to be used when
responding to peer configuration requests. If local is used,
the daemon will supply configuration infor&acirc; <br>
mation defined in the xconf_local section. The default value
for this parameter is local. <br>
plcy_mode (disable | config | compat); <br>
Specifies the policy generation mode. When disable is used,
no policy generation is performed. When config mode is used,
policy generation is performed during Con&acirc; <br>
figuration Exchange. This allows the daemon to generate
polices using the peers private tunnel address. When compat
mode is used, policy generation is performed <br>
post phase1 negotiations. This allows the daemon to
interoperate with peers that do not support Configuration
Exchanges. <br>
plcy_list { statements } <br>
Specifies a list of network groups and parameters that can
be used to perform policy generation. If no plcy_list is
defined but plcy_mode is set to config or <br>
compat, the daemon operates as if a single include statement
was used that specified a netmap defining all networks. <br>
(include | exclude) label [quoted]; <br>
Specifies a netgroup by label for use with policy
generation. When include is used, the daemon will generate
appropriate IPsec policies and pass all <br>
netgroup defined networks during the Configuration Exchange
if requested. A peer would use this configuration
information to selectively tunnel all traffic <br>
destined for any one of these networks. If exclude is used,
the daemon will generate appropriate discard policies and
pass all netgroup defined networks <br>
during the Configuration Exchange if requested. A peer would
use this configuration information to selectively bypass
IPsec processing for all traffic des&acirc; <br>
tined to any one of these networks. The optional quoted
string specifies a group name that can be used to restrict
processing of this netgroup to only users <br>
that are valid members of the group. If XAuth is not
performed, statements that define a group name are skipped.
<br>
proposal type { statements } <br>
Specifies a proposal to be used during SA negotiations with
a peer. The valid proposal types are as follows ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isakmp An ISAKMP proposal

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This section contains a few iked configuration examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first example shows a
configuration that only defines the parameters required to
support client connectivity mode with NATT and debug options
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daemon <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third example shows a
configuration that supports client gateway negotiations
using mutual preshared key authentication with xauth, nat
traversal, dead peer detection, ike <br>
fragmentation and policy generation. The daemon would allow
xauth users that are members of the &quot;remote&quot; group
to connect to the gateway. Policies would be generated to
allow a <br>
peer access to the 10.1.1.0/24 and 1.3.3.0/24 networks with
the exception of 1.1.1.15/32 which be accessed directly (
not via IPsec ). Peers that use an xauth user account that
is <br>
