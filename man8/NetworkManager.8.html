<p>NETWORKMANAGER(8) Network management daemons
NETWORKMANAGER(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
NetworkManager - network management daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
NetworkManager [OPTIONS...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking
configuration and operation as painless and automatic as
possible by managing the primary network connection and
other <br>
network interfaces, like Ethernet, WiFi, and Mobile
Broadband devices. NetworkManager will connect any network
device when a connection for that device becomes available,
unless <br>
that behavior is disabled. Information about networking is
exported via a D-Bus interface to any interested
application, providing a rich API with which to inspect and
control <br>
network settings and operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPATCHER SCRIPTS <br>
NetworkManager will execute scripts in the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d directory or subdirectories
in alphabetical order in response to network events. Each
script should be <br>
a regular executable file owned by root. Furthermore, it
must not be writable by group or other, and not setuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each script receives two
arguments, the first being the interface name of the device
an operation just happened on, and second the action. For
device actions, the interface is <br>
the name of the kernel interface suitable for IP
configuration. Thus it is either VPN_IP_IFACE,
DEVICE_IP_IFACE, or DEVICE_IFACE, as applicable. For the
hostname and <br>
connectivity-change actions it is always
&quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pre-up <br>
The interface is connected to the network but is not yet
fully activated. Scripts acting on this event must be placed
or symlinked into the <br>
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d directory, and
NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
before indicating to applications that the interface is <br>
fully activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">up <br>
The interface has been activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pre-down <br>
The interface will be deactivated but has not yet been
disconnected from the network. Scripts acting on this event
must be placed or symlinked into the <br>
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d directory, and
NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
before disconnecting the interface from its network. Note
<br>
that this event is not emitted for forced disconnections,
like when carrier is lost or a wireless signal fades. It is
only emitted when there is an opportunity to cleanly <br>
handle a network disconnection event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down <br>
The interface has been deactivated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpn-pre-up <br>
The VPN is connected to the network but is not yet fully
activated. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or
symlinked into the <br>
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d directory, and
NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
before indicating to applications that the VPN is fully <br>
activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpn-up <br>
A VPN connection has been activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpn-pre-down <br>
The VPN will be deactivated but has not yet been
disconnected from the network. Scripts acting on this event
must be placed or symlinked into the <br>
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d directory, and
NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
before disconnecting the VPN from its network. Note that
<br>
this event is not emitted for forced disconnections, like
when the VPN terminates unexpectedly or general connectivity
is lost. It is only emitted when there is an <br>
opportunity to cleanly handle a VPN disconnection event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpn-down <br>
A VPN connection has been deactivated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname <br>
The system hostname has been updated. Use gethostname(2) to
retrieve it. The interface name (first argument) is empty
and no environment variable is set for this action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp4-change <br>
The DHCPv4 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp6-change <br>
The DHCPv6 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connectivity-change <br>
The network connectivity state has changed (no connectivity,
went online, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment contains more
information about the interface and the connection. The
following variables are available for the use in the
dispatcher scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION_UUID <br>
The UUID of the connection profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION_ID <br>
The name (ID) of the connection profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION_DBUS_PATH <br>
The NetworkManager D-Bus path of the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION_FILENAME <br>
The backing file name of the connection profile (if
any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTION_EXTERNAL <br>
If &quot;1&quot;, this indicates that the connection
describes a network configuration created outside of
NetworkManager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE_IFACE <br>
The interface name of the control interface of the device.
Depending on the device type, this differs from
DEVICE_IP_IFACE. For example for ADSL devices, this could be
&rsquo;atm0&rsquo; <br>
or for WWAN devices it might be &rsquo;ttyUSB0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE_IP_IFACE <br>
The IP interface name of the device. This is the network
interface on which IP addresses and routes will be
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP4_ADDRESS_N <br>
The IPv4 address in the format &quot;address/prefix
gateway&quot;, where N is a number from 0 to (# IPv4
addresses - 1). gateway item in this variable is deprecated,
use IP4_GATEWAY <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES <br>
The variable contains the number of IPv4 addresses the
script may expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP4_GATEWAY <br>
The gateway IPv4 address in traditional numbers-and-dots
notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP4_ROUTE_N <br>
The IPv4 route in the format &quot;address/prefix next-hop
metric&quot;, where N is a number from 0 to (# IPv4 routes -
1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP4_NUM_ROUTES <br>
The variable contains the number of IPv4 routes the script
may expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP4_NAMESERVERS <br>
The variable contains a space-separated list of the DNS
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP4_DOMAINS <br>
The variable contains a space-separated list of the search
domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DHCP4_&lt;dhcp-option-name&gt;
<br>
If the connection used DHCP for address configuration, the
received DHCP configuration is passed in the environment
using standard DHCP option names, prefixed with
&quot;DHCP4_&quot;, <br>
like &quot;DHCP4_HOST_NAME=foobar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP6_&lt;name&gt; and
DHCP6_&lt;name&gt; <br>
The same variables as for IPv4 are available for IPv6, but
the prefixes are IP6_ and DHCP6_ instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTIVITY_STATE <br>
The network connectivity state, which can take the values
defined by the NMConnectivityState type, from the
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager D-Bus API: unknown, none,
portal, <br>
limited or full. Note: this variable will only be set for
connectivity-change actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of VPN, VPN_IP_IFACE is
set, and IP4_*, IP6_* variables with VPN prefix are exported
too, like VPN_IP4_ADDRESS_0, VPN_IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dispatcher scripts are run one
at a time, but asynchronously from the main NetworkManager
process, and will be killed if they run for too long. If
your script might take <br>
arbitrarily long to complete, you should spawn a child
process and have the parent return immediately. Scripts that
are symbolic links pointing inside the <br>
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/no-wait.d/ directory are
run immediately, without waiting for the termination of
previous scripts, and in parallel. Also beware that once a
<br>
script is queued, it will always be run, even if a later
event renders it obsolete. (Eg, if an interface goes up, and
then back down again quickly, it is possible that one or
<br>
more &quot;up&quot; scripts will be run after the interface
has gone down.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version | -V <br>
Print the NetworkManager software version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help | -h <br>
Print NetworkManager&rsquo;s available options and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-daemon | -n <br>
Do not daemonize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug | -d <br>
Do not daemonize, and direct log output to the controlling
terminal in addition to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid-file | -p <br>
Specify location of a PID file. The PID file is used for
storing PID of the running process and prevents running
multiple instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--state-file <br>
Specify file for storing state of the NetworkManager
persistently. If not specified, the default value of
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config <br>
Specify configuration file to set up various settings for
NetworkManager. If not specified, the default value of
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is used with a <br>
fallback to the older &rsquo;nm-system-settings.conf&rsquo;
if located in the same directory. See NetworkManager.conf(5)
for more information on configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--plugins <br>
List plugins used to manage system-wide connection settings.
This list has preference over plugins specified in the
configuration file. Currently supported plugins are: <br>
keyfile, ifcfg-rh, ifcfg-suse, ifupdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-level <br>
Sets how much information NetworkManager sends to the log
destination (usually syslog&rsquo;s &quot;daemon&quot;
facility). By default, only informational, warning, and
error messages are <br>
logged. See the section on logging in NetworkManager.conf(5)
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-domains <br>
A comma-separated list specifying which operations are
logged to the log destination (usually syslog). By default,
most domains are logging-enabled. See the section on <br>
logging in NetworkManager.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-config <br>
Print the NetworkManager configuration to stdout and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDEV PROPERTIES <br>
udev(7) device manager is used for the network device
discovery. The following property influences how
NetworkManager manages the devices:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM_UNMANAGED <br>
No default connection will be created and automatic
activation will not be attempted when this property of a
device is set to a true value (&quot;1&quot; or
&quot;true&quot;). You will still be <br>
able to attach a connection to the device manually or
observe externally added configuration such as addresses or
routes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create an udev rule that sets
this property to prevent NetworkManager from interfering
with virtual Ethernet device interfaces that are managed by
virtualization tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
NetworkManager process handles the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
The signal causes a reload of NetworkManager&rsquo;s
configuration. Note that not all configuration parameters
can be changed at runtime and therefore some changes may be
applied <br>
only after the next restart of the daemon. A SIGHUP also
involves further reloading actions, like doing a DNS update
and restarting the DNS plugin. The latter can be useful <br>
for example when using the dnsmasq plugin and changing its
configuration in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d. However, it
also means this will shortly interrupt name resolution. <br>
In the future, there may be further actions added. A SIGHUP
means to update NetworkManager configuration and reload
everything that is supported. Note that this does not <br>
reload connections from disk. For that there is a D-Bus API
and nmcli&rsquo;s reload action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
The signal forces a rewrite of DNS configuration. Contrary
to SIGHUP, this does not restart the DNS plugin and will not
interrupt name resolution. In the future, further <br>
actions may be added. A SIGUSR1 means to write out data like
resolv.conf, or refresh a cache. It is a subset of what is
done for SIGHUP without reloading configuration from <br>
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
The signal has no effect at the moment but is reserved for
future use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative to a signal to
reload configuration is the Reload D-Bus call. It allows for
more fine-grained selection of what to reload, it only
returns after the reload is <br>
complete, and it is guarded by PolicyKit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING <br>
The following environment variables are supported to help
debugging. When used in conjunction with the --no-daemon
option (thus echoing PPP and DHCP helper output to stdout)
<br>
these can quickly help pinpoint the source of connection
issues. Also see the --log-level and --log-domains to enable
debug logging inside NetworkManager itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM_PPP_DEBUG: When set to
anything, causes NetworkManager to turn on PPP debugging in
pppd, which logs all PPP and PPTP frames and client/server
exchanges.</p>
