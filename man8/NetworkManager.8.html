NetworkManager - network management daemon
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 28.00ex; text-indent: -28.00ex;"><b>NetworkManager
  </b> <b>[OPTIONS...]</b></div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking configuration and
  operation as painless and automatic as possible by managing the primary
  network connection and other network interfaces, like Ethernet, WiFi, and
  Mobile Broadband devices. NetworkManager will connect any network device when
  a connection for that device becomes available, unless that behavior is
  disabled. Information about networking is exported via a D-Bus interface to
  any interested application, providing a rich API with which to inspect and
  control network settings and operation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DISPATCHER_SCRIPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#DISPATCHER_SCRIPTS">DISPATCHER
  SCRIPTS</a></h1>
NetworkManager will execute scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d
  directory or subdirectories in alphabetical order in response to network
  events. Each script should be a regular executable file owned by root.
  Furthermore, it must not be writable by group or other, and not setuid.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each script receives two arguments, the first being the interface name of the
  device an operation just happened on, and second the action. For device
  actions, the interface is the name of the kernel interface suitable for IP
  configuration. Thus it is either VPN_IP_IFACE, DEVICE_IP_IFACE, or
  DEVICE_IFACE, as applicable. For the <i>hostname</i> and
  <i>connectivity-change</i> actions it is always &quot;none&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The actions are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>pre-up</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The interface is connected to the network but
  is not yet fully activated. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or
  symlinked into the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d directory, and
  NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before indicating to
  applications that the interface is fully activated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>up</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The interface has been activated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>pre-down</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The interface will be deactivated but has not
  yet been disconnected from the network. Scripts acting on this event must be
  placed or symlinked into the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d
  directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
  before disconnecting the interface from its network. Note that this event is
  not emitted for forced disconnections, like when carrier is lost or a wireless
  signal fades. It is only emitted when there is an opportunity to cleanly
  handle a network disconnection event.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>down</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The interface has been deactivated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>vpn-pre-up</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The VPN is connected to the network but is not
  yet fully activated. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked
  into the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d directory, and
  NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before indicating to
  applications that the VPN is fully activated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>vpn-up</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A VPN connection has been activated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>vpn-pre-down</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The VPN will be deactivated but has not yet
  been disconnected from the network. Scripts acting on this event must be
  placed or symlinked into the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d
  directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
  before disconnecting the VPN from its network. Note that this event is not
  emitted for forced disconnections, like when the VPN terminates unexpectedly
  or general connectivity is lost. It is only emitted when there is an
  opportunity to cleanly handle a VPN disconnection event.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>vpn-down</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A VPN connection has been deactivated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>hostname</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The system hostname has been updated. Use
  gethostname(2) to retrieve it. The interface name (first argument) is empty
  and no environment variable is set for this action.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>dhcp4-change</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The DHCPv4 lease has changed (renewed,
  rebound, etc).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>dhcp6-change</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The DHCPv6 lease has changed (renewed,
  rebound, etc).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>connectivity-change</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The network connectivity state has changed (no
  connectivity, went online, etc).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The environment contains more information about the interface and the
  connection. The following variables are available for the use in the
  dispatcher scripts:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>CONNECTION_UUID</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The UUID of the connection profile.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>CONNECTION_ID</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The name (ID) of the connection profile.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>CONNECTION_DBUS_PATH</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The NetworkManager D-Bus path of the
  connection.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>CONNECTION_FILENAME</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The backing file name of the connection
  profile (if any).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>CONNECTION_EXTERNAL</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If &quot;1&quot;, this indicates that the
  connection describes a network configuration created outside of
  NetworkManager.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DEVICE_IFACE</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The interface name of the control interface of
  the device. Depending on the device type, this differs from
  <i>DEVICE_IP_IFACE</i>. For example for ADSL devices, this could be 'atm0' or
  for WWAN devices it might be 'ttyUSB0'.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DEVICE_IP_IFACE</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The IP interface name of the device. This is
  the network interface on which IP addresses and routes will be
  configured.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>IP4_ADDRESS_N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The IPv4 address in the format
  &quot;address/prefix gateway&quot;, where N is a number from 0 to (# IPv4
  addresses - 1). gateway item in this variable is deprecated, use IP4_GATEWAY
  instead.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The variable contains the number of IPv4
  addresses the script may expect.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The gateway IPv4 address in traditional
  numbers-and-dots notation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>IP4_ROUTE_N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The IPv4 route in the format
  &quot;address/prefix next-hop metric&quot;, where N is a number from 0 to (#
  IPv4 routes - 1).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>IP4_NUM_ROUTES</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The variable contains the number of IPv4
  routes the script may expect.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The variable contains a space-separated list
  of the DNS servers.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>IP4_DOMAINS</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The variable contains a space-separated list
  of the search domains.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DHCP4_&lt;dhcp-option-name&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the connection used DHCP for address
  configuration, the received DHCP configuration is passed in the environment
  using standard DHCP option names, prefixed with &quot;DHCP4_&quot;, like
  &quot;DHCP4_HOST_NAME=foobar&quot;.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>IP6_&lt;name&gt; and DHCP6_&lt;name&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The same variables as for IPv4 are available
  for IPv6, but the prefixes are IP6_ and DHCP6_ instead.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>CONNECTIVITY_STATE</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The network connectivity state, which can take
  the values defined by the NMConnectivityState type, from the
  org.freedesktop.NetworkManager D-Bus API: unknown, none, portal, limited or
  full. Note: this variable will only be set for connectivity-change
  actions.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In case of VPN, VPN_IP_IFACE is set, and IP4_*, IP6_* variables with VPN prefix
  are exported too, like VPN_IP4_ADDRESS_0, VPN_IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dispatcher scripts are run one at a time, but asynchronously from the main
  NetworkManager process, and will be killed if they run for too long. If your
  script might take arbitrarily long to complete, you should spawn a child
  process and have the parent return immediately. Scripts that are symbolic
  links pointing inside the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/no-wait.d/
  directory are run immediately, without waiting for the termination of previous
  scripts, and in parallel. Also beware that once a script is queued, it will
  always be run, even if a later event renders it obsolete. (Eg, if an interface
  goes up, and then back down again quickly, it is possible that one or more
  &quot;up&quot; scripts will be run after the interface has gone down.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are understood:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--version</b> | <b>-V</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print the NetworkManager software version and
  exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--help</b> | <b>-h</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print NetworkManager's available options and
  exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-daemon</b> | <b>-n</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not daemonize.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--debug</b> | <b>-d</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not daemonize, and direct log output to the
  controlling terminal in addition to syslog.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--pid-file</b> | <b>-p</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify location of a PID file. The PID file
  is used for storing PID of the running process and prevents running multiple
  instances.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--state-file</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify file for storing state of the
  NetworkManager persistently. If not specified, the default value of
  /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state is used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--config</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify configuration file to set up various
  settings for NetworkManager. If not specified, the default value of
  /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is used with a fallback to the older
  'nm-system-settings.conf' if located in the same directory. See
  <b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for more information on configuration
  file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--plugins</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">List plugins used to manage system-wide
  connection settings. This list has preference over plugins specified in the
  configuration file. Currently supported plugins are: keyfile, <b>ifcfg-rh</b>,
  <b>ifcfg-suse</b>, <b>ifupdown</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--log-level</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets how much information NetworkManager sends
  to the log destination (usually syslog's &quot;daemon&quot; facility). By
  default, only informational, warning, and error messages are logged. See the
  section on logging in <b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for more
  information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--log-domains</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A comma-separated list specifying which
  operations are logged to the log destination (usually syslog). By default,
  most domains are logging-enabled. See the section on logging in
  <b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--print-config</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print the NetworkManager configuration to
  stdout and exit.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UDEV_PROPERTIES"><a class="selflink" href="#UDEV_PROPERTIES">UDEV
  PROPERTIES</a></h1>
<b>udev</b>(7) device manager is used for the network device discovery. The
  following property influences how NetworkManager manages the devices:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>NM_UNMANAGED</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">No default connection will be created and
  automatic activation will not be attempted when this property of a device is
  set to a true value (&quot;1&quot; or &quot;true&quot;). You will still be
  able to attach a connection to the device manually or observe externally added
  configuration such as addresses or routes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Create an udev rule that sets this property to prevent NetworkManager from
  interfering with virtual Ethernet device interfaces that are managed by
  virtualization tools.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
NetworkManager process handles the following signals:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>SIGHUP</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The signal causes a reload of NetworkManager's
  configuration. Note that not all configuration parameters can be changed at
  runtime and therefore some changes may be applied only after the next restart
  of the daemon. A SIGHUP also involves further reloading actions, like doing a
  DNS update and restarting the DNS plugin. The latter can be useful for example
  when using the dnsmasq plugin and changing its configuration in
  /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d. However, it also means this will shortly
  interrupt name resolution. In the future, there may be further actions added.
  A SIGHUP means to update NetworkManager configuration and reload everything
  that is supported. Note that this does not reload connections from disk. For
  that there is a D-Bus API and nmcli's reload action</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>SIGUSR1</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The signal forces a rewrite of DNS
  configuration. Contrary to SIGHUP, this does not restart the DNS plugin and
  will not interrupt name resolution. In the future, further actions may be
  added. A SIGUSR1 means to write out data like resolv.conf, or refresh a cache.
  It is a subset of what is done for SIGHUP without reloading configuration from
  disk.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>SIGUSR2</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The signal has no effect at the moment but is
  reserved for future use.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An alternative to a signal to reload configuration is the Reload D-Bus call. It
  allows for more fine-grained selection of what to reload, it only returns
  after the reload is complete, and it is guarded by PolicyKit.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEBUGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#DEBUGGING">DEBUGGING</a></h1>
The following environment variables are supported to help debugging. When used
  in conjunction with the <b>--no-daemon</b> option (thus echoing PPP and DHCP
  helper output to stdout) these can quickly help pinpoint the source of
  connection issues. Also see the <b>--log-level</b> and <b>--log-domains</b> to
  enable debug logging inside NetworkManager itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NM_PPP_DEBUG</b>: When set to anything, causes NetworkManager to turn on PPP
  debugging in pppd, which logs all PPP and PPTP frames and client/server
  exchanges.
