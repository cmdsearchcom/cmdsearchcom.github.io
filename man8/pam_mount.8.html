pam_mount - A PAM module that can mount volumes for a user session
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Overview"><a class="selflink" href="#Overview">Overview</a></h1>
This module is aimed at environments with central file servers that a user
  wishes to mount on login and unmount on logout, such as (semi-)diskless
  stations where many users can logon and where statically mounting the entire
  /home from a server is a security risk, or listing all possible volumes in
  /etc/fstab is not feasible.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Users can define their own list of volumes without having
      to change (possibly non-writable) global config files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Single sign-on feature - the user needs to type the
      password just once (at login)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Transparent mount process</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No stored passwords</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Volumes are unmounted on logout, freeing system resources
      and not leaving data exposed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The module also supports mounting local filesystems of any kind the normal mount
  utility supports, with extra code to make sure certain volumes are set up
  properly because often they need more than just a mount call, such as
  encrypted volumes. This includes SMB/CIFS, FUSE, dm-crypt and LUKS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you intend to use pam_mount to protect volumes on your computer using an
  encrypted filesystem system, please know that there are many other issues you
  need to consider in order to protect your data. For example, you probably want
  to disable or encrypt your swap partition (the cryptoswap can help you do
  this). Do not assume a system is secure without carefully considering
  potential threats.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Configuration"><a class="selflink" href="#Configuration">Configuration</a></h1>
The primary configuration file for the pam_mount module is pam_mount.conf.xml.
  On most platforms this file is read from /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml. On
  OpenBSD pam_mount reads its configuration file from /etc/pam_mount.conf.xml.
  See pam_mount.conf(5) documenting its use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Individual users may define additional volumes to mount if allowed by
  pam_mount.conf.xml (usually ~/.pam_mount.conf.xml). The volume keyword is the
  only valid keyword in these per-user configuration files. If the luserconf
  parameter is set in pam_mount.conf.xml, allowing user-defined volume, then
  users may mount and unmount any volume they own at any mount point they own.
  On some filesystem configurations this may be a security flaw so user-defined
  volumes are not allowed by the example pam_mount.conf.xml distributed with
  pam_mount.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PAM_configuration"><a class="selflink" href="#PAM_configuration">PAM
  configuration</a></h1>
In addition, you must include two entries in the system's applicable /etc/pam.d/
  <i>service</i> config files, as the following example shows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
    auth     required  pam_securetty.so
    auth     required  pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
    auth     required  pam_nologin.so
+++ auth     optional  pam_mount.so
    account  required  pam_pwdb.so
    password required  pam_cracklib.so
    password required  pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok use_authtok
    session  required  pam_pwdb.so
    session  optional  pam_console.so
+++ session  optional  pam_mount.so
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When &quot;sufficient&quot; is used in the second column, you must make sure
  that pam_mount is added before this entry. Otherwise pam_mount will not get
  executed should a previous PAM module succeed. Also be aware of the
  &quot;include&quot; statements. These make PAM look into the specified file.
  If there is a &quot;sufficient&quot; statement, then the pam_mount entry must
  either be in the included file before the &quot;sufficient&quot; statement or
  before the &quot;include&quot; statement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use pam_ldap, pam_winbind, or any other authentication services that make
  use of PAM's sufficient keyword, model your configuration on the following
  order:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;
account sufficient  pam_ldap.so
auth    required    pam_mount.so
auth    sufficient  pam_ldap.so use_first_pass
auth    required    pam_unix.so use_first_pass
session optional    pam_mount.so
&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allows for:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">pam_mount, as the first &quot;auth&quot; module, will
      prompt for a password and export it to the PAM system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">pam_ldap will use the password from the PAM system to try
      and authenticate the user. If this succedes, the user will be
      authenticated. If it fails, pam_unix will try to authenticate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">pam_unix will try to authenticate the user if pam_ldap
      failed. If pam_unix fails, then the authentication will be refused (due to
      the &quot;required&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, the following is possible (thanks to Andrew Morgan for the
  hint!):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
auth [success=2 default=ignore] pam_unix2.so
auth [success=1 default=ignore] pam_ldap.so use_first_pass
auth requisite pam_deny.so
auth optional pam_mount.so
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It may seem odd, but the first three lines will make it so that at least one of
  pam_unix2 or pam_ldap has to succeed. As you can see, pam_mount will be run
  <b>after</b> successful authentication with these subsystems.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Encrypted_disks"><a class="selflink" href="#Encrypted_disks">Encrypted
  disks</a></h1>
pam_mount supports a few types of crypto. The most common are encfs, dm-crypt
  and dm-crypt+LUKS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first one uses the FUSE layer; files within the encfs container are stored
  as single encrypted files on the host in a previously-existing directory. If
  you store lots of files, it is recommended to have a lower filesystem that is
  strong in this area, such as xfs, but some software and/or your partitioning
  decisions may force you to use a different fs. The 1:1 mapping of files also
  allows encrypted files to be reasonably efficiently rsync'ed for example
  without having to open the encrypted container. Creation is done through the
  encfs(1) tool.
<div class="Pp"></div>
dm-crypt provides whole-filesystem/entire-partition encryption. You can also
  create a container file, but the idea is that it is represented as a block
  device on which you still have to create a filesystem. In fact, this way you
  can select a filesystem of your choice. The downside is that shrinking is
  often not possible (there is no such issue in encfs because it uses the lower
  fs). Suitable dm-crypt containers (and auxiliary files), using block devices
  or plain files, can be created using the pmt-ehd(8) tool.
<div class="Pp"></div>
pmt-ehd creates filesystem key material which is a bunch of random bytes that
  will be used to en-/decrypt the volume. This material itself is encrypted with
  your own password - this is done so that you can change the password without
  having to reencrypt all of your data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
LUKS is an extension for dm-crypt to support multi-password containers. Unless
  you specifically need it, the above two solutions are recommended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
NOTE: The key file that pmt-ehd(8) will create represents the filesystem key
  material as encrypted with your password. It is thus safe to store this on an
  unsecured filesystem.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Troubleshooting"><a class="selflink" href="#Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h1>
To ensure that your system and, possibly, the remote server are all properly
  configured, you should try to mount all or some of the volumes by hand, using
  the same commands and mount points provided in pam_mount.conf.xml. This will
  save you a lot of grief, since it is more difficult to debug the mounting
  process via pam_mount.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you can mount the volumes by hand but it is not happening via pam_mount, you
  may want to enable the &quot;debug&quot; option in pam_mount.conf.xml to see
  what is happening.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Verify if the user owns the mount point and has sufficient permissions over
  that. pam_mount will verify this and will refuse to mount the remote volume if
  the user does not own that directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If pam_mount is having trouble unmounting volumes upon logging out, enable the
  debug variable. This causes pam_mount to run ofl on logout and write its
  output to the system's log.
