<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
pam_mount - A PAM module that can mount volumes for a user
session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview <br>
This module is aimed at environments with central file
servers that a user wishes to mount on login and unmount on
logout, such as (semi-)diskless stations where many users
can <br>
logon and where statically mounting the entire /home from a
server is a security risk, or listing all possible volumes
in /etc/fstab is not feasible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Users can define
their own list of volumes without having to change (possibly
non-writable) global config files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Single sign-on
feature - the user needs to type the password just once (at
login)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Transparent
mount process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; No stored
passwords</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Volumes are
unmounted on logout, freeing system resources and not
leaving data exposed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The module also supports
mounting local filesystems of any kind the normal mount
utility supports, with extra code to make sure certain
volumes are set up properly because often <br>
they need more than just a mount call, such as encrypted
volumes. This includes SMB/CIFS, FUSE, dm-crypt and
LUKS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you intend to use pam_mount
to protect volumes on your computer using an encrypted
filesystem system, please know that there are many other
issues you need to consider in <br>
order to protect your data. For example, you probably want
to disable or encrypt your swap partition (the cryptoswap
can help you do this). Do not assume a system is secure
with&acirc; <br>
out carefully considering potential threats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration <br>
The primary configuration file for the pam_mount module is
pam_mount.conf.xml. On most platforms this file is read from
/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml. On OpenBSD pam_mount <br>
reads its configuration file from /etc/pam_mount.conf.xml.
See pam_mount.conf(5) documenting its use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual users may define
additional volumes to mount if allowed by pam_mount.conf.xml
(usually ~/.pam_mount.conf.xml). The volume keyword is the
only valid keyword in these <br>
per-user configuration files. If the luserconf parameter is
set in pam_mount.conf.xml, allowing user-defined volume,
then users may mount and unmount any volume they own at any
<br>
mount point they own. On some filesystem configurations this
may be a security flaw so user-defined volumes are not
allowed by the example pam_mount.conf.xml distributed with
<br>
pam_mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM configuration <br>
In addition, you must include two entries in the
system&rsquo;s applicable /etc/pam.d/service config files,
as the following example shows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth required pam_securetty.so
<br>
auth required pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok <br>
auth required pam_nologin.so <br>
+++ auth optional pam_mount.so <br>
account required pam_pwdb.so <br>
password required pam_cracklib.so <br>
password required pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok use_authtok <br>
session required pam_pwdb.so <br>
session optional pam_console.so <br>
+++ session optional pam_mount.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;sufficient&quot; is
used in the second column, you must make sure that pam_mount
is added before this entry. Otherwise pam_mount will not get
executed should a previous PAM mod&acirc; <br>
ule succeed. Also be aware of the &quot;include&quot;
statements. These make PAM look into the specified file. If
there is a &quot;sufficient&quot; statement, then the
pam_mount entry must either be <br>
in the included file before the &quot;sufficient&quot;
statement or before the &quot;include&quot; statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use pam_ldap,
pam_winbind, or any other authentication services that make
use of PAM&rsquo;s sufficient keyword, model your
configuration on the following order:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;&Acirc;&middot;&Acirc;&middot;
<br>
account sufficient pam_ldap.so <br>
auth required pam_mount.so <br>
auth sufficient pam_ldap.so use_first_pass <br>
auth required pam_unix.so use_first_pass <br>
session optional pam_mount.so <br>
&Acirc;&middot;&Acirc;&middot;&Acirc;&middot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows for:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. pam_mount, as the first
&quot;auth&quot; module, will prompt for a password and
export it to the PAM system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. pam_ldap will use the
password from the PAM system to try and authenticate the
user. If this succedes, the user will be authenticated. If
it fails, pam_unix will try to <br>
authenticate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. pam_unix will try to
authenticate the user if pam_ldap failed. If pam_unix fails,
then the authentication will be refused (due to the
&quot;required&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the following is
possible (thanks to Andrew Morgan for the hint!):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth [success=2 default=ignore]
pam_unix2.so <br>
auth [success=1 default=ignore] pam_ldap.so use_first_pass
<br>
auth requisite pam_deny.so <br>
auth optional pam_mount.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may seem odd, but the first
three lines will make it so that at least one of pam_unix2
or pam_ldap has to succeed. As you can see, pam_mount will
be run after successful <br>
authentication with these subsystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encrypted disks <br>
pam_mount supports a few types of crypto. The most common
are encfs, dm-crypt and dm-crypt+LUKS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first one uses the FUSE
layer; files within the encfs container are stored as single
encrypted files on the host in a previously-existing
directory. If you store lots of <br>
files, it is recommended to have a lower filesystem that is
strong in this area, such as xfs, but some software and/or
your partitioning decisions may force you to use a
differ&acirc; <br>
ent fs. The 1:1 mapping of files also allows encrypted files
to be reasonably efficiently rsync&rsquo;ed for example
without having to open the encrypted container. Creation is
done <br>
through the encfs(1) tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dm-crypt provides
whole-filesystem/entire-partition encryption. You can also
create a container file, but the idea is that it is
represented as a block device on which you still <br>
have to create a filesystem. In fact, this way you can
select a filesystem of your choice. The downside is that
shrinking is often not possible (there is no such issue in
encfs <br>
because it uses the lower fs). Suitable dm-crypt containers
(and auxiliary files), using block devices or plain files,
can be created using the pmt-ehd(8) tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmt-ehd creates filesystem key
material which is a bunch of random bytes that will be used
to en-/decrypt the volume. This material itself is encrypted
with your own password - <br>
this is done so that you can change the password without
having to reencrypt all of your data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LUKS is an extension for
dm-crypt to support multi-password containers. Unless you
specifically need it, the above two solutions are
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The key file that
pmt-ehd(8) will create represents the filesystem key
material as encrypted with your password. It is thus safe to
store this on an unsecured filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Troubleshooting <br>
To ensure that your system and, possibly, the remote server
are all properly configured, you should try to mount all or
some of the volumes by hand, using the same commands and
<br>
mount points provided in pam_mount.conf.xml. This will save
you a lot of grief, since it is more difficult to debug the
mounting process via pam_mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you can mount the volumes by
hand but it is not happening via pam_mount, you may want to
enable the &quot;debug&quot; option in pam_mount.conf.xml to
see what is happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verify if the user owns the
mount point and has sufficient permissions over that.
pam_mount will verify this and will refuse to mount the
remote volume if the user does not own <br>
that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pam_mount is having trouble
unmounting volumes upon logging out, enable the debug
variable. This causes pam_mount to run ofl on logout and
write its output to the system&rsquo;s <br>
log.</p>
