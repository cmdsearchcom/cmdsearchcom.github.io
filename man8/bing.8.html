<p>BING(8) UNIX System Manager&rsquo;s Manual BING(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bing - compute point to point throughput using two sizes of
ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to pairs of remote hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bing [dDnrRPvVwz] [-c count] [-e samples] [-f samplefile]
[-i wait] [-p pattern] [-s small packetsize] [-S big
packetsize] host1 host2 [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bing determines bandwidth on a point-to-point link by
sending ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets and measuring their
roundtrip times for different packet sizes on each end of
the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host1 is supposed to be the
nearest end of the link, while host2 is the other end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c count <br>
Stop after count resets of the stats. Useful only in
conjunction with the -e option. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Set the SO_DEBUG option on
the socket being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Display the measured
throughput at every received packet. By default, it is
displayed only when the computed value changes, which itself
changes only when the minimum <br>
roundtrip time for one of the packet sizes changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e samples <br>
Reset stats after sending samples ECHO_REQUEST packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f samplefile <br>
Saves the bandwidth measurements to the file samplefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i wait <br>
Wait wait seconds for each ECHO_REPLY packet. The default is
to wait for four seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Numeric output only. No
attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Be pedantic regarding
round-trip times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, bing assumes that the
roundtrip time for a small packet should always be smaller
than the roundtrip time for a big packet to the same host,
that for a given size <br>
the roundtrip time for host1 should always be smaller than
the roundtrip time for host2, and that the increase in the
roundtrip time between host1 and host2 should always be <br>
bigger for big packets than for small packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bing takes advantage of this to
better determine the minimum roundtrip times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -P disables this
behaviour, in the unlikely event it could be of any use
someday. Even IP/X25 links are not weird enough to require
this, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pattern <br>
You may specify up to 16 &lsquo;&lsquo;pad&rsquo;&rsquo;
bytes to fill out the packet you send. This is useful for
diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network. For
example, &lsquo;&lsquo;-p ff&rsquo;&rsquo; will <br>
cause the sent packet to be filled with all ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Record route. Includes the
RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays
the route buffer on returned packets. Note that the IP
header is only large enough for <br>
nine such routes. Many hosts ignore or discard this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Bypass the normal routing
tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error
is returned. This option can <br>
be used to ping a local host through an interface that has
no route through it (e.g., after the interface was dropped
by routed(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s small packetsize <br>
Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent in the small
packets. The default and minimum value is 44.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S big packetsize <br>
Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent in the big
packets. The default is 108. The size should be chosen so
that big packet roundtrip times are long enough to be <br>
accurately measured (depending on clock resolution and
number of hops).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u size increment <br>
Specifies that bing should start sending packets of the size
of small packetsize and then increase the size by size
increment until it reaches big packetsize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output. ICMP packets
other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are received are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Very verbose output. The
roundtrip time of each received echo is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Display possible warnings
about roundtrip times all the time. By default, warnings are
printed only at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Fill packets with
uncompressible (pseudo-random) data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Round-trip times and packet loss
statistics are computed. If duplicate packets are received,
they are not included in the packet loss calculation,
although the round trip time of <br>
these packets is used in calculating the
minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers. When the
specified number of loops have been made or if the program
is terminated with a <br>
SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is intended for use
in network testing, measurement and management. Because of
the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
bing during normal opera&acirc; <br>
tions or from automated scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum IP header length is
too small for options like RECORD_ROUTE to be completely
useful. There&rsquo;s not much that that can be done about
this, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the final stats (average
throughputs) almost never give a even marginally correct
result.</p>
