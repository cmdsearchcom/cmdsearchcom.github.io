<p>SG_SCAN(8) SG3_UTILS SG_SCAN(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_scan - scans sg devices (or SCSI/ATAPI/ATA devices) and
prints results</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_scan [-a] [-i] [-n] [-w] [-x] [DEVICE]*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If no DEVICE names are given, sg_scan does a scan of the sg
devices and outputs a line of information for each sg device
that is currently bound to a SCSI device. If one or more
<br>
DEVICEs are given only those devices are scanned. Each
device is opened with the O_NONBLOCK flag so that the scan
will not &quot;hang&quot; on any device that another process
holds an <br>
O_EXCL lock on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any given DEVICE name is
expected to comply with (to some extent) the Storage
Architecture Model (SAM see www.t10.org). Any device names
associated with the Linux SCSI subsystem <br>
(e.g. /dev/sda and /dev/st0m) are suitable. Devices names
associated with ATAPI devices (e.g. most CD/DVD drives and
ATAPI tape drives) are also suitable. If the device does not
<br>
fall into the above categories then an ATA IDENTIFY command
is tried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Linux 2.6 and 3 series
kernels, the lsscsi utility may be helpful. Apart from
providing more information (by data-mining in the sysfs
pseudo file system), it does not need <br>
root permissions to execute, as this utility would typically
need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a do alphabetical scan (i.e. sga, sgb, sgc). Note that sg
device nodes with an alphabetical index have been deprecated
since the Linux kernel 2.2 series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i do a SCSI INQUIRY, output
results in a second (indented) line. If the device is an ATA
disk then output information from an ATA IDENTIFY
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n do numeric scan (i.e. sg0,
sg1...) [default]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w use a read/write flag when
opening sg device (default is read-only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x extra information output
about queuing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This utility was written at a time when hotplugging of SCSI
devices was not supported in Linux. It used a simple
algorithm to scan sg device nodes in ascending numeric or
alpha&acirc; <br>
betical order, stopping after there were 4 consecutive
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Linux kernel 2.6 series,
this utility uses sysfs to find which sg device nodes are
active and only checks those. Hence there can be large
&quot;holes&quot; in the numbering of sg <br>
device nodes (e.g. after an adapter has been removed) and
still all active sg device nodes will be listed. This
utility assumes that sg device nodes are named using the
normal <br>
conventions and searches from /dev/sg0 to /dev/sg4095
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_scan is 0 when it is successful.
Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
