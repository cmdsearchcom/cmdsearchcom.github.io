<p style="margin-top: 1em">spampd --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
spampd is an SMTP/LMTP proxy that marks (or tags) spam using
SpamAssassin (http://www.SpamAssassin.org/). The proxy is
designed to be transparent to the sending and receiving <br>
mail servers and at no point takes responsibility for the
message itself. If a failure occurs within spampd (or
SpamAssassin) then the mail servers will disconnect and the
<br>
sending server is still responsible for retrying the message
for as long as it is configured to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spampd uses SpamAssassin to
modify (tag) relayed messages based on their spam score, so
all SA settings apply. This is described in the SA
documentation. spampd will by default <br>
only tell SA to tag a message if it exceeds the spam
threshold score, however you can have it rewrite all
messages passing through by adding the --tagall option (see
SA for how <br>
non-spam messages are tagged).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spampd logs all aspects of its
operation to syslog(8), using the mail syslog facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latest version can be found
at
&lt;http://www.WorldDesign.com/index.cfm/rd/mta/spampd.htm&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requires <br>
Perl modules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail::SpamAssassin <br>
Net::Server::PreForkSimple <br>
IO::File <br>
IO::Socket <br>
Time::HiRes (not actually required but recommended)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation <br>
spampd is meant to operate as an S/LMTP mail proxy which
passes each message through SpamAssassin for analysis. Note
that spampd does not do anything other than check for spam,
<br>
so it is not suitable as an anti-relay system. It is meant
to work in conjunction with your regular mail system.
Typically one would pipe any messages they wanted scanned
<br>
through spampd after initial acceptance by your MX host.
This is especially useful for using Postfix&rsquo;s
(http://www.postfix.org) advanced content filtering
mechanism, although <br>
certainly not limited to that application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please re-read the second
sentence in the above paragraph. You should NOT enable
spampd to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless
you know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing! <br>
It is very easy to set up an open relay this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some simple examples
(square brackets in the &quot;diagrams&quot; indicate
physical machines):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running between firewall/gateway
and internal mail server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The firewall/gateway MTA would
be configured to forward all of its mail to the port that
spampd listens on, and spampd would relay its messages to
port 25 of your internal <br>
server. spampd could either run on its own host (and listen
on any port) or it could run on either mail server (and
listen on any port except port 25).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internet -&gt; [ MX gateway
(@inter.net.host:25) -&gt; <br>
spampd (@localhost:2025) ] -&gt; <br>
Internal mail (@private.host.ip:25)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Postfix advanced content
filtering</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please see the FILTER_README
that came with the Postfix distribution. You need to have a
version of Postfix which supports this (ideally v.2 and
up).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internet -&gt; [ Postfix
(@inter.net.host:25) -&gt; <br>
spampd (@localhost:10025) -&gt; <br>
Postfix (@localhost:10026) ] -&gt; final delivery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these examples only
show incoming mail delivery. Since it is usually unnecessary
to scan mail coming from your network (right?), it may be
desirable to set up a <br>
separate outbound route which bypasses spampd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upgrading <br>
If upgrading from a version prior to 2.2, please note that
the --add-sc-header option is no longer supported. Use SAs
built-in header manipulation features instead (as of SA <br>
v2.6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upgrading from version 1 simply
involves replacing the spampd program file with the latest
one. Note that the dead-letters folder is no longer being
used and the --dead-letters <br>
option is no longer needed (though no errors are thrown if
it&rsquo;s present). Check the &quot;Options&quot; list
below for a full list of new and deprecated options. Also be
sure to check <br>
out the change log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation <br>
spampd can be run directly from the command prompt if
desired. This is useful for testing purposes, but for long
term use you probably want to put it somewhere like /usr/bin
or <br>
/usr/local/bin and execute it at system startup. For example
on Red Hat-style Linux system one can use a script in
/etc/rc.d/init.d to start spampd (a sample script is
available <br>
on the spampd Web page @
http://www.WorldDesign.com/index.cfm/rd/mta/spampd.htm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options all have reasonable
defaults, especially for a Postfix-centric installation. You
may want to specify the --children option if you have an
especially beefy or weak <br>
server box because spampd is a memory-hungry program. Check
the &quot;Options&quot; for details on this and all other
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that spampd replaces spamd
from the SpamAssassin distribution in function. You do not
need to run spamd in order for spampd to work. This has
apparently been the source of <br>
some confusion, so now you know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Postfix-specific Notes <br>
Here is a typical setup for Postfix &quot;advanced&quot;
content filtering as described in the FILTER_README that
came with the Postfix distribution (which you really need to
read):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/postfix/master.cf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smtp inet n - y - - smtpd <br>
-o content_filter=smtp:localhost:10025 <br>
-o myhostname=mx.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localhost:10026 inet n - n - 10
smtpd <br>
-o content_filter= <br>
-o myhostname=mx-int.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first entry is the main
public-facing MTA which uses localhost:10025 as the content
filter for all mail. The second entry receives mail from the
content filter and does <br>
final delivery. Both smtpd instances use the same Postfix
main.cf file. spampd is the process that listens on
localhost:10025 and then connects to the Postfix listener on
<br>
localhost:10026. Note that the &quot;myhostname&quot;
options must be different between the two instances,
otherwise Postfix will think it&rsquo;s talking to itself
and abort sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the above example you can
simply start spampd like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spampd --host=localhost:10025
--relayhost=localhost:10026</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTER_README from the Postfix
distro has more details and examples of various setups,
including how to skip the content filter for outbound
mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another tip for Postfix when
considering what timeout values to use for --childtimout and
--satimeout options is the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;# postconf | grep
timeout&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will return a list of
useful timeout settings and their values. For explanations
see the relevant &quot;man&quot; page (smtp, smtpd, lmtp).
By default spampd is set up for the <br>
default Postfix timeout values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
--host=ip[:port] or hostname[:port] <br>
Specifies what hostname/IP and port spampd listens on. By
default, it listens on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port
10025.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important! You should NOT enable
spampd to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless
you know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--port=n <br>
Specifies what port spampd listens on. By default, it
listens on port 10025. This is an alternate to using the
above --host=ip:port notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relayhost=ip[:port] or
hostname[:port] <br>
Specifies the hostname/IP where spampd will relay all
messages. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). If the port is
not provided, that defaults to 25.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relayport=n <br>
Specifies what port spampd will relay to. Default is 25.
This is an alternate to using the above --relayhost=ip:port
notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user=username or --u=username
<br>
--group=groupname or --g=groupname <br>
Specifies the user and group that the proxy will run as.
Default is mail/mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--children=n or --c=n <br>
Number of child servers to start and maintain (where n &gt;
0). Each child will process up to --maxrequests (below)
before exiting and being replaced by another child. Keep
<br>
this number low on systems w/out a lot of memory. Default is
5 (which seems OK on a 512MB lightly loaded system). Note
that there is always a parent process running, so if <br>
you specify 5 children you will actually have 6 spampd
processes running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may want to set your
origination mail server to limit the number of concurrent
connections to spampd to match this setting (for Postfix
this is the <br>
&quot;xxxx_destination_concurrency_limit&quot; setting where
&rsquo;xxxx&rsquo; is the transport being used, usually
&rsquo;smtp&rsquo;, and the default is 100).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maxrequests=n <br>
spampd works by forking child servers to handle each
message. The maxrequests parameter specifies how many
requests will be handled before the child exits. Since a
child <br>
never gives back memory, a large message can cause it to
become quite bloated; the only way to reclaim the memory is
for the child to exit. The default is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--childtimeout=n <br>
This is the number of seconds to allow each child server
before it times out a transaction. In an S/LMTP transaction
the timer is reset for every command. This timeout <br>
includes time it would take to send the message data, so it
should not be too short. Note that it&rsquo;s more likely
the origination or destination mail servers will timeout
<br>
first, which is fine. This is just a &quot;sane&quot;
failsafe. Default is 360 seconds (6 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--satimeout=n <br>
This is the number of seconds to allow for processing a
message with SpamAssassin (including feeding it the message,
analyzing it, and adding the headers/report if <br>
necessary). This should be less than your origination and
destination servers&rsquo; timeout settings for the DATA
command. For Postfix the default is 300 seconds in both
cases <br>
(smtp_data_done_timeout and smtpd_timeout). In the event of
timeout while processing the message, the problem is logged
and the message is passed on anyway (w/out spam <br>
tagging, obviously). To fail the message with a temp 450
error, see the --dose (die-on-sa-errors) option, below.
Default is 285 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid=filename or --p=filename
<br>
Specifies a filename where spampd will write its process ID
so that it is easy to kill it later. The directory that will
contain this file must be writable by the spampd <br>
user. The default is /var/run/spampd.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logsock=unix or inet
&quot;(new in v2.20)&quot; <br>
Syslog socket to use. May be either &quot;unix&quot; of
&quot;inet&quot;. Default is &quot;unix&quot; except on
HP-UX and SunOS (Solaris) systems which seem to prefer
&quot;inet&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodetach &quot;(new in
v2.20)&quot; <br>
If this option is given spampd won&rsquo;t detach from the
console and fork into the background. This can be useful for
running under control of some daemon management tools or
<br>
when configured as a win32 service under cygrunsrv&rsquo;s
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maxsize=n <br>
The maximum message size to send to SpamAssassin, in KBytes.
By default messages over 64KB are not scanned at all, and an
appropriate message is logged indicating this. The <br>
size includes headers and attachments (if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dose <br>
Acronym for (d)ie (o)n (s)pamAssassin (e)rrors. By default
if spampd encounters a problem with processing the message
through Spam Assassin (timeout or other error), it <br>
will still pass the mail on to the destination server. If
you specify this option however, the mail is instead
rejected with a temporary error (code 450, which means the
<br>
origination server should keep retrying to send it). See the
related --satimeout option, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tagall or --a <br>
Tells spampd to have SpamAssassin add headers to all scanned
mail, not just spam. By default spampd will only rewrite
messages which exceed the spam threshold score (as <br>
defined in the SA settings). Note that for this option to
work as of SA-2.50, the always_add_report and/or
always_add_headers settings in your SpamAssassin local.cf
need to <br>
be set to 1/true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-rules-hit or --rh <br>
Logs the names of each SpamAssassin rule which matched the
message being processed. This list is returned by SA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set-envelope-headers or --seh
&quot;(new in v2.30)&quot; <br>
Turns on addition of X-Envelope-To and X-Envelope-From
headers to the mail being scanned before it is passed to
SpamAssassin. The idea is to help SA process any <br>
blacklist/whitelist to/from directives on the actual
sender/recipients instead of the possibly bogus envelope
headers. This potentially exposes the list of all recipients
of <br>
that mail (even BCC&rsquo;ed ones). Therefore usage of this
option is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Even though spampd tries
to prevent this leakage by removing the X-Envelope-To header
after scanning, SpamAssassin itself might add headers itself
which report one or <br>
more of the recipients which had been listed in this
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set-envelope-from or --sef
&quot;(new in v2.30)&quot; <br>
Same as above option but only enables the addition of
X-Envelope-From header. For those that don&rsquo;t feel
comfortable with the possible information exposure of
X-Envelope-To. <br>
The above option overrides this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-whitelist or --aw <br>
This option is no longer relevant with SA version 3.0 and
above, which controls auto whitelist use via local.cf
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For SA version &lt; 3.0, turns
on the SpamAssassin global whitelist feature. See the SA
docs. Note that per-user whitelists are not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local-only or --L <br>
Turn off all SA network-based tests (DNS, Razor, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug or --d <br>
Turns on SpamAssassin debug messages which print to the
system mail log (same log as spampd will log to). Also turns
on more verbose logging of what spampd is doing (new in <br>
v2). Also increases log level of Net::Server to 4 (debug),
adding yet more info (but not too much) (new in v2.2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help or --h <br>
Prints usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated Options <br>
The following options are no longer used but still accepted
for backwards compatibility with prevoius spampd
versions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dead-letters <br>
--heloname <br>
--stop-at-threshold <br>
--add-sc-header <br>
--hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above but spampd runs on

passes messages on to the internal mail server on another
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add configurable option for
rejecting mail outright based on spam score. It would be
nice to make this program safe enough to sit in front of a
mail server such as Postfix and <br>
be able to reject mail before it enters our systems. The
only real problem is that Postfix will see localhost as the
connecting client, so that disables any client-based checks
<br>
Postfix can do and creates a possible relay hole if
localhost is trusted.</p>
