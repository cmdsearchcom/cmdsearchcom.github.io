<i>spampd</i> is an SMTP/LMTP proxy that marks (or tags) spam using SpamAssassin
  (http://www.SpamAssassin.org/). The proxy is designed to be transparent to the
  sending and receiving mail servers and at no point takes responsibility for
  the message itself. If a failure occurs within <i>spampd</i> (or SpamAssassin)
  then the mail servers will disconnect and the sending server is still
  responsible for retrying the message for as long as it is configured to do so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>spampd</i> uses SpamAssassin to modify (tag) relayed messages based on their
  spam score, so all SA settings apply. This is described in the SA
  documentation. <i>spampd</i> will by default only tell SA to tag a message if
  it exceeds the spam threshold score, however you can have it rewrite all
  messages passing through by adding the --tagall option (see SA for how
  non-spam messages are tagged).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>spampd</i> logs all aspects of its operation to <i>syslog</i>(8), using the
  mail syslog facility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The latest version can be found at
  &lt;http://www.WorldDesign.com/index.cfm/rd/mta/spampd.htm&gt;.

<i>spampd</i> is meant to operate as an S/LMTP mail proxy which passes each
  message through SpamAssassin for analysis. Note that <i>spampd</i> does not do
  anything other than check for spam, so it is not suitable as an anti-relay
  system. It is meant to work in conjunction with your regular mail system.
  Typically one would pipe any messages they wanted scanned through
  <i>spampd</i> after initial acceptance by your MX host. This is especially
  useful for using Postfix's (http://www.postfix.org) advanced content filtering
  mechanism, although certainly not limited to that application.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please re-read the second sentence in the above paragraph. You should NOT enable
  <i>spampd</i> to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless you know
  exactly what you're doing! It is very easy to set up an open relay this way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some simple examples (square brackets in the &quot;diagrams&quot;
  indicate physical machines):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Running between firewall/gateway and internal mail server</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 3.00ex;">The firewall/gateway MTA would be configured
  to forward all of its mail to the port that <i>spampd</i> listens on, and
  <i>spampd</i> would relay its messages to port 25 of your internal server.
  <i>spampd</i> could either run on its own host (and listen on any port) or it
  could run on either mail server (and listen on any port except port 25).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
 Internet -&gt; [ MX gateway (@inter.net.host:25) -&gt; 
        spampd (@localhost:2025) ] -&gt;
        Internal mail (@private.host.ip:25)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Using Postfix advanced content filtering</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 3.00ex;">Please see the <i>FILTER_README</i> that came
  with the Postfix distribution. You need to have a version of Postfix which
  supports this (ideally v.2 and up).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
 Internet -&gt; [ Postfix (@inter.net.host:25) -&gt; 
        spampd (@localhost:10025) -&gt; 
        Postfix (@localhost:10026) ] -&gt; final delivery
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that these examples only show incoming mail delivery. Since it is usually
  unnecessary to scan mail coming from your network (right?), it may be
  desirable to set up a separate outbound route which bypasses <i>spampd</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Upgrading"><a class="selflink" href="#Upgrading">Upgrading</a></h1>
If upgrading from a version prior to 2.2, please note that the --add-sc-header
  option is no longer supported. Use SAs built-in header manipulation features
  instead (as of SA v2.6).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Upgrading from version 1 simply involves replacing the <i>spampd</i> program
  file with the latest one. Note that the <i>dead-letters</i> folder is no
  longer being used and the --dead-letters option is no longer needed (though no
  errors are thrown if it's present). Check the &quot;Options&quot; list below
  for a full list of new and deprecated options. Also be sure to check out the
  change log.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Installation"><a class="selflink" href="#Installation">Installation</a></h1>
<i>spampd</i> can be run directly from the command prompt if desired. This is
  useful for testing purposes, but for long term use you probably want to put it
  somewhere like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin and execute it at system startup.
  For example on Red Hat-style Linux system one can use a script in
  /etc/rc.d/init.d to start <i>spampd</i> (a sample script is available on the
  <i>spampd</i> Web page @
  http://www.WorldDesign.com/index.cfm/rd/mta/spampd.htm).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options all have reasonable defaults, especially for a Postfix-centric
  installation. You may want to specify the --children option if you have an
  especially beefy or weak server box because <i>spampd</i> is a memory-hungry
  program. Check the &quot;Options&quot; for details on this and all other
  parameters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <i>spampd</i> <b>replaces</b> <i>spamd</i> from the
  <i>SpamAssassin</i> distribution in function. You do not need to run
  <i>spamd</i> in order for <i>spampd</i> to work. This has apparently been the
  source of some confusion, so now you know.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Postfix-specific_Notes"><a class="selflink" href="#Postfix-specific_Notes">Postfix-specific
  Notes</a></h2>
Here is a typical setup for Postfix &quot;advanced&quot; content filtering as
  described in the <i>FILTER_README</i> that came with the Postfix distribution
  (which you really need to read):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/etc/postfix/master.cf</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 smtp   inet    n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
        -o content_filter=smtp:localhost:10025
        -o myhostname=mx.example.com
 localhost:10026        inet    n       -       n       -       10      smtpd
        -o content_filter=
        -o myhostname=mx-int.example.com
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first entry is the main public-facing MTA which uses localhost:10025 as the
  content filter for all mail.	The second entry receives mail from the content
  filter and does final delivery. Both smtpd instances use the same Postfix
  <i>main.cf</i> file. <i>spampd</i> is the process that listens on
  localhost:10025 and then connects to the Postfix listener on localhost:10026.
  Note that the &quot;myhostname&quot; options must be different between the two
  instances, otherwise Postfix will think it's talking to itself and abort
  sending.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the above example you can simply start <i>spampd</i> like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 spampd --host=localhost:10025 --relayhost=localhost:10026
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>FILTER_README</i> from the Postfix distro has more details and examples of
  various setups, including how to skip the content filter for outbound mail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another tip for Postfix when considering what timeout values to use for
  --childtimout and --satimeout options is the following command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;# postconf | grep timeout&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will return a list of useful timeout settings and their values. For
  explanations see the relevant &quot;man&quot; page (smtp, smtpd, lmtp). By
  default <i>spampd</i> is set up for the default Postfix timeout values.

      system). Note that there is always a parent process running, so if you
      specify 5 children you will actually have 6 <i>spampd</i> processes
      running.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You may want to set your origination mail server to limit the number of
      concurrent connections to <i>spampd</i> to match this setting (for Postfix

      the message data, so it should not be too short. Note that it's more
      likely the origination or destination mail servers will timeout first,
      which is fine. This is just a &quot;sane&quot; failsafe. Default is 360

      command. For Postfix the default is 300 seconds in both cases
      (smtp_data_done_timeout and smtpd_timeout). In the event of timeout while
      processing the message, the problem is logged and the message is passed on
      anyway (w/out spam tagging, obviously). To fail the message with a temp
      450 error, see the --dose (die-on-sa-errors) option, below. Default is 285

Figure out how to use Net::Server::PreFork because it has cool potential for
  load management. I tried but either I'm missing something or PreFork is
  somewhat broken in how it works. If anyone has experience here, please let me
  know.

Add configurable option for rejecting mail outright based on spam score. It
  would be nice to make this program safe enough to sit in front of a mail
  server such as Postfix and be able to reject mail before it enters our
  systems. The only real problem is that Postfix will see localhost as the
  connecting client, so that disables any client-based checks Postfix can do and
  creates a possible relay hole if localhost is trusted.
