votequorum_overview - Votequorum Library Overview
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
The votequorum library is delivered with the corosync project. It is the
  external interface to the vote-based quorum service. This service is
  optionally loaded into all nodes in a corosync cluster to avoid split-brain
  situations. It does this by having a number of votes assigned to each system
  in the cluster and ensuring that only when a majority of the votes are
  present, cluster operations are allowed to proceed.

The library provides a mechanism to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Query the quorum status
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Get a list of nodes known to the quorum service
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Receive notifications of quorum state changes
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Change the number of votes assigned to a node
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Change the number of expected votes for a cluster to be quorate
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Connect an additional quorum device to allow small clusters to remain quorate
  during node outages.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VIRTUAL_SYNCHRONY"><a class="selflink" href="#VIRTUAL_SYNCHRONY">VIRTUAL
  SYNCHRONY</a></h1>
Votequorum is the only one service where communication with library is allowed
  during synchronization phase. This makes it possible for quorum device to
  react to membership change and decide to vote or not without timing hazard,
  because corosync stands in synchronization phase until qdevice on all nodes
  votes or timeout expires.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As a side effect, extended virtual synchrony is broken for the votequorum
  service. This means, that messages sent during synchronization phase can be
  delivered sooner then messages sent right before sync phase began. This
  applies also for local messages.
