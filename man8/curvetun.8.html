curvetun - a lightweight curve25519 ip4/6 tunnel
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>curvetun</b> [<i>options</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
curvetun is a lightweight, high-speed ECDH multiuser IP tunnel for Linux that is
  based on epoll(2). curvetun uses the Linux TUN/TAP interface and supports
  {IPv4, IPv6} over {IPv4, IPv6} with UDP or TCP as carrier protocols.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It has an integrated packet forwarding tree, thus multiple users with different
  IPs can be handled via a single tunnel device on the server side, and flows
  are scheduled for processing in a CPU efficient way, at least in the case of
  TCP as the carrier protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For key management, public-key cryptography based on elliptic curves are used
  and packets are encrypted end-to-end by the symmetric stream cipher Salsa20
  and authenticated by the MAC Poly1305, where keys have previously been
  computed with the ECDH key agreement protocol Curve25519.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cryptography is based on Daniel J. Bernstein's networking and cryptography
  library &#x201C;NaCl&#x201D;. By design, curvetun does not provide any
  particular pattern or default port numbers that gives certainty that the
  connection from a particular flow is actually running curvetun.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, if you have a further need to bypass censorship, you can try using
  curvetun in combination with Tor's obfsproxy or Telex. Furthermore, curvetun
  also protects you against replay attacks and DH man-in-the-middle attacks.
  Additionally, server-side syslog event logging can also be disabled to avoid
  revealing critical user connection data.

Encrypted IP tunnels are often used to create virtual private networks (VPN),
  where parts of the network can only be reached via an insecure or untrusted
  medium such as the Internet. Only a few software utilities exist to create
  such tunnels, or, VPNs. Two popular representatives of such software are
  OpenVPN and VTUN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The latter also introduced the TUN/TAP interfaces into the Linux kernel. VTUN
  only has a rather basic encryption module, that does not fit today's
  cryptographic needs. By default, MD5 is used to create 128-Bit wide keys for
  the symmetric BlowFish cipher in ECB mode [1].
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although OpenSSL is used in both VTUN and OpenVPN, OpenVPN is much more feature
  rich regarding ciphers and user authentication. Nevertheless, letting people
  choose ciphers or authentication methods is not necessarily a good thing:
  administrators could either prefer speed over security and therefore choose
  weak ciphers, so that the communication system will be as good as without any
  cipher; they could choose weak passwords for symmetric encryption or they
  could misconfigure the communication system by having too much choice of
  ciphers and too little experience for picking the right one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next to the administration issues, there are also software development issues.
  Cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL are a huge mess and too low-level and
  complex to fully understand or correctly apply, so that they form further
  ground for vulnerabilities of such software.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In 2010, the cryptographers Tanja Lange and Daniel J. Bernstein have therefore
  created and published a cryptographic library for networking, which is named
  NaCl (pronounced ''salt''). NaCl addresses such problems as mentioned in
  OpenSSL and, in contrast to the rather generic use of OpenSSL, was created
  with a strong focus on public-key authenticated encryption based on elliptic
  curve cryptography, which is used in curvetun. Partially quoting Daniel J.
  Bernstein:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;RSA is somewhat older than elliptic-curve cryptography: RSA was introduced
  in 1977, while elliptic-curve cryptography was introduced in 1985. However,
  RSA has shown many more weaknesses than elliptic-curve cryptography. RSA's
  effective security level was dramatically reduced by the linear sieve in the
  late 1970s, by the quadratic sieve and ECM in the 1980s, and by the
  number-field sieve in the 1990s. For comparison, a few attacks have been
  developed against some rare elliptic curves having special algebraic
  structures, and the amount of computer power available to attackers has
  predictably increased, but typical elliptic curves require just as much
  computer power to break today as they required twenty years ago.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IEEE P1363 standardized elliptic-curve cryptography in the late 1990s, including
  a stringent list of security criteria for elliptic curves. NIST used the IEEE
  P1363 criteria to select fifteen specific elliptic curves at five different
  security levels. In 2005, NSA issued a new ''Suite B'' standard, recommending
  the NIST elliptic curves (at two specific security levels) for all public-key
  cryptography and withdrawing previous recommendations of RSA.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
curvetun uses a particular elliptic curve, Curve25519, introduced in the
  following paper: Daniel J. Bernstein, ''Curve25519: new Diffie-Hellman speed
  records,'' pages 207-228 in Proceedings of PKC 2006, edited by Moti Yung,
  Yevgeniy Dodis, Aggelos Kiayias, and Tal Malkin, Lecture Notes in Computer
  Science 3958, Springer, 2006, ISBN 3-540-33851-9.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This elliptic curve follows all of the standard IEEE P1363 security criteria. It
  also follows new recommendations that achieve ''side-channel immunity'' and
  ''twist security'' while improving speed. What this means is that secure
  implementations of Curve25519 are considerably simpler and faster than secure
  implementations of, for example, NIST P-256; there are fewer opportunities for
  implementors to make mistakes that compromise security, and mistakes are more
  easily caught by reviewers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An attacker who spends a billion dollars on special-purpose chips to attack
  Curve25519, using the best attacks available today, has about 1 chance in
  1000000000000000000000000000 of breaking Curve25519 after a year of
  computation. One could achieve similar levels of security with 3000-bit RSA,
  but encryption and authentication with 3000-bit RSA are not nearly fast enough
  to handle tunnel traffic and would require much more space in network packets.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SETUP_HOWTO"><a class="selflink" href="#SETUP_HOWTO">SETUP
  HOWTO</a></h1>
If you have not run curvetun before, you need to do an initial setup once.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, make sure that the servers and clients clocks are periodically synced,
  for example, by running an NTP daemon. This is necessary to protect against
  replay attacks. Also, make sure you have read and write access to
  /dev/net/tun. You should not run curvetun as root! Then, after you have
  assured this, the first step is to generate keys and config files. On both the
  client and server do:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>curvetun -k</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You are asked for a user name. You can use an email address or whatever suits
  you. Here, we assume you have entered 'mysrv1' on the server and 'myclient1'
  on the client side.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, all necessary files have been created under ~/.curvetun. Files include
  &#x201C;priv.key&#x201D;, &#x201C;pub.key&#x201D;, &#x201C;username&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;clients&#x201D; and &#x201C;servers&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&#x201C;clients&#x201D; and &#x201C;servers&#x201D; are empty at the beginning
  and need to be filled. The &#x201C;clients&#x201D; file is meant for the
  server, so that it knows what clients are allowed to connect. The
  &#x201C;servers&#x201D; file is for the client, where it can select curvetun
  servers to connect to. Both files are kept very simple, so that a single
  configuration line per client or server is sufficient.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The client needs to export its public key data for the server
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>curvetun -x</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where it prints a string in the following format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>

  myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11
<br/>
 \_______/
  \_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
<br/>
 username 32 byte public key for 'myclient1'
<div class="Pp"></div>
This line is transferred to the server admin (yes, we assume a manual on-site
  key exchange scenario where, for example, the admin sets up server and
  clients), where the admin then adds this entry into his ''clients'' file like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 server$ echo
  &quot;myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:&quot; \
<br/>
 &quot;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11&quot; &gt;&gt;
  ~/.curvetun/clients
<div class="Pp"></div>
The server admin can check if the server has registered it properly as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 server$ curvetun -C
<div class="Pp"></div>
which prints all parsed clients from ''~/.curvetun/clients''. This process could
  easily be automated or scripted with, for example, Perl and LDAP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, the client ''myclient1'' is known to the server; that completes the server
  configuration. The next step is to tell the client where it needs to connect
  to the server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We assume in this example that the tunnel server has a public IP address, e.g.
  1.2.3.4, runs on port 6666 and uses UDP as a carrier protocol. In case you are
  behind NAT, you can use curvetun's ''--stun'' option for starting the server,
  to obtain your mapping. However, in this example we continue with 1.2.3.4 and
  6666, UDP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, the server needs to export its key to the client, as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 server$ curvetun -x
<div class="Pp"></div>
where it prints a string in the following format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>

  mysrv1;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22
<br/>
 \____/
  \_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
<br/>
 username 32 byte public key for 'mysrv1'
<br/>
 ^-- you need this public key
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, you now have the server IP address, server port, server transport protocol
  and the server's public key at hand. On the client side it can be put all
  together in the config as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 client$ echo
  &quot;myfirstserver;1.2.3.4;6666;udp;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:&quot; \
<br/>
 &quot;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:&quot; \
<br/>
 &quot;22:22&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.curvetun/servers
<div class="Pp"></div>
The client can check its config using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 client$ curvetun -S
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then we start the server with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 server$ curvetun -s -p 6666 -u
<br/>
 server# ifconfig curves0 up
<br/>
 server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then, we start the client with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 client$ curvetun -c=myfirstserver
<br/>
 client# ifconfig curvec0 up
<br/>
 client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, client-side information, errors, or warnings will appear in syslog! By now
  we should be able to ping the server:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 client$ ping 10.0.0.1
<div class="Pp"></div>
That's it! Routing example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Server side's public IP on eth0 is, for example, 1.2.3.4:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 server$ ... start curvetun server ...
<br/>
 server# ifconfig curves0 up
<br/>
 server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24
<br/>
 server# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
<br/>
 server# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
<br/>
 server# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o curves0 -m state --state
  RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
<br/>
 server# iptables -A FORWARD -i curves0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
<div class="Pp"></div>
Client side's IP on eth0 is, for example, 5.6.7.8:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 client$ ... start curvetun client ...
<br/>
 client# ... lookup your default gateway (e.g. via route, here: 5.6.7.9) ...
<br/>
 client# ifconfig curvec0 up
<br/>
 client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24
<br/>
 client# route add -net 1.2.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 5.6.7.9 dev eth0
<br/>
 client# route add default gw 10.0.0.1
<br/>
 client# route del default gw 5.6.7.9
<div class="Pp"></div>
That should be it, happy browsing and emailing via curvetun tunnels!
