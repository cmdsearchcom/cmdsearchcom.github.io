<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
curvetun - a lightweight curve25519 ip4/6 tunnel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
curvetun [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
curvetun is a lightweight, high-speed ECDH multiuser IP
tunnel for Linux that is based on epoll(2). curvetun uses
the Linux TUN/TAP interface and supports {IPv4, IPv6} over
<br>
{IPv4, IPv6} with UDP or TCP as carrier protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It has an integrated packet
forwarding tree, thus multiple users with different IPs can
be handled via a single tunnel device on the server side,
and flows are scheduled for pro&acirc; <br>
cessing in a CPU efficient way, at least in the case of TCP
as the carrier protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For key management, public-key
cryptography based on elliptic curves are used and packets
are encrypted end-to-end by the symmetric stream cipher
Salsa20 and authenticated by the <br>
MAC Poly1305, where keys have previously been computed with
the ECDH key agreement protocol Curve25519.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cryptography is based on Daniel
J. Bernstein&rsquo;s networking and cryptography library
&acirc;NaCl&acirc;. By design, curvetun does not provide any
particular pattern or default port numbers <br>
that gives certainty that the connection from a particular
flow is actually running curvetun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you have a further
need to bypass censorship, you can try using curvetun in
combination with Tor&rsquo;s obfsproxy or Telex.
Furthermore, curvetun also protects you against <br>
replay attacks and DH man-in-the-middle attacks.
Additionally, server-side syslog event logging can also be
disabled to avoid revealing critical user connection
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. obfsproxy from the TOR

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d &lt;tundev&gt;, --dev &lt;tundev&gt; <br>
Defines the name of the tunnel device that is being created.
If this option is not set, then the default names,
curves{0,1,2,..} for a curvetun server, and
curvec{0,1,2,...} for <br>
a curvetun client are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;num&gt;, --port
&lt;num&gt; <br>
Defines the port the curvetun server should listen on. There
is no default port for curvetun, so setting this option for
server bootstrap is mandatory. This option is for servers
<br>
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;server&gt;, --stun
&lt;server&gt; <br>
If needed, this options enables an STUN lookup in order to
show public IP to port mapping and to punch a hole into the
firewall. In case you are unsure what STUN server to use,
<br>
simply use &rsquo;&rsquo;--stun
stunserver.org&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c[=alias], --client[=alias]
<br>
Starts curvetun in client mode and connects to the given
connection alias that is defined in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keygen <br>
Generate private and public keypair. This must be done
initially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --export <br>
Export user and key combination to stdout as a
one-liner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --dumpc <br>
Dump all known clients that may connect to the local
curvetun server and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --dumps <br>
Dump all known servers curvetun as a client can connect to,
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --nofork <br>
Do not fork off as a client or server on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --server <br>
Start curvetun in server mode. Additional parameters are
needed, at least the definition of the port that clients can
connect to is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-logging <br>
Disable all curvetun logging of user information. This
option can be used to enable curvetun users to connect more
anonymously. This option is for servers only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --udp <br>
Use UDP as a carrier protocol instead of TCP. By default,
TCP is the carrier protocol. This option is for servers
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --ipv4 <br>
Defines IPv4 as the underlying network protocol to be used
on the tunnel device. IPv4 is the default. This option is
for servers only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ipv6 <br>
Defines IPv6 as the underlying network protocol to be used
on the tunnel device. This option is for servers only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Show version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show user help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE EXAMPLE <br>
curvetun --server -4 -u -N --port 6666 --stun stunserver.org
<br>
Starts curvetun in server mode with IPv4 as network protocol
and UDP as a transport carrier protocol. The curvetun server
listens for incoming connections on port 6666 and per&acirc;
<br>
forms an STUN lookup on startup to stunserver.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curvetun --client=ethz <br>
Starts curvetun in client mode and connects to the defined
connection alias &rsquo;&rsquo;ethz&rsquo;&rsquo; that is
defined in the curvetun ~/.curvetun/servers configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curvetun --keygen <br>
Generates initial keypairs and stores them in the
~/.curvetun/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curvetun --export <br>
Export user data to stdout for configuration of a curvetun
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRYPTOGRAPHY <br>
Encrypted IP tunnels are often used to create virtual
private networks (VPN), where parts of the network can only
be reached via an insecure or untrusted medium such as the
<br>
Internet. Only a few software utilities exist to create such
tunnels, or, VPNs. Two popular representatives of such
software are OpenVPN and VTUN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latter also introduced the
TUN/TAP interfaces into the Linux kernel. VTUN only has a
rather basic encryption module, that does not fit
today&rsquo;s cryptographic needs. By <br>
default, MD5 is used to create 128-Bit wide keys for the
symmetric BlowFish cipher in ECB mode [1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although OpenSSL is used in both
VTUN and OpenVPN, OpenVPN is much more feature rich
regarding ciphers and user authentication. Nevertheless,
letting people choose ciphers or <br>
authentication methods is not necessarily a good thing:
administrators could either prefer speed over security and
therefore choose weak ciphers, so that the communication
system <br>
will be as good as without any cipher; they could choose
weak passwords for symmetric encryption or they could
misconfigure the communication system by having too much
choice of <br>
ciphers and too little experience for picking the right
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next to the administration
issues, there are also software development issues.
Cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL are a huge mess and too
low-level and complex to fully under&acirc; <br>
stand or correctly apply, so that they form further ground
for vulnerabilities of such software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In 2010, the cryptographers
Tanja Lange and Daniel J. Bernstein have therefore created
and published a cryptographic library for networking, which
is named NaCl (pronounced <br>
&rsquo;&rsquo;salt&rsquo;&rsquo;). NaCl addresses such
problems as mentioned in OpenSSL and, in contrast to the
rather generic use of OpenSSL, was created with a strong
focus on public-key authenticated <br>
encryption based on elliptic curve cryptography, which is
used in curvetun. Partially quoting Daniel J. Bernstein:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;RSA is somewhat older than
elliptic-curve cryptography: RSA was introduced in 1977,
while elliptic-curve cryptography was introduced in 1985.
However, RSA has shown many more <br>
weaknesses than elliptic-curve cryptography. RSA&rsquo;s
effective security level was dramatically reduced by the
linear sieve in the late 1970s, by the quadratic sieve and
ECM in the <br>
1980s, and by the number-field sieve in the 1990s. For
comparison, a few attacks have been developed against some
rare elliptic curves having special algebraic structures,
and <br>
the amount of computer power available to attackers has
predictably increased, but typical elliptic curves require
just as much computer power to break today as they required
<br>
twenty years ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IEEE P1363 standardized
elliptic-curve cryptography in the late 1990s, including a
stringent list of security criteria for elliptic curves.
NIST used the IEEE P1363 criteria to <br>
select fifteen specific elliptic curves at five different
security levels. In 2005, NSA issued a new
&rsquo;&rsquo;Suite B&rsquo;&rsquo; standard, recommending
the NIST elliptic curves (at two specific <br>
security levels) for all public-key cryptography and
withdrawing previous recommendations of RSA.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curvetun uses a particular
elliptic curve, Curve25519, introduced in the following
paper: Daniel J. Bernstein, &rsquo;&rsquo;Curve25519: new
Diffie-Hellman speed records,&rsquo;&rsquo; pages 207-228 in
<br>
Proceedings of PKC 2006, edited by Moti Yung, Yevgeniy
Dodis, Aggelos Kiayias, and Tal Malkin, Lecture Notes in
Computer Science 3958, Springer, 2006, ISBN
3-540-33851-9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This elliptic curve follows all
of the standard IEEE P1363 security criteria. It also
follows new recommendations that achieve
&rsquo;&rsquo;side-channel immunity&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;twist security&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
while improving speed. What this means is that secure
implementations of Curve25519 are considerably simpler and
faster than secure implementations of, for example, NIST
P-256; <br>
there are fewer opportunities for implementors to make
mistakes that compromise security, and mistakes are more
easily caught by reviewers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An attacker who spends a billion
dollars on special-purpose chips to attack Curve25519, using
the best attacks available today, has about 1 chance in
1000000000000000000000000000 <br>
of breaking Curve25519 after a year of computation. One
could achieve similar levels of security with 3000-bit RSA,
but encryption and authentication with 3000-bit RSA are not
<br>
nearly fast enough to handle tunnel traffic and would
require much more space in network packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP HOWTO <br>
If you have not run curvetun before, you need to do an
initial setup once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, make sure that the
servers and clients clocks are periodically synced, for
example, by running an NTP daemon. This is necessary to
protect against replay attacks. Also, <br>
make sure you have read and write access to /dev/net/tun.
You should not run curvetun as root! Then, after you have
assured this, the first step is to generate keys and config
<br>
files. On both the client and server do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curvetun -k</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are asked for a user name.
You can use an email address or whatever suits you. Here, we
assume you have entered &rsquo;mysrv1&rsquo; on the server
and &rsquo;myclient1&rsquo; on the client side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, all necessary files have
been created under ~/.curvetun. Files include
&acirc;priv.key&acirc;, &acirc;pub.key&acirc;,
&acirc;username&acirc;, &acirc;clients&acirc; and
&acirc;servers&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;clients&acirc; and
&acirc;servers&acirc; are empty at the beginning and need to
be filled. The &acirc;clients&acirc; file is meant for the
server, so that it knows what clients are allowed to
connect. The <br>
&acirc;servers&acirc; file is for the client, where it can
select curvetun servers to connect to. Both files are kept
very simple, so that a single configuration line per client
or server is <br>
sufficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The client needs to export its
public key data for the server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curvetun -x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where it prints a string in the
following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11
<br>
_______/
_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
<br>
username 32 byte public key for &rsquo;myclient1&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This line is transferred to the
server admin (yes, we assume a manual on-site key exchange
scenario where, for example, the admin sets up server and
clients), where the admin <br>
then adds this entry into his
&rsquo;&rsquo;clients&rsquo;&rsquo; file like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server$ echo
&quot;myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:&quot;
&quot;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11&quot;
&gt;&gt; ~/.curvetun/clients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server admin can check if
the server has registered it properly as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server$ curvetun -C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which prints all parsed clients
from &rsquo;&rsquo;~/.curvetun/clients&rsquo;&rsquo;. This
process could easily be automated or scripted with, for
example, Perl and LDAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, the client
&rsquo;&rsquo;myclient1&rsquo;&rsquo; is known to the
server; that completes the server configuration. The next
step is to tell the client where it needs to connect to the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We assume in this example that
the tunnel server has a public IP address, e.g. 1.2.3.4,
runs on port 6666 and uses UDP as a carrier protocol. In
case you are behind NAT, you can <br>
use curvetun&rsquo;s &rsquo;&rsquo;--stun&rsquo;&rsquo;
option for starting the server, to obtain your mapping.
However, in this example we continue with 1.2.3.4 and 6666,
UDP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, the server needs to
export its key to the client, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server$ curvetun -x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where it prints a string in the
following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysrv1;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22
<br>
____/
_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
<br>
username 32 byte public key for &rsquo;mysrv1&rsquo; <br>
^-- you need this public key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, you now have the server IP
address, server port, server transport protocol and the
server&rsquo;s public key at hand. On the client side it can
be put all together in the config <br>
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client$ echo
&quot;myfirstserver;1.2.3.4;6666;udp;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:&quot;
&quot;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:&quot;
&quot;22:22&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.curvetun/servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The client can check its config
using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client$ curvetun -S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then we start the server
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server$ curvetun -s -p 6666 -u
<br>
server# ifconfig curves0 up <br>
server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, we start the client
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client$ curvetun
-c=myfirstserver <br>
client# ifconfig curvec0 up <br>
client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, client-side information,
errors, or warnings will appear in syslog! By now we should
be able to ping the server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client$ ping 10.0.0.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s it! Routing
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server side&rsquo;s public IP on
eth0 is, for example, 1.2.3.4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server$ ... start curvetun
server ... <br>
server# ifconfig curves0 up <br>
server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24 <br>
server# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward <br>
server# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
<br>
server# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o curves0 -m state
--state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT <br>
server# iptables -A FORWARD -i curves0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client side&rsquo;s IP on eth0
is, for example, 5.6.7.8:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client$ ... start curvetun
client ... <br>
client# ... lookup your default gateway (e.g. via route,
here: 5.6.7.9) ... <br>
client# ifconfig curvec0 up <br>
client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24 <br>
client# route add -net 1.2.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw
5.6.7.9 dev eth0 <br>
client# route add default gw 10.0.0.1 <br>
client# route del default gw 5.6.7.9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That should be it, happy
browsing and emailing via curvetun tunnels!</p>
