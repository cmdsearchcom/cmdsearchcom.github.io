<p>checkpassword.login(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
checkpassword.login(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
checkpassword - check a password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
checkpassword prog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
checkpassword reads descriptor 3 through end of file and
then closes descriptor 3. There must be at most 512 bytes of
data before end of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information supplied on
descriptor 3 is a login name terminated by , a password
terminated by , a timestamp terminated by , and possibly
more data. There are no other <br>
restrictions on the form of the login name, password, and
timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the password is unacceptable,
checkpassword exits 1. If checkpassword is misused, it may
instead exit 2. If there is a temporary problem checking the
password, checkpassword <br>
exits 111.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the password is acceptable,
checkpassword runs prog. prog consists of one or more
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBLE TOOLS <br>
There are other tools that offer the same interface as
checkpassword. Applications that use checkpassword are
encouraged to take the checkpassword name as an argument, so
that <br>
they can be used with different tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these tools do not
follow the getopt(3) interface. Optional features are
controlled through (1) the tool name and (2) environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE PASSWORD DATABASE <br>
checkpassword checks the login name and password against
/etc/passwd, using the operating system&rsquo;s getpwnam(3)
and crypt(3) functions, supplemented by getspnam. It rejects
<br>
accounts with empty passwords. It ignores the timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other checkpassword-compatible
tools have different interpretations of login names,
passwords, and timestamps. Both the login name and the
password should be treated as secrets <br>
by the application calling checkpassword; the only
distinction is for administrative convenience. The timestamp
should include any other information that the password is
based <br>
on; for example, the challenge in a challenge-response
system such as APOP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: getpwnam is inherently
unreliable. It fails to distinguish between temporary errors
and nonexistent users. Future versions of getpwnam(3) should
return ETXTBSY to <br>
indicate temporary errors and ESRCH to indicate nonexistent
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROCESS-STATE CHANGES <br>
Before invoking prog, checkpassword sets up $USER, $HOME,
$SHELL, its supplementary groups, its gid, its uid, and its
working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other checkpassword-compatible
tools may make different changes to the process state. It is
crucial for these effects to be documented; different
applications have different <br>
requirements.</p>
