<p>WICD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual WICD(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Wicd - Wired and Wireless Network Connection Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEORY OF OPERATION <br>
Wicd is designed to give the user as much control over
behavior of network connections as possible. Every network,
both wired and wireless, has its own profile with its own
con&acirc; <br>
figuration options and connection behavior. Wicd will try to
automatically connect only to networks the user specifies it
should try, with a preference first to a wired network, <br>
then to wireless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For wired connections, users
have many options for determining what network settings to
use. Wicd allows creation of an unlimited number of wired
profiles, each of which has its <br>
own unique settings. The user can choose to automatically
connect to a selected default profile, choose a profile from
a pop-up window every time wicd connects, or have wicd <br>
automatically choose the last profile used to manually
connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For wireless connections, users
can select any number of wireless networks to automatically
connect; wicd will choose the one with the highest signal
strength to try to connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user chooses, wicd will
try to automatically reconnect when it detects that a
connection is lost. If the last known connection state is
wired, wicd will first try to <br>
reconnect to the wired network, and if it is not available,
wicd will try any available wireless networks which have
automatic connection enabled. If the last known connection
<br>
state is wireless, wicd will first try to reconnect to the
previously connected network (even if that network does not
have automatic connection enabled), and should that fail,
<br>
it will try both a wired connection and any available
wireless networks which have automatic connection
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wicd uses built-in linux
wireless-tools, such as ifconfig and iwconfig, to get and
configure network info. There is some flexibility in its use
of DHCP, providing support for <br>
dhclient, dhcpcd, and pump. Wicd uses wpa_supplicant to
handle all wireless encryption settings, and uses a
template-based system to create the configuration files used
by <br>
wpa_supplicant. These templates can be edited, and new
templates can be created by the user and imported into wicd,
allowing connection to networks with uncommon encryption
set&acirc; <br>
tings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRUCTURE <br>
Wicd has two major parts: the daemon, which runs with root
privileges; and the user interface, which runs with normal
user privileges. The two parts run as separate processes
<br>
and make use of D-Bus to communicate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon is responsible for
making and configuring connections, reading and writing
configuration files and logs, and monitoring the connection
status. The daemon&rsquo;s job is <br>
split between two processes: wicd-daemon.py and monitor.py.
All the connection status monitoring, as well as the
auto-reconnection logic, takes place in monitor.py.
Everything <br>
else is done by wicd-daemon.py.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user interface (stored in
wicd-gtk), which is made up of a tray icon, a main GUI
window, and its child dialogs, gets configuration and
network info from the daemon either by <br>
querying it using the methods in the daemon&rsquo;s dbus
interface or by receiving signals emitted from the daemon
over D-Bus. Any configuration changes made in the user
interface are <br>
passed back to the daemon, which actually applies the
changes and writes them to configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the user interface just
queries for connection and configuration info from the
daemon, it is possible to run wicd without the GUI at all.
Also, the daemon is started by <br>
wicd&rsquo;s init script during system startup (before any
user logs in), making it possible to use wicd with
&quot;headless&quot; machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE HINTS <br>
Choosing Alternate Tools <br>
Wicd supports several alternatives regarding the networking
tools on linux. In the &quot;External Programs&quot; tab of
the Preferences menu, you can choose your preferred DHCP
client, <br>
link detection tool, and routing tool if the defaults
aren&rsquo;t suitable for your particular distribution or
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom Scripts <br>
If you need to run any custom commands before or after
connecting to or disconnecting from a network, Wicd supports
this; however, you will need to have a graphical sudo helper
<br>
installed (currently supported are kdesu, gksu, and ktsuss).
Also see /etc/wicd/scripts/ in FILES. <br>
If you do not have a graphical sudo helper installed, you
still have the ability to use custom scripts, but you will
have to set them up manually. See wicd-wired-set&acirc; <br>
tings.conf(5) and/or wicd-wireless-settings.conf(5) for more
information on how to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatically Connecting to
Networks <br>
Wicd uses the BSSID to recognize a particular network (and
thus to decide whether it should automatically connect to
it). If you are on a network that has many different access
<br>
points which all have the same ESSID (many universities have
such networks), there is an option in the &quot;Advanced
Settings&quot; to &quot;Use these settings for all networks
sharing this <br>
essid.&quot; With this option enabled, Wicd will autoconnect
to that network, regardless of which node it sees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/wicd/manager-settings.conf <br>
This file contains global settings for Wicd. <br>
See this file&rsquo;s own man page for more information
about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/wicd/wired-settings.conf
<br>
This file contains settings related to the wired interface.
<br>
See this file&rsquo;s own man page for more information
about it.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/wicd/wireless-settings.conf
<br>
This file contains settings related to the wireless
interface. <br>
See this file&rsquo;s own man page for more information
about it.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/wicd/dhclient.conf.template
<br>
This is used to replace /etc/dhclient.conf during Wicd
activity, if you&rsquo;re using dhclient(1) as DHCP client.
See dhclient.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/wicd/encryption/templates/
<br>
This directory contains various templates for encrypted
(WEP, WPA, etcetera) connections. If none of them fit your
needs, you may create your own and add it to this directory.
<br>
If you do this, please contact the authors (see below) of
Wicd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/wicd/scripts/ <br>
Dropping a script in the relevant directory will cause it to
be executed when the specified event is preformed upon
connection or disconnect from or to any network. Please note
<br>
that pre/post disconnect scripts may be executed multiple
times on already-disconnected interfaces. <br>
The scripts will be passed different parameters, depending
if Wicd is acting on a wired or a wireless network. In the
former case, &quot;wired wired wired&quot; will be passed
(three <br>
times, just for compatibility with the wireless case). If
Wicd is acting on a wireless network, it will pass
&quot;wireless ESSID BSSID&quot; to the script. <br>
Available directories are: <br>
/etc/wicd/scripts/predisconnect <br>
/etc/wicd/scripts/postdisconnect <br>
/etc/wicd/scripts/preconnect <br>
/etc/wicd/scripts/postconnect</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/wicd/configurations/
<br>
This directory contains individual configuration files for
each encrypted network you set up in Wicd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/ <br>
This directory contains logfiles of Wicd&rsquo;s activity.
Please refer to the log if you are having connection or
other problems.</p>
