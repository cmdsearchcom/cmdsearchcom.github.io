<b>Wicd</b> - Wired and Wireless Network Connection Manager

Wicd is designed to give the user as much control over behavior of network
  connections as possible. Every network, both wired and wireless, has its own
  profile with its own configuration options and connection behavior. Wicd will
  try to automatically connect only to networks the user specifies it should
  try, with a preference first to a wired network, then to wireless.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For wired connections, users have many options for determining what network
  settings to use. Wicd allows creation of an unlimited number of wired
  profiles, each of which has its own unique settings. The user can choose to
  automatically connect to a selected default profile, choose a profile from a
  pop-up window every time wicd connects, or have wicd automatically choose the
  last profile used to manually connect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For wireless connections, users can select any number of wireless networks to
  automatically connect; wicd will choose the one with the highest signal
  strength to try to connect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the user chooses, wicd will try to automatically reconnect when it detects
  that a connection is lost. If the last known connection state is wired, wicd
  will first try to reconnect to the wired network, and if it is not available,
  wicd will try any available wireless networks which have automatic connection
  enabled. If the last known connection state is wireless, wicd will first try
  to reconnect to the previously connected network (even if that network does
  not have automatic connection enabled), and should that fail, it will try both
  a wired connection and any available wireless networks which have automatic
  connection enabled.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Wicd uses built-in linux wireless-tools, such as ifconfig and iwconfig, to get
  and configure network info. There is some flexibility in its use of DHCP,
  providing support for dhclient, dhcpcd, and pump. Wicd uses wpa_supplicant to
  handle all wireless encryption settings, and uses a template-based system to
  create the configuration files used by wpa_supplicant. These templates can be
  edited, and new templates can be created by the user and imported into wicd,
  allowing connection to networks with uncommon encryption settings.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="STRUCTURE"><a class="selflink" href="#STRUCTURE">STRUCTURE</a></h1>
Wicd has two major parts: the daemon, which runs with root privileges; and the
  user interface, which runs with normal user privileges. The two parts run as
  separate processes and make use of D-Bus to communicate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The daemon is responsible for making and configuring connections, reading and
  writing configuration files and logs, and monitoring the connection status.
  The daemon's job is split between two processes: wicd-daemon.py and
  monitor.py. All the connection status monitoring, as well as the
  auto-reconnection logic, takes place in monitor.py. Everything else is done by
  wicd-daemon.py.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The user interface (stored in wicd-gtk), which is made up of a tray icon, a main
  GUI window, and its child dialogs, gets configuration and network info from
  the daemon either by querying it using the methods in the daemon's dbus
  interface or by receiving signals emitted from the daemon over D-Bus. Any
  configuration changes made in the user interface are passed back to the
  daemon, which actually applies the changes and writes them to configuration
  files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Since the user interface just queries for connection and configuration info from
  the daemon, it is possible to run wicd without the GUI at all. Also, the
  daemon is started by wicd's init script during system startup (before any user
  logs in), making it possible to use wicd with &quot;headless&quot; machines.

<b>Choosing Alternate Tools</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Wicd supports several alternatives regarding the networking tools on linux. In
  the &quot;External Programs&quot; tab of the Preferences menu, you can choose
  your preferred DHCP client, link detection tool, and routing tool if the
  defaults aren't suitable for your particular distribution or system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Custom Scripts</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to run any custom commands before or after connecting to or
  disconnecting from a network, Wicd supports this; however, you will need to
  have a graphical sudo helper installed (currently supported are kdesu, gksu,
  and ktsuss). Also see /etc/wicd/scripts/ in FILES.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If you do not have a graphical sudo helper installed, you still have the ability
  to use custom scripts, but you will have to set them up manually. See
  wicd-wired-settings.conf(5) and/or wicd-wireless-settings.conf(5) for more
  information on how to do so.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Automatically Connecting to Networks</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Wicd uses the BSSID to recognize a particular network (and thus to decide
  whether it should automatically connect to it). If you are on a network that
  has many different access points which all have the same ESSID (many
  universities have such networks), there is an option in the &quot;Advanced
  Settings&quot; to &quot;Use these settings for all networks sharing this
  essid.&quot; With this option enabled, Wicd will autoconnect to that network,
  regardless of which node it sees.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
<b>/etc/wicd/manager-settings.conf</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This file contains global settings for Wicd.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
See this file's own man page for more information about it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/etc/wicd/wired-settings.conf</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This file contains settings related to the wired interface.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
See this file's own man page for more information about it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/etc/wicd/wireless-settings.conf</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This file contains settings related to the wireless interface.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
See this file's own man page for more information about it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/etc/wicd/dhclient.conf.template</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This is used to replace /etc/dhclient.conf during Wicd activity, if you're using
  dhclient(1) as DHCP client. See dhclient.conf(5) for more information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/etc/wicd/encryption/templates/</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This directory contains various templates for encrypted (WEP, WPA, etcetera)
  connections. If none of them fit your needs, you may create your own and add
  it to this directory. If you do this, please contact the authors (see below)
  of Wicd.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/etc/wicd/scripts/</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Dropping a script in the relevant directory will cause it to be executed when
  the specified event is preformed upon connection or disconnect from or to any
  network. Please note that pre/post disconnect scripts may be executed multiple
  times on already-disconnected interfaces.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The scripts will be passed different parameters, depending if Wicd is acting on
  a wired or a wireless network. In the former case, &quot;wired wired
  wired&quot; will be passed (three times, just for compatibility with the
  wireless case). If Wicd is acting on a wireless network, it will pass
  &quot;wireless ESSID BSSID&quot; to the script.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Available directories are:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
/etc/wicd/scripts/predisconnect
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
/etc/wicd/scripts/postdisconnect
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
/etc/wicd/scripts/preconnect

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/var/lib/wicd/configurations/</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This directory contains individual configuration files for each encrypted
  network you set up in Wicd.

<b>/var/log/</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This directory contains logfiles of Wicd's activity. Please refer to the log if
  you are having connection or other problems.
