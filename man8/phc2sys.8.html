<p>PHC2SYS(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual PHC2SYS(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
phc2sys - synchronize two or more clocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
phc2sys -a [ -r ] [ -r ] [ options ] <br>
phc2sys [ -d pps-device ] [ -s device ] [ -c device ] [ -O
offset ] [ -w ] [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
phc2sys is a program which synchronizes two or more clocks
in the system. Typically, it is used to synchronize the
system clock to a PTP hardware clock (PHC), which itself is
<br>
synchronized by the ptp4l(8) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -a option, the clocks
to synchronize are fetched from the running ptp4l daemon and
the direction of synchronization automatically follows
changes of the PTP port states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manual configuration is also
possible. When using manual configuration, two
synchronization modes are supported, one uses a pulse per
second (PPS) signal provided by the source <br>
clock and the other mode reads time from the source clock
directly. Some clocks can be used in both modes, the mode
which will synchronize the slave clock with better accuracy
<br>
depends on hardware and driver implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Read the clocks to synchronize from running ptp4l and
follow changes in the port states, adjusting the
synchronization direction automatically. The system clock
<br>
(CLOCK_REALTIME) is not synchronized, unless the -r option
is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Only valid together with the
-a option. Instructs phc2sys to also synchronize the system
clock (CLOCK_REALTIME). By default, the system clock is not
considered as a possi&acirc; <br>
ble time source. If you want the system clock to be eligible
to become a time source, specify the -r option twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d pps-device <br>
Specify the PPS device of the master clock (e.g. /dev/pps0).
With this option the PPS synchronization mode is used
instead of the direct mode. As the PPS signal does not <br>
specify time and only marks start of a second, the slave
clock should be already close to the correct time before
phc2sys is started or the -s option should be used too. <br>
With the -s option the PPS signal of the master clock is
enabled automatically, otherwise it has to be enabled before
phc2sys is started (e.g. by running echo 1 &gt; <br>
/sys/class/ptp/ptp0/pps_enable). This option can be used
only with the system clock as the slave clock. Not
compatible with the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s device <br>
Specify the master clock by device (e.g. /dev/ptp0) or
interface (e.g. eth0) or by name (e.g. CLOCK_REALTIME for
the system clock). When this option is used together with
<br>
the -d option, the master clock is used only to correct the
offset by whole number of seconds, which cannot be fixed
with PPS alone. Not compatible with the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface <br>
Performs the exact same function as -s for compatibility
reasons. Previously enabled specifying master clock by
network interface. However, this can now be done using -s
<br>
and this option is no longer necessary. As such it has been
deprecated, and should no longer be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c device <br>
Specify the slave clock by device (e.g. /dev/ptp1) or
interface (e.g. eth1) or by name. The default is
CLOCK_REALTIME (the system clock). Not compatible with the
-a <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E servo <br>
Specify which clock servo should be used. Valid values are
pi for a PI controller, linreg for an adaptive controller
using linear regression, and ntpshm for the NTP SHM <br>
reference clock to allow another process to synchronize the
local clock. The default is pi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P kp Specify the proportional
constant of the PI controller. The default is 0.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I ki Specify the integral
constant of the PI controller. The default is 0.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S step <br>
Specify the step threshold of the servo. It is the maximum
offset that the servo corrects by changing the clock
frequency instead of stepping the clock. The clock is <br>
stepped on start regardless of the option if the offset is
larger than 20 microseconds (unless the -F option is used).
It&rsquo;s specified in seconds. The value of 0.0 disables
<br>
stepping after the start. The default is 0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F step <br>
Specify the step threshold applied only on the first update.
It is the maximum offset that is corrected by adjusting
clock. It&rsquo;s specified in seconds. The value of 0.0
<br>
disables stepping on start. The default is 0.00002 (20
microseconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R update-rate <br>
Specify the slave clock update rate when running in the
direct synchronization mode. The default is 1 per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N phc-num <br>
Specify the number of master clock readings per one slave
clock update. Only the fastest reading is used to update the
slave clock, this is useful to minimize the error <br>
caused by random delays in scheduling and bus utilization.
The default is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O offset <br>
Specify the offset between the slave and master times in
seconds. Not compatible with the -a option. See TIME SCALE
USAGE below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L freq-limit <br>
The maximum allowed frequency offset between uncorrected
clock and the system monotonic clock in parts per billion
(ppb). This is used as a sanity check of the synchro&acirc;
<br>
nized clock. When a larger offset is measured, a warning
message will be printed and the servo will be reset. When
set to 0, the sanity check is disabled. The default is <br>
200000000 (20%).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M segment <br>
The number of the SHM segment used by ntpshm servo. The
default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u summary-updates <br>
Specify the number of clock updates included in summary
statistics. The statistics include offset root mean square
(RMS), maximum absolute offset, frequency offset mean <br>
and standard deviation, and mean of the delay in clock
readings and standard deviation. The units are nanoseconds
and parts per billion (ppb). If zero, the individual
sam&acirc; <br>
ples are printed instead of the statistics. The messages are
printed at the LOG_INFO level. The default is 0
(disabled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Wait until ptp4l is in a
synchronized state. If the -O option is not used, also keep
the offset between the slave and master times updated
according to the currentUtcOff&acirc; <br>
set value obtained from ptp4l and the direction of the clock
synchronization. Not compatible with the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n domain-number <br>
Specify the domain number used by ptp4l. The default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x When a leap second is
announced, don&rsquo;t apply it in the kernel by stepping
the clock, but let the servo correct the one-second offset
slowly by changing the clock frequency <br>
(unless the -S option is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z uds-address <br>
Specifies the address of the server&rsquo;s UNIX domain
socket. The default is /var/run/ptp4l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l print-level <br>
Set the maximum syslog level of messages which should be
printed or sent to the system logger. The default is 6
(LOG_INFO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Print messages to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Don&rsquo;t send messages to
the system logger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints the software version
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME SCALE USAGE <br>
Ptp4l uses either PTP time scale or UTC (Coordinated
Universal Time) time scale. PTP time scale is continuous and
shifted against UTC by a few tens of seconds as PTP time
scale <br>
does not apply leap seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In hardware time stamping mode,
ptp4l announces use of PTP time scale and PHC is used for
the stamps. That means PHC must follow PTP time scale while
system clock follows UTC. <br>
Time offset between these two is maintained by phc2sys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Phc2sys acquires the offset
value either by reading it from ptp4l when -a or -w is in
effect or from command line when -O is supplied. Failure to
maintain the correct offset can <br>
result in local system clock being off some seconds to
domain master system clock when in slave mode, or incorect
PTP time announced to the network in case the host is the
domain <br>
master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Synchronize time automatically according to the current
ptp4l state, synchronize the system clock to the remote
master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phc2sys -a -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above, but when the host
becomes the domain master, synchronize time in the domain to
its system clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phc2sys -a -rr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host is a domain master, PTP
clock is synchronized to system clock and the time offset is
obtained from ptp4l. Phc2sys waits for ptp4l to get at least
one port in master or <br>
slave mode before starting the synchronization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phc2sys -c /dev/ptp0 -s
CLOCK_REALTIME -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above, time offset is
provided on command line and phc2sys does not wait for
ptp4l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phc2sys -c /dev/ptp0 -s
CLOCK_REALTIME -O 35</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host is in slave mode,
system clock is synchronized from PTP clock, phc2sys waits
for ptp4l and the offset is set automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phc2sys -s /dev/ptp0 -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above, PTP clock id is
read from the network interface, the offset is provided on
command line phc2sys does not wait.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phc2sys -s eth0 -O -35</p>
