<p>tcpsvd(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual tcpsvd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcpsvd - TCP/IP service daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcpsvd [-hpEvv] [-c n] [-C n:msg] [-b n] [-u user] [-l name]
[-i dir|-x cdb] [ -t sec] host port prog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tcpsvd creates a TCP/IP socket, binds it to the address
host:port, and listens on the socket for incoming
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On each incoming connection,
tcpsvd conditionally runs a program, with standard input
reading from the socket, and standard output writing to the
socket, to handle this connec&acirc; <br>
tion. tcpsvd keeps listening on the socket for new
connections, and can handle multiple connections
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpsvd optionally checks for
special instructions depending on the IP address or hostname
of the client that initiated the connection, see
ipsvd-instruct(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
host host either is a hostname, or a dotted-decimal IP
address, or 0. If host is 0, tcpsvd accepts connections to
any local IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port tcpsvd accepts connections
to host:port. port may be a name from /etc/services or a
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prog prog consists of one or
more arguments. For each connection, tcpsvd normally runs
prog, with file descriptor 0 reading from the network, and
file descriptor 1 writing to <br>
the network. By default it also sets up TCP-related
environment variables, see tcp-environ(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i dir read instructions for
handling new connections from the instructions directory
dir. See ipsvd-instruct(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x cdb read instructions for
handling new connections from the constant database cdb. The
constant database normally is created from an instructions
directory by running ipsvd- <br>
cdb(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t sec timeout. This option only
takes effect if the -i option is given. While checking the
instructions directory, check the time of last access of the
file that matches the <br>
clients address or hostname if any, discard and remove the
file if it wasn&rsquo;t accessed within the last sec
seconds; tcpsvd does not discard or remove a file if the
user&rsquo;s <br>
write permission is not set, for those files the timeout is
disabled. Default is 0, which means that the timeout is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l name <br>
local hostname. Do not look up the local hostname in DNS,
but use name as hostname. This option must be set if tcpsvd
listens on port 53 to avoid loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u [:]user[:group] <br>
drop permissions. Set uid and gid to the user&rsquo;s uid
and gid, as found in /etc/passwd, before running prog. If
user is followed by a colon and a group, set the gid to <br>
group&rsquo;s gid, as found in /etc/group, instead of
user&rsquo;s gid. If group consists of a colon-separated
list of group names, set the group ids of all listed groups.
If user <br>
is prefixed with a colon, the user and all group arguments
are interpreted as uid and gids respectively, and not looked
up in the password or group file. All supplemen&acirc; <br>
tary groups are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c n concurrency. Handle up to n
connections simultaneously. Default is 30. If there are n
connections active, tcpsvd defers acceptance of a new
connection until an active <br>
connection is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C n[:msg] <br>
per host concurrency. Allow only up to n connections from
the same IP address simultaneously. If there are n active
connections from one IP address, new incoming connec&acirc;
<br>
tions from this IP address are closed immediately. If n is
followed by :msg, the message msg is written to the client
if possible, before closing the connection. By <br>
default msg is empty. See ipsvd-instruct(5) for supported
escape sequences in msg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each accepted connection,
the current per host concurrency is available through the
environment variable TCPCONCURRENCY. n and msg can be
overwritten by ipsvd(7) <br>
instructions, see ipsvd-instruct(5). By default tcpsvd
doesn&rsquo;t keep track of connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Look up the client&rsquo;s
hostname in DNS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p paranoid. After looking up
the client&rsquo;s hostname in DNS, look up the IP addresses
in DNS for that hostname, and forget about the hostname if
none of the addresses match <br>
the client&rsquo;s IP address. You should set this option if
you use hostname based instructions. The -p option implies
the -h option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b n backlog. Allow a backlog of
approximately n TCP SYNs. On some systems n is silently
limited. Default is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E no special environment. Do
not set up TCP-related environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose. Print verbose
messsages to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv more verbose. Print more
verbose messages to standard output.</p>
