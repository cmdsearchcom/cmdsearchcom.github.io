<p>MIMEDEFANG-MULTIPLEXOR(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
MIMEDEFANG-MULTIPLEXOR(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mimedefang-multiplexor - Process pool controller for mail
filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mimedefang-multiplexor [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mimedefang-multiplexor manages a pool of Perl processes for
scanning e-mail. It is designed to work in conjunction with
mimedefang(8) and mimedefang.pl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mimedefang-multiplexor opens a
UNIX-domain socket and listens for requests for work from
mimedefang. As requests come in, mimedefang-multiplexor
creates Perl processes as needed <br>
to scan mail. The Perl processes are not killed when
scanning is completed, but continue to run in a loop. Perl
processes are re-used for subsequent e-mail messages. This
<br>
eliminates the large overhead of starting a new Perl process
for each incoming message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid memory leaks, the Perl
processes are killed after they have handled some number of
scans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-U user <br>
Runs the multiplexor as user rather than root. This option
is mandatory, and must match the -U option supplied to
mimedefang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m minSlaves <br>
The minimum number of Perl processes to keep running at all
times. The default is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x maxSlaves <br>
The maximum number of Perl processes to run simultaneously.
If a request comes in and all processes are busy, a
temporary failure is signalled to the SMTP peer. The <br>
default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r maxRequests <br>
The maximum number of requests a given process handles
before it is killed and a replacement started. The default
is 500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i idleTime <br>
The idle time in seconds after which to kill of excess Perl
processes. That is, if the process is idle for longer than
this time, and there are more than minSlaves run&acirc; <br>
ning, the process is killed. Note that this is implemented
as a timer which ticks every idleTime seconds; therefore,
processes may be idle for up to twice this time <br>
before they are killed. The default for idleTime is 300
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b busyTime <br>
The longest a Perl process is allowed to spend scanning an
e-mail before it is declared hung up and killed. The default
is 120 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z This option specifies that
the multiplexor should accept and process &quot;status
updates&quot; from busy slaves. Note that this consumes one
extra file descriptor per slave, plus <br>
a small amount of CPU time per status update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cmdTime <br>
The timeout for communication between mimedefang-multiplexor
and mimedefang, or between mimedefang-multiplexor and a Perl
scanning process. The default is 10 seconds. <br>
This timeout should be kept quite short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w waitTime <br>
When mimedefang-multiplexor starts the initial slaves, or
needs to bring the number of running slaves up to the number
defined by the -m option, it does not start all the <br>
slaves at once, because this could overload your server.
Instead, it starts one slave every waitTime seconds. The
default value for waitTime is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W waitTime <br>
If you use this option, mimedefang-multiplexor will never
activate a slave until waitTime seconds have elapsed since
the last slave activation. This could result in mail <br>
being tempfailed if slave activations do not keep pace with
incoming mail. However, it may be preferable to tempfail
mail rather than allow the load on your server to <br>
spike up too quickly. The default value for this option is
0, meaning that mimedefang-multiplexor will start slaves as
quickly as necessary to keep up with incoming mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z spooldir <br>
Set the spool directory to spooldir. If this option is
omitted, the spool directory defaults to
/var/spool/MIMEDefang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s pathName <br>
The UNIX-domain socket on which mimedefang-multiplexor
listens for requests. This should be specified as an
absolute pathname. If this option is not supplied, it <br>
defaults to mimedefang-multiplexor.sock under the spool
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a socket <br>
A socket for listening for requests. This is similar to the
-s socket, except that a restricted set of requests are
processed. On this socket, the multiplexor will only <br>
process requests asking for status; it will not accept any
commands to do scanning or that would consume a slave. See
the SOCKET SPECIFICATION section for the format of <br>
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p fileName <br>
Causes mimedefang-multiplexor to write its process-ID (after
becoming a daemon) to the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filter_path <br>
Normally, mimedefang-multiplexor executes a Perl filter
script called mimedefang.pl to scan the e-mail. However, you
can have it execute any program you like by specify&acirc;
<br>
ing the full path to the program with the -f option. This
program must obey the protocol documented in
mimedefang-protocol(7); see that manual page for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -f option does not
specify the &quot;filter&quot; to use with mimedefang.pl;
instead, it specifies the program for mimedefang-multiplexor
to execute. You almost cer&acirc; <br>
tainly should not use this option unless you wish to replace
mimedefang.pl with your own program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F rules_path <br>
Specifies the path to the filter rules. By default,
/etc/mail/mimedefang-filter is used. If you use the -F
option, its value is passed to the underlying Perl filter
pro&acirc; <br>
gram using -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Log certain events, including
the output of the Perl slaves&rsquo; standard-error, using
syslog. Normally, the multiplexor does not log much
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Write debugging information
about event-handling code in
/var/log/mimedefang-event-debug.log. This is only of use to
people debugging mimedefang-multiplexor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R kbytes <br>
Limits the resident-set size of the slave filter processes
to kbytes kilobytes. This limit is not supported on all
operating systems; it is known to work on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M kbytes <br>
Limits the total memory space of slave filter processes to
kbytes kilobytes. This limit is supported on all operating
systems which support the setrlimit(2) system call. <br>
This should include most modern UNIX systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We recommend that you monitor
your slave filter processes and get a feel for how much
memory they use. You should then limit the memory to two or
three times the worst- <br>
case that you have observed. This can help mitigate
denial-of-service attacks which use complicated MIME
messages to force mimedefang.pl to consume lots of
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print usage information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t filename <br>
Log statistical information to filename. See the section
STATISTICS for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Log statistical information
using syslog(2). You may use any -t and -T together, in
which case statistical information is logged in a file and
using syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Flush the statistics file
after every write. Normally, mimedefang-multiplexor does not
flush the file; this is the best choice for minimizing disk
I/O on a busy mail <br>
server. However, if you wish to watch statistics entries in
real-time, you should enable flushing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not fork into the
background and become a daemon. Instead, stay in the
foreground. Useful mainly for debugging or if you have a
supervisory process managing mimede&acirc; <br>
fang-multiplexor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q queue_size <br>
Normally, if all slaves are busy and mimedefang-multiplexor
receives another request, it fails it with the error
&quot;No free slaves.&quot; However, if you use the -q
option, then <br>
up to queue_size requests will be queued. As soon as a slave
becomes free, the queued requests will be handed off in FIFO
order. If the queue is full and another request <br>
comes in, then the request is failed with &quot;No free
slaves&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q queue_timeout <br>
Queued requests should not stay on the queue indefinitely.
If a queued request cannot be processed within queue_timeout
(default 30) seconds of being placed on the queue, <br>
it is failed with a &quot;Queued request timed out&quot;
message. See the section &quot;QUEUEING REQUESTS&quot; for
more discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O sock <br>
Listen on a notification socket for connections from
listeners. mimedefang-multiplexor can inform external
programs of state changes by sending messages over a
notifica&acirc; <br>
tion socket. The external programs connect to this socket
and then listen for notifications. See the section SOCKET
SPECIFICATION for the format of sock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the mimedefang-notify(7) man
page for details of the notification protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N map_sock <br>
Listen on a map socket for Sendmail SOCKETMAP connections.
As of Sendmail 8.13, you can define a Sendmail map type that
talks to a daemon over a socket. mimedefang-mul&acirc; <br>
tiplexor implements that protocol; consult the
mimedefang-filter(5) man page for detils (see the SOCKET
MAPS section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the section SOCKET
SPECIFICATION for the format of map_sock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I backlog <br>
When mimedefang-multiplexor creates a listening socket, it
calculates the &quot;backlog&quot; argument to listen(2)
based on the maximum number of slaves. However, you can
explic&acirc; <br>
itly set this backlog with the -I option. Setting the
backlog to a high value (around 30-50) may help on a very
busy server. If you see mail log messages saying
&quot;MXCom&acirc; <br>
mand: socket: Connection refused&quot; during busy periods,
then that&rsquo;s an indication you need a higher listen
backlog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L interval <br>
Log the slave status every interval seconds. This logs a
line using syslog; the line looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slave status: Stopped=s Idle=i
Busy=b Killed=k Queued=q Msgs=m Activations=a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, &quot;Stopped&quot; is the
number of non-running slaves, &quot;Idle&quot; is the number
of idle slaves, &quot;Busy&quot; is the number of busy
slaves, &quot;Killed&quot; is the number of killed slaves
yet <br>
to be reaped, &quot;Queued&quot; is the number of queued
requests, &quot;Msgs&quot; is the total number of messages
processed since the multiplexor began running, and
&quot;Activations&quot; is the <br>
number of times a Perl process has been started since the
multiplexor began running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you supply an interval of 0
(which is the default), no periodic status logging is
performed. If you supply an interval of less than 5 seconds,
it is silently reset to <br>
5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S facility <br>
Specifies the syslog facility for log messages. The default
is mail. See openlog(3) for a list of valid facilities. You
can use either the short name (&quot;mail&quot;) or long
<br>
name (&quot;LOG_MAIL&quot;) for the facility name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Specifies that the
multiplexor should create an embedded Perl interpreter. This
can improve performance dramatically. But see the section
&quot;EMBEDDING PERL&quot; for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X n Specifies that the
multiplexor should initiate a &quot;tick&quot; request every
n seconds. This causes your filter_tick function (if
defined) to be called. Note that you have no <br>
control over which slave executes filter_tick. If all slaves
are busy when a tick occurs, that tick request is skipped
and a warning message is logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P n Specifies that the
multiplexor should run n tick requests in parallel. Each
tick is run as often as specified with the -X argument. (If
you omit the -P option, then the <br>
multiplexor behaves as if -P 1 had been specified.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run parallel ticks, each
tick is assigned an integer identifying its
&quot;type&quot;. The type ranges from 0 to n-1. While there
may be as many as n tick requests running <br>
at a time, only one tick of each type will be active at any
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y label <br>
Sets the tag used in the multiplexor&rsquo;s syslog messages
to label instead of mimedefang-multiplexor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Normally,
mimedefang-multiplexor uses a umask of 027 when creating
listening sockets. If you would like the sockets to be
readable and writeable by the group as well as <br>
the owner, supply the -G option. This causes the umask to be
007 whenever UNIX-domain sockets are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y n Limits the maximum number
of concurrent recipok checks to n on a per-domain basis. The
value of n can range from 0 (in which case no limit is
applied) to maxSlaves, where <br>
maxSlaves is the argument to the -x option. If n is outside
that range, it is ignored (and no limit is applied.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recipok command ultimately
invokes the filter_recipient function in your filter. If you
are doing recipient verification against servers that may be
slow or unreli&acirc; <br>
able, you can use the -y option to limit the number of
concurrent recipient verifications per domain. That way, if
one domain&rsquo;s server becomes very slow, it won&rsquo;t
consume <br>
all available slaves for recipient verification. Instead,
its RCPT commands will be tempfailed and there will be
slaves available to handle RCPT commands for other <br>
domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKET SPECIFICATION <br>
The -a, -N and -O options take a socket as an argument. This
socket can be specified as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/path/to/socket <br>
A UNIX-domain socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inet:portnum <br>
A TCP socket bound to port portnum, but which accepts
connections only from the IPv4 loopback address
(127.0.0.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inet_any:portnum <br>
A TCP socket bound to port portnum which will accept
connections from any address. Use inet_any with caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inet6:portnum <br>
A TCP socket bound to port portnum listening on the IPv6
loopback address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inet6_any:portnum <br>
A TCP socket bound to port portnum listening on the IPv6
wildcard address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUEUEING REQUESTS <br>
Normally, if all slaves are busy, any additional requests
are failed immediately. However, the -q and -Q options allow
you to queue requests for a short amount of time. This <br>
facility is intended to gracefully handle a temporary
overload; most of the time, your queue should be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because mimedefang checks the
number of free slaves when a connection is opened and fails
the connection if there are no free slaves, the intent of
the queue is to allow SMTP <br>
transactions that are already underway to continue if there
is a slight overload. Any new connections will be failed if
all slaves are busy, but existing connections are allowed
<br>
to continue. Queuing requests may improve throughput on
extremely busy servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you supply the -q
option to mimedefang, then even new connections are allowed
to queue. This may improve throughput by keeping the slave
utilization higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -R option to mimedefang can
be used to reserve a specified number of slaves for
connections from the loopback address. Using the -R option
has the side-effect of permitting <br>
new connections from the loopback address to queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMBEDDING PERL <br>
Normally, when mimedefang-multiplexor activates a slave, it
forks and execs mimedefang.pl. However, if the multiplexor
was compiled with embedded Perl support, and you supply <br>
the -E command-line option, the multiplexor works like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 It creates an embedded Perl
interpreter, and sources mimedefang.pl with a special
command-line argument telling it to read the filter, but not
to enter the main loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Each time a slave is
activated, the multiplexor calls fork() and runs the
mimedefang.pl main loop. This invokes filter_initialize and
then runs the main loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms (for example,
Red Hat Linux 7.3 with Perl 5.6.1), it is not safe to
destroy and recreate a Perl interpreter without causing a
memory leak. On those platforms, <br>
if you attempt to reread the filter file (by sending the
multiplexor a HUP signal or reread command), the filter will
not be re-read, and a message will be logged to syslog. On
<br>
those platforms, you must kill and restart MIMEDefang if you
change the filter file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On most platforms, however, a
filter reread is accomplished by destroying and re-creating
the embedded interpreter, re-sourcing mimedefang.pl and
killing slaves as soon as they <br>
are idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATISTICS <br>
With the -t option, mimedefang-multiplexor logs certain
events to a file. This file can be post-processed to gather
statistics about the multiplexor. You can use it to tune the
<br>
number of slaves you run, adjust timeouts, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line of the file looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYY/MM/DD:HH:MM:SS timestamp
event key=val key=val...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, YYYY/MM/DD:HH:MM:SS is the
local time of day. Timestamp is the number of seconds since
January 1, 1970. Event is the name of an event. The valid
events are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartSlave <br>
A slave process has been started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KillSlave <br>
A slave process has been killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReapSlave <br>
A dead slave process has been reaped. It is possible to have
a ReapSlave event without a previous KillSlave event if the
slave process terminated abnormally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartFilter <br>
A slave process has begun filtering an e-mail message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EndFilter <br>
A slave process has finished filtering an e-mail
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible keys in the
key=value pairs are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slave=n <br>
The slave involved in the event. Every slave is identified
by a small integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nslaves=n <br>
The total number of running slaves immediately after the
event happened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbusy=n <br>
The number of busy slaves (slaves which are processing an
e-mail message) immediately after the event happened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reason=&quot;string&quot; <br>
The reason for a StartSlave or KillSlave event. (Present
only for these events.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numRequests=n <br>
The number of e-mails processed by the slave. Present only
for an EndFilter event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you send the
mimedefang-multiplexor process a SIGHUP signal (kill -1
pid), it closes and reopens the statistics file. This is
useful during log file rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you send the
mimedefang-multiplexor process a SIGINT signal (kill -INT
pid), it terminates all active-but-idle slaves. Also, any
active-and-busy slaves terminate as soon as <br>
they finish filtering the current message. This is useful to
force a reread of the filter rules file without stopping and
restarting Sendmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you send the
mimedefang-multiplexor process a SIGTERM signal (kill pid),
it terminates all slaves and exits immediately.</p>
