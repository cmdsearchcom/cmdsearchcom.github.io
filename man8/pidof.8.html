<p>PIDOF(8) Linux System Administrator&rsquo;s Manual
PIDOF(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pidof -- find the process ID of a running program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pidof [-s] [-c] [-n] [-x] [-m] [-o omitpid[,omitpid..]] [-o
omitpid[,omitpid..]..] program [program..]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Pidof finds the process id&rsquo;s (pids) of the named
programs. It prints those id&rsquo;s on the standard output.
This program is on some systems used in run-level change
scripts, espe&acirc; <br>
cially when the system has a System-V like rc structure. In
that case these scripts are located in /etc/rc?.d, where ?
is the runlevel. If the system has a start-stop-daemon (8)
<br>
program that should be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-s Single shot - this instructs the program to only return
one pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Only return process ids that
are running with the same root directory. This option is
ignored for non-root users, as they will be unable to check
the current root direc&acirc; <br>
tory of processes they do not own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Avoid stat(2) system function
call on all binaries which are located on network based file
systems like NFS. Instead of using this option the the
variable PIDOF_NETFS may <br>
be set and exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Scripts too - this causes the
program to also return process id&rsquo;s of shells running
the named scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o omitpid <br>
Tells pidof to omit processes with that process id. The
special pid %PPID can be used to name the parent process of
the pidof program, in other words the calling shell or <br>
shell script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m When used with -o, will also
omit any processes that have the same argv[0] and argv[1] as
any explicitly omitted process ids. This can be used to
avoid multiple shell <br>
scripts concurrently calling pidof returning each
other&rsquo;s pids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 At least one program was found with the requested
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 No program was found with the
requested name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
pidof is actually the same program as killall5; the program
behaves according to the name under which it is called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When pidof is invoked with a
full pathname to the program it should find the pid of, it
is reasonably safe. Otherwise it is possible that it returns
pids of running programs that <br>
happen to have the same name as the program you&rsquo;re
after but are actually other programs. Note that that the
executable name of running processes is calculated with
readlink(2), <br>
so symbolic links to executables will also match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
shutdown(8), init(8), halt(8), reboot(8), killall5(8)</p>
