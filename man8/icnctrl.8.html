<p>ICNCTRL(8) Linux System Administration ICNCTRL(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
icnctrl - configure ICN ISDN adaptor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
icnctrl [-d Driver-Id] action options ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
icnctrl is used to setup the ICN ISDN device driver and for
downloading the firmware into the ISDN card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of icnctrl makes sense,
if you are using an ICN card only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Driver-Id <br>
selects the S0 interface named by Driver-Id. Driver-Ids are
defined during driver initialisation. See icn(4) for a
description of the syntax to be used for modularised <br>
and monolithic driver versions. This option must be used to
identify the S0 interface if more than one S0 interface is
existent. If a single ICN-2B is used, it may be <br>
omitted. If using more than one card, support for the other
cards is enabled with the add action of icnctrl. Ids may not
start with digits or small x, because these val&acirc; <br>
ues are misinterpreted as numeric parameters by insmod. For
loading the module, always the newest modutils package
should be used to avoid problems during load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following actions may be
given to icnctrl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add port [id1 [id2]] <br>
enables support for an additional card in the driver. If id1
and id2 are missing, adds an ICN-2B with an id given by the
system. with id2 missing, adds an ICN-2B with an <br>
Id given by the user. With both Ids given, adds an ICN-4B
with both Ids given by the user. There is no checking
against port-conflicts. Ports are checked later during <br>
first activation while downloading the firmware and can be
changed at runtime. Ids are checked against conflicts, and
if a conflict happens, replaced by the system in the <br>
same manner as if no Id was supplied. It is not allowed, to
add cards, after a load was done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">io [base-address port] <br>
sets the address of the memory-mapped IO-region and the
port-base. After loading the icn-module into kernel-space,
this command should be used as the very first setup, if <br>
the hardware settings are different from the default
settings below. If both parameters are omitted, prints out
current settings. The default memory address is 0xD0000,
<br>
the default port-base is 0x320. An ICN card uses 4
port-addresses. The memory address is globally used for all
cards (cards are mapped on demand), while each card has its
<br>
own port range. Memory range is 16k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leased on|1|2|off <br>
switches between normal (dialup) and leased-line mode.
Leased-line mode is intended for usage with S64K-lines or -
if both channels are used - for S02. If the second <br>
parameter is 1 , only one channel is enabled. If the second
parameter is 2 or on both channels are enabled. Leased lines
do not have a D-channel. When leased-line mode is <br>
enabled, the driver simulates incoming calls using special
&quot;phone-numbers&quot; for calling and called address
which are generated as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling number: <br>
LEASEDx <br>
where x is the internal slot-number of the S0 interface.
This number starts with 0 for the first S0 interface and is
incremented by one for every S0 inter&acirc; <br>
face configured using the add action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Called number: <br>
x <br>
where x is equal to the channel number of the calling S0
interface starting with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load boot-code firmware
[firmware2] <br>
downloads the firmware into the card and starts operation.
Using this command, after loading the icn-module into
kernel-space the first real access to the hardware is <br>
done. Therefore the io action above, should be used before,
if the hardware settings are different from the default
settings. Usually the images are located in @DATADIR@. <br>
The boot-code is named loadpg.bin. The firmware depends on
the D-channel protocol of the ISDN line. For German
1TR6-lines, the firmware is named pc_1t_ca.bin. For Euro-
<br>
ISDN-lines, it is named pc_eu_ca.bin. When loading an
ICN-4B, two firmware parameters have to be supplied. The
first firmware is used for the upper S0 connector, the
sec&acirc; <br>
ond firmware is used for the lower S0 connector (towards the
card&rsquo;s slot connector).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump is available if the program
is configured using the --enable-dump option only. The
contents of internal driver variables is dumped on
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
@DATADIR@/loadpg.bin <br>
This is the image of the bootstrap loader, which is loaded
first, then loads the firmware into the card&rsquo;s memory
and starts execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@DATADIR@/pc_1t_ca.bin <br>
This is the image of the firmware designed for the German
1TR6 protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@DATADIR@/pc_eu_ca.bin <br>
This is the image of the firmware, designed for Euro
ISDN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read error on boot-code <br>
The file supplied as boot-code has less than 4096 bytes
length or could not be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read error on firmware <br>
The file supplied as firmware has less than 65536 bytes
length or could not be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
No bugs so far.</p>
