<p>COMPARE AND WRITE(8) SG3_UTILS COMPARE AND WRITE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sg_compare_and_write - send the SCSI COMPARE AND WRITE
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sg_compare_and_write [--dpo] [--fua] [--fua_nv] [--help]
--in=IF [--inw=WF] --lba=LBA [--num=NUM] [--quiet]
[--timeout=TO] [--verbose] [--version] [--wrprotect=WP] <br>
[--xferlen=LEN] DEVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Send the SCSI COMPARE AND WRITE command to DEVICE. This
utility reads a compare buffer and a write buffer from
either one or two files. If the --inw=WF option is not given
then <br>
the concatenated compare and write buffers are read from the
file indicated by the --in=IF option. If the --inw=WF option
is given then the compare buffer is read from the file <br>
indicated by the --in=IF while the write buffer is read from
the file indicated by the --inw=WF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those buffers are expected to
each contain NUM blocks of data. The compare starts at at
logical block address LBA on the DEVICE and if the
comparison fails (i.e. the provided <br>
compare buffer does not equal at LBA on the DEVICE) then the
COMPARE AND WRITE command finishes with a sense key of
MISCOMPARE. In this case this utility will completes and set
<br>
an exit status of 14 (which happens to be the sense key
value of MISCOMPARE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the comparison succeeds then
the provided write buffer is written to starting at LBA for
NUM blocks on the DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual number of bytes
transferred in the data-out buffer of the COMPARE AND WRITE
command may need to be given by the user with the
--xferlen=LEN option. LEN defaults to (2* <br>
NUM * 512) which is 1024 for the default NUM of 1. If the
block size is other than 512 then the user will need to use
--xferlen=LEN option. If protection information is given
<br>
(indicated by a value of WP other than 0 (the default)) then
for a NUM of 1 LEN should be 1040 . Note that the SCSI READ
CAPACITY command is not checked by this utility (e.g. to
<br>
find the block size).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of the SCSI
COMPARE AND WRITE command requires that the DEVICE implement
the compare and optional write as an uninterrupted series of
actions. Depending on some <br>
other DEVICE settings a verify operation may occur prior to
the compare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a mismatch occurs between
the compare buffer and the blocks starting at LBA read from
the DEVICE the sense buffer containing the MISCOMPARE sense
key causes several messages <br>
to be sent to stderr (including the offset of the first byte
mismatch). To suppress these messages use the --quiet
option. With or without the --quiet option the exit status
will <br>
be set to 14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is defined in SBC-3
whose most recent revision is 35f. SBC-3 and other SCSI
documents can be found at http://www.t10.org .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as
well. The options are arranged in alphabetical order based
on the long option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dpo <br>
Set the DPO bit in the COMPARE AND WRITE CDB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fua <br>
Set the FUA bit in the COMPARE AND WRITE CDB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fua_nv <br>
Set the FUA_NV bit in the COMPARE AND WRITE CDB. This bit
was removed in SBC-3 revision 35d and its position marked as
&quot;reserved&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --in=IF <br>
read data (binary) from file named IF. This will either be
the combined compare and write buffers (when the --inw=WF
option is not given) or just the compare buffer (when <br>
the --inw=WF option is given). If IF is &rsquo;-&rsquo; then
stdin (e.g. a pipe) is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --inw=WF <br>
read data (binary) from file named WF. This will the write
buffer that will become the second half of the data-out
buffer sent to the DEVICE associated with the COMPARE <br>
AND WRITE command. Note that when this option is given then
the --in=IF is expected to hold the associated compare
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lba=LBA <br>
where LBA is the logical block address to start the COMPARE
AND WRITE command. Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed
with &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or has a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --num=NUM <br>
where NUM is the number of blocks, starting at LBA, to read
and compare with the verify instance. And given a match, the
NUM of blocks to write starting LBA. The default <br>
value for NUM is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
suppress the sense buffer messages associated with a
MISCOMPARE sense key that would otherwise be sent to stderr.
Still set the exit status to 14 which is the sense key <br>
value indicating a MISCOMPARE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout=TO <br>
where TO is the command timeout value in seconds. The
default value is 60 seconds. If NUM is large (or zero) a
WRITE SAME command may require considerably more time than
<br>
60 seconds to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
output version string then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wrprotect=WP <br>
set the WRPROTECT field in the cdb to WP. The default value
is 0 which implies no protection information is sent (along
with the user data) by this utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --xferlen=LEN <br>
where LEN is the data out buffer length in byte. It defaults
to (2 * NUM * 512) bytes. If the DEVICE block size is other
than 512 bytes or WP is non-zero (implying addi&acirc; <br>
tional protection information) then this default will be
incorrect; the use must supply the correct value for LEN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Various numeric arguments (e.g. LBA) may include
multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the
&quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status of sg_compare_and_write is 0 when it is
successful. If the compare step fails then the exit status
is 14. For other exit status values see the EXIT STATUS
section <br>
in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this utility
set an exit status of 98 when there was a MISCOMPARE.</p>
