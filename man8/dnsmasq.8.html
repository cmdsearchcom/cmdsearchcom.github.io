<p>DNSMASQ(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual DNSMASQ(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnsmasq [OPTION]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnsmasq is a lightweight DNS, TFTP, PXE, router
advertisement and DHCP server. It is intended to provide
coupled DNS and DHCP service to a LAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and
either answers them from a small, local, cache or forwards
them to a real, recursive, DNS server. It loads the contents
of /etc/hosts so that <br>
local hostnames which do not appear in the global DNS can be
resolved and also answers DNS queries for DHCP configured
hosts. It can also act as the authoritative DNS server for
<br>
one or more domains, allowing local names to appear in the
global DNS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dnsmasq DHCP server supports
static address assignments and multiple networks. It
automatically sends a sensible default set of DHCP options,
and can be configured to send <br>
any desired set of DHCP options, including
vendor-encapsulated options. It includes a secure,
read-only, TFTP server to allow net/PXE boot of DHCP hosts
and also supports BOOTP. <br>
The PXE support is full featured, and includes a proxy mode
which supplies PXE information to clients whilst DHCP
address allocation is done by another server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dnsmasq DHCPv6 server
provides the same set of features as the DHCPv4 server, and
in addition, it includes router advertisements and a neat
feature which allows nameing for <br>
clients which use DHCPv4 and stateless autoconfiguration
only for IPv6 configuration. There is support for doing
address allocation (both DHCPv6 and RA) from subnets which
are <br>
dynamically delegated via DHCPv6 prefix delegation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dnsmasq is coded with small
embedded systems in mind. It aims for the smallest possible
memory footprint compatible with the supported functions,
and allows uneeded functions to <br>
be omitted from the compiled binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Note that in general missing parameters are allowed and
switch off functions, for instance &quot;--pid-file&quot;
disables writing a PID file. On BSD, unless the GNU getopt
library is <br>
linked, the long form of the options does not work on the
command line; it is still recognised in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test Read and syntax check
configuration file(s). Exit with code 0 if all is OK, or a
non-zero code otherwise. Do not start up dnsmasq.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --no-hosts <br>
Don&rsquo;t read the hostnames in /etc/hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --addn-hosts=&lt;file&gt;
<br>
Additional hosts file. Read the specified file as well as
/etc/hosts. If -h is given, read only the specified file.
This option may be repeated for more than one addi&acirc;
<br>
tional hosts file. If a directory is given, then read all
the files contained in that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --expand-hosts <br>
Add the domain to simple names (without a period) in
/etc/hosts in the same way as for DHCP-derived names. Note
that this does not apply to domain names in cnames, PTR <br>
records, TXT records etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --local-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
<br>
When replying with information from /etc/hosts or the DHCP
leases file dnsmasq by default sets the time-to-live field
to zero, meaning that the requester should not itself <br>
cache the information. This is the correct thing to do in
almost all situations. This option allows a time-to-live (in
seconds) to be given for these replies. This will <br>
reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients
using stale data under some circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--neg-ttl=&lt;time&gt; <br>
Negative replies from upstream servers normally contain
time-to-live information in SOA records which dnsmasq uses
for caching. If the replies from upstream servers omit <br>
this information, dnsmasq does not cache the reply. This
option gives a default value for time-to-live (in seconds)
which dnsmasq uses to cache negative replies even in <br>
the absence of an SOA record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-ttl=&lt;time&gt; <br>
Set a maximum TTL value that will be handed out to clients.
The specified maximum TTL will be given to clients instead
of the true TTL value if it is lower. The true TTL <br>
value is however kept in the cache to avoid flooding the
upstream DNS servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-cache-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
<br>
Set a maximum TTL value for entries in the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-ttl=&lt;time&gt; <br>
Set the TTL value returned in answers from the authoritative
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-in-foreground <br>
Do not go into the background at startup but otherwise run
as normal. This is intended for use when dnsmasq is run
under daemontools or launchd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --no-daemon <br>
Debug mode: don&rsquo;t fork to the background, don&rsquo;t
write a pid file, don&rsquo;t change user id, generate a
complete cache dump on receipt on SIGUSR1, log to stderr as
well as sys&acirc; <br>
log, don&rsquo;t fork new processes to handle TCP queries.
Note that this option is for use in debugging only, to stop
dnsmasq daemonising in production, use -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --log-queries <br>
Log the results of DNS queries handled by dnsmasq. Enable a
full cache dump on receipt of SIGUSR1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8,
--log-facility=&lt;facility&gt; <br>
Set the facility to which dnsmasq will send syslog entries,
this defaults to DAEMON, and to LOCAL0 when debug mode is in
operation. If the facility given contains at least <br>
one &rsquo;/&rsquo; character, it is taken to be a filename,
and dnsmasq logs to the given file, instead of syslog. If
the facility is &rsquo;-&rsquo; then dnsmasq logs to stderr.
(Errors whilst <br>
reading configuration will still go to syslog, but all
output from a successful startup, and all output whilst
running, will go exclusively to the file.) When logging to a
<br>
file, dnsmasq will close and reopen the file when it
receives SIGUSR2. This allows the log file to be rotated
without stopping dnsmasq.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-async[=&lt;lines&gt;] <br>
Enable asynchronous logging and optionally set the limit on
the number of lines which will be queued by dnsmasq when
writing to the syslog is slow. Dnsmasq can log asyn&acirc;
<br>
chronously: this allows it to continue functioning without
being blocked by syslog, and allows syslog to use dnsmasq
for DNS queries without risking deadlock. If the <br>
queue of log-lines becomes full, dnsmasq will log the
overflow, and the number of messages lost. The default queue
length is 5, a sane value would be 5-25, and a maximum <br>
limit of 100 is imposed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --pid-file=&lt;path&gt; <br>
Specify an alternate path for dnsmasq to record its
process-id in. Normally /var/run/dnsmasq.pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user=&lt;username&gt; <br>
Specify the userid to which dnsmasq will change after
startup. Dnsmasq must normally be started as root, but it
will drop root privileges after startup by changing id to
<br>
another user. Normally this user is &quot;nobody&quot; but
that can be over-ridden with this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --group=&lt;groupname&gt;
<br>
Specify the group which dnsmasq will run as. The defaults to
&quot;dip&quot;, if available, to facilitate access to
/etc/ppp/resolv.conf which is not normally world
readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --port=&lt;port&gt; <br>
Listen on &lt;port&gt; instead of the standard DNS port
(53). Setting this to zero completely disables DNS function,
leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P,
--edns-packet-max=&lt;size&gt; <br>
Specify the largest EDNS.0 UDP packet which is supported by
the DNS forwarder. Defaults to 4096, which is the
RFC5625-recommended size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q,
--query-port=&lt;query_port&gt; <br>
Send outbound DNS queries from, and listen for their replies
on, the specific UDP port &lt;query_port&gt; instead of
using random ports. NOTE that using this option will make
<br>
dnsmasq less secure against DNS spoofing attacks but it may
be faster and use less resources. Setting this option to
zero makes dnsmasq use a single port allocated to it <br>
by the OS: this was the default behaviour in versions prior
to 2.43.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-port=&lt;port&gt; <br>
Do not use ports less than that given as source for outbound
DNS queries. Dnsmasq picks random ports as source for
outbound queries: when this option is given, the ports <br>
used will always to larger than that specified. Useful for
systems behind firewalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interface=&lt;interface
name&gt; <br>
Listen only on the specified interface(s). Dnsmasq
automatically adds the loopback (local) interface to the
list of interfaces to use when the --interface option is
used. <br>
If no --interface or --listen-address options are given
dnsmasq listens on all available interfaces except any given
in --except-interface options. IP alias interfaces (eg <br>
&quot;eth1:0&quot;) cannot be used with --interface or
--except-interface options, use --listen-address instead. A
simple wildcard, consisting of a trailing &rsquo;*&rsquo;,
can be used in <br>
--interface and --except-interface options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I,
--except-interface=&lt;interface name&gt; <br>
Do not listen on the specified interface. Note that the
order of --listen-address --interface and --except-interface
options does not matter and that --except-interface <br>
options always override the others.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-server=&lt;domain&gt;,&lt;interface&gt;|&lt;ip-address&gt;
<br>
Enable DNS authoritative mode for queries arriving at an
interface or address. Note that the interface or address
need not be mentioned in --interface or --listen-address
<br>
configuration, indeed --auth-server will overide these and
provide a different DNS service on the specified interface.
The &lt;domain&gt; is the &quot;glue record&quot;. It should
resolve <br>
in the global DNS to a A and/or AAAA record which points to
the address dnsmasq is listening on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2,
--no-dhcp-interface=&lt;interface name&gt; <br>
Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but
do provide DNS service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a,
--listen-address=&lt;ipaddr&gt; <br>
Listen on the given IP address(es). Both --interface and
--listen-address options may be given, in which case the set
of both interfaces and addresses is used. Note that <br>
if no --interface option is given, but --listen-address is,
dnsmasq will not automatically listen on the loopback
interface. To achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, <br>
must be explicitly given as a --listen-address option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --bind-interfaces <br>
On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard
address, even when it is listening on only some interfaces.
It then discards requests that it shouldn&rsquo;t reply to.
<br>
This has the advantage of working even when interfaces come
and go and change address. This option forces dnsmasq to
really bind only the interfaces it is listening on. <br>
About the only time when this is useful is when running
another nameserver (or another instance of dnsmasq) on the
same machine. Setting this option also enables multiple <br>
instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP service to run in
the same machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bind-dynamic <br>
Enable a network mode which is a hybrid between
--bind-interfaces and the default. Dnsmasq binds the address
of individual interfaces, allowing multiple dnsmasq
instances, <br>
but if new interfaces or addresses appear, it automatically
listens on those (subject to any access-control
configuration). This makes dynamically created interfaces
work <br>
in the same way as the default. Implementing this option
requires non-standard networking APIs and it is only
available under Linux. On other platforms it falls-back to
<br>
--bind-interfaces mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --localise-queries <br>
Return answers to DNS queries from /etc/hosts which depend
on the interface over which the query was received. If a
name in /etc/hosts has more than one address associated <br>
with it, and at least one of those addresses is on the same
subnet as the interface to which the query was sent, then
return only the address(es) on that subnet. This <br>
allows for a server to have multiple addresses in /etc/hosts
corresponding to each of its interfaces, and hosts will get
the correct address based on which network they <br>
are attached to. Currently this facility is limited to
IPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bogus-priv <br>
Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for
private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc) which are not found
in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file are answered with <br>
&quot;no such domain&quot; rather than being forwarded
upstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V,
--alias=[&lt;old-ip&gt;]|[&lt;start-ip&gt;-&lt;end-ip&gt;],&lt;new-ip&gt;[,&lt;mask&gt;]
<br>
Modify IPv4 addresses returned from upstream nameservers;
old-ip is replaced by new-ip. If the optional mask is given
then any address which matches the masked old-ip will <br>
be re-written. So, for instance
--alias=1.2.3.0,6.7.8.0,255.255.255.0 will map 1.2.3.56 to
6.7.8.56 and 1.2.3.67 to 6.7.8.67. This is what Cisco PIX
routers call &quot;DNS doc&acirc; <br>
toring&quot;. If the old IP is given as range, then only
addresses in the range, rather than a whole subnet, are
re-written. So <br>
--alias=192.168.0.10-192.168.0.40,10.0.0.0,255.255.255.0
maps 192.168.0.10-&gt;192.168.0.40 to
10.0.0.10-&gt;10.0.0.40</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B,
--bogus-nxdomain=&lt;ipaddr&gt; <br>
Transform replies which contain the IP address given into
&quot;No such domain&quot; replies. This is intended to
counteract a devious move made by Verisign in September 2003
when <br>
they started returning the address of an advertising web
page in response to queries for unregistered names, instead
of the correct NXDOMAIN response. This option tells <br>
dnsmasq to fake the correct response when it sees this
behaviour. As at Sept 2003 the IP address being returned by
Verisign is 64.94.110.11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --filterwin2k <br>
Later versions of windows make periodic DNS requests which
don&rsquo;t get sensible answers from the public DNS and can
cause problems by triggering dial-on-demand links. This <br>
flag turns on an option to filter such requests. The
requests blocked are for records of types SOA and SRV, and
type ANY where the requested name has underscores, to catch
<br>
LDAP requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --resolv-file=&lt;file&gt;
<br>
Read the IP addresses of the upstream nameservers from
&lt;file&gt;, instead of /etc/resolv.conf. For the format of
this file see resolv.conf(5). The only lines relevant to
<br>
dnsmasq are nameserver ones. Dnsmasq can be told to poll
more than one resolv.conf file, the first file name
specified overrides the default, subsequent ones add to the
<br>
list. This is only allowed when polling; the file with the
currently latest modification time is the one used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --no-resolv <br>
Don&rsquo;t read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only
from the command line or the dnsmasq configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1,
--enable-dbus[=&lt;service-name&gt;] <br>
Allow dnsmasq configuration to be updated via DBus method
calls. The configuration which can be changed is upstream
DNS servers (and corresponding domains) and cache <br>
clear. Requires that dnsmasq has been built with DBus
support. If the service name is given, dnsmasq provides
service at that name, rather than the default which is <br>
uk.org.thekelleys.dnsmasq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --strict-order <br>
By default, dnsmasq will send queries to any of the upstream
servers it knows about and tries to favour servers that are
known to be up. Setting this flag forces dnsmasq <br>
to try each query with each server strictly in the order
they appear in /etc/resolv.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all-servers <br>
By default, when dnsmasq has more than one upstream server
available, it will send queries to just one server. Setting
this flag forces dnsmasq to send all queries to all <br>
available servers. The reply from the server which answers
first will be returned to the original requester.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stop-dns-rebind <br>
Reject (and log) addresses from upstream nameservers which
are in the private IP ranges. This blocks an attack where a
browser behind a firewall is used to probe machines <br>
on the local network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rebind-localhost-ok <br>
Exempt 127.0.0.0/8 from rebinding checks. This address range
is returned by realtime black hole servers, so blocking it
may disable these services.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rebind-domain-ok=[&lt;domain&gt;]|[[/&lt;domain&gt;/[&lt;domain&gt;/]
<br>
Do not detect and block dns-rebind on queries to these
domains. The argument may be either a single domain, or
multiple domains surrounded by &rsquo;/&rsquo;, like the
--server syn&acirc; <br>
tax, eg. --rebind-domain-ok=/domain1/domain2/domain3/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-poll <br>
Don&rsquo;t poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear-on-reload <br>
Whenever /etc/resolv.conf is re-read, clear the DNS cache.
This is useful when new nameservers may have different data
than that held in cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --domain-needed <br>
Tells dnsmasq to never forward A or AAAA queries for plain
names, without dots or domain parts, to upstream
nameservers. If the name is not known from /etc/hosts or
DHCP <br>
then a &quot;not found&quot; answer is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --local,
--server=[/[&lt;domain&gt;]/[domain/]][&lt;ipaddr&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;][@&lt;source-ip&gt;|&lt;interface&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;]]
<br>
Specify IP address of upstream servers directly. Setting
this flag does not suppress reading of /etc/resolv.conf, use
-R to do that. If one or more optional domains are <br>
given, that server is used only for those domains and they
are queried only using the specified server. This is
intended for private nameservers: if you have a nameserver
<br>
on your network which deals with names of the form
xxx.internal.thekelleys.org.uk at 192.168.1.1 then giving
the flag -S /internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1 will
send <br>
all queries for internal machines to that nameserver,
everything else will go to the servers in /etc/resolv.conf.
An empty domain specification, // has the special meaning
<br>
of &quot;unqualified names only&quot; ie names without any
dots in them. A non-standard port may be specified as part
of the IP address using a # character. More than one -S flag
<br>
is allowed, with repeated domain or ipaddr parts as
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More specific domains take
precendence over less specific domains, so:
--server=/google.com/1.2.3.4
--server=/www.google.com/2.3.4.5 will send queries for
*.google.com to <br>
1.2.3.4, except *www.google.com, which will go to
2.3.4.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special server address
&rsquo;#&rsquo; means, &quot;use the standard servers&quot;,
so --server=/google.com/1.2.3.4 --server=/www.google.com/#
will send queries for *.google.com to 1.2.3.4, <br>
except *www.google.com which will be forwarded as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also permitted is a -S flag
which gives a domain but no IP address; this tells dnsmasq
that a domain is local and it may answer queries from
/etc/hosts or DHCP but should <br>
never forward queries on that domain to any upstream
servers. local is a synonym for server to make configuration
files clearer in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 addresses may include a
%interface scope-id, eg fe80::202:a412:4512:7bbf%eth0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional string after the @
character tells dnsmasq how to set the source of the queries
to this nameserver. It should be an ip-address, which should
belong to the <br>
machine on which dnsmasq is running otherwise this server
line will be logged and then ignored, or an interface name.
If an interface name is given, then queries to the <br>
server will be forced via that interface; if an ip-address
is given then the source address of the queries will be set
to that address. The query-port flag is ignored for <br>
any servers which have a source address specified but the
port may be specified directly as part of the source
address. Forcing queries to an interface is not implemented
<br>
on all platforms supported by dnsmasq.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A,
--address=/&lt;domain&gt;/[domain/]&lt;ipaddr&gt; <br>
Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given
domains. Queries in the domains are never forwarded and
always replied to with the specified IP address which <br>
may be IPv4 or IPv6. To give both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
for a domain, use repeated -A flags. Note that /etc/hosts
and DHCP leases override this for individual names. A <br>
common use of this is to redirect the entire doubleclick.net
domain to some friendly local web server to avoid banner
ads. The domain specification works in the same was <br>
as for --server, with the additional facility that /#/
matches any domain. Thus --address=/#/1.2.3.4 will always
return 1.2.3.4 for any query not answered from /etc/hosts
<br>
or DHCP and not sent to an upstream nameserver by a more
specific --server directive.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipset=/&lt;domain&gt;/[domain/]&lt;ipset&gt;[,&lt;ipset&gt;]
<br>
Places the resolved IP addresses of queries for the
specified domains in the specified netfilter ip sets.
Domains and subdomains are matched in the same way as
--address. <br>
These ip sets must already exist. See ipset(8) for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mx-host=&lt;mx
name&gt;[[,&lt;hostname&gt;],&lt;preference&gt;] <br>
Return an MX record named &lt;mx name&gt; pointing to the
given hostname (if given), or the host specified in the
--mx-target switch or, if that switch is not given, the host
on <br>
which dnsmasq is running. The default is useful for
directing mail from systems on a LAN to a central server.
The preference value is optional, and defaults to 1 if not
<br>
given. More than one MX record may be given for a host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --mx-target=&lt;hostname&gt;
<br>
Specify the default target for the MX record returned by
dnsmasq. See --mx-host. If --mx-target is given, but not
--mx-host, then dnsmasq returns a MX record containing <br>
the MX target for MX queries on the hostname of the machine
on which dnsmasq is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --selfmx <br>
Return an MX record pointing to itself for each local
machine. Local machines are those in /etc/hosts or with DHCP
leases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --localmx <br>
Return an MX record pointing to the host given by mx-target
(or the machine on which dnsmasq is running) for each local
machine. Local machines are those in /etc/hosts or <br>
with DHCP leases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W,
--srv-host=&lt;_service&gt;.&lt;_prot&gt;.[&lt;domain&gt;],[&lt;target&gt;[,&lt;port&gt;[,&lt;priority&gt;[,&lt;weight&gt;]]]]
<br>
Return a SRV DNS record. See RFC2782 for details. If not
supplied, the domain defaults to that given by --domain. The
default for the target domain is empty, and the <br>
default for port is one and the defaults for weight and
priority are zero. Be careful if transposing data from BIND
zone files: the port, weight and priority numbers are <br>
in a different order. More than one SRV record for a given
service/domain is allowed, all that match are returned.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--host-record=&lt;name&gt;[,&lt;name&gt;....][&lt;IPv4-address&gt;],[&lt;IPv6-address&gt;]
<br>
Add A, AAAA and PTR records to the DNS. This adds one or
more names to the DNS with associated IPv4 (A) and IPv6
(AAAA) records. A name may appear in more than one host-
<br>
record and therefore be assigned more than one address. Only
the first address creates a PTR record linking the address
to the name. This is the same rule as is used read&acirc;
<br>
ing hosts-files. host-record options are considered to be
read before host-files, so a name appearing there inhibits
PTR-record creation if it appears in hosts-file also. <br>
Unlike hosts-files, names are not expanded, even when
expand-hosts is in effect. Short and long names may appear
in the same host-record, eg. --host-record=laptop,lap&acirc;
<br>
top.thekelleys.org,192.168.0.1,1234::100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y,
--txt-record=&lt;name&gt;[[,&lt;text&gt;],&lt;text&gt;] <br>
Return a TXT DNS record. The value of TXT record is a set of
strings, so any number may be included, delimited by commas;
use quotes to put commas into a string. Note <br>
that the maximum length of a single string is 255
characters, longer strings are split into 255 character
chunks.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ptr-record=&lt;name&gt;[,&lt;target&gt;]
<br>
Return a PTR DNS record.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--naptr-record=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;order&gt;,&lt;preference&gt;,&lt;flags&gt;,&lt;service&gt;,&lt;regexp&gt;[,&lt;replacement&gt;]
<br>
Return an NAPTR DNS record, as specified in RFC3403.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cname=&lt;cname&gt;,&lt;target&gt;
<br>
Return a CNAME record which indicates that &lt;cname&gt; is
really &lt;target&gt;. There are significant limitations on
the target; it must be a DNS name which is known to dnsmasq
<br>
from /etc/hosts (or additional hosts files), from DHCP or
from another --cname. If the target does not satisfy this
criteria, the whole cname is ignored. The cname must <br>
be unique, but it is permissable to have more than one cname
pointing to the same target.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dns-rr=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;RR-number&gt;,[&lt;hex
data&gt;] <br>
Return an arbitrary DNS Resource Record. The number is the
type of the record (which is always in the C_IN class). The
value of the record is given by the hex data, which <br>
may be of the form 01:23:45 or 01 23 45 or 012345 or any
mixture of these.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interface-name=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;interface&gt;
<br>
Return a DNS record associating the name with the primary
address on the given interface. This flag specifies an A
record for the given name in the same way as an <br>
/etc/hosts line, except that the address is not constant,
but taken from the given interface. If the interface is
down, not configured or non-existent, an empty record is
<br>
returned. The matching PTR record is also created, mapping
the interface address to the name. More than one name may be
associated with an interface address by repeating <br>
the flag; in that case the first instance is used for the
reverse address-to-name mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-mac <br>
Add the MAC address of the requestor to DNS queries which
are forwarded upstream. This may be used to DNS filtering by
the upstream server. The MAC address can only be <br>
added if the requestor is on the same subnet as the dnsmasq
server. Note that the mechanism used to achieve this (an
EDNS0 option) is not yet standardised, so this should <br>
be considered experimental. Also note that exposing MAC
addresses in this way may have security and privacy
implications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c,
--cache-size=&lt;cachesize&gt; <br>
Set the size of dnsmasq&rsquo;s cache. The default is 150
names. Setting the cache size to zero disables caching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-negcache <br>
Disable negative caching. Negative caching allows dnsmasq to
remember &quot;no such domain&quot; answers from upstream
nameservers and answer identical queries without forwarding
<br>
them again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0,
--dns-forward-max=&lt;queries&gt; <br>
Set the maximum number of concurrent DNS queries. The
default value is 150, which should be fine for most setups.
The only known situation where this needs to be increased
<br>
is when using web-server log file resolvers, which can
generate large numbers of concurrent queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-dnssec <br>
A resolver on a client machine can do DNSSEC validation in
two ways: it can perform the cryptograhic operations on the
reply it receives, or it can rely on the upstream <br>
recursive nameserver to do the validation and set a bit in
the reply if it succeeds. Dnsmasq is not a DNSSEC validator,
so it cannot perform the validation role of the <br>
recursive nameserver, but it can pass through the validation
results from its own upstream nameservers. This option
enables this behaviour. You should only do this if you <br>
trust all the configured upstream nameservers and the
network between you and them. If you use the first DNSSEC
mode, validating resolvers in clients, this option is not
<br>
required. Dnsmasq always returns all the data needed for a
client to do validation itself.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-zone=&lt;domain&gt;[,&lt;subnet&gt;[/&lt;prefix
length&gt;][,&lt;subnet&gt;[/&lt;prefix length&gt;].....]]
<br>
Define a DNS zone for which dnsmasq acts as authoritative
server. Locally defined DNS records which are in the domain
will be served, except that A and AAAA records must <br>
be in one of the specified subnets, or in a subnet
corresponding to a constructed DHCP range. The subnet(s) are
also used to define in-addr.arpa and ipv6.arpa domains <br>
which are served for reverse-DNS queries. If not specified,
the prefix length defaults to 24 for IPv4 and 64 for IPv6.
For IPv4 subnets, the prefix length should be have <br>
the value 8, 16 or 24 unless you are familiar with RFC 2317
and have arranged the in-addr.arpa delegation
accordingly.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-soa=&lt;serial&gt;[,&lt;hostmaster&gt;[,&lt;refresh&gt;[,&lt;retry&gt;[,&lt;expiry&gt;]]]]
<br>
Specify fields in the SOA record associated with
authoritative zones. Note that this is optional, all the
values are set to sane defaults.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-sec-servers=&lt;domain&gt;[,&lt;domain&gt;[,&lt;domain&gt;...]]
<br>
Specify any secondary servers for a zone for which dnsmasq
is authoritative. These servers must be configured to get
zone data from dnsmasq by zone transfer, and answer <br>
queries for the same authoritative zones as dnsmasq.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-peer=&lt;ip-address&gt;[,&lt;ip-address&gt;[,&lt;ip-address&gt;...]]
<br>
Specify the addresses of secondary servers which are allowed
to initiate zone transfer (AXFR) requests for zones for
which dnsmasq is authoritative. If this option is not <br>
given, then AXFR requests will be accepted from any
secondary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--conntrack <br>
Read the Linux connection track mark associated with
incoming DNS queries and set the same mark value on upstream
traffic used to answer those queries. This allows traffic
<br>
generated by dnsmasq to be associated with the queries which
cause it, useful for bandwidth accounting and firewalling.
Dnsmasq must have conntrack support compiled in and <br>
the kernel must have conntrack support included and
configured. This option cannot be combined with
--query-port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F,
--dhcp-range=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;],][set:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;start-addr&gt;[,&lt;end-addr&gt;][,&lt;mode&gt;][,&lt;netmask&gt;[,&lt;broadcast&gt;]][,&lt;lease

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F,
--dhcp-range=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;],][set:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;start-IPv6addr&gt;[,&lt;end-IPv6addr&gt;|constructor:&lt;interface&gt;][,&lt;mode&gt;][,&lt;prefix-len&gt;][,&lt;lease
time&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable the DHCP server.
Addresses will be given out from the range
&lt;start-addr&gt; to &lt;end-addr&gt; and from statically
defined addresses given in dhcp-host options. If the <br>
lease time is given, then leases will be given for that
length of time. The lease time is in seconds, or minutes (eg
45m) or hours (eg 1h) or &quot;infinite&quot;. If not given,
the <br>
default lease time is one hour. The minimum lease time is
two minutes. For IPv6 ranges, the lease time maybe
&quot;deprecated&quot;; this sets the preferred lifetime
sent in a DHCP <br>
lease or router advertisement to zero, which causes clients
to use other addresses, if available, for new connections as
a prelude to renumbering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be repeated,
with different addresses, to enable DHCP service to more
than one network. For directly connected networks (ie,
networks on which the machine <br>
running dnsmasq has an interface) the netmask is optional:
dnsmasq will determine it from the interface configuration.
For networks which receive DHCP service via a relay <br>
agent, dnsmasq cannot determine the netmask itself, so it
should be specified, otherwise dnsmasq will have to guess,
based on the class (A, B or C) of the network address. <br>
The broadcast address is always optional. It is always
allowed to have more than one dhcp-range in a single
subnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For IPv6, the parameters are
slightly different: instead of netmask and broadcast
address, there is an optional prefix length. If not given,
this defaults to 64. Unlike <br>
the IPv4 case, the prefix length is not automatically
derived from the interface configuration. The mimimum size
of the prefix length is 64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 (only) supports another
type of range. In this, the start address and optional end
address contain only the network part (ie ::1) and they are
followed by construc&acirc; <br>
tor:&lt;interface&gt;. This forms a template which describes
how to create ranges, based on the addresses assigned to the
interface. For instance</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-range=::1,::400,constructor:eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will look for addresses of the
form &lt;network&gt;::1 or &lt;network&gt;:400 on eth0 and
then create a range from &lt;network&gt;::1 to
&lt;network&gt;::400. If the interface is assigned more <br>
than one network, then the corresponding ranges will be
automatically created, and then deprecated and finally
removed again as the address is deprecated and then deleted.
<br>
The interface name may have a final &quot;*&quot; wildcard.
Note that just any address on eth0 will not do: the
non-prefix part must be equal either the start or end
address given <br>
in the dhcp-range. This is to prevent prefixes becoming
perpetual if the interface gains a SLAAC address for the
prefix when it is advertised by dnsmasq.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional set:&lt;tag&gt;
sets an alphanumeric label which marks this network so that
dhcp options may be specified on a per-network basis. When
it is prefixed with &rsquo;tag:&rsquo; <br>
instead, then its meaning changes from setting a tag to
matching it. Only one tag may be set, but more than one tag
may be matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional &lt;mode&gt;
keyword may be static which tells dnsmasq to enable DHCP for
the network specified, but not to dynamically allocate IP
addresses: only hosts which have <br>
static addresses given via dhcp-host or from /etc/ethers
will be served. A static-only subnet with address all zeros
may be used as a &quot;catch-all&quot; address to enable
replies <br>
to all Information-request packets on a subnet which is
provided with stateless DHCPv6, ie
--dhcp=range=::,static</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For IPv4, the &lt;mode&gt; may
be proxy in which case dnsmasq will provide proxy-DHCP on
the specified subnet. (See pxe-prompt and pxe-service for
details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For IPv6, the mode may be some
combination of ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-stateless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ra-only tells dnsmasq to offer
Router Advertisement only on this subnet, and not DHCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slaac tells dnsmasq to offer
Router Advertisement on this subnet and to set the A bit in
the router advertisement, so that the client will use SLAAC
addresses. When used <br>
with a DHCP range or static DHCP address this results in the
client having both a DHCP-assigned and a SLAAC address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ra-stateless sends router
advertisements with the O and A bits set, and provides a
stateless DHCP service. The client will use a SLAAC address,
and use DHCP for other con&acirc; <br>
figuration information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ra-names enables a mode which
gives DNS names to dual-stack hosts which do SLAAC for IPv6.
Dnsmasq uses the host&rsquo;s IPv4 lease to derive the name,
network segment and MAC <br>
address and assumes that the host will also have an IPv6
address calculated using the SLAAC algorithm, on the same
network segment. The address is pinged, and if a reply <br>
is received, an AAAA record is added to the DNS for this
IPv6 address. Note that this is only happens for
directly-connected networks, (not one doing DHCP via a
relay) and <br>
it will not work if a host is using privacy extensions.
ra-names can be combined with ra-stateless and slaac.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G,
--dhcp-host=[&lt;hwaddr&gt;][,id:&lt;client_id&gt;|*][,set:&lt;tag&gt;][,&lt;ipaddr&gt;][,&lt;hostname&gt;][,&lt;lease_time&gt;][,ignore]
<br>
Specify per host parameters for the DHCP server. This allows
a machine with a particular hardware address to be always
allocated the same hostname, IP address and lease <br>
time. A hostname specified like this overrides any supplied
by the DHCP client on the machine. It is also allowable to
omit the hardware address and include the hostname, <br>
in which case the IP address and lease times will apply to
any machine claiming that name. For example
--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,wap,infinite tells dnsmasq to
give the <br>
machine with hardware address 00:20:e0:3b:13:af the name
wap, and an infinite DHCP lease.
--dhcp-host=lap,192.168.0.199 tells dnsmasq to always
allocate the machine lap <br>
the IP address 192.168.0.199.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses allocated like this
are not constrained to be in the range given by the
--dhcp-range option, but they must be in the same subnet as
some valid dhcp-range. For <br>
subnets which don&rsquo;t need a pool of dynamically
allocated addresses, use the &quot;static&quot; keyword in
the dhcp-range declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is allowed to use client
identifiers (called client DUID in IPv6-land rather than
hardware addresses to identify hosts by prefixing with
&rsquo;id:&rsquo;. Thus: --dhcp- <br>
host=id:01:02:03:04,..... refers to the host with client
identifier 01:02:03:04. It is also allowed to specify the
client ID as text, like this: --dhcp-host=id:clienti&acirc;
<br>
dastext,.....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single dhcp-host may contain
an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, or both. IPv6 addresses
must be bracketed by square brackets thus:
--dhcp-host=laptop,[1234::56] IPv6 <br>
addresses may contain only the host-identifier part:
--dhcp-host=laptop,[::56] in which case they act as
wildcards in constructed dhcp ranges, with the appropriate
network <br>
part inserted. Note that in IPv6 DHCP, the hardware address
may not be available, though it normally is for
direct-connected clients, or clients using DHCP relays which
<br>
support RFC 6939.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For DHCPv4, the special option
id:* means &quot;ignore any client-id and use MAC addresses
only.&quot; This is useful when a client presents a
client-id sometimes but not others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a name appears in /etc/hosts,
the associated address can be allocated to a DHCP lease, but
only if a --dhcp-host option specifying the name also
exists. Only one host&acirc; <br>
name can be given in a dhcp-host option, but aliases are
possible by using CNAMEs. (See --cname ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special keyword
&quot;ignore&quot; tells dnsmasq to never offer a DHCP lease
to a machine. The machine can be specified by hardware
address, client ID or hostname, for instance <br>
--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,ignore This is useful when
there is another DHCP server on the network which should be
used by some machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set:&lt;tag&gt; construct
sets the tag whenever this dhcp-host directive is in use.
This can be used to selectively send DHCP options just for
this host. More than one tag <br>
can be set in a dhcp-host directive (but not in other places
where &quot;set:&lt;tag&gt;&quot; is allowed). When a host
matches any dhcp-host directive (or one implied by
/etc/ethers) <br>
then the special tag &quot;known&quot; is set. This allows
dnsmasq to be configured to ignore requests from unknown
machines using --dhcp-ignore=tag:!known Ethernet addresses
(but <br>
not client-ids) may have wildcard bytes, so for example
--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:*,ignore will cause dnsmasq to
ignore a range of hardware addresses. Note that the
&quot;*&quot; <br>
will need to be escaped or quoted on a command line, but not
in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hardware addresses normally
match any network (ARP) type, but it is possible to restrict
them to a single ARP type by preceding them with the
ARP-type (in HEX) and &quot;-&quot;. so <br>
--dhcp-host=06-00:20:e0:3b:13:af,1.2.3.4 will only match a
Token-Ring hardware address, since the ARP-address type for
token ring is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, in DHCPv4, it
is possible to include more than one hardware address. eg:
--dhcp-host=11:22:33:44:55:66,12:34:56:78:90:12,192.168.0.2
This allows an IP <br>
address to be associated with multiple hardware addresses,
and gives dnsmasq permission to abandon a DHCP lease to one
of the hardware addresses when another one asks for <br>
a lease. Beware that this is a dangerous thing to do, it
will only work reliably if only one of the hardware
addresses is active at any time and there is no way for
dns&acirc; <br>
masq to enforce this. It is, for instance, useful to
allocate a stable IP address to a laptop which has both
wired and wireless interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-hostsfile=&lt;path&gt;
<br>
Read DHCP host information from the specified file. If a
directory is given, then read all the files contained in
that directory. The file contains information about one <br>
host per line. The format of a line is the same as text to
the right of &rsquo;=&rsquo; in --dhcp-host. The advantage
of storing DHCP host information in this file is that it can
be <br>
changed without re-starting dnsmasq: the file will be
re-read when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-optsfile=&lt;path&gt;
<br>
Read DHCP option information from the specified file. If a
directory is given, then read all the files contained in
that directory. The advantage of using this option is <br>
the same as for --dhcp-hostsfile: the dhcp-optsfile will be
re-read when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP. Note that it is
possible to encode the information in a --dhcp-boot flag
<br>
as DHCP options, using the options names bootfile-name,
server-ip-address and tftp-server. This allows these to be
included in a dhcp-optsfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --read-ethers <br>
Read /etc/ethers for information about hosts for the DHCP
server. The format of /etc/ethers is a hardware address,
followed by either a hostname or dotted-quad IP address.
<br>
When read by dnsmasq these lines have exactly the same
effect as --dhcp-host options containing the same
information. /etc/ethers is re-read when dnsmasq receives
SIGHUP. <br>
IPv6 addresses are NOT read from /etc/ethers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O,
--dhcp-option=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]][encap:&lt;opt&gt;,][vi-encap:&lt;enterprise&gt;,][vendor:[&lt;vendor-class&gt;],][&lt;opt&gt;|option:&lt;opt-name&gt;|option6:&lt;opt&gt;|option6:&lt;opt-
<br>
name&gt;],[&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]] <br>
Specify different or extra options to DHCP clients. By
default, dnsmasq sends some standard options to DHCP
clients, the netmask and broadcast address are set to the
same <br>
as the host running dnsmasq, and the DNS server and default
route are set to the address of the machine running dnsmasq.
(Equivalent rules apply for IPv6.) If the domain <br>
name option has been set, that is sent. This configuration
allows these defaults to be overridden, or other options
specified. The option, to be sent may be given as a <br>
decimal number or as &quot;option:&lt;option-name&gt;&quot;
The option numbers are specified in RFC2132 and subsequent
RFCs. The set of option-names known by dnsmasq can be
discovered by <br>
running &quot;dnsmasq --help dhcp&quot;. For example, to set
the default route option to 192.168.4.4, do
--dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.4 or --dhcp-option =
option:router, 192.168.4.4 <br>
and to set the time-server address to 192.168.0.4, do
--dhcp-option = 42,192.168.0.4 or --dhcp-option =
option:ntp-server, 192.168.0.4 The special address 0.0.0.0
(or [::] <br>
for DHCPv6) is taken to mean &quot;the address of the
machine running dnsmasq&quot;. Data types allowed are comma
separated dotted-quad IP addresses, a decimal number,
colon-sepa&acirc; <br>
rated hex digits and a text string. If the optional tags are
given then this option is only sent when all the tags are
matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special processing is done on a
text argument for option 119, to conform with RFC 3397. Text
or dotted-quad IP addresses as arguments to option 120 are
handled as per RFC <br>
3361. Dotted-quad IP addresses which are followed by a slash
and then a netmask size are encoded as described in RFC
3442.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 options are specified using
the option6: keyword, followed by the option number or
option name. The IPv6 option name space is disjoint from the
IPv4 option name <br>
space. IPv6 addresses in options must be bracketed with
square brackets, eg.
--dhcp-option=option6:ntp-server,[1234::56]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful: no checking is done
that the correct type of data for the option number is sent,
it is quite possible to persuade dnsmasq to generate illegal
DHCP packets with <br>
injudicious use of this flag. When the value is a decimal
number, dnsmasq must determine how large the data item is.
It does this by examining the option number and/or the <br>
value, but can be overridden by appending a single letter
flag as follows: b = one byte, s = two bytes, i = four
bytes. This is mainly useful with encapsulated vendor <br>
class options (see below) where dnsmasq cannot determine
data size from the option number. Option data which consists
solely of periods and digits will be interpreted by <br>
dnsmasq as an IP address, and inserted into an option as
such. To force a literal string, use quotes. For instance
when using option 66 to send a literal IP address as <br>
TFTP server name, it is necessary to do
--dhcp-option=66,&quot;1.2.3.4&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encapsulated Vendor-class
options may also be specified (IPv4 only) using
--dhcp-option: for instance
--dhcp-option=vendor:PXEClient,1,0.0.0.0 sends the
encapsulated ven&acirc; <br>
dor class-specific option &quot;mftp-address=0.0.0.0&quot;
to any client whose vendor-class matches
&quot;PXEClient&quot;. The vendor-class matching is
substring based (see --dhcp-vendorclass <br>
for details). If a vendor-class option (number 60) is sent
by dnsmasq, then that is used for selecting encapsulated
options in preference to any sent by the client. It is <br>
possible to omit the vendorclass completely;
--dhcp-option=vendor:,1,0.0.0.0 in which case the
encapsulated option is always sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may be encapsulated
(IPv4 only) within other options: for instance
--dhcp-option=encap:175, 190, iscsi-client0 will send option
175, within which is the option <br>
190. If multiple options are given which are encapsulated
with the same option number then they will be correctly
combined into one encapsulated option. encap: and ven&acirc;
<br>
dor: are may not both be set in the same dhcp-option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final variant on
encapsulated options is &quot;Vendor-Identifying Vendor
Options&quot; as specified by RFC3925. These are denoted
like this: --dhcp-option=vi-encap:2, 10, text <br>
The number in the vi-encap: section is the IANA enterprise
number used to identify this option. This form of
encapsulation is supported in IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The address 0.0.0.0 is not
treated specially in encapsulated options.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-option-force=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]][encap:&lt;opt&gt;,][vi-encap:&lt;enterprise&gt;,][vendor:[&lt;vendor-class&gt;],]&lt;opt&gt;,[&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]]
<br>
This works in exactly the same way as --dhcp-option except
that the option will always be sent, even if the client does
not ask for it in the parameter request list. This <br>
is sometimes needed, for example when sending options to
PXELinux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-no-override <br>
(IPv4 only) Disable re-use of the DHCP servername and
filename fields as extra option space. If it can, dnsmasq
moves the boot server and filename information (from dhcp-
<br>
boot) out of their dedicated fields into DHCP options. This
make extra space available in the DHCP packet for options
but can, rarely, confuse old or broken clients. This <br>
flag forces &quot;simple and safe&quot; behaviour to avoid
problems in such a case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U,
--dhcp-vendorclass=set:&lt;tag&gt;,[enterprise:&lt;IANA-enterprise
number&gt;,]&lt;vendor-class&gt; <br>
Map from a vendor-class string to a tag. Most DHCP clients
provide a &quot;vendor class&quot; which represents, in some
sense, the type of host. This option maps vendor classes to
<br>
tags, so that DHCP options may be selectively delivered to
different classes of hosts. For example
dhcp-vendorclass=set:printers,Hewlett-Packard JetDirect will
allow <br>
options to be set only for HP printers like so:
--dhcp-option=tag:printers,3,192.168.4.4 The vendor-class
string is substring matched against the vendor-class
supplied by <br>
the client, to allow fuzzy matching. The set: prefix is
optional but allowed for consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in IPv6 only,
vendorclasses are namespaced with an IANA-allocated
enterprise number. This is given with enterprise: keyword
and specifies that only vendorclasses <br>
matching the specified number should be searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j,
--dhcp-userclass=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;user-class&gt; <br>
Map from a user-class string to a tag (with substring
matching, like vendor classes). Most DHCP clients provide a
&quot;user class&quot; which is configurable. This option
maps user <br>
classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be selectively
delivered to different classes of hosts. It is possible, for
instance to use this to set a different printer <br>
server for hosts in the class &quot;accounts&quot; than for
hosts in the class &quot;engineering&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4,
--dhcp-mac=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;MAC address&gt; <br>
Map from a MAC address to a tag. The MAC address may include
wildcards. For example --dhcp-mac=set:3com,01:34:23:*:*:*
will set the tag &quot;3com&quot; for any host whose MAC
<br>
address matches the pattern.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-circuitid=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;circuit-id&gt;,
--dhcp-remoteid=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;remote-id&gt; <br>
Map from RFC3046 relay agent options to tags. This data may
be provided by DHCP relay agents. The circuit-id or
remote-id is normally given as colon-separated hex, but is
<br>
also allowed to be a simple string. If an exact match is
achieved between the circuit or agent ID and one provided by
a relay agent, the tag is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dhcp-remoteid (but not
dhcp-circuitid) is supported in IPv6.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-subscrid=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;subscriber-id&gt;
<br>
(IPv4 and IPv6) Map from RFC3993 subscriber-id relay agent
options to tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-proxy[=&lt;ip
addr&gt;]...... <br>
(IPv4 only) A normal DHCP relay agent is only used to
forward the initial parts of a DHCP interaction to the DHCP
server. Once a client is configured, it communicates <br>
directly with the server. This is undesirable if the relay
agent is adding extra information to the DHCP packets, such
as that used by dhcp-circuitid and dhcp-remoteid. A <br>
full relay implementation can use the RFC 5107
serverid-override option to force the DHCP server to use the
relay as a full proxy, with all packets passing through it.
<br>
This flag provides an alternative method of doing the same
thing, for relays which don&rsquo;t support RFC 5107. Given
alone, it manipulates the server-id for all interactions
<br>
via relays. If a list of IP addresses is given, only
interactions via relays at those addresses are affected.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-match=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;option
number&gt;|option:&lt;option
name&gt;|vi-encap:&lt;enterprise&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;] <br>
Without a value, set the tag if the client sends a DHCP
option of the given number or name. When a value is given,
set the tag only if the option is sent and matches the <br>
value. The value may be of the form &quot;01:ff:*:02&quot;
in which case the value must match (apart from wildcards)
but the option sent may have unmatched data past the end of
the <br>
value. The value may also be of the same form as in
dhcp-option in which case the option sent is treated as an
array, and one element must match, so</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-match=set:efi-ia32,option:client-arch,6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will set the tag
&quot;efi-ia32&quot; if the the number 6 appears in the list
of architectures sent by the client in option 93. (See RFC
4578 for details.) If the value is a <br>
string, substring matching is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special form with
vi-encap:&lt;enterprise number&gt; matches against
vendor-identifying vendor classes for the specified
enterprise. Please see RFC 3925 for more details of <br>
these rare and interesting beasts.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tag-if=set:&lt;tag&gt;[,set:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]]]
<br>
Perform boolean operations on tags. Any tag appearing as
set:&lt;tag&gt; is set if all the tags which appear as
tag:&lt;tag&gt; are set, (or unset when tag:!&lt;tag&gt; is
used) If no <br>
tag:&lt;tag&gt; appears set:&lt;tag&gt; tags are set
unconditionally. Any number of set: and tag: forms may
appear, in any order. Tag-if lines ares executed in order,
so if the tag <br>
in tag:&lt;tag&gt; is a tag set by another tag-if, the line
which sets the tag must precede the one which tests it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J,
--dhcp-ignore=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;] <br>
When all the given tags appear in the tag set ignore the
host and do not allocate it a DHCP lease.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-ignore-names[=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]]
<br>
When all the given tags appear in the tag set, ignore any
hostname provided by the host. Note that, unlike
dhcp-ignore, it is permissible to supply no tags, in which
case <br>
DHCP-client supplied hostnames are always ignored, and DHCP
hosts are added to the DNS using only dhcp-host
configuration in dnsmasq and the contents of /etc/hosts and
<br>
/etc/ethers.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-generate-names=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]
<br>
(IPv4 only) Generate a name for DHCP clients which do not
otherwise have one, using the MAC address expressed in hex,
separated by dashes. Note that if a host provides a <br>
name, it will be used by preference to this, unless
--dhcp-ignore-names is set.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-broadcast[=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]]
<br>
(IPv4 only) When all the given tags appear in the tag set,
always use broadcast to communicate with the host when it is
unconfigured. It is permissible to supply no tags, <br>
in which case this is unconditional. Most DHCP clients which
need broadcast replies set a flag in their requests so that
this happens automatically, some old BOOTP clients <br>
do not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M,
--dhcp-boot=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;filename&gt;,[&lt;servername&gt;[,&lt;server
address&gt;|&lt;tftp_servername&gt;]] <br>
(IPv4 only) Set BOOTP options to be returned by the DHCP
server. Server name and address are optional: if not
provided, the name is left empty, and the address set to the
<br>
address of the machine running dnsmasq. If dnsmasq is
providing a TFTP service (see --enable-tftp ) then only the
filename is required here to enable network booting. If <br>
the optional tag(s) are given, they must match for this
configuration to be sent. Instead of an IP address, the TFTP
server address can be given as a domain name which is <br>
looked up in /etc/hosts. This name can be associated in
/etc/hosts with multiple IP addresses, which are used
round-robin. This facility can be used to load balance the
<br>
tftp load among a set of servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-sequential-ip <br>
Dnsmasq is designed to choose IP addresses for DHCP clients
using a hash of the client&rsquo;s MAC address. This
normally allows a client&rsquo;s address to remain stable
long-term, <br>
even if the client sometimes allows its DHCP lease to
expire. In this default mode IP addresses are distributed
pseudo-randomly over the entire available address range.
<br>
There are sometimes circumstances (typically server
deployment) where it is more convenient to have IP addresses
allocated sequentially, starting from the lowest available
<br>
address, and setting this flag enables this mode. Note that
in the sequential mode, clients which allow a lease to
expire are much more likely to move IP address; for this
<br>
reason it should not be generally used.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pxe-service=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;CSA&gt;,&lt;menu
text&gt;[,&lt;basename&gt;|&lt;bootservicetype&gt;][,&lt;server
address&gt;|&lt;server_name&gt;] <br>
Most uses of PXE boot-ROMS simply allow the PXE system to
obtain an IP address and then download the file specified by
dhcp-boot and execute it. However the PXE system is <br>
capable of more complex functions when supported by a
suitable DHCP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies a boot option
which may appear in a PXE boot menu. &lt;CSA&gt; is client
system type, only services of the correct type will appear
in a menu. The known types are <br>
x86PC, PC98, IA64_EFI, Alpha, Arc_x86, Intel_Lean_Client,
IA32_EFI, BC_EFI, Xscale_EFI and X86-64_EFI; an integer may
be used for other types. The parameter after the menu <br>
text may be a file name, in which case dnsmasq acts as a
boot server and directs the PXE client to download the file
by TFTP, either from itself ( enable-tftp must be set <br>
for this to work) or another TFTP server if the final server
address/name is given. Note that the &quot;layer&quot;
suffix (normally &quot;.0&quot;) is supplied by PXE, and
should not be <br>
added to the basename. If an integer boot service type,
rather than a basename is given, then the PXE client will
search for a suitable boot service for that type on the <br>
network. This search may be done by broadcast, or direct to
a server if its IP address/name is provided. If no boot
service type or filename is provided (or a boot ser&acirc;
<br>
vice type of 0 is specified) then the menu entry will abort
the net boot procedure and continue booting from local
media. The server address can be given as a domain name <br>
which is looked up in /etc/hosts. This name can be
associated in /etc/hosts with multiple IP addresses, which
are used round-robin.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pxe-prompt=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;prompt&gt;[,&lt;timeout&gt;]
<br>
Setting this provides a prompt to be displayed after PXE
boot. If the timeout is given then after the timeout has
elapsed with no keyboard input, the first available menu
<br>
option will be automatically executed. If the timeout is
zero then the first available menu item will be executed
immediately. If pxe-prompt is omitted the system will <br>
wait for user input if there are multiple items in the menu,
but boot immediately if there is only one. See pxe-service
for details of menu items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dnsmasq supports PXE
&quot;proxy-DHCP&quot;, in this case another DHCP server on
the network is responsible for allocating IP addresses, and
dnsmasq simply provides the information <br>
given in pxe-prompt and pxe-service to allow netbooting.
This mode is enabled using the proxy keyword in
dhcp-range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X,
--dhcp-lease-max=&lt;number&gt; <br>
Limits dnsmasq to the specified maximum number of DHCP
leases. The default is 1000. This limit is to prevent DoS
attacks from hosts which create thousands of leases and <br>
use lots of memory in the dnsmasq process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --dhcp-authoritative <br>
Should be set when dnsmasq is definitely the only DHCP
server on a network. For DHCPv4, it changes the behaviour
from strict RFC compliance so that DHCP requests on <br>
unknown leases from unknown hosts are not ignored. This
allows new hosts to get a lease without a tedious timeout
under all circumstances. It also allows dnsmasq to <br>
rebuild its lease database without each client needing to
reacquire a lease, if the database is lost. For DHCPv6 it
sets the priority in replies to 255 (the maximum) <br>
instead of 0 (the minimum).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-alternate-port[=&lt;server
port&gt;[,&lt;client port&gt;]] <br>
(IPv4 only) Change the ports used for DHCP from the default.
If this option is given alone, without arguments, it changes
the ports used for DHCP from 67 and 68 to 1067 <br>
and 1068. If a single argument is given, that port number is
used for the server and the port number plus one used for
the client. Finally, two port numbers allows arbi&acirc;
<br>
trary specification of both server and client ports for
DHCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3,
--bootp-dynamic[=&lt;network-id&gt;[,&lt;network-id&gt;]]
<br>
(IPv4 only) Enable dynamic allocation of IP addresses to
BOOTP clients. Use this with care, since each address
allocated to a BOOTP client is leased forever, and therefore
<br>
becomes permanently unavailable for re-use by other hosts.
if this is given without tags, then it unconditionally
enables dynamic allocation. With tags, only when the tags
<br>
are all set. It may be repeated with different tag sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-5, --no-ping <br>
(IPv4 only) By default, the DHCP server will attempt to
ensure that an address in not in use before allocating it to
a host. It does this by sending an ICMP echo request <br>
(aka &quot;ping&quot;) to the address in question. If it
gets a reply, then the address must already be in use, and
another is tried. This flag disables this check. Use with
cau&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-dhcp <br>
Extra logging for DHCP: log all the options sent to DHCP
clients and the tags used to determine them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l,
--dhcp-leasefile=&lt;path&gt; <br>
Use the specified file to store DHCP lease information.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-duid=&lt;enterprise-id&gt;,&lt;uid&gt;
<br>
(IPv6 only) Specify the server persistent UID which the
DHCPv6 server will use. This option is not normally required
as dnsmasq creates a DUID automatically when it is <br>
first needed. When given, this option provides dnsmasq the
data required to create a DUID-EN type DUID. Note that once
set, the DUID is stored in the lease database, so to <br>
change between DUID-EN and automatically created DUIDs or
vice-versa, the lease database must be re-intialised. The
enterprise-id is assigned by IANA, and the uid is a <br>
string of hex octets unique to a particular device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 --dhcp-script=&lt;path&gt;
<br>
Whenever a new DHCP lease is created, or an old one
destroyed, or a TFTP file transfer completes, the executable
specified by this option is run. &lt;path&gt; must be an
abso&acirc; <br>
lute pathname, no PATH search occurs. The arguments to the
process are &quot;add&quot;, &quot;old&quot; or
&quot;del&quot;, the MAC address of the host (or DUID for
IPv6) , the IP address, and the <br>
hostname, if known. &quot;add&quot; means a lease has been
created, &quot;del&quot; means it has been destroyed,
&quot;old&quot; is a notification of an existing lease when
dnsmasq starts or a change <br>
to MAC address or hostname of an existing lease (also, lease
length or expiry and client-id, if leasefile-ro is set). If
the MAC address is from a network type other than <br>
ethernet, it will have the network type prepended, eg
&quot;06-01:23:45:67:89:ab&quot; for token ring. The process
is run as root (assuming that dnsmasq was originally run as
root) <br>
even if dnsmasq is configured to change UID to an
unprivileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment is inherited
from the invoker of dnsmasq, with some or all of the
following variables added</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For both IPv4 and IPv6:</p>

HAVE_BROKEN_RTC, then the length of the lease (in seconds)
is stored in DNSMASQ_LEASE_LENGTH, otherwise the time of
lease expiry is stored in <br>
DNSMASQ_LEASE_EXPIRES. The number of seconds until lease
expiry is always stored in DNSMASQ_TIME_REMAINING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a lease used to have a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All file descriptors are closed
except stdin, stdout and stderr which are open to /dev/null
(except in debug mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script is not invoked
concurrently: at most one instance of the script is ever
running (dnsmasq waits for an instance of script to exit
before running the next). <br>
Changes to the lease database are which require the script
to be invoked are queued awaiting exit of a running
instance. If this queueing allows multiple state changes
<br>
occur to a single lease before the script can be run then
earlier states are discarded and the current state of that
lease is reflected when the script finally runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At dnsmasq startup, the script
will be invoked for all existing leases as they are read
from the lease file. Expired leases will be called with
&quot;del&quot; and others with <br>
&quot;old&quot;. When dnsmasq receives a HUP signal, the
script will be invoked for existing leases with an &quot;old
&quot; event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two further actions
which may appear as the first argument to the script,
&quot;init&quot; and &quot;tftp&quot;. More may be added in
the future, so scripts should be written to <br>
ignore unknown actions. &quot;init&quot; is described below
in --leasefile-ro The &quot;tftp&quot; action is invoked
when a TFTP file transfer completes: the arguments are the
file size in <br>
bytes, the address to which the file was sent, and the
complete pathname of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-luascript=&lt;path&gt;
<br>
Specify a script written in Lua, to be run when leases are
created, destroyed or changed. To use this option, dnsmasq
must be compiled with the correct support. The Lua <br>
interpreter is intialised once, when dnsmasq starts, so that
global variables persist between lease events. The Lua code
must define a lease function, and may provide init <br>
and shutdown functions, which are called, without arguments
when dnsmasq starts up and terminates. It may also provide a
tftp function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lease function receives the
information detailed in --dhcp-script. It gets two
arguments, firstly the action, which is a string containing,
&quot;add&quot;, &quot;old&quot; or &quot;del&quot;, and
<br>
secondly a table of tag value pairs. The tags mostly
correspond to the environment variables detailed above, for
instance the tag &quot;domain&quot; holds the same data as
the envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable DNSMASQ_DOMAIN. There are a few extra tags
which hold the data supplied as arguments to --dhcp-script.
These are mac_address, ip_address and hostname for <br>
IPv4, and client_duid, ip_address and hostname for IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tftp function is called in
the same way as the lease function, and the table holds the
tags destination_address, file_name and file_size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-scriptuser <br>
Specify the user as which to run the lease-change script or
Lua script. This defaults to root, but can be changed to
another user using this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-9, --leasefile-ro <br>
Completely suppress use of the lease database file. The file
will not be created, read, or written. Change the way the
lease-change script (if one is provided) is called, <br>
so that the lease database may be maintained in external
storage by the script. In addition to the invocations given
in --dhcp-script the lease-change script is called <br>
once, at dnsmasq startup, with the single argument
&quot;init&quot;. When called like this the script should
write the saved state of the lease database, in dnsmasq
leasefile for&acirc; <br>
mat, to stdout and exit with zero exit code. Setting this
option also forces the leasechange script to be called on
changes to the client-id and lease length and expiry <br>
time.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bridge-interface=&lt;interface&gt;,&lt;alias&gt;[,&lt;alias&gt;]
<br>
Treat DHCP request packets arriving at any of the
&lt;alias&gt; interfaces as if they had arrived at
&lt;interface&gt;. This option is necessary when using
&quot;old style&quot; bridging on BSD <br>
platforms, since packets arrive at tap interfaces which
don&rsquo;t have an IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s,
--domain=&lt;domain&gt;[,&lt;address range&gt;[,local]] <br>
Specifies DNS domains for the DHCP server. Domains may be be
given unconditionally (without the IP range) or for limited
IP ranges. This has two effects; firstly it causes <br>
the DHCP server to return the domain to any hosts which
request it, and secondly it sets the domain which it is
legal for DHCP-configured hosts to claim. The intention is
<br>
to constrain hostnames so that an untrusted host on the LAN
cannot advertise its name via dhcp as e.g.
&quot;microsoft.com&quot; and capture traffic not meant for
it. If no domain <br>
suffix is specified, then any DHCP hostname with a domain
part (ie with a period) will be disallowed and logged. If
suffix is specified, then hostnames with a domain part <br>
are allowed, provided the domain part matches the suffix. In
addition, when a suffix is set then hostnames without a
domain part have the suffix added as an optional <br>
domain part. Eg on my network I can set
--domain=thekelleys.org.uk and have a machine whose DHCP
hostname is &quot;laptop&quot;. The IP address for that
machine is available from <br>
dnsmasq both as &quot;laptop&quot; and
&quot;laptop.thekelleys.org.uk&quot;. If the domain is given
as &quot;#&quot; then the domain is read from the first
&quot;search&quot; directive in /etc/resolv.conf (or <br>
equivalent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The address range can be of the
form &lt;ip address&gt;,&lt;ip address&gt; or &lt;ip
address&gt;/&lt;netmask&gt; or just a single &lt;ip
address&gt;. See --dhcp-fqdn which can change the behaviour
of <br>
dnsmasq with domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the address range is given as
ip-address/network-size, then a additional flag
&quot;local&quot; may be supplied which has the effect of
adding --local declarations for forward <br>
and reverse DNS queries. Eg.
--domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24,local is identical
to --domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24
--local=/thekelleys.org.uk/ <br>
--local=/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa/ The network size must be 8,
16 or 24 for this to be legal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-fqdn <br>
In the default mode, dnsmasq inserts the unqualified names
of DHCP clients into the DNS. For this reason, the names
must be unique, even if two clients which have the same <br>
name are in different domains. If a second DHCP client
appears which has the same name as an existing client, the
name is transferred to the new client. If --dhcp-fqdn is
<br>
set, this behaviour changes: the unqualified name is no
longer put in the DNS, only the qualified name. Two DHCP
clients with the same name may both keep the name,
pro&acirc; <br>
vided that the domain part is different (ie the fully
qualified names differ.) To ensure that all names have a
domain part, there must be at least --domain without an <br>
address specified when --dhcp-fqdn is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dhcp-client-update <br>
Normally, when giving a DHCP lease, dnsmasq sets flags in
the FQDN option to tell the client not to attempt a DDNS
update with its name and IP address. This is because the
<br>
name-IP pair is automatically added into dnsmasq&rsquo;s DNS
view. This flag suppresses that behaviour, this is useful,
for instance, to allow Windows clients to update Active <br>
Directory servers. See RFC 4702 for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-ra <br>
Enable dnsmasq&rsquo;s IPv6 Router Advertisement feature.
DHCPv6 doesn&rsquo;t handle complete network configuration
in the same way as DHCPv4. Router discovery and (possibly)
prefix <br>
discovery for autonomous address creation are handled by a
different protocol. When DHCP is in use, only a subset of
this is needed, and dnsmasq can handle it, using <br>
existing DHCP configuration to provide most data. When RA is
enabled, dnsmasq will advertise a prefix for each
dhcp-range, with default router and recursive DNS server as
<br>
the relevant link-local address on the machine running
dnsmasq. By default, he &quot;managed address&quot; bits are
set, and the &quot;use SLAAC&quot; bit is reset. This can be
changed for <br>
individual subnets with the mode keywords described in
--dhcp-range. RFC6106 DNS parameters are included in the
advertisements. By default, the relevant link-local <br>
address of the machine running dnsmasq is sent as recursive
DNS server. If provided, the DHCPv6 options dns-server and
domain-search are used for RDNSS and DNSSL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-tftp <br>
Enable the TFTP server function. This is deliberately
limited to that needed to net-boot a client. Only reading is
allowed; the tsize and blksize extensions are supported <br>
(tsize is only supported in octet mode).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-root=&lt;directory&gt;[,&lt;interface&gt;]
<br>
Look for files to transfer using TFTP relative to the given
directory. When this is set, TFTP paths which include
&quot;..&quot; are rejected, to stop clients getting outside
the <br>
specified root. Absolute paths (starting with /) are
allowed, but they must be within the tftp-root. If the
optional interface argument is given, the directory is only
<br>
used for TFTP requests via that interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-unique-root <br>
Add the IP address of the TFTP client as a path component on
the end of the TFTP-root (in standard dotted-quad format).
Only valid if a tftp-root is set and the directory <br>
exists. For instance, if tftp-root is &quot;/tftp&quot; and
client 1.2.3.4 requests file &quot;myfile&quot; then the
effective path will be &quot;/tftp/1.2.3.4/myfile&quot; if
/tftp/1.2.3.4 exists or <br>
/tftp/myfile otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-secure <br>
Enable TFTP secure mode: without this, any file which is
readable by the dnsmasq process under normal unix
access-control rules is available via TFTP. When the --tftp-
<br>
secure flag is given, only files owned by the user running
the dnsmasq process are accessible. If dnsmasq is being run
as root, different rules apply: --tftp-secure has no <br>
effect, but only files which have the world-readable bit set
are accessible. It is not recommended to run dnsmasq as root
with TFTP enabled, and certainly not without <br>
specifying --tftp-root. Doing so can expose any
world-readable file on the server to any host on the
net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-lowercase <br>
Convert filenames in TFTP requests to all lowercase. This is
useful for requests from Windows machines, which have
case-insensitive filesystems and tend to play fast-and- <br>
loose with case in filenames. Note that dnsmasq&rsquo;s tftp
server always converts &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-max=&lt;connections&gt;
<br>
Set the maximum number of concurrent TFTP connections
allowed. This defaults to 50. When serving a large number of
TFTP connections, per-process file descriptor limits may
<br>
be encountered. Dnsmasq needs one file descriptor for each
concurrent TFTP connection and one file descriptor per
unique file (plus a few others). So serving the same file
<br>
simultaneously to n clients will use require about n + 10
file descriptors, serving different files simultaneously to
n clients will require about (2*n) + 10 descriptors. <br>
If --tftp-port-range is given, that can affect the number of
concurrent connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-no-blocksize <br>
Stop the TFTP server from negotiating the
&quot;blocksize&quot; option with a client. Some buggy
clients request this option but then behave badly when it is
granted.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-port-range=&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;
<br>
A TFTP server listens on a well-known port (69) for
connection initiation, but it also uses a
dynamically-allocated port for each connection. Normally
these are allocated <br>
by the OS, but this option specifies a range of ports for
use by TFTP transfers. This can be useful when TFTP has to
traverse a firewall. The start of the range cannot be <br>
lower than 1025 unless dnsmasq is running as root. The
number of concurrent TFTP connections is limited by the size
of the port range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --conf-file=&lt;file&gt;
<br>
Specify a different configuration file. The conf-file option
is also allowed in configuration files, to include multiple
configuration files. A filename of &quot;-&quot; causes
dns&acirc; <br>
masq to read configuration from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7,
--conf-dir=&lt;directory&gt;[,&lt;file-extension&gt;......]
<br>
Read all the files in the given directory as configuration
files. If extension(s) are given, any files which end in
those extensions are skipped. Any files whose names end <br>
in ~ or start with . or start and end with # are always
skipped. This flag may be given on the command line or in a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
At startup, dnsmasq reads /etc/dnsmasq.conf, if it exists.
(On FreeBSD, the file is /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf ) (but
see the -C and -7 options.) The format of this file
con&acirc; <br>
sists of one option per line, exactly as the long options
detailed in the OPTIONS section but without the leading
&quot;--&quot;. Lines starting with # are comments and
ignored. For <br>
options which may only be specified once, the configuration
file overrides the command line. Quoting is allowed in a
config file: between &quot; quotes the special meanings of
,:. <br>
and # are removed and the following escapes are allowed:
\</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
When it receives a SIGHUP, dnsmasq clears its cache and then
re-loads /etc/hosts and /etc/ethers and any file given by
--dhcp-hostsfile, --dhcp-optsfile or --addn-hosts. The <br>
dhcp lease change script is called for all existing DHCP
leases. If --no-poll is set SIGHUP also re-reads
/etc/resolv.conf. SIGHUP does NOT re-read the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it receives a SIGUSR1,
dnsmasq writes statistics to the system log. It writes the
cache size, the number of names which have had to removed
from the cache before they <br>
expired in order to make room for new names and the total
number of names that have been inserted into the cache. For
each upstream server it gives the number of queries sent,
<br>
and the number which resulted in an error. In --no-daemon
mode or when full logging is enabled (-q), a complete dump
of the contents of the cache is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it receives SIGUSR2 and it
is logging direct to a file (see --log-facility ) dnsmasq
will close and reopen the log file. Note that during this
operation, dnsmasq will not be <br>
running as root. When it first creates the logfile dnsmasq
changes the ownership of the file to the non-root user it
will run as. Logrotate should be configured to create a new
<br>
log file with the ownership which matches the existing one
before sending SIGUSR2. If TCP DNS queries are in progress,
the old logfile will remain open in child processes which
<br>
are handling TCP queries and may continue to be written.
There is a limit of 150 seconds, after which all existing
TCP processes will have expired: for this reason, it is not
<br>
wise to configure logfile compression for logfiles which
have just been rotated. Using logrotate, the required
options are create and delaycompress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dnsmasq is a DNS query
forwarder: it it not capable of recursively answering
arbitrary queries starting from the root servers but
forwards such queries to a fully recursive <br>
upstream DNS server which is typically provided by an ISP.
By default, dnsmasq reads /etc/resolv.conf to discover the
IP addresses of the upstream nameservers it should use, <br>
since the information is typically stored there. Unless
--no-poll is used, dnsmasq checks the modification time of
/etc/resolv.conf (or equivalent if --resolv-file is used)
and <br>
re-reads it if it changes. This allows the DNS servers to be
set dynamically by PPP or DHCP since both protocols provide
the information. Absence of /etc/resolv.conf is not an <br>
error since it may not have been created before a PPP
connection exists. Dnsmasq simply keeps checking in case
/etc/resolv.conf is created at any time. Dnsmasq can be told
to <br>
parse more than one resolv.conf file. This is useful on a
laptop, where both PPP and DHCP may be used: dnsmasq can be
set to poll both /etc/ppp/resolv.conf and <br>
/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf and will use the contents of
whichever changed last, giving automatic switching between
DNS servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upstream servers may also be
specified on the command line or in the configuration file.
These server specifications optionally take a domain name
which tells dnsmasq to use that <br>
server only to find names in that particular domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to configure dnsmasq to
act as cache for the host on which it is running, put
&quot;nameserver 127.0.0.1&quot; in /etc/resolv.conf to
force local processes to send queries to dns&acirc; <br>
masq. Then either specify the upstream servers directly to
dnsmasq using --server options or put their addresses real
in another file, say /etc/resolv.dnsmasq and run dnsmasq
<br>
with the -r /etc/resolv.dnsmasq option. This second
technique allows for dynamic update of the server addresses
by PPP or DHCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses in /etc/hosts will
&quot;shadow&quot; different addresses for the same names in
the upstream DNS, so &quot;mycompany.com 1.2.3.4&quot; in
/etc/hosts will ensure that queries for <br>
&quot;mycompany.com&quot; always return 1.2.3.4 even if
queries in the upstream DNS would otherwise return a
different address. There is one exception to this: if the
upstream DNS contains <br>
a CNAME which points to a shadowed name, then looking up the
CNAME through dnsmasq will result in the unshadowed address
associated with the target of the CNAME. To work around <br>
this, add the CNAME to /etc/hosts so that the CNAME is
shadowed too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tag system works as follows:
For each DHCP request, dnsmasq collects a set of valid tags
from active configuration lines which include
set:&lt;tag&gt;, including one from the dhcp- <br>
range used to allocate the address, one from any matching
dhcp-host (and &quot;known&quot; if a dhcp-host matches) The
tag &quot;bootp&quot; is set for BOOTP requests, and a tag
whose name is the <br>
name of the interface on which the request arrived is also
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any configuration lines which
include one or more tag:&lt;tag&gt; constructs will only be
valid if all that tags are matched in the set derived above.
Typically this is dhcp-option. <br>
dhcp-option which has tags will be used in preference to an
untagged dhcp-option, provided that _all_ the tags match
somewhere in the set collected as described above. The
pre&acirc; <br>
fix &rsquo;!&rsquo; on a tag means &rsquo;not&rsquo; so
--dhcp=option=tag:!purple,3,1.2.3.4 sends the option when
the tag purple is not in the set of valid tags. (If using
this in a command line rather <br>
than a configuration file, be sure to escape !, which is a
shell metacharacter)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When selecting dhcp-options, a
tag from dhcp-range is second class relative to other tags,
to make it easy to override options for individual hosts, so
dhcp-range=set:inter&acirc; <br>
face1,...... dhcp-host=set:myhost,.....
dhcp-option=tag:interface1,option:nis-domain,&quot;domain1&quot;
dhcp-option=tag:myhost,option:nis-domain,&quot;domain2&quot;
will set the NIS-domain to <br>
domain1 for hosts in the range, but override that to domain2
for a particular host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that for dhcp-range both
tag:&lt;tag&gt; and set:&lt;tag&gt; are allowed, to both
select the range in use based on (eg) dhcp-host, and to
affect the options sent, based on the range <br>
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This system evolved from an
earlier, more limited one and for backward compatibility
&quot;net:&quot; may be used instead of &quot;tag:&quot; and
&quot;set:&quot; may be omitted. (Except in dhcp-host, where
<br>
&quot;net:&quot; may be used instead of &quot;set:&quot;.)
For the same reason, &rsquo;#&rsquo; may be used instead of
&rsquo;!&rsquo; to indicate NOT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DHCP server in dnsmasq will
function as a BOOTP server also, provided that the MAC
address and IP address for clients are given, either using
dhcp-host configurations or in <br>
/etc/ethers , and a dhcp-range configuration option is
present to activate the DHCP server on a particular network.
(Setting --bootp-dynamic removes the need for static address
<br>
mappings.) The filename parameter in a BOOTP request is used
as a tag, as is the tag &quot;bootp&quot;, allowing some
control over the options returned to different classes of
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORITATIVE CONFIGURATION <br>
Configuring dnsmasq to act as an authoritative DNS server is
complicated by the fact that it involves configuration of
external DNS servers to provide delegation. We will walk
<br>
through three scenarios of increasing complexity.
Prerequisites for all of these scenarios are a globally
accessible IP address, an A or AAAA record pointing to that
address, and <br>
an external DNS server capable of doing delegation of the
zone in question. For the first part of this explanation, we
will call the A (or AAAA) record for the globally
accessi&acirc; <br>
ble address server.example.com, and the zone for which
dnsmasq is authoritative our.zone.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest configuration
consists of two lines of dnsmasq configuration; something
like</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth-server=server.example.com,eth0
<br>
auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and two records in the external
DNS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server.example.com A 192.0.43.10
<br>
our.zone.com NS server.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eth0 is the external network
interface on which dnsmasq is listening, and has (globally
accessible) address 192.0.43.10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the external IP
address may well be dynamic (ie assigned from an ISP by DHCP
or PPP) If so, the A record must be linked to this dynamic
assignment by one of the usual <br>
dynamic-DNS systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more complex, but practically
useful configuration has the address record for the globally
accessible IP address residing in the authoritative zone
which dnsmasq is serving, <br>
typically at the root. Now we have</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0
<br>
auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">our.zone.com A 1.2.3.4 <br>
our.zone.com NS our.zone.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The A record for our.zone.com
has now become a glue record, it solves the chicken-and-egg
problem of finding the IP address of the nameserver for
our.zone.com when the A record <br>
is within that zone. Note that this is the only role of this
record: as dnsmasq is now authoritative from our.zone.com it
too must provide this record. If the external address is
<br>
static, this can be done with an /etc/hosts entry or
--host-record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0
<br>
host-record=our.zone.com,1.2.3.4 <br>
auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the external address is
dynamic, the address associated with our.zone.com must be
derived from the address of the relevant interface. This is
done using interface-name Some&acirc; <br>
thing like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0
<br>
interface-name=our.zone.com,eth0 <br>
auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Our final configuration builds
on that above, but also adds a secondary DNS server. This is
another DNS server which learns the DNS data for the zone by
doing zones transfer, and <br>
acts as a backup should the primary server become
inaccessible. The configuration of the secondary is beyond
the scope of this man-page, but the extra configuration of
dnsmasq is <br>
simple:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth-sec-servers=secondary.myisp.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">our.zone.com NS
secondary.myisp.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding auth-sec-servers enables
zone transfer in dnsmasq, to allow the secondary to collect
the DNS data. If you wish to restrict this data to
particular hosts then</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth-peer=&lt;IP address of
secondary&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dnsmasq acts as an authoritative
server for in-addr.arpa and ipv6.arpa domains associated
with the subnets given in auth-zone declarations, so reverse
(address to name) lookups <br>
can be simply configured with a suitable NS record, for
instance in this example, where we allow 1.2.3.0/24
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.2.1.in-addr.arpa NS
our.zone.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that at present, reverse
(in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa) zones are not available in zone
transfers, so there is no point arranging secondary servers
for reverse lookups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dnsmasq is configured to
act as an authoritative server, the following data is used
to populate the authoritative zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mx-host, --srv-host, --dns-rr,
--txt-record, --naptr-record , as long as the record names
are in the authoritative domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cname as long as the record
name is in the authoritative domain. If the target of the
CNAME is unqualified, then it is qualified with the
authoritative zone name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from
/etc/hosts (and --addn-hosts ) and --host-record provided
the address falls into one of the subnets specified in the
--auth-zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses specified by
--interface-name. In this case, the address is not
contrained to a subnet from --auth-zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses of DHCP leases,
provided the address falls into one of the subnets specified
in the --auth-zone OR a constructed DHCP range. In the
default mode, where a DHCP lease has <br>
an unqualified name, and possibly a qualified name
constructed using --domain then the name in the
authoritative zone is constructed from the unqualified name
and the zone&rsquo;s <br>
domain. This may or may not equal that specified by
--domain. If --dhcp-fqdn is set, then the fully qualified
names associated with DHCP leases are used, and must match
the <br>
zone&rsquo;s domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
0 - Dnsmasq successfully forked into the background, or
terminated normally if backgrounding is not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - A problem with configuration
was detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 - A problem with network
access occurred (address in use, attempt to use privileged
ports without permission).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 - A problem occurred with a
filesystem operation (missing file/directory,
permissions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 - Memory allocation
failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 - Other miscellaneous
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 or greater - a non zero
return code was received from the lease-script process
&quot;init&quot; call. The exit code from dnsmasq is the
script&rsquo;s exit code with 10 added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITS <br>
The default values for resource limits in dnsmasq are
generally conservative, and appropriate for embedded router
type devices with slow processors and limited memory. On
more <br>
capable hardware, it is possible to increase the limits, and
handle many more clients. The following applies to
dnsmasq-2.37: earlier versions did not scale as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dnsmasq is capable of handling
DNS and DHCP for at least a thousand clients. The DHCP lease
times should not be very short (less than one hour). The
value of --dns-forward-max <br>
can be increased: start with it equal to the number of
clients and increase if DNS seems slow. Note that DNS
performance depends too on the performance of the upstream
name&acirc; <br>
servers. The size of the DNS cache may be increased: the
hard limit is 10000 names and the default (150) is very low.
Sending SIGUSR1 to dnsmasq makes it log information which is
<br>
useful for tuning the cache size. See the NOTES section for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The built-in TFTP server is
capable of many simultaneous file transfers: the absolute
limit is related to the number of file-handles allowed to a
process and the ability of the <br>
select() system call to cope with large numbers of file
handles. If the limit is set too high using --tftp-max it
will be scaled down and the actual limit logged at start-up.
<br>
Note that more transfers are possible when the same file is
being sent than when each transfer sends a different
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to use dnsmasq to
block Web advertising by using a list of known banner-ad
servers, all resolving to 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0, in
/etc/hosts or an additional hosts <br>
file. The list can be very long, dnsmasq has been tested
successfully with one million names. That size file needs a
1GHz processor and about 60Mb of RAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNATIONALISATION <br>
Dnsmasq can be compiled to support internationalisation. To
do this, the make targets &quot;all-i18n&quot; and
&quot;install-i18n&quot; should be used instead of the
standard targets &quot;all&quot; and <br>
&quot;install&quot;. When internationalisation is compiled
in, dnsmasq will produce log messages in the local language
and support internationalised domain names (IDN). Domain
names in <br>
/etc/hosts, /etc/ethers and /etc/dnsmasq.conf which contain
non-ASCII characters will be translated to the DNS-internal
punycode representation. Note that dnsmasq determines both
<br>
the language for messages and the assumed charset for
configuration files from the LANG environment variable. This
should be set to the system default value by the script
which <br>
is responsible for starting dnsmasq. When editing the
configuration files, be careful to do so using only the
system-default locale and not user-specific one, since
dnsmasq has <br>
no direct way of determining the charset in use, and must
assume that it is the system default.</p>
