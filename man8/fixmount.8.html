<p>FIXMOUNT(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FIXMOUNT(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fixmount - fix remote mount entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fixmount [ -adervq ] [ -h name ] host ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fixmount is a variant of showmount(8) that can delete bogus
mount entries in remote mountd(8) daemons. The actions
specified by the options are performed for each host in
turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a -d -e <br>
These options work as in showmount(8) except that only
entries pertaining to the local host are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Removes those remote mount
entries on host that do not correspond to current mounts,
i.e., which are left-over from a crash or are the result of
improper mount protocol. <br>
The actuality of mounts is verified using the entries in
/etc/mtab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verify remote mounts. Similar
to -r except that only a notification message is printed for
each bogus entry found. The remote mount table is not
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Issues a command to the
remote mountd declaring that ALL of its filesystems have
been unmounted. This should be used with caution, as it
removes all remote mount entries <br>
pertaining to the local system, whether or not any
filesystems are still mounted locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet. Suppresses error
messages due to timeouts and &quot;Program not
registered&quot;, i.e., due to remote hosts not supporting
RPC or not running mountd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h name <br>
Pretend the local hostname is name. This is useful after the
local hostname has been changed and rmtab entries using the
old name remain on a remote machine. Unfortu&acirc; <br>
nately, most mountd&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be able to
successfully handle removal of such entries, so this option
is useful in combination with -v only. <br>
This option also saves time as comparisons of remotely
recorded and local hostnames by address are avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/mtab List of current mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/rmtab Backup file for
remote mount entries on NFS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
showmount(8), mtab(5), rmtab(5), mountd(8C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
No attempt is made to verify the information in /etc/mtab
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since swap file mounts are not
recorded in /etc/mtab, a heuristic specific to SunOS is used
to determine whether such a mount is actual (replacing the
string &quot;swap&quot; with &quot;root&quot; <br>
and verifying the resulting path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbolic links on the server
will cause the path in the remote entry to differ from the
one in /etc/mtab. To catch those cases, a filesystem is also
deemed mounted if its local <br>
mount point is identical to the remote entry. I.e., on a
SunOS diskless client, server:/export/share/sunos.4.1.1 is
actually /usr/share. Since the local mount point is <br>
/usr/share as well this will be handled correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to clear a stale
entry in a remote mountd after the local hostname (or
whatever reverse name resolution returns for it) has been
changed. To take care of these <br>
cases, the remote /etc/rmtab file has to be edited and
mountd restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The RPC timeouts for mountd
calls can only be changed by recompiling. The defaults are 2
seconds for client handle creation and 5 seconds for RPC
calls.</p>
