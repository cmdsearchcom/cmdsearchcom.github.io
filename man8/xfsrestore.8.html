<p>xfsrestore(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
xfsrestore(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfsrestore - XFS filesystem incremental restore utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfsrestore -h <br>
xfsrestore [ options ] -f source [ -f source ... ] dest <br>
xfsrestore [ options ] - dest <br>
xfsrestore -I [ subopt=value ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfsrestore restores filesystems from dumps produced by
xfsdump(8). Two modes of operation are available: simple and
cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is simple mode.
xfsrestore populates the specified destination directory,
dest, with the files contained in the dump media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option specifies the
cumulative mode. Successive invocations of xfsrestore are
used to apply a chronologically ordered sequence of delta
dumps to a base (level 0) dump. <br>
The contents of the filesystem at the time each dump was
produced is reproduced. This can involve adding, deleting,
renaming, linking, and unlinking files and directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A delta dump is defined as
either an incremental dump (xfsdump -l option with level
&gt; 0) or a resumed dump (xfsdump -R option). The deltas
must be applied in the order they were <br>
produced. Each delta applied must have been produced with
the previously applied delta as its base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsrestore keeps state
information in the xfsrestorehousekeepingdir, to inform
subsequent invocations when used in cumulative mode, or in
the event a restore is interrupted. To <br>
ensure that the state information can be processed, a
compatible version of xfsrestore must be used for each
subsequent invocation. Additionally, each invocation must
run on a <br>
system of the same endianness and page size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options to xfsrestore
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a housekeeping <br>
Each invocation of xfsrestore creates a directory called
xfsrestorehousekeepingdir. This directory is normally
created directly under the dest directory. The -a option
<br>
allows the operator to specify an alternate directory,
housekeeping, in which xfsrestore creates the
xfsrestorehousekeepingdir directory. When performing a
cumulative (-r <br>
option) restore or resuming (-R option) a restore, each
successive invocation must specify the same alternate
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be used for the
restore. For other drives such as DAT or 8 mm , the same
blocksize used for the xfsdump operation must be specified
to <br>
restore the tape. The default block size is 1Mb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c progname <br>
Use the specified program to alert the operator when a media
change is required. The alert program is typically a script
to send a mail or flash a window to draw the opera&acirc;
<br>
tor&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Prevents xfsrestore from
overwriting existing files in the dest directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f source [ -f source ... ] <br>
Specifies a source of the dump to be restored. This can be
the pathname of a device (such as a tape drive), a regular
file or a remote tape drive (see rmt(8)). This option <br>
must be omitted if the standard input option (a lone -
preceding the dest specification) is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Selects interactive
operation. Once the on-media directory hierarchy has been
read, an interactive dialogue is begun. The operator uses a
small set of commands to peruse <br>
the directory hierarchy, selecting files and subtrees for
extraction. The available commands are given below.
Initially nothing is selected, except for those subtrees
<br>
specified with -s command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls [arg] List the entries in the
current directory or the specified directory, or the
specified non-directory file entry. Both the entry&rsquo;s
original inode number and <br>
name are displayed. Entries that are directories are
appended with a &lsquo;/&rsquo;. Entries that have been
selected for extraction are prepended with a
&lsquo;*&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd [arg] Change the current
working directory to the specified argument, or to the
filesystem root directory if no argument is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwd Print the pathname of the
current directory, relative to the filesystem root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add [arg] The current directory
or specified file or directory within the current directory
is selected for extraction. If a directory is specified,
then it and all <br>
its descendents are selected. Entries that are selected for
extraction are prepended with a &lsquo;*&rsquo; when they
are listed by ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete [arg] The current
directory or specified file or directory within the current
directory is deselected for extraction. If a directory is
specified, then it and all <br>
its descendents are deselected. The most expedient way to
extract most of the files from a directory is to select the
directory and then deselect those files <br>
that are not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extract Ends the interactive
dialogue, and causes all selected subtrees to be
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit xfsrestore ends the
interactive dialogue and immediately exits, even if there
are files or subtrees selected for extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help List a summary of the
available commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Use the minimal tape
protocol. This option cannot be used without specifying a
blocksize to be used (see -b option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n file <br>
Allows xfsrestore to restore only files newer than file. The
modification time of file (i.e., as displayed with the ls -l
command) is compared to the inode modification <br>
time of each file on the source media (i.e., as displayed
with the ls -lc command). A file is restored from media only
if its inode modification time is greater than or <br>
equal to the modification time of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Restore file and directory
owner/group even if not root. When run with an effective
user id of root, xfsrestore restores owner and group of each
file and directory. When <br>
run with any other effective user id it does not, unless
this option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p interval <br>
Causes progress reports to be printed at intervals of
interval seconds. The interval value is approximate,
xfsrestore will delay progress reports to avoid undue
processing <br>
overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Source tape drive is a QIC
tape. QIC tapes only use a 512 byte blocksize, for which
xfsrestore must make special allowances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Selects the cumulative mode
of operation. The -a and destination options must be the
same for each invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s subtree <br>
Specifies a subtree to restore. Any number of -s options are
allowed. The restore is constrained to the union of all
subtrees specified. Each subtree is specified as a <br>
pathname relative to the restore dest. If a directory is
specified, the directory and all files beneath that
directory are restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Displays the contents of the
dump, but does not create or modify any files or
directories. It may be desirable to set the verbosity level
to silent when using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbosity <br>
-v subsys=verbosity[,subsys=verbosity,...] <br>
Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed
during the course of the restore. The verbosity argument can
be passed as either a string or an integer. If passed <br>
as a string the following values may be used: silent,
verbose, trace, debug, or nitty. If passed as an integer,
values from 0-5 may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to
<br>
the strings already listed. The value 5 can be used to
produce even more verbose debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form of this option
activates message logging across all restore subsystems. The
second form allows the message logging level to be
controlled on a per-subsystem <br>
basis. The two forms can be combined (see the example
below). The argument subsys can take one of the following
values: general, proc, drive, media, inventory, and
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to restore the root
filesystem with tracing activated for all subsystems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsrestore -v trace -f
/dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable debug-level tracing
for drive and media operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsrestore -v
drive=debug,media=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable tracing for all
subsystems, and debug level tracing for drive operations
only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsrestore -v
trace,drive=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Do not restore extended file
attributes. When restoring a filesystem managed within a DMF
environment this option should not be used. DMF stores file
migration status <br>
within extended attributes associated with each file. If
these attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
restored, files that had been in migrated state will not
<br>
be recallable by DMF. Note that dumping of extended file
attributes is also optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Change the ownership and
permissions of the destination directory to match those of
the root directory of the dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Restore DMAPI (Data
Management Application Programming Interface) event
settings. If the restored filesystem will be managed within
the same DMF environment as the original <br>
dump it is essential that the -D option be used. Otherwise
it is not usually desirable to restore these settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Prevents xfsrestore from
overwriting newer versions of files. The inode modification
time of the on-media file is compared to the inode
modification time of corresponding <br>
file in the dest directory. The file is restored only if the
on-media version is newer than the version in the dest
directory. The inode modification time of a file can be <br>
displayed with the ls -lc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Inhibit interactive operator
prompts. This option inhibits xfsrestore from prompting the
operator for verification of the selected dump as the
restore target and from <br>
prompting for any media change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Causes the xfsdump inventory
to be displayed (no restore is performed). Each time xfsdump
is used, an online inventory in /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory
is updated. This is <br>
used to determine the base for incremental dumps. It is also
useful for manually identifying a dump session to be
restored (see the -L and -S options). Suboptions to
fil&acirc; <br>
ter the inventory display are described later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Inhibits inventory update
when on-media session inventory encountered during restore.
xfsrestore opportunistically updates the online inventory
when it encounters an on- <br>
media session inventory, but only if run with an effective
user id of root and only if this option is not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Force xfsrestore to use dump
format 2 generation numbers. Normally the need for this is
determined automatically, but this option is required on the
first xfsrestore invoca&acirc; <br>
tion in the rare case that a cumulative restore begins with
a format 3 (or newer) dump and will be followed by a format
2 dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L session_label <br>
Specifies the label of the dump session to be restored. The
source media is searched for this label. It is any arbitrary
string up to 255 characters long. The label of <br>
the desired dump session can be copied from the inventory
display produced by the -I option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O options_file <br>
Insert the options contained in options_file into the
beginning of the command line. The options are specified
just as they would appear if typed into the command line. In
<br>
addition, newline characters (0 can be used as whitespace.
The options are placed before all options actually given on
the command line, just after the command name. <br>
Only one -O option can be used. Recursive use is ignored.
The destination directory cannot be specified in
options_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Force completion of an
interrupted restore session. This option is required to work
around one specific pathological scenario. When restoring a
dump session which was <br>
interrupted due to an EOM condition and no online session
inventory is available, xfsrestore cannot know when the
restore of that dump session is complete. The operator is
<br>
forced to interrupt the restore session. In that case, if
the operator tries to subsequently apply a resumed dump
(using the -r option), xfsrestore refuses to do so. The <br>
operator must tell xfsrestore to consider the base restore
complete by using this option when applying the resumed
dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Resume a previously
interrupted restore. xfsrestore can be interrupted at any
time by pressing the terminal interrupt character (see
stty(1)). Use this option to resume <br>
the restore. The -a and destination options must be the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S session_id <br>
Specifies the session UUID of the dump session to be
restored. The source media is searched for this UUID. The
UUID of the desired dump session can be copied from the <br>
inventory display produced by the -I option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Inhibits interactive dialogue
timeouts. xfsrestore prompts the operator for media changes.
This dialogue normally times out if no response is supplied.
This option pre&acirc; <br>
vents the timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X subtree <br>
Specifies a subtree to exclude. This is the converse of the
-s option. Any number of -X options are allowed. Each
subtree is specified as a pathname relative to the <br>
restore dest. If a directory is specified, the directory and
all files beneath that directory are excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y io_ring_length <br>
Specify I/O buffer ring length. xfsrestore uses a ring of
input buffers to achieve maximum throughput when restoring
from tape drives. The default ring length is 3. How&acirc;
<br>
ever, this is not currently enabled on Linux yet, making
this option benign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A lone - causes the standard
input to be read as the source of the dump to be restored.
Standard input can be a pipe from another utility (such as
xfsdump(8)) or a redi&acirc; <br>
rected file. This option cannot be used with the -f option.
The - must follow all other options, and precede the dest
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dumped filesystem is
restored into the dest directory. There is no default; the
dest must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Cumulative Restoration <br>
A base (level 0) dump and an ordered set of delta dumps can
be sequentially restored, each on top of the previous, to
reproduce the contents of the original filesystem at the
<br>
time the last delta was produced. The operator invokes
xfsrestore once for each dump. The -r option must be
specified. The dest directory must be the same for all
invocations. <br>
Each invocation leaves a directory named
xfsrestorehousekeeping in the dest directory (however, see
the -a option above). This directory contains the state
information that must <br>
be communicated between invocations. The operator must
remove this directory after the last delta has been
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsrestore also generates a
directory named orphanage in the dest directory. xfsrestore
removes this directory after completing a simple restore.
However, if orphanage is not <br>
empty, it is not removed. This can happen if files present
on the dump media are not referenced by any of the restored
directories. The orphanage has an entry for each such <br>
file. The entry name is the file&rsquo;s original inode
number, a &quot;.&quot;, and the file&rsquo;s generation
count modulo 4096 (only the lower 12 bits of the generation
count are used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsrestore does not remove the
orphanage after cumulative restores. Like the
xfsrestorehousekeeping directory, the operator must remove
it after applying all delta dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media Management <br>
A dump consists of one or more media files contained on one
or more media objects. A media file contains all or a
portion of the filesystem dump. Large filesystems are broken
<br>
up into multiple media files to minimize the impact of media
dropouts, and to accommodate media object boundaries
(end-of-media).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A media object is any storage
medium: a tape cartridge, a remote tape device (see rmt(8)),
a regular file, or the standard input (currently other
removable media drives are not <br>
supported). Tape cartridges can contain multiple media
files, which are typically separated by (in tape parlance)
file marks. If a dump spans multiple media objects, the <br>
restore must begin with the media object containing the
first media file dumped. The operator is prompted when the
next media object is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media objects can contain more
than one dump. The operator can select the desired dump by
specifying the dump label (-L option), or by specifying the
dump UUID (-S option). If <br>
neither is specified, xfsrestore scans the entire media
object, prompting the operator as each dump session is
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inventory display (-I
option) is useful for identifying the media objects
required. It is also useful for identifying a dump session.
The session UUID can be copied from <br>
the inventory display to the -S option argument to
unambiguously identify a dump session to be restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumps placed in regular files or
the standard output do not span multiple media objects, nor
do they contain multiple dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inventory <br>
Each dump session updates an inventory database in
/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory. This database can be displayed
by invoking xfsrestore with the -I option. The display uses
tabbed <br>
indentation to present the inventory hierarchically. The
first level is filesystem. The second level is session. The
third level is media stream (currently only one stream is
<br>
supported). The fourth level lists the media files
sequentially composing the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following suboptions are
available to filter the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I depth=n <br>
(where n is 1, 2, or 3) limits the hierarchical depth of the
display. When n is 1, only the filesystem information from
the inventory is displayed. When n is 2, only <br>
filesystem and session information are displayed. When n is
3, only filesystem, session and stream information are
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I level=n <br>
(where n is the dump level) limits the display to dumps of
that particular dump level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The display may be restricted to
media files contained in a specific media object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I mobjid=value <br>
(where value is a media ID) specifies the media object by
its media ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I mobjlabel=value <br>
(where value is a media label) specifies the media object by
its media label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the display can be
restricted to a specific filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I mnt=mount_point <br>
(that is, [hostname:]pathname), identifies the filesystem by
mountpoint. Specifying the hostname is optional, but may be
useful in a clustered environment where more than <br>
one host can be responsible for dumping a filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I fsid=filesystem_id <br>
identifies the filesystem by filesystem ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dev=device_pathname <br>
(that is, [hostname:]device_pathname) identifies the
filesystem by device. As with the mnt filter, specifying the
hostname is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More than one of these
suboptions, separated by commas, may be specified at the
same time to limit the display of the inventory to those
dumps of interest. However, at most four <br>
suboptions can be specified at once: one to constrain the
display hierarchy depth, one to constrain the dump level,
one to constrain the media object, and one to constrain the
<br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -I
depth=1,mobjlabel=&quot;tape 1&quot;,mnt=host1:/test_mnt
would display only the filesystem information (depth=1) for
those filesystems that were mounted on host1:/test_mnt <br>
at the time of the dump, and only those filesystems dumped
to the media object labeled &quot;tape 1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump records may be removed
(pruned) from the inventory using the xfsinvutil
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An additional media file is
placed at the end of each dump stream. This media file
contains the inventory information for the current dump
session. If the online inventory <br>
files in /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory are missing information
for the current dump session, then the inventory information
in the media file is automatically added to the files in
<br>
/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory. If you wish to incorporate the
inventory information from the media file without restoring
any data, you may do so using the -t option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsrestore -t -f /dev/tape</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful to rebuild the
inventory database if it is ever lost or corrupted. The only
caveat is that xfsrestore needs to read through the entire
dump in order to reach the <br>
inventory media file. This could become time consuming for
dump sessions with large media files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media Errors <br>
xfsdump is tolerant of media errors, but cannot do error
correction. If a media error occurs in the body of a media
file, the filesystem file represented at that point is lost.
<br>
The bad portion of the media is skipped, and the restoration
resumes at the next filesystem file after the bad portion of
the media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a media error occurs in the
beginning of the media file, the entire media file is lost.
For this reason, large dumps are broken into a number of
reasonably sized media files. <br>
The restore resumes with the next media file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quotas <br>
When xfsdump dumps a filesystem with user quotas, it creates
a file in the root of the dump called xfsdump_quotas.
xfsrestore can restore this file like any other file
included <br>
in the dump. This file can be processed by the restore
command of xfs_quota(8) to reactivate the quotas. However,
the xfsdump_quotas file contains information which may first
<br>
require modification; specifically the filesystem name and
the user ids. If you are restoring the quotas for the same
users on the same filesystem from which the dump was taken,
<br>
then no modification will be necessary. However, if you are
restoring the dump to a different filesystem, you will need
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- ensure the new filesystem is
mounted with the quota option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- modify the xfsdump_quotas file
to contain the new filesystem name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- ensure the uids in the
xfsdump_quotas file are correct</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the quota information has
been verified, the restore command of xfs_quota (8) can be
used to apply the quota limits to the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group and project quotas are
handled in a similar fashion and will be restored in files
called xfsdump_quotas_group and xfsdump_quotas_proj,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To restore the root filesystem from a locally mounted
tape:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsrestore -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restore from a remote tape,
specifying the dump session id:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsrestore -L session_1 -f
otherhost:/dev/tape /new</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restore the contents a of a
dump to another subdirectory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsrestore -f /dev/tape
/newdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy the contents of a
filesystem to another directory (see xfsdump(8)):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># xfsdump -J - / | xfsrestore -J
- /new</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The exit code is 0 on normal completion, and non-zero if an
error occurred or the restore was terminated by the
operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all verbosity levels greater
than 0 (silent) the final line of the output shows the exit
status of the restore. It is of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsdump: Restore Status:
code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where code takes one of the
following values: SUCCESS (normal completion), INTERRUPT
(interrupted), QUIT (media no longer usable), INCOMPLETE
(restore incomplete), FAULT (soft&acirc; <br>
ware error), and ERROR (resource error). Every attempt will
be made to keep both the syntax and the semantics of this
log message unchanged in future versions of xfsrestore. <br>
However, it may be necessary to refine or expand the set of
exit codes, or their interpretation at some point in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Pathnames of restored non-directory files (relative to the
dest directory) must be 1023 characters (MAXPATHLEN) or
less. Longer pathnames are discarded and a warning message
<br>
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no verify option to
xfsrestore. This would allow the operator to compare a
filesystem dump to an existing filesystem, without actually
doing a restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interactive commands (-i
option) do not understand regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the minimal rmt option is
specified, xfsrestore applies it to all remote tape sources.
The same blocksize (specified by the -b option) is used for
all these remote drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfsrestore uses the alert
