<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bbstoreaccounts - Box Backup store accounts manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bbstoreaccounts [-c config-file] command account-id
[command-specific arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bbstoreaccounts is the tool for managing accounts on the
store server. It can be used to view information related to
accounts, as well as create, change and delete accounts on
<br>
the store server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bbstoreaccounts always takes at
least 2 parameters: the command name and the account ID.
Some commands require additional parameters, and some
commands have optional parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-c config-file <br>
The configfile to use for connecting to the store. Default
is /etc/box/bbstored.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
The commands tells bbstoreaccounts what action to
perform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check account-id [fix] <br>
The check command verifies the integrity of the store
account given, and optionally fixes any corruptions. Note:
It is recommended to run the
&Acirc;&acute;simple&Acirc;&acute; check command (without
<br>
fix) before using the fix option. This gives an overview of
the extent of any problems, before attempting to fix
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create account-id disc-set
soft-limit hard-limit <br>
Creates a new store account with the parameters given. The
parameters are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account-id <br>
The ID of the new account to be created. A 32-bit
hexadecimal number. Cannot already exist on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disc-set <br>
The disc set from raidfile.conf(5) where the backups for
this client will be stored. A number. Each RAID-file set has
a number in raidfile.conf. This number is
what&Acirc;&acute;s <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soft-limit <br>
The soft limit is the amount of storage that the server will
guarantee to be available for storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hard-limit <br>
The amount of storage that the the server will allow, before
rejecting uploads, and starting to eliminate old and deleted
files to get back down to soft-limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete account-id [yes] <br>
Deletes the account from the store server completely.
Removes all backups and deletes all references to the
account in the config files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete will ask for confirmation
from the user, when called. Using the yes flag, eliminates
that need. This is useful when deleting accounts from within
a script or some <br>
other automated means. 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info account-id <br>
Display information about the given account. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[root]# bbstoreaccounts info 1
<br>
Account ID: 00000001 <br>
Last object ID: 58757 <br>
Blocks used: 9864063 (38531.50Mb) <br>
Blocks used by old files: 62058 (242.41Mb) <br>
Blocks used by deleted files: 34025 (132.91Mb) <br>
Blocks used by directories: 6679 (26.09Mb) <br>
Block soft limit: 11796480 (46080.00Mb) <br>
Block hard limit: 13107200 (51200.00Mb) <br>
Client store marker: 1139559852000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explanation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Account ID <br>
The account ID being displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Last Object ID <br>
A counter that keeps track of the objects that have been
backed up. This number refers to the last file that was
written to the store. The ID is displayed as a decimal <br>
number, and the object ID can be converted to a path name to
a file as follows: convert the number to hex (e.g.: 58757
=&gt; 0xE585); The last backed up file will be <br>
(relative from the client&Acirc;&acute;s store root):
e5/o85.rfw. Longer numbers infer more directories in the
structure, so as an example 3952697264 as the last object ID
gives <br>
0xEB995FB0, which translates to a backup pathname of
eb/99/5f/ob0.rfw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks used <br>
The number of blocks used by the store. The size in Mb
depends on the number of blocks, as well as the block size
for the disc set given in raidfile.conf(5). In this case
<br>
the block size is 4096.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks used by old files <br>
The number of blocks occupied by files that have newer
versions in the store. This data is at risk for being
removed during housekeeping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks used by deleted files
<br>
The number of blocks used by files that have been deleted on
the client. This data is at risk for being removed during
housekeeping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks used by directories <br>
The number of blocks used by directories in the store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Block soft limit <br>
The soft limit in blocks. The soft limit is the maximum
guaranteed storage space available to the account. When
housekeeping starts, and the old and deleted files are <br>
removed, they are removed in chronological order (oldest
first), until the data used is less than the soft limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Block hard limit <br>
The hard limit in blocks. The hard limit is the most amount
of storage the server will allow in an account. Any data
above this amount will be rejected. Housekeeping will <br>
reduce the storage use, so more data can be uploaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client store marker <br>
bbstored(8) uses this number to determine if it needs to
rescan the entire store. If this number is different from
the last time it checked, a rescan will take place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setlimit account-id soft-limit
hard-limit <br>
Changes the storage space allocation for the given account.
No server restart is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account-id <br>
The ID of the account to be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soft-limit <br>
The soft limit is the amount of storage that the server will
guarantee to be available for storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hard-limit <br>
The amount of storage that the the server will allow before
rejecting uploads and starting to eliminate old and deleted
files to get back down to soft-limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Create an account with ID 3af on disc set 0, with a 20GB
soft-limit and a 22GB hard-limit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bbstoreaccounts create 3af 0 20G
22G</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alter existing account ID 20 to
have a 50GB soft-limit and a 55GB hard-limit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bbstoreaccounts setlimit 20 50G
55G</p>
