<p>DNSSEC-IMPORTKEY(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-IMPORTKEY(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnssec-importkey - Import DNSKEY records from external
systems so they can be managed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnssec-importkey [-K directory] [-L ttl] [-P date/offset]
[-D date/offset] [-h] [-v level] [-V] {keyfile}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-importkey {-f filename}
[-K directory] [-L ttl] [-P date/offset] [-D date/offset]
[-h] [-v level] [-V] [dnsname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnssec-importkey reads a public DNSKEY record and generates
a pair of .key/.private files. The DNSKEY record may be read
from an existing .key file, in which case a corresponding
<br>
.private file will be generated, or it may be read from any
other file or from the standard input, in which case both
.key and .private files will be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newly-created .private file
does not contain private key data, and cannot be used for
signing. However, having a .private file makes it possible
to set publication (-P) and <br>
deletion (-D) times for the key, which means the public key
can be added to and removed from the DNSKEY RRset on
schedule even if the true private key is stored offline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f filename <br>
Zone file mode: instead of a public keyfile name, the
argument is the DNS domain name of a zone master file, which
can be read from file. If the domain name is the same as
<br>
file, then it may be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file is set to &quot;-&quot;,
then the zone data is read from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K directory <br>
Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L ttl <br>
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is
converted into a DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a
zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there
was <br>
already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing
TTL would take precedence. Setting the default TTL to 0 or
none removes it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Emit usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v level <br>
Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Prints version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMING OPTIONS <br>
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;, it is interpreted as an
offset from the present time. For convenience, <br>
if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes
&rsquo;y&rsquo;, &rsquo;mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;w&rsquo;,
&rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;mi&rsquo;, then
the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour
days, ignoring leap years), <br>
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is
computed in seconds. To explicitly prevent a date from being
<br>
set, use &rsquo;none&rsquo; or &rsquo;never&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone.
After that date, the key will be included in the zone but
will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D date/offset <br>
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that
date, the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It
may remain in the key repository, however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
A keyfile can be designed by the key identification
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii or the full file name Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key
as generated by dnssec-keygen(8).</p>
