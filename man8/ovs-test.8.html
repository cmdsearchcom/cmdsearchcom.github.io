<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ovs-test - check Linux drivers for performance, vlan and L3
tunneling problems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ovs-test -s port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-test -c server1 server2 [-b
targetbandwidth] [-i testinterval] [-d] [-l vlantag] [-t
tunnelmodes]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common options: <br>
[-h | --help] [-V | --version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ovs-test program may be used to check for problems
sending 802.1Q or GRE traffic that Open vSwitch may uncover.
These problems, for example, can occur when Open vSwitch is
<br>
used to send 802.1Q traffic through physical interfaces
running certain drivers of certain Linux kernel versions. To
run a test, configure IP addresses on server1 and server2
for <br>
interfaces you intended to test. These interfaces could also
be already configured OVS bridges that have a physical
interface attached to them. Then, on one of the nodes, run
<br>
ovs-test in server mode and on the other node run it in
client mode. The client will connect to ovs-test server and
schedule tests between both of them. The ovs-test client
will <br>
perform UDP and TCP tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDP tests can report packet loss
and achieved bandwidth for various datagram sizes. By
default target bandwidth for UDP tests is 1Mbit/s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP tests report only achieved
bandwidth, because kernel TCP stack takes care of flow
control and packet loss. TCP tests are essential to detect
potential TSO related issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine whether Open
vSwitch is encountering any problems, the user must compare
packet loss and achieved bandwidth in a setup where traffic
is being directly sent and in <br>
one where it is not. If in the 802.1Q or L3 tunneled tests
both ovs-test processes are unable to communicate or the
achieved bandwidth is much lower compared to direct setup,
<br>
then, most likely, Open vSwitch has encountered a
pre-existing kernel or driver bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of the types of
problems that may be encountered are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When NICs use
VLAN stripping on receive they must pass a pointer to a
vlan_group when reporting the stripped tag to the networking
core. If no vlan_group is in use then <br>
some drivers just drop the extracted tag. Drivers are
supposed to only enable stripping if a vlan_group is
registered but not all of them do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On receive, some
drivers handle priority tagged packets specially and
don&rsquo;t pass the tag onto the network stack at all, so
Open vSwitch never has a chance to see it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some drivers
size their receive buffers based on whether a vlan_group is
enabled, meaning that a maximum size packet with a VLAN tag
will not fit if no vlan_group is con&acirc; <br>
figured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On transmit,
some drivers expect that VLAN acceleration will be used if
it is available, which can only be done if a vlan_group is
configured. In these cases, the driver <br>
may fail to parse the packet and correctly setup checksum
offloading or TSO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client Mode <br>
An ovs-test client will connect to two ovs-test servers and
will ask them to exchange test traffic. It is also possible
to spawn an ovs-test server automatically from the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Mode <br>
To conduct tests, two ovs-test servers must be running on
two different hosts where the client can connect. The actual
test traffic is exchanged only between both ovs-test <br>
servers. It is recommended that both servers have their IP
addresses in the same subnet, otherwise one would have to
make sure that routing is set up correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-s port <br>
--server port <br>
Run in server mode and wait for the client to establish XML
RPC Control Connection on this TCP port. It is recommended
to have ethtool(8) installed on the server so that <br>
it could retrieve information about the NIC driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c server1 server2 <br>
--client server1 server2 <br>
Run in client mode and schedule tests between server1 and
server2, where each server must be given in the following
format - OuterIP[:OuterPort],InnerIP[/Mask][:Inner&acirc;
<br>
Port]. The OuterIP must be already assigned to the physical
interface which is going to be tested. This is the IP
address where client will try to establish XML RPC
con&acirc; <br>
nection. If OuterIP is 127.0.0.1 then client will
automatically spawn a local instance of ovs-test server.
OuterPort is TCP port where server is listening for incoming
<br>
XML/RPC control connections to schedule tests (by default it
is 15531). The ovs-test will automatically assign
InnerIP[/Mask] to the interfaces that will be created on the
<br>
fly for testing purposes. It is important that
InnerIP[/Mask] does not interfere with already existing IP
addresses on both ovs-test servers and client. InnerPort is
port <br>
which will be used by server to listen for test traffic that
will be encapsulated (by default it is 15532).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b targetbandwidth <br>
--bandwidth targetbandwidth <br>
Target bandwidth for UDP tests. The targetbandwidth must be
given in bits per second. It is possible to use postfix M or
K to alter the target bandwidth magnitude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i testinterval <br>
--interval testinterval <br>
How long each test should run. By default 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints version information to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test Modes <br>
The following test modes are supported by ovs-test. It is
possible to combine multiple of them in a single ovs-test
invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
--direct <br>
Perform direct tests between both OuterIP addresses. These
tests could be used as a reference to compare 802.1Q or L3
tunneling test results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l vlantag <br>
--vlan-tag vlantag <br>
Perform 802.1Q tests between both servers. These tests will
create a temporary OVS bridge, if necessary, and attach a
VLAN tagged port to it for testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tunnelmodes <br>
--tunnel-modes tunnelmodes <br>
Perform L3 tunneling tests. The given argument is a comma
separated string that specifies all the L3 tunnel modes that
should be tested (e.g. gre). The L3 tunnels are ter&acirc;
<br>
minated on interface that has the OuterIP address
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
On host 1.2.3.4 start ovs-test in server mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-test -s 15531</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On host 1.2.3.5 start ovs-test
in client mode and do direct, VLAN and GRE tests between
both nodes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovs-test -c 127.0.0.1,1.1.1.1/30
1.2.3.4,1.1.1.2/30 -d -l 123 -t gre</p>
