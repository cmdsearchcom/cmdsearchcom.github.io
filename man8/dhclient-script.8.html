dhclient-script - DHCP client network configuration script
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The DHCP client network configuration script is invoked from time to time by
  <b>dhclient(8)</b>. This script is used by the dhcp client to set each
  interface's initial configuration prior to requesting an address, to test the
  address once it has been offered, and to set the interface's final
  configuration once a lease has been acquired. If no lease is acquired, the
  script is used to test predefined leases, if any, and also called once if no
  valid lease can be identified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This script is not meant to be customized by the end user. If local
  customizations are needed, they should be possible using the enter and exit
  hooks provided (see HOOKS for details). These hooks will allow the user to
  override the default behaviour of the client in creating a
  <b>/etc/resolv.conf</b> file, and to handle DHCP options not handled by
  default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
No standard client script exists for some operating systems, even though the
  actual client may work, so a pioneering user may well need to create a new
  script or modify an existing one. In general, customizations specific to a
  particular computer should be done in the <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> file.
  If you find that you can't make such a customization without customizing
  <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> or using the enter and exit hooks, please
  submit a bug report.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOOKS"><a class="selflink" href="#HOOKS">HOOKS</a></h1>
When it starts, the client script first defines a shell function,
  <b>make_resolv_conf ,</b> which is later used to create the
  <b>/etc/resolv.conf</b> file. To override the default behaviour, redefine this
  function in the enter hook script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On after defining the make_resolv_conf function, the client script checks for
  the presence of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks</b> script,
  and if present, it invokes the script inline, using the Bourne shell
  &#x00B4;.&#x00B4; command. The entire environment documented under OPERATION
  is available to this script, which may modify the environment if needed to
  change the behaviour of the script. If an error occurs during the execution of
  the script, it can set the exit_status variable to a nonzero value, and
  <b>/usr/sbin/dhclient-script</b> will exit with that error code immediately
  after the client script exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After all processing has completed, <b>/usr/sbin/dhclient-script</b> checks for
  the presence of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks</b> script,
  which if present is invoked using the &#x00B4;.&#x00B4; command. The exit
  status of dhclient-script will be passed to dhclient-exit-hooks in the
  exit_status shell variable, and will always be zero if the script succeeded at
  the task for which it was invoked. The rest of the environment as described
  previously for dhclient-enter-hooks is also present. The
  <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks</b> script can modify the valid of
  exit_status to change the exit status of dhclient-script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Immediately after dhclient brings an interface UP with a new IP address, subnet
  mask, and routes, in the REBOOT/BOUND states, it will check for the existence
  of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-up-hooks</b> script, and source it if
  found. This script can handle DHCP options in the environment that are not
  handled by default. A per-interface. <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-up-hooks</b>
  script will override the generic script and be sourced when interface $IF has
  been brought up.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Immediately before dhclient brings an interface DOWN, removing its IP address,
  subnet mask, and routes, in the STOP/RELEASE states, it will check for the
  existence of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-down-hooks</b> script, and
  source it if found. This script can handle DHCP options in the environment
  that are not handled by default. A per-interface
  <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-down-hooks</b> script will override the generic
  script and be sourced when interface $IF is about to be brought down.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#OPERATION">OPERATION</a></h1>
When dhclient needs to invoke the client configuration script, it defines a set
  of variables in the environment, and then invokes
  <b>/usr/sbin/dhclient-script.</b> In all cases, $reason is set to the name of
  the reason why the script has been invoked. The following reasons are
  currently defined: MEDIUM, PREINIT, BOUND, RENEW, REBIND, REBOOT, EXPIRE,
  FAIL, STOP, RELEASE, NBI and TIMEOUT.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MEDIUM"><a class="selflink" href="#MEDIUM">MEDIUM</a></h1>
The DHCP client is requesting that an interface's media type be set. The
  interface name is passed in $interface, and the media type is passed in
  $medium.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREINIT"><a class="selflink" href="#PREINIT">PREINIT</a></h1>
The DHCP client is requesting that an interface be configured as required in
  order to send packets prior to receiving an actual address. For clients which
  use the BSD socket library, this means configuring the interface with an IP
  address of 0.0.0.0 and a broadcast address of 255.255.255.255. For other
  clients, it may be possible to simply configure the interface up without
  actually giving it an IP address at all. The interface name is passed in
  $interface, and the media type in $medium.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an IP alias has been declared in dhclient.conf, its address will be passed in
  $alias_ip_address, and that ip alias should be deleted from the interface,
  along with any routes to it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BOUND"><a class="selflink" href="#BOUND">BOUND</a></h1>
The DHCP client has done an initial binding to a new address. The new ip address
  is passed in $new_ip_address, and the interface name is passed in $interface.
  The media type is passed in $medium. Any options acquired from the server are
  passed using the option name described in <b>dhcp-options</b>, except that
  dashes (&#x00B4;-&#x00B4;) are replaced by underscores (&#x00B4;_&#x00B4;) in
  order to make valid shell variables, and the variable names start with new_.
  So for example, the new subnet mask would be passed in $new_subnet_mask. The
  options that the client explicitly requested via a PRL or ORO option are
  passed with the same option name as above but prepended with requested_ and
  with a value of 1, or example requested_subnet_mask=1. No such variable is
  defined for options not requested by the client or options that don't require
  a request option, such as the ip address (*_ip_address) or expiration time
  (*_expiry).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before actually configuring the address, dhclient-script should somehow ARP for
  it and exit with a nonzero status if it receives a reply. In this case, the
  client will send a DHCPDECLINE message to the server and acquire a different
  address. This may also be done in the RENEW, REBIND, or REBOOT states, but is
  not required, and indeed may not be desirable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a binding has been completed, a lot of network parameters are likely to
  need to be set up. A new /etc/resolv.conf needs to be created, using the
  values of $new_domain_name and $new_domain_name_servers (which may list more
  than one server, separated by spaces). A default route should be set using
  $new_routers, and static routes may need to be set up using
  $new_static_routes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an IP alias has been declared, it must be set up here. The alias IP address
  will be written as $alias_ip_address, and other DHCP options that are set for
  the alias (e.g., subnet mask) will be passed in variables named as described
  previously except starting with $alias_ instead of $new_. Care should be taken
  that the alias IP address not be used if it is identical to the bound IP
  address ($new_ip_address), since the other alias parameters may be incorrect
  in this case.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RENEW"><a class="selflink" href="#RENEW">RENEW</a></h1>
When a binding has been renewed, the script is called as in BOUND, except that
  in addition to all the variables starting with $new_, and $requested_ there is
  another set of variables starting with $old_. Persistent settings that may
  have changed need to be deleted - for example, if a local route to the bound
  address is being configured, the old local route should be deleted. If the
  default route has changed, the old default route should be deleted. If the
  static routes have changed, the old ones should be deleted. Otherwise,
  processing can be done as with BOUND.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REBIND"><a class="selflink" href="#REBIND">REBIND</a></h1>
The DHCP client has rebound to a new DHCP server. This can be handled as with
  RENEW, except that if the IP address has changed, the ARP table should be
  cleared.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REBOOT"><a class="selflink" href="#REBOOT">REBOOT</a></h1>
The DHCP client has successfully reacquired its old address after a reboot. This
  can be processed as with BOUND.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXPIRE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXPIRE">EXPIRE</a></h1>
The DHCP client has failed to renew its lease or acquire a new one, and the
  lease has expired. The IP address must be relinquished, and all related
  parameters should be deleted, as in RENEW and REBIND.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FAIL"><a class="selflink" href="#FAIL">FAIL</a></h1>
The DHCP client has been unable to contact any DHCP servers, and any leases that
  have been tested have not proved to be valid. The parameters from the last
  lease tested should be deconfigured. This can be handled in the same way as
  EXPIRE.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="STOP"><a class="selflink" href="#STOP">STOP</a></h1>
The dhclient has been informed to shut down gracefully, the dhclient-script
  should unconfigure or shutdown the interface as appropriate.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RELEASE"><a class="selflink" href="#RELEASE">RELEASE</a></h1>
The dhclient has been executed using the -r flag, indicating that the
  administrator wishes it to release its lease(s). dhclient-script should
  unconfigure or shutdown the interface.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NBI"><a class="selflink" href="#NBI">NBI</a></h1>
No-Broadcast-Interfaces...dhclient was unable to find any interfaces upon which
  it believed it should commence DHCP. What dhclient-script should do in this
  situation is entirely up to the implementor.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TIMEOUT"><a class="selflink" href="#TIMEOUT">TIMEOUT</a></h1>
The DHCP client has been unable to contact any DHCP servers. However, an old
  lease has been identified, and its parameters have been passed in as with
  BOUND. The client configuration script should test these parameters and, if it
  has reason to believe they are valid, should exit with a value of zero. If
  not, it should exit with a nonzero value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The usual way to test a lease is to set up the network as with REBIND (since
  this may be called to test more than one lease) and then ping the first router
  defined in $routers. If a response is received, the lease must be valid for
  the network to which the interface is currently connected. It would be more
  complete to try to ping all of the routers listed in $new_routers, as well as
  those listed in $new_static_routes, but current scripts do not do this.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
Each operating system should generally have its own script file, although the
  script files for similar operating systems may be similar or even identical.
  The script files included in Internet Systems Consortium DHCP distribution
  appear in the distribution tree under client/scripts, and bear the names of
  the operating systems on which they are intended to work.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
If more than one interface is being used, there's no obvious way to avoid
  clashes between server-supplied configuration parameters - for example, the
  stock dhclient-script rewrites /etc/resolv.conf. If more than one interface is
  being configured, /etc/resolv.conf will be repeatedly initialized to the
  values provided by one server, and then the other. Assuming the information
  provided by both servers is valid, this shouldn't cause any real problems, but
  it could be confusing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, if dhclient was compiled with libcap-ng support, dhclient drops most
  capabilities immediately upon startup. While more secure, this greatly
  restricts the additional actions that hooks in dhclient-script can take. For
  example, any daemons that dhclient-script starts or restarts will inherit the
  restricted capabilities as well, which may interfere with their correct
  operation. Thus, the <b>-nc</b> option can be used to prevent dhclient from
  dropping capabilities.
