<p>dhclient-script(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
dhclient-script(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dhclient-script - DHCP client network configuration
script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The DHCP client network configuration script is invoked from
time to time by dhclient(8). This script is used by the dhcp
client to set each interface&rsquo;s initial configuration
<br>
prior to requesting an address, to test the address once it
has been offered, and to set the interface&rsquo;s final
configuration once a lease has been acquired. If no lease is
<br>
acquired, the script is used to test predefined leases, if
any, and also called once if no valid lease can be
identified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script is not meant to be
customized by the end user. If local customizations are
needed, they should be possible using the enter and exit
hooks provided (see HOOKS for <br>
details). These hooks will allow the user to override the
default behaviour of the client in creating a
/etc/resolv.conf file, and to handle DHCP options not
handled by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No standard client script exists
for some operating systems, even though the actual client
may work, so a pioneering user may well need to create a new
script or modify an exist&acirc; <br>
ing one. In general, customizations specific to a particular
computer should be done in the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file.
If you find that you can&rsquo;t make such a customization
<br>
without customizing /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf or using the
enter and exit hooks, please submit a bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOOKS <br>
When it starts, the client script first defines a shell
function, make_resolv_conf , which is later used to create
the /etc/resolv.conf file. To override the default
behaviour, <br>
redefine this function in the enter hook script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On after defining the
make_resolv_conf function, the client script checks for the
presence of an executable /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks
script, and if present, it invokes the <br>
script inline, using the Bourne shell
&Acirc;&acute;.&Acirc;&acute; command. The entire
environment documented under OPERATION is available to this
script, which may modify the environment if needed to <br>
change the behaviour of the script. If an error occurs
during the execution of the script, it can set the
exit_status variable to a nonzero value, and
/usr/sbin/dhclient-script <br>
will exit with that error code immediately after the client
script exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After all processing has
completed, /usr/sbin/dhclient-script checks for the presence
of an executable /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks script, which
if present is invoked using the <br>
&Acirc;&acute;.&Acirc;&acute; command. The exit status of
dhclient-script will be passed to dhclient-exit-hooks in the
exit_status shell variable, and will always be zero if the
script succeeded at the <br>
task for which it was invoked. The rest of the environment
as described previously for dhclient-enter-hooks is also
present. The /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks script can
mod&acirc; <br>
ify the valid of exit_status to change the exit status of
dhclient-script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Immediately after dhclient
brings an interface UP with a new IP address, subnet mask,
and routes, in the REBOOT/BOUND states, it will check for
the existence of an executable <br>
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-up-hooks script, and source it if found.
This script can handle DHCP options in the environment that
are not handled by default. A per-interface. <br>
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-up-hooks script will override the
generic script and be sourced when interface $IF has been
brought up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Immediately before dhclient
brings an interface DOWN, removing its IP address, subnet
mask, and routes, in the STOP/RELEASE states, it will check
for the existence of an exe&acirc; <br>
cutable /etc/dhcp/dhclient-down-hooks script, and source it
if found. This script can handle DHCP options in the
environment that are not handled by default. A per-interface
<br>
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-down-hooks script will override the
generic script and be sourced when interface $IF is about to
be brought down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
When dhclient needs to invoke the client configuration
script, it defines a set of variables in the environment,
and then invokes /usr/sbin/dhclient-script. In all cases,
$rea&acirc; <br>
son is set to the name of the reason why the script has been
invoked. The following reasons are currently defined:
MEDIUM, PREINIT, BOUND, RENEW, REBIND, REBOOT, EXPIRE, FAIL,
<br>
STOP, RELEASE, NBI and TIMEOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEDIUM <br>
The DHCP client is requesting that an interface&rsquo;s
media type be set. The interface name is passed in
$interface, and the media type is passed in $medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREINIT <br>
The DHCP client is requesting that an interface be
configured as required in order to send packets prior to
receiving an actual address. For clients which use the BSD
socket <br>
library, this means configuring the interface with an IP
address of 0.0.0.0 and a broadcast address of
255.255.255.255. For other clients, it may be possible to
simply config&acirc; <br>
ure the interface up without actually giving it an IP
address at all. The interface name is passed in $interface,
and the media type in $medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an IP alias has been declared
in dhclient.conf, its address will be passed in
$alias_ip_address, and that ip alias should be deleted from
the interface, along with any routes <br>
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOUND <br>
The DHCP client has done an initial binding to a new
address. The new ip address is passed in $new_ip_address,
and the interface name is passed in $interface. The media
type <br>
is passed in $medium. Any options acquired from the server
are passed using the option name described in dhcp-options,
except that dashes (&Acirc;&acute;-&Acirc;&acute;) are
replaced by underscores <br>
(&Acirc;&acute;_&Acirc;&acute;) in order to make valid shell
variables, and the variable names start with new_. So for
example, the new subnet mask would be passed in
$new_subnet_mask. The options that <br>
the client explicitly requested via a PRL or ORO option are
passed with the same option name as above but prepended with
requested_ and with a value of 1, or example <br>
requested_subnet_mask=1. No such variable is defined for
options not requested by the client or options that
don&rsquo;t require a request option, such as the ip address
<br>
(*_ip_address) or expiration time (*_expiry).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before actually configuring the
address, dhclient-script should somehow ARP for it and exit
with a nonzero status if it receives a reply. In this case,
the client will send a <br>
DHCPDECLINE message to the server and acquire a different
address. This may also be done in the RENEW, REBIND, or
REBOOT states, but is not required, and indeed may not be
<br>
desirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a binding has been
completed, a lot of network parameters are likely to need to
be set up. A new /etc/resolv.conf needs to be created, using
the values of $new_domain_name <br>
and $new_domain_name_servers (which may list more than one
server, separated by spaces). A default route should be set
using $new_routers, and static routes may need to be set
<br>
up using $new_static_routes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an IP alias has been
declared, it must be set up here. The alias IP address will
be written as $alias_ip_address, and other DHCP options that
are set for the alias (e.g., <br>
subnet mask) will be passed in variables named as described
previously except starting with $alias_ instead of $new_.
Care should be taken that the alias IP address not be used
<br>
if it is identical to the bound IP address
($new_ip_address), since the other alias parameters may be
incorrect in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RENEW <br>
When a binding has been renewed, the script is called as in
BOUND, except that in addition to all the variables starting
with $new_, and $requested_ there is another set of
vari&acirc; <br>
ables starting with $old_. Persistent settings that may have
changed need to be deleted - for example, if a local route
to the bound address is being configured, the old local <br>
route should be deleted. If the default route has changed,
the old default route should be deleted. If the static
routes have changed, the old ones should be deleted.
Other&acirc; <br>
wise, processing can be done as with BOUND.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REBIND <br>
The DHCP client has rebound to a new DHCP server. This can
be handled as with RENEW, except that if the IP address has
changed, the ARP table should be cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REBOOT <br>
The DHCP client has successfully reacquired its old address
after a reboot. This can be processed as with BOUND.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPIRE <br>
The DHCP client has failed to renew its lease or acquire a
new one, and the lease has expired. The IP address must be
relinquished, and all related parameters should be <br>
deleted, as in RENEW and REBIND.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAIL <br>
The DHCP client has been unable to contact any DHCP servers,
and any leases that have been tested have not proved to be
valid. The parameters from the last lease tested should <br>
be deconfigured. This can be handled in the same way as
EXPIRE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STOP <br>
The dhclient has been informed to shut down gracefully, the
dhclient-script should unconfigure or shutdown the interface
as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELEASE <br>
The dhclient has been executed using the -r flag, indicating
that the administrator wishes it to release its lease(s).
dhclient-script should unconfigure or shutdown the
inter&acirc; <br>
face.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NBI <br>
No-Broadcast-Interfaces...dhclient was unable to find any
interfaces upon which it believed it should commence DHCP.
What dhclient-script should do in this situation is entirely
<br>
up to the implementor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMEOUT <br>
The DHCP client has been unable to contact any DHCP servers.
However, an old lease has been identified, and its
parameters have been passed in as with BOUND. The client
con&acirc; <br>
figuration script should test these parameters and, if it
has reason to believe they are valid, should exit with a
value of zero. If not, it should exit with a nonzero
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual way to test a lease is
to set up the network as with REBIND (since this may be
called to test more than one lease) and then ping the first
router defined in $routers. <br>
If a response is received, the lease must be valid for the
network to which the interface is currently connected. It
would be more complete to try to ping all of the routers
<br>
listed in $new_routers, as well as those listed in
$new_static_routes, but current scripts do not do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Each operating system should generally have its own script
file, although the script files for similar operating
systems may be similar or even identical. The script files
<br>
included in Internet Systems Consortium DHCP distribution
appear in the distribution tree under client/scripts, and
bear the names of the operating systems on which they are
<br>
intended to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If more than one interface is being used, there&rsquo;s no
obvious way to avoid clashes between server-supplied
configuration parameters - for example, the stock
dhclient-script <br>
rewrites /etc/resolv.conf. If more than one interface is
being configured, /etc/resolv.conf will be repeatedly
initialized to the values provided by one server, and then
the <br>
other. Assuming the information provided by both servers is
valid, this shouldn&rsquo;t cause any real problems, but it
could be confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, if dhclient was
compiled with libcap-ng support, dhclient drops most
capabilities immediately upon startup. While more secure,
this greatly restricts the additional <br>
actions that hooks in dhclient-script can take. For example,
any daemons that dhclient-script starts or restarts will
inherit the restricted capabilities as well, which may <br>
interfere with their correct operation. Thus, the -nc option
can be used to prevent dhclient from dropping
capabilities.</p>
