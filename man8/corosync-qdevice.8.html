<p>COROSYNC-QDEVICE(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
COROSYNC-QDEVICE(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
corosync-qdevice - QDevice daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
corosync-qdevice [-dfh] [-S
option=value[,option2=value2,...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
corosync-qdevice is a daemon running on each node of a
cluster. It provides a configured number of votes to the
quorum subsystem based on a third-party arbitrator&rsquo;s
decision. Its <br>
primary use is to allow a cluster to sustain more node
failures than standard quorum rules allow. It is recommended
for clusters with an even number of nodes and highly
recom&acirc; <br>
mended for 2 node clusters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Forcefully turn on debug information without the need to
change corosync.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not daemonize, run in the
foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show short help text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Set advanced settings
described in its own section below. This option
shouldn&rsquo;t be generally used because most of the
options are not safe to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
corosync-qdevice reads its configuration from corosync.conf
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main configuration is within
quorum.device sub-key. Each model also has its own
configuration within a similarly named sub-key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">model Specifies the model to be
used. This parameter is required. corosync-qdevice is
modular and is able to support multiple different models.
The model basically defines what <br>
type of arbitrator is used. Currently only net is
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout <br>
Specifies how often should corosync-qdevice should call the
votequorum_poll function. It is also used by the net model
to adjust its hearbeat timeout. It is recommended <br>
that you don&rsquo;t change this value. Default is
10000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync_timeout <br>
Specifies how often corosync-qdevice should call the
votequorum_poll function during a sync phase. It is
recommended that you don&rsquo;t change this value. Default
is 30000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">votes The number of votes
provided to the cluster by qdevice. Default is
(number_of_nodes - 1) or generally sum(votes_per_node) -
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quorum.device.net holds the
configuration for model &rsquo;net&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tls Can be one of on, off or
required and specifies if tls should be used. on means a
connection with TLS is attempted first, but if the server
doesn&rsquo;t advertise TLS support <br>
then non-TLS will be used. off is used then TLS is not
required and it&rsquo;s then not even tried. This mode is
the only one which doesn&rsquo;t need a properly initialized
NSS <br>
database. required means TLS is required and if the server
doesn&rsquo;t support TLS, qdevice will exit with error
message. Default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host Specifies the IP address or
host name of the qnetd server to be used. This parameter is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port Specifies TCP port of qnetd
server. Default is 5403.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">algorithm <br>
Decision algorithm. Can be one of the ffsplit or lms.
(actually there are also test and 2nodelms , both of which
are mainly for developers and shouldn&rsquo;t be used for
pro&acirc; <br>
duction clusters). For a description of what each algorithm
means and how the algorithms differ see their individual
sections. Default value is ffsplit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tie-breaker <br>
can be one of lowest, highest or valid_node_id (number)
values. It&rsquo;s used as a fallback if qdevice has to
decide between two or more equal partitions. lowest means
the <br>
partition with the lowest node id is chosen. highest means
the partition with highest node id is chosen. And
valid_node_id means that the partition containing the node
<br>
with the given node id is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect_timeout <br>
Timeout when corosync-qdevice is trying to connect to
corosync-qnetd host. Default is 0.8 *
quorum.sync_timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force_ip_version <br>
can be one of 0|4|6 and forces the software to use the given
IP version. 0 (default value) means IPv6 is prefered and
IPv4 should be used as a fallback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging configuration is within
the logging directive. corosync-qdevice parses and supports
most of the options with exception of to_logfile, logfile
and logfile_priority. The <br>
logger_subsys sub-directive can be also used if subsys is
set to QDEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For corosync-qdevice to work
correctly, the nodelist directive has to be used and
properly configured. Also the net model requires that
totem.cluster_name option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODEL NET TLS CONFIGURATION <br>
For model net to work using TLS, it&rsquo;s necessary to
create the NSS database, import Qnetd CA certificate, and
get/distribute a valid client certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pcs is used (recommended) the
following steps are not needed because pcs does them
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">corosync-qdevice-net-certutil is
the tool to perform required actions semi-automatically.
Please consult the help output of it and its man page. For a
first time configuration it <br>
may make sense to start with the -Q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If TLS is not required just edit
corosync.conf file and set quorum.device.net.tls to off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODEL NET ALGORITHMS <br>
Algorithms are used to change behavior of how corosync-qnetd
provides votes to a given node/partition. Currently there
are two algorithms supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ffsplit <br>
This one makes sense only for clusters with even number of
nodes. It provides exactly one vote to the partition with
the highest number of active nodes. If there are two <br>
exactly similar partitions, it provides its vote to the
partition that has the most clients connected to the qnetd
server. If this number is also equal, then the tie- <br>
breaker is used. It is able to transition its vote if the
currently active partition becomes partitioned and a
non-active partition still has at least 50% of the active
<br>
nodes. Because of this, a vote is not provided if the qnetd
connection is not active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this algorithm it&rsquo;s
required to set the number of votes per node to 1 (default)
and the qdevice number of votes has to be also 1. This is
achieved by setting quo&acirc; <br>
rum.device.votes key in corosync.conf file to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lms Last-man-standing. If the
node is the only one left in the cluster that can see the
qnetd server then we return a vote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one node can see
the qnetd server but some nodes can&rsquo;t see each other
then the cluster is divided up into &rsquo;partitions&rsquo;
based on their ring_id and this algo&acirc; <br>
rithm returns a vote to the largest active partition or, if
there is more than 1 equal partiton, the partition that
contains the tie_breaker node (lowest, highest, etc). <br>
For LMS to work, the number of qdevice votes has to be set
to default (so just delete quorum.device.votes key from
corosync.conf).</p>
