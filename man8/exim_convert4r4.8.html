This script is provided to assist in updating Exim configuration files. It reads
  an Exim 3 configuration file on the standard input, and writes a modified file
  on the standard output. It also writes comments about what it has done to the
  standard error file. It assumes that the input is a valid Exim 3 configuration
  file. A typical call to the conversion script might be
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>exim_convert4r4 &lt; /etc/exim/exim.conf &gt; /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.new</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The output file <b>MUST</b> be checked and tested before trying to use it on a
  live system. The conversion script is just an aid which does a lot of the
  &#x201C;grunt work&#x201D;. It does not guarantee to produce an Exim 4
  configuration that behaves exactly the same as the Exim 3 configuration it
  reads.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each option change in the new file is preceded by an identifying comment. In
  fact, the conversion script tends to make quite a mess of your configuration,
  and you should expect to go through it afterwards and tidy it up by hand.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unless you are running a very straightforward configuration, the automatic
  conversion is likely to generate a non-optimal configuration. You should not
  only check it thoroughly, but also run as many tests as you can, to ensure
  that it is working as you expect. In particular, you should test address
  routing, using -bt and -bv, and the policy controls, using -bh. If possible,
  you should also do some live tests (i.e. send and receive some messages)
  before putting Exim 4 into service.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you have a very complicated configuration, it is possible that
  exim_convert4r4 will break it in some situations, which is why thorough
  testing is strongly recommended.

This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us
  and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly
  appreciated.
