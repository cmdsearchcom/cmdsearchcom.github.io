<p>EXIM_CONVERT4R4(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
EXIM_CONVERT4R4(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exim_convert4r4 - Convert Exim configuration from v3 to v4
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
exim_convert4r4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This script is provided to assist in updating Exim
configuration files. It reads an Exim 3 configuration file
on the standard input, and writes a modified file on the
standard <br>
output. It also writes comments about what it has done to
the standard error file. It assumes that the input is a
valid Exim 3 configuration file. A typical call to the
con&acirc; <br>
version script might be</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exim_convert4r4 &lt;
/etc/exim/exim.conf &gt; /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.new</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output file MUST be checked
and tested before trying to use it on a live system. The
conversion script is just an aid which does a lot of the
&acirc;grunt work&acirc;. It does not <br>
guarantee to produce an Exim 4 configuration that behaves
exactly the same as the Exim 3 configuration it reads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each option change in the new
file is preceded by an identifying comment. In fact, the
conversion script tends to make quite a mess of your
configuration, and you should expect <br>
to go through it afterwards and tidy it up by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you are running a very
straightforward configuration, the automatic conversion is
likely to generate a non-optimal configuration. You should
not only check it thoroughly, <br>
but also run as many tests as you can, to ensure that it is
working as you expect. In particular, you should test
address routing, using -bt and -bv, and the policy controls,
<br>
using -bh. If possible, you should also do some live tests
(i.e. send and receive some messages) before putting Exim 4
into service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a very complicated
configuration, it is possible that exim_convert4r4 will
break it in some situations, which is why thorough testing
is strongly recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows
better groff than us and has more experience in writing
manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.</p>
