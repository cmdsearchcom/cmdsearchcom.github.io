<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Universal/Ugly 32bit filter allows to match arbitrary
bitfields in the packet. Due to breaking everything down to
values, masks and offsets, It is equally powerful and hard
<br>
to use. Luckily many abstracting directives are present
which allow defining rules on a higher level and therefore
free the user from having to fiddle with bits and masks in
many <br>
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two general modes of
invocation: The first mode creates a new filter to delegate
packets to different destinations. Apart from the obvious
ones, namely classifying the <br>
packet by specifying a CLASSID or calling an action, one may
link one filter to another one (or even a list of them),
effectively organizing filters into a tree-like
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically filter delegation is
done by means of a hash table, which leads to the second
mode of invocation: it merely serves to set up these hash
tables. Filters can select a <br>
hash table and provide a key selector from which a hash is
to be computed and used as key to lookup the table&rsquo;s
bucket which contains filters for further processing. This
is use&acirc; <br>
ful if a high number of filters is in use, as the overhead
of performing the hash operation and table lookup becomes
negligible in that case. Using hashtables with u32 basically
<br>
involves the following pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) Creating a new hash table,
specifying it&rsquo;s size using the divisor parameter and
ideally a handle by which the table can be identified. If
the latter is not given, the kernel <br>
chooses one on it&rsquo;s own, which has to be guessed
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(2) Creating filters which link
to the created table in (1) using the link parameter and
defining the packet data which the kernel will use to
calculate the hashkey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(3) Adding filters to buckets in
the hash table from (1). In order to avoid having to know
how exactly the kernel creates the hash key, there is the
sample parameter, which <br>
gives sample data to hash and thereby define the table
bucket the filter should be added to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, even if not explicitly
requested u32 creates a hash table for every priority a
filter is being added with. The table&rsquo;s size is 1
though, so it is in fact merely a linked <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALUES <br>
Options and selectors require values to be specified in a
specific format, which is often non-intuitive. Therefore the
terminals in SYNOPSIS have been given descriptive names to
<br>
indicate the required format and/or maximum allowed numeric
value: Prefixes u32, u16 and u8 indicate four, two and
single byte unsigned values. E.g. u16 indicates a two byte-
<br>
sized value in range between 0 and 65535 (0xFFFF) inclusive.
A prefix of int indicates a four byte signed value. A middle
part of _hex_ indicates that the value is parsed in <br>
hexadecimal format. Otherwise, the value&rsquo;s base is
automatically detected, i.e. values prefixed with 0x are
considered hexadecimal, a leading 0 indicates octal format
and decimal <br>
format otherwise. There are some values with special
formatting as well: ip_address and netmask are in
dotted-quad formatting as usual for IPv4 addresses. An
ip6_address is spec&acirc; <br>
ified in common, colon-separated hexadecimal format.
Finally, prefixlen is an unsigned, decimal integer value in
range from 0 to the address width in bits (32 for IPv4 and
128 <br>
for IPv6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes values need to be
dividable by a certain number. In that case a name of the
form N*val was chosen, indicating that val must be dividable
by N. Or the other way around: <br>
the resulting value must be a multiple of N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
U32 recognizes the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">handle HANDLE <br>
The handle is used to reference a filter and therefore must
be unique. It consists of a hash table identifier htid and
optional hash (which identifies the hash table&rsquo;s <br>
bucket) and nodeid. All these values are parsed as unsigned,
hexadecimal numbers with length 12bits ( htid and nodeid) or
8bits ( hash). Alternatively one may specify a <br>
single, 32bit long hex number which contains the three
fields bits in concatenated form. Other than the fields
themselves, it has to be prefixed by 0x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset OFFSET <br>
Set an offset which defines where matches of subsequent
filters are applied to. Therefore this option is useful only
when combined with link or a combination of ht and <br>
sample. The offset may be given explicitly by using the plus
keyword, or extracted from the packet data with at. It is
possible to mangle the latter using mask and/or <br>
shift keywords. By default, this offset is recorded but not
implicitly applied. It is used only to substitute the
nexthdr+ statement. Using the keyword eat though inverses
<br>
this behaviour: the offset is applied always, and nexthdr+
will fall back to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hashkey HASHKEY <br>
Spefify what packet data to use to calculate a hash key for
bucket lookup. The kernel adjusts the value according to the
hash table&rsquo;s size. For this to work, the option <br>
link must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classid CLASSID <br>
Classify matching packets into the given CLASSID, which
consists of either 16bit major and minor numbers or a single
32bit value combining both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">divisor u32_value <br>
Specify a modulo value. Used when creating hash tables to
define their size or for declaring a sample to calculate
hash table keys from. Must be a power of two with
expo&acirc; <br>
nent not exceeding eight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">order u32_value <br>
A value to order filters by, ascending. Conflicts with
handle which serves the same purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sample SELECTOR <br>
Used together with ht to specify which bucket to add this
filter to. This allows one to avoid having to know how
exactly the kernel calculates hashes. The additional
divi&acirc; <br>
sor defaults to 256, so must be given for hash tables of
different size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link HANDLE <br>
Delegate matching packets to filters in a hash table. HANDLE
is used to only specify the hash table, so only htid may be
given, hash and nodeid have to be omitted. By <br>
default, bucket number 0 will be used and can be overridden
by the hashkey option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indev ifname <br>
Filter on the incoming interface of the packet. Obviously
works only for forwarded traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Print a brief help text
about possible options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTORS <br>
Basically the only real selector is u32 . All others merely
provide a higher level syntax and are internally translated
into u32 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u32 VAL_MASK_32 <br>
u16 VAL_MASK_16 <br>
u8 VAL_MASK_8 <br>
Match packet data to a given value. The selector name
defines the sample length to extract (32bits for u32, 16bits
for u16 and 8bits for u8). Before comparing, the sample <br>
is binary AND&rsquo;ed with the given mask. This way
uninteresting bits can be cleared before comparison. The
position of the sample is defined by the offset specified in
AT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip IP <br>
ip6 IP6 <br>
Assume packet starts with an IPv4 ( ip) or IPv6 ( ip6)
header. IP/IP6 then allows to match various header
fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src ADDR <br>
dst ADDR <br>
Compare Source or Destination Address fields against the
value of ADDR. The reserved words default, any and all
effectively match any address. Otherwise an IP <br>
address of the particular protocol is expected, optionally
suffixed by a prefix length to match whole subnets. In case
of IPv4 a netmask may also be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsfield VAL_MASK_8 <br>
IPv4 only. Match the packet header&rsquo;s DSCP/ECN field.
Synonyms to this are tos and precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ihl VAL_MASK_8 <br>
IPv4 only. Match the Internet Header Length field. Note that
the value&rsquo;s unit is 32bits, so to match a packet with
24byte header length u8_value has to be 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol VAL_MASK_8 <br>
Match the Protocol (IPv4) or Next Header (IPv6) field value,
e.g. 6 for TCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmp_type VAL_MASK_8 <br>
icmp_code VAL_MASK_8 <br>
Assume a next-header protocol of icmp or ipv6-icmp and match
Type or Code field values. This is dangerous, as the code
assumes minimal header size for IPv4 and lack <br>
of extension headers for IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sport VAL_MASK_16 <br>
dport VAL_MASK_16 <br>
Match layer four source or destination ports. This is
dangerous as well, as it assumes a suitable layer four
protocol is present (which has Source and Destination <br>
Port fields right at the start of the header and 16bit in
size). Also minimal header size for IPv4 and lack of IPv6
extension headers is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nofrag <br>
firstfrag <br>
df <br>
mf IPv4 only, check certain flags and fragment offset
values. Match if the packet is not a fragment (nofrag), the
first fragment (firstfrag), if Don&rsquo;t Fragment (df) or
<br>
More Fragments (mf) bits are set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">priority VAL_MASK_8 <br>
IPv6 only. Match the header&rsquo;s Traffic Class field,
which has the same purpose and semantics of IPv4&rsquo;s ToS
field since RFC 3168: upper six bits are DSCP, the lower
<br>
two ECN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flowlabel VAL_MASK_32 <br>
IPv6 only. Match the Flow Label field&rsquo;s value. Note
that Flow Label itself is only 20bytes long, which are the
least significant ones here. The remaining upper <br>
12bytes match Version and Traffic Class fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp TCPUDP <br>
udp TCPUDP <br>
Match fields of next header of protocol TCP or UDP. The
possible values for TCPDUP are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src VAL_MASK_16 <br>
Match on Source Port field value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dst VALMASK_16 <br>
Match on Destination Port field value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmp ICMP <br>
Match fields of next header of protocol ICMP. The possible
values for ICMP are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type VAL_MASK_8 <br>
Match on ICMP Type field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">code VAL_MASK_8 <br>
Match on ICMP Code field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mark VAL_MASK_32 <br>
Match on netfilter fwmark value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ether ETHER <br>
Match on ethernet header fields. Possible values for ETHER
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src ether_address AT <br>
dst ether_address AT <br>
Match on source or destination ethernet address. This is
dangerous: It assumes an ethernet header is present at the
start of the packet. This will probably lead to <br>
unexpected things if used with layer three interfaces like
e.g. tun or ppp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
tc filter add dev eth0 parent 999:0 prio 99 protocol ip u32
match ip src 192.168.8.0/24 classid 1:1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attaches a filter to the
qdisc identified by 999:0. It&rsquo;s priority is 99, which
affects in which order multiple filters attached to the same
parent are consulted (the lower <br>
the earlier). The filter handles packets of protocol type
ip, and matches if the IP header&rsquo;s source address is
within the 192.168.8.0/24 subnet. Matching packets are
classified <br>
into class 1.1. The effect of this command might be
surprising at first glance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter parent 1: protocol ip
pref 99 u32 <br>
filter parent 1: protocol ip pref 99 u32 fh 800: ht divisor
1 <br>
filter parent 1: protocol ip pref 99 u32 fh 800::800 order
2048 key ht 800 bkt 0 flowid 1:1 match c0a80800/ffffff00 at
12</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So parent 1: is assigned a new
u32 filter, which contains a hash table of size 1 (as the
divisor indicates). The table ID is 800. The third line then
shows the actual filter <br>
which was added above: it sits in table 800 and bucket 0,
classifies packets into class ID 1:1 and matches the upper
three bytes of the four byte value at offset 12 to be <br>
0xc0a808, which is 192, 168 and 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now for something more
complicated, namely creating a custom hash table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc filter add dev eth0 prio 99
handle 1: u32 divisor 256</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This creates a table of size 256
with handle 1: in priority 99. The effect is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter parent 1: protocol all
pref 99 u32 <br>
filter parent 1: protocol all pref 99 u32 fh 1: ht divisor
256 <br>
filter parent 1: protocol all pref 99 u32 fh 800: ht divisor
1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So along with the requested hash
table (handle 1:), the kernel has created his own table of
size 1 to hold other filters of the same priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next step is to create a
filter which links to the created hash table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:
prio 1 u32 link 1: hashkey mask 0x0000ff00 at 12 match ip
src 192.168.0.0/16</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter is given a lower
priority than the hash table itself so u32 consults it
before manually traversing the hash table. The options link
and hashkey determine which table <br>
and bucket to redirect to. In this case the hash key should
be constructed out of the second byte at offset 12, which
corresponds to an IP packet&rsquo;s third byte of the source
<br>
address field. Along with the match statement, this
effectively maps all class C networks below 192.168.0.0/16
to different buckets of the hash table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filters for certain subnets can
be created like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:
prio 99 u32 ht 1: sample u32 0x00000800 0x0000ff00 at 12
match ip src 192.168.8.0/24 classid 1:1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bucket is defined using the
sample option: In this case, the second byte at offset 12
must be 0x08, exactly. In this case, the resulting bucket ID
is obviously 8, but as soon <br>
as sample selects an amount of data which could exceed the
divisor, one would have to know the kernel-internal
algorithm to deduce the destination bucket. This
filter&rsquo;s match <br>
statement is redundant in this case, as the entropy for the
hash key does not exceed the table size and therefore no
collisions can occur. Otherwise it&rsquo;s necessary to
prevent <br>
matching unwanted packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matching upper layer fields is
problematic since IPv4 header length is variable and IPv6
supports extension headers which affect upper layer header
offset. To overcome this, <br>
there is the possibility to specify nexthdr+ when giving an
offset, and to make things easier there are the tcp and udp
matches which use nexthdr+ implicitly. This offset has to
<br>
be calculated in beforehand though, and the only way to
achieve that is by doing it in a separate filter which then
links to the filter which wants to use it. Here is an
example <br>
of doing so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tc filter add dev eth0 parent
1:0 protocol ip handle 1: u32 divisor 1 <br>
tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 protocol ip u32 ht 1:
match tcp src 22 FFFF classid 1:2 <br>
tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 protocol ip u32 ht 800:
match ip protocol 6 FF match ip firstfrag offset at 0 mask
0f00 shift 6 link 1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is what is being done: In
the first call, a single element sized hash table is created
so there is a place to hold the linked to filter and a known
handle (1:) to reference <br>
to it. The second call then adds the actual filter, which
pushes packets with TCP source port 22 into class 1:2. Using
ht, it is moved into the hash table created by the first
<br>
call. The third call then does the actual magic: It matches
IPv4 packets with next layer protocol 6 (TCP), only if
it&rsquo;s the first fragment (usually TCP sets DF bit, but
if it <br>
doesn&rsquo;t and the packet is fragmented, only the first
one contains the TCP header), and then sets the offset based
on the IP header&rsquo;s IHL field (right-shifting by 6
eliminates the <br>
offset of the field and at the same time converts the value
into byte unit). Finally, using link, the hash table from
first call is referenced which holds the filter from second
<br>
call.</p>
