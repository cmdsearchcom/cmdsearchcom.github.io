<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Relay Agent, dhcrelay,
provides a means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a
subnet to which no DHCP server is directly connected to <br>
one or more DHCP servers on other subnets. It supports both
DHCPv4/BOOTP and DHCPv6 protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
The DHCP Relay Agent listens for DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 queries
from clients or other relay agents on one or more
interfaces, passing them along to
&lsquo;&lsquo;upstream&rsquo;&rsquo; servers or relay agents
<br>
as specified on the command line. When a reply is received
from upstream, it is multicast or unicast back downstream to
the source of the original request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE <br>
Protocol selection options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Run dhcrelay as a DHCPv6
relay agent. Incompatible with the -4 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Run dhcrelay as a
DHCPv4/BOOTP relay agent. This is the default mode of
operation, so the argument is not necessary, but may be
specified for clarity. Incompatible with <br>
-6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying DHCPv4/BOOTP
servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DHCPv4 mode, a list of one or
more server addresses must be specified on the command line,
to which DHCP/BOOTP queries should be relayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options available for both
DHCPv4 and DHCPv6:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c COUNT <br>
Maximum hop count. When forwarding packets, dhcrelay
discards packets which have reached a hop count of COUNT.
Default is 10. Maximum is 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Force dhcrelay to run as a
foreground process. Useful when running dhcrelay under a
debugger, or running out of inittab on System V systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PORT <br>
Listen and transmit on port PORT. This is mostly useful for
debugging purposes. Default is port 67 for DHCPv4/BOOTP, or
port 547 for DHCPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode. Prevents
dhcrelay6 from printing its network configuration on
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pf pid-file <br>
Path to alternate pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pid <br>
Option to disable writing pid files. By default the program
will write a pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options available in DHCPv4 mode
only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Append an agent option field
to each request before forwarding it to the server. Agent
option fields in responses sent from servers to clients will
be stripped before <br>
forwarding such responses back to the client. The agent
option field will contain two agent options: the Circuit ID
suboption and the Remote ID suboption. Currently, the <br>
Circuit ID will be the printable name of the interface on
which the client request was received. The client supports
inclusion of a Remote ID suboption as well, but this <br>
is not used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A LENGTH <br>
Specify the maximum packet size to send to a DHCPv4/BOOTP
server. This might be done to allow sufficient space for
addition of relay agent options while still fitting <br>
into the Ethernet MTU size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Drop packets from upstream
servers if they contain Relay Agent Information options that
indicate they were generated in response to a query that
came via a different relay <br>
agent. If this option is not specified, such packets will be
relayed anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i ifname <br>
Listen for DHCPv4/BOOTP queries on interface ifname.
Multiple interfaces may be specified by using more than one
-i option. If no interfaces are specified on the command
<br>
line, dhcrelay will identify all network interfaces,
eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and
attempt to listen on all of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m
append|replace|forward|discard <br>
Control the handling of incoming DHCPv4 packets which
already contain relay agent options. If such a packet does
not have giaddr set in its header, the DHCP standard <br>
requires that the packet be discarded. However, if giaddr is
set, the relay agent may handle the situation in four ways:
It may append its own set of relay options to <br>
the packet, leaving the supplied option field intact; it may
replace the existing agent option field; it may forward the
packet unchanged; or, it may discard it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this option you must also
enable the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options available in DHCPv6 mode
only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Force use of the DHCPv6
Interface-ID option. This option is automatically sent when
there are two or more downstream interfaces in use, to
disambiguate between them. The <br>
-I option causes dhcrelay to send the option even if there
is only one downstream interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l [address%]ifname[#index] <br>
Specifies the &lsquo;&lsquo;lower&rsquo;&rsquo; network
interface for DHCPv6 relay mode: the interface on which
queries will be received from clients or from other relay
agents. At least one -l <br>
option must be included in the command line when running in
DHCPv6 mode. The interface name ifname is a mandatory
parameter. The link address can be specified by <br>
address%; if it isn&rsquo;t, dhcrelay will use the first
non-link-local address configured on the interface. The
optional #index parameter specifies the interface index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u [address%]ifname <br>
Specifies the &lsquo;&lsquo;upper&rsquo;&rsquo; network
interface for DHCPv6 relay mode: the interface to which
queries from clients and other relay agents should be
forwarded. At least one -u <br>
option must be included in the command line when running in
DHCPv6 mode. The interface name ifname is a mandatory
parameter. The destination unicast or multicast address <br>
can be specified by address%; if not specified, the relay
agent will forward to the DHCPv6
All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to specify the
same interface with different addresses more than once, and
even, when the system supports it, to use the same interface
as both upper and lower <br>
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
dhclient(8), dhcpd(8), RFC3315, RFC2132, RFC2131.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Using the same interface on both upper and lower sides may
cause loops, so when running this way, the maximum hop count
should be set to a low value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The loopback interface is not
(yet) recognized as a valid interface.</p>
