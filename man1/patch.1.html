<b>patch</b> [<i>options</i>] [<i>originalfile</i> [<i>patchfile</i>]]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
but usually just
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>patch -p</b><i>num</i> <b>&lt;</b><i>patchfile</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>patch</b> takes a patch file <i>patchfile</i> containing a difference listing
  produced by the <b>diff</b> program and applies those differences to one or
  more original files, producing patched versions. Normally the patched versions
  are put in place of the originals. Backups can be made; see the <b>-b</b> or
  <b>--backup</b> option. The names of the files to be patched are usually taken
  from the patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can be
  specified on the command line as <i>originalfile</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff listing, unless
  overruled by a <b>-c</b> (<b>--context</b>), <b>-e</b> (<b>--ed</b>),
  <b>-n</b> ( <b>--normal</b>), or <b>-u</b> (<b>--unified</b>) option. Context
  diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs are applied by the
  <b>patch</b> program itself, while <b>ed</b> diffs are simply fed to the
  <b>ed</b>(1) editor via a pipe.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>patch</b> tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then skip
  any trailing garbage. Thus you could feed an article or message containing a
  diff listing to <b>patch</b>, and it should work. If the entire diff is
  indented by a consistent amount, if lines end in CRLF, or if a diff is
  encapsulated one or more times by prepending &quot; <b>- </b>&quot; to lines
  starting with &quot; <b>-</b>&quot; as specified by Internet RFC 934, this is
  taken into account. After removing indenting or encapsulation, lines beginning
  with <b>#</b> are ignored, as they are considered to be comments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs, <b>patch</b> can
  detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
  attempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch. As a first
  guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or minus any
  offset used in applying the previous hunk. If that is not the correct place,
  <b>patch</b> scans both forwards and backwards for a set of lines matching the
  context given in the hunk. First <b>patch</b> looks for a place where all
  lines of the context match. If no such place is found, and it's a context
  diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more, then another scan takes
  place ignoring the first and last line of context. If that fails, and the
  maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more, the first two and last two lines of
  context are ignored, and another scan is made. (The default maximum fuzz
  factor is 2.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hunks with less prefix context than suffix context (after applying fuzz) must
  apply at the start of the file if their first line number is&#x00A0;1. Hunks
  with more prefix context than suffix context (after applying fuzz) must apply
  at the end of the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>patch</b> cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch, it puts
  the hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name of the output file
  plus a <b>.rej</b> suffix, or <b>#</b> if <b>.rej</b> would generate a file
  name that is too long (if even appending the single character <b>#</b> makes
  the file name too long, then <b>#</b> replaces the file name's last
  character).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The rejected hunk comes out in unified or context diff format. If the input was
  a normal diff, many of the contexts are simply null. The line numbers on the
  hunks in the reject file may be different than in the patch file: they reflect
  the approximate location patch thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file
  rather than the old one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As each hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and if so which line
  (in the new file) <b>patch</b> thought the hunk should go on. If the hunk is
  installed at a different line from the line number specified in the diff, you
  are told the offset. A single large offset <i>may</i> indicate that a hunk was
  installed in the wrong place. You are also told if a fuzz factor was used to
  make the match, in which case you should also be slightly suspicious. If the
  <b>--verbose</b> option is given, you are also told about hunks that match
  exactly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no original file <i>origfile</i> is specified on the command line,
  <b>patch</b> tries to figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the
  file to edit is, using the following rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, <b>patch</b> takes an ordered list of candidate file names as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the header is that of a context diff, <b>patch</b> takes
      the old and new file names in the header. A name is ignored if it does not
      have enough slashes to satisfy the <b>-p</b><i>num</i> or
      <b>--strip=</b><i>num</i> option. The name <b>/dev/null</b> is also
      ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If there is an <b>Index:</b> line in the leading garbage
      and if either the old and new names are both absent or if <b>patch</b> is
      conforming to POSIX, <b>patch</b> takes the name in the <b>Index:</b>
      line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For the purpose of the following rules, the candidate file
      names are considered to be in the order (old, new, index), regardless of
      the order that they appear in the header.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then <b>patch</b> selects a file name from the candidate list as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If some of the named files exist, <b>patch</b> selects the
      first name if conforming to POSIX, and the best name otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>patch</b> is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase, Perforce,
      and SCCS (see the <b>-g&#x00A0;</b><i>num</i> or <b>--get=</b><i>num</i>
      option), and no named files exist but an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS
      master is found, <b>patch</b> selects the first named file with an RCS,
      ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If no named files exist, no RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or
      SCCS master was found, some names are given, <b>patch</b> is not
      conforming to POSIX, and the patch appears to create a file, <b>patch</b>
      selects the best name requiring the creation of the fewest
    directories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If no file name results from the above heuristics, you are
      asked for the name of the file to patch, and <b>patch</b> selects that
      name.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To determine the <i>best</i> of a nonempty list of file names, <b>patch</b>
  first takes all the names with the fewest path name components; of those, it
  then takes all the names with the shortest basename; of those, it then takes
  all the shortest names; finally, it takes the first remaining name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a <b>Prereq:</b> line,
  <b>patch</b> takes the first word from the prerequisites line (normally a
  version number) and checks the original file to see if that word can be found.
  If not, <b>patch</b> asks for confirmation before proceeding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while in a news
  interface, something like the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	 <b>| patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and patch a file in the <b>blurfl</b> directory directly from the article
  containing the patch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the patch file contains more than one patch, <b>patch</b> tries to apply each
  of them as if they came from separate patch files. This means, among other
  things, that it is assumed that the name of the file to patch must be
  determined for each diff listing, and that the garbage before each diff
  listing contains interesting things such as file names and revision level, as
  mentioned previously.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES_FOR_PATCH_SENDERS"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES_FOR_PATCH_SENDERS">NOTES
  FOR PATCH SENDERS</a></h1>
There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going to be sending
  out patches.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Create your patch systematically. A good method is the command
  <b>diff&#x00A0;-Naur&#x00A0;</b><i>old&#x00A0;new</i> where <i>old</i> and
  <i>new</i> identify the old and new directories. The names <i>old</i> and
  <i>new</i> should not contain any slashes. The <b>diff</b> command's headers
  should have dates and times in Universal Time using traditional Unix format,
  so that patch recipients can use the <b>-Z</b> or <b>--set-utc</b> option.
  Here is an example command, using Bourne shell syntax:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	 <b>LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur gcc-2.7 gcc-2.8</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tell your recipients how to apply the patch by telling them which directory to
  <b>cd</b> to, and which <b>patch</b> options to use. The option string
  <b>-Np1</b> is recommended. Test your procedure by pretending to be a
  recipient and applying your patch to a copy of the original files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can save people a lot of grief by keeping a <b>patchlevel.h</b> file which
  is patched to increment the patch level as the first diff in the patch file
  you send out. If you put a <b>Prereq:</b> line in with the patch, it won't let
  them apply patches out of order without some warning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can create a file by sending out a diff that compares <b>/dev/null</b> or an
  empty file dated the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) to the file you want to
  create. This only works if the file you want to create doesn't exist already
  in the target directory. Conversely, you can remove a file by sending out a
  context diff that compares the file to be deleted with an empty file dated the
  Epoch. The file will be removed unless <b>patch</b> is conforming to POSIX and
  the <b>-E</b> or <b>--remove-empty-files</b> option is not given. An easy way
  to generate patches that create and remove files is to use GNU <b>diff</b>'s
  <b>-N</b> or <b>--new-file</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the recipient is supposed to use the <b>-p</b><i>N</i> option, do not send
  output that looks like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	--- v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	+++ prog/README Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
because the two file names have different numbers of slashes, and different
  versions of <b>patch</b> interpret the file names differently. To avoid
  confusion, send output that looks like this instead:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README v2.0.30/prog/README
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	--- v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	+++ v2.0.30/prog/README Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Avoid sending patches that compare backup file names like <b>README.orig</b>,
  since this might confuse <b>patch</b> into patching a backup file instead of
  the real file. Instead, send patches that compare the same base file names in
  different directories, e.g. <b>old/README</b> and <b>new/README</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Take care not to send out reversed patches, since it makes people wonder whether
  they already applied the patch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Try not to have your patch modify derived files (e.g. the file <b>configure</b>
  where there is a line <b>configure: configure.in</b> in your makefile), since
  the recipient should be able to regenerate the derived files anyway. If you
  must send diffs of derived files, generate the diffs using UTC, have the
  recipients apply the patch with the <b>-Z</b> or <b>--set-utc</b> option, and
  have them remove any unpatched files that depend on patched files (e.g. with
  <b>make&#x00A0;clean</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
While you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff listings into one file,
  it may be wiser to group related patches into separate files in case something
  goes haywire.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
Diagnostics generally indicate that <b>patch</b> couldn't parse your patch file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>--verbose</b> option is given, the message <b>Hmm...</b> indicates
  that there is unprocessed text in the patch file and that <b>patch</b> is
  attempting to intuit whether there is a patch in that text and, if so, what
  kind of patch it is.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>patch</b>'s exit status is 0 if all hunks are applied successfully, 1 if some
  hunks cannot be applied or there were merge conflicts, and 2 if there is more
  serious trouble. When applying a set of patches in a loop it behooves you to
  check this exit status so you don't apply a later patch to a partially patched
  file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
Context diffs cannot reliably represent the creation or deletion of empty files,
  empty directories, or special files such as symbolic links. Nor can they
  represent changes to file metadata like ownership, permissions, or whether one
  file is a hard link to another. If changes like these are also required,
  separate instructions (e.g. a shell script) to accomplish them should
  accompany the patch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>patch</b> cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an <b>ed</b> script, and
  can detect bad line numbers in a normal diff only when it finds a change or
  deletion. A context diff using fuzz factor 3 may have the same problem. You
  should probably do a context diff in these cases to see if the changes made
  sense. Of course, compiling without errors is a pretty good indication that
  the patch worked, but not always.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>patch</b> usually produces the correct results, even when it has to do a lot
  of guessing. However, the results are guaranteed to be correct only when the
  patch is applied to exactly the same version of the file that the patch was
  generated from.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES"><a class="selflink" href="#COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES">COMPATIBILITY
  ISSUES</a></h1>
The POSIX standard specifies behavior that differs from <b>patch</b>'s
  traditional behavior. You should be aware of these differences if you must
  interoperate with <b>patch</b> versions 2.1 and earlier, which do not conform
  to POSIX.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In traditional <b>patch</b>, the <b>-p</b> option's operand
      was optional, and a bare <b>-p</b> was equivalent to <b>-p0.</b> The
      <b>-p</b> option now requires an operand, and <b>-p&#x00A0;0</b> is now
      equivalent to <b>-p0</b>. For maximum compatibility, use options like
      <b>-p0</b> and <b>-p1</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also, traditional <b>patch</b> simply counted slashes when stripping path
      prefixes; <b>patch</b> now counts pathname components. That is, a sequence
      of one or more adjacent slashes now counts as a single slash. For maximum
      portability, avoid sending patches containing <b>//</b> in file
    names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In traditional <b>patch</b>, backups were enabled by
      default. This behavior is now enabled with the <b>-b</b> or
      <b>--backup</b> option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Conversely, in POSIX <b>patch</b>, backups are never made, even when there
      is a mismatch. In GNU <b>patch</b>, this behavior is enabled with the
      <b>--no-backup-if-mismatch</b> option, or by conforming to POSIX with the
      <b>--posix</b> option or by setting the <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> environment
      variable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-b</b><i>&#x00A0;suffix</i> option of traditional <b>patch</b> is

      (but better documented) method that is optionally POSIX-conforming; we
      hope it has fewer gotchas. The two methods are compatible if the file
      names in the context diff header and the <b>Index:</b> line are all
      identical after prefix-stripping. Your patch is normally compatible if

If code has been duplicated (for instance with <b>#ifdef OLDCODE</b> ...
  <b>#else ... #endif</b>), <b>patch</b> is incapable of patching both versions,
  and, if it works at all, will likely patch the wrong one, and tell you that it
  succeeded to boot.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you apply a patch you've already applied, <b>patch</b> thinks it is a
  reversed patch, and offers to un-apply the patch. This could be construed as a
  feature.

Computing how to merge a hunk is significantly harder than using the standard
  fuzzy algorithm. Bigger hunks, more context, a bigger offset from the original
  location, and a worse match all slow the algorithm down.
