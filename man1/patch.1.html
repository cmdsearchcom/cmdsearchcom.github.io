<p>PATCH(1) General Commands Manual PATCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
patch - apply a diff file to an original</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
patch [options] [originalfile [patchfile]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but usually just</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch -pnum &lt;patchfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
patch takes a patch file patchfile containing a difference
listing produced by the diff program and applies those
differences to one or more original files, producing patched
<br>
versions. Normally the patched versions are put in place of
the originals. Backups can be made; see the -b or --backup
option. The names of the files to be patched are usually
<br>
taken from the patch file, but if there&rsquo;s just one
file to be patched it can be specified on the command line
as originalfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon startup, patch attempts to
determine the type of the diff listing, unless overruled by
a -c (--context), -e (--ed), -n (--normal), or -u
(--unified) option. Context diffs <br>
(old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs are
applied by the patch program itself, while ed diffs are
simply fed to the ed(1) editor via a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch tries to skip any leading
garbage, apply the diff, and then skip any trailing garbage.
Thus you could feed an article or message containing a diff
listing to patch, and it <br>
should work. If the entire diff is indented by a consistent
amount, if lines end in CRLF, or if a diff is encapsulated
one or more times by prepending &quot;- &quot; to lines
starting <br>
with &quot;-&quot; as specified by Internet RFC 934, this is
taken into account. After removing indenting or
encapsulation, lines beginning with # are ignored, as they
are considered to <br>
be comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With context diffs, and to a
lesser extent with normal diffs, patch can detect when the
line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
attempts to find the correct place <br>
to apply each hunk of the patch. As a first guess, it takes
the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or minus any
offset used in applying the previous hunk. If that is not
<br>
the correct place, patch scans both forwards and backwards
for a set of lines matching the context given in the hunk.
First patch looks for a place where all lines of the
con&acirc; <br>
text match. If no such place is found, and it&rsquo;s a
context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or
more, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and
last line <br>
of context. If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is
set to 2 or more, the first two and last two lines of
context are ignored, and another scan is made. (The default
max&acirc; <br>
imum fuzz factor is 2.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hunks with less prefix context
than suffix context (after applying fuzz) must apply at the
start of the file if their first line number is 1. Hunks
with more prefix context than <br>
suffix context (after applying fuzz) must apply at the end
of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If patch cannot find a place to
install that hunk of the patch, it puts the hunk out to a
reject file, which normally is the name of the output file
plus a .rej suffix, or # if <br>
.rej would generate a file name that is too long (if even
appending the single character # makes the file name too
long, then # replaces the file name&rsquo;s last
character).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rejected hunk comes out in
unified or context diff format. If the input was a normal
diff, many of the contexts are simply null. The line numbers
on the hunks in the reject <br>
file may be different than in the patch file: they reflect
the approximate location patch thinks the failed hunks
belong in the new file rather than the old one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As each hunk is completed, you
are told if the hunk failed, and if so which line (in the
new file) patch thought the hunk should go on. If the hunk
is installed at a different <br>
line from the line number specified in the diff, you are
told the offset. A single large offset may indicate that a
hunk was installed in the wrong place. You are also told if
<br>
a fuzz factor was used to make the match, in which case you
should also be slightly suspicious. If the --verbose option
is given, you are also told about hunks that match <br>
exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no original file origfile is
specified on the command line, patch tries to figure out
from the leading garbage what the name of the file to edit
is, using the following rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, patch takes an ordered
list of candidate file names as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the header is
that of a context diff, patch takes the old and new file
names in the header. A name is ignored if it does not have
enough slashes to satisfy the -pnum or <br>
--strip=num option. The name /dev/null is also ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If there is an
Index: line in the leading garbage and if either the old and
new names are both absent or if patch is conforming to
POSIX, patch takes the name in the Index: <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For the purpose
of the following rules, the candidate file names are
considered to be in the order (old, new, index), regardless
of the order that they appear in the header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then patch selects a file name
from the candidate list as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If some of the
named files exist, patch selects the first name if
conforming to POSIX, and the best name otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If patch is not
ignoring RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS (see the -g num
or --get=num option), and no named files exist but an RCS,
ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master is <br>
found, patch selects the first named file with an RCS,
ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If no named
files exist, no RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master was
found, some names are given, patch is not conforming to
POSIX, and the patch appears to create a file, <br>
patch selects the best name requiring the creation of the
fewest directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If no file name
results from the above heuristics, you are asked for the
name of the file to patch, and patch selects that name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine the best of a
nonempty list of file names, patch first takes all the names
with the fewest path name components; of those, it then
takes all the names with the <br>
shortest basename; of those, it then takes all the shortest
names; finally, it takes the first remaining name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, if the leading
garbage contains a Prereq: line, patch takes the first word
from the prerequisites line (normally a version number) and
checks the original file to <br>
see if that word can be found. If not, patch asks for
confirmation before proceeding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upshot of all this is that
you should be able to say, while in a news interface,
something like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| patch -d
/usr/src/local/blurfl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and patch a file in the blurfl
directory directly from the article containing the
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the patch file contains more
than one patch, patch tries to apply each of them as if they
came from separate patch files. This means, among other
things, that it is assumed <br>
that the name of the file to patch must be determined for
each diff listing, and that the garbage before each diff
listing contains interesting things such as file names and
<br>
revision level, as mentioned previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b or --backup <br>
Make backup files. That is, when patching a file, rename or
copy the original instead of removing it. When backing up a
file that does not exist, an empty, unreadable backup <br>
file is created as a placeholder to represent the
nonexistent file. See the -V or --version-control option for
details about how backup file names are determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup-if-mismatch <br>
Back up a file if the patch does not match the file exactly
and if backups are not otherwise requested. This is the
default unless patch is conforming to POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-backup-if-mismatch <br>
Do not back up a file if the patch does not match the file
exactly and if backups are not otherwise requested. This is
the default if patch is conforming to POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B pref or --prefix=pref <br>
Use the simple method to determine backup file names (see
the -V method or --version-control method option), and
append pref to a file name when generating its backup file
<br>
name. For example, with -B /junk/ the simple backup file
name for src/patch/util.c is /junk/src/patch/util.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary <br>
Write all files in binary mode, except for standard output
and /dev/tty. When reading, disable the heuristic for
transforming CRLF line endings into LF line endings. This
<br>
option is needed on POSIX systems when applying patches
generated on non-POSIX systems to non-POSIX files. (On POSIX
systems, file reads and writes never transform line
end&acirc; <br>
ings. On Windows, reads and writes do transform line endings
by default, and patches should be generated by diff --binary
when line endings are significant.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c or --context <br>
Interpret the patch file as a ordinary context diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dir or --directory=dir <br>
Change to the directory dir immediately, before doing
anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D define or --ifdef=define <br>
Use the #ifdef ... #endif construct to mark changes, with
define as the differentiating symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run <br>
Print the results of applying the patches without actually
changing any files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e or --ed <br>
Interpret the patch file as an ed script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E or --remove-empty-files <br>
Remove output files that are empty after the patches have
been applied. Normally this option is unnecessary, since
patch can examine the time stamps on the header to
deter&acirc; <br>
mine whether a file should exist after patching. However, if
the input is not a context diff or if patch is conforming to
POSIX, patch does not remove empty patched files <br>
unless this option is given. When patch removes a file, it
also attempts to remove any empty ancestor directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f or --force <br>
Assume that the user knows exactly what he or she is doing,
and do not ask any questions. Skip patches whose headers do
not say which file is to be patched; patch files even <br>
though they have the wrong version for the Prereq: line in
the patch; and assume that patches are not reversed even if
they look like they are. This option does not suppress <br>
commentary; use -s for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F num or --fuzz=num <br>
Set the maximum fuzz factor. This option only applies to
diffs that have context, and causes patch to ignore up to
that many lines of context in looking for places to install
<br>
a hunk. Note that a larger fuzz factor increases the odds of
a faulty patch. The default fuzz factor is 2. A fuzz factor
greater than or equal to the number of lines of <br>
context in the context diff, ordinarily 3, ignores all
context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g num or --get=num <br>
This option controls patch&rsquo;s actions when a file is
under RCS or SCCS control, and does not exist or is
read-only and matches the default version, or when a file is
under <br>
ClearCase or Perforce control and does not exist. If num is
positive, patch gets (or checks out) the file from the
revision control system; if zero, patch ignores RCS, <br>
ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS and does not get the file; and
if negative, patch asks the user whether to get the file.
The default value of this option is given by the value <br>
of the PATCH_GET environment variable if it is set; if not,
the default value is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print a summary of options and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i patchfile or
--input=patchfile <br>
Read the patch from patchfile. If patchfile is -, read from
standard input, the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l or --ignore-whitespace <br>
Match patterns loosely, in case tabs or spaces have been
munged in your files. Any sequence of one or more blanks in
the patch file matches any sequence in the original file,
<br>
and sequences of blanks at the ends of lines are ignored.
Normal characters must still match exactly. Each line of the
context must still match a line in the original file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge or --merge=merge or
--merge=diff3 <br>
Merge a patch file into the original files similar to
diff3(1) or merge(1). If a conflict is found, patch outputs
a warning and brackets the conflict with
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
lines. A typical conflict will look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
lines from the original file <br>
||||||| <br>
original lines from the patch <br>
======= <br>
new lines from the patch <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional argument of --merge
determines the output format for conflicts: the diff3 format
shows the ||||||| section with the original lines from the
patch; in the merge <br>
format, this section is missing. The merge format is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies --forward
and does not take the --fuzz=num option into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n or --normal <br>
Interpret the patch file as a normal diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N or --forward <br>
Ignore patches that seem to be reversed or already applied.
It is only checked if the first hunk of a patch can be
reversed. See also -R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile or --output=outfile
<br>
Send output to outfile instead of patching files in place.
Do not use this option if outfile is one of the files to be
patched. When outfile is -, send output to standard <br>
output, and send any messages that would usually go to
standard output to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pnum or --strip=num <br>
Strip the smallest prefix containing num leading slashes
from each file name found in the patch file. A sequence of
one or more adjacent slashes is counted as a single slash.
<br>
This controls how file names found in the patch file are
treated, in case you keep your files in a different
directory than the person who sent out the patch. For
example, <br>
supposing the file name in the patch file was</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setting -p0 gives the entire
file name unmodified, -p1 gives</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">without the leading slash, -p4
gives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and not specifying -p at all
just gives you blurfl.c. Whatever you end up with is looked
for either in the current directory, or the directory
specified by the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--posix <br>
Conform more strictly to the POSIX standard, as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Take the first
existing file from the list (old, new, index) when intuiting
file names from diff headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not remove
files that are empty after patching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not ask
whether to get files from RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or
SCCS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Require that all
options precede the files in the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not backup
files when there is a mismatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quoting-style=word <br>
Use style word to quote output names. The word should be one
of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">literal <br>
Output names as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell Quote names for the shell
if they contain shell metacharacters or would cause
ambiguous output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell-always <br>
Quote names for the shell, even if they would normally not
require quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Quote names as for a C
language string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape Quote as with c except
omit the surrounding double-quote characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify the default
value of the --quoting-style option with the environment
variable QUOTING_STYLE. If that environment variable is not
set, the default value is <br>
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rejectfile or
--reject-file=rejectfile <br>
Put rejects into rejectfile instead of the default .rej
file. When rejectfile is -, discard rejects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R or --reverse <br>
Assume that this patch was created with the old and new
files swapped. (Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid that does happen
occasionally, human nature being what it is.) patch attempts
to swap <br>
each hunk around before applying it. Rejects come out in the
swapped format. The -R option does not work with ed diff
scripts because there is too little information to <br>
reconstruct the reverse operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first hunk of a patch
fails, patch reverses the hunk to see if it can be applied
that way. If it can, you are asked if you want to have the
-R option set. If it <br>
can&rsquo;t, the patch continues to be applied normally.
(Note: this method cannot detect a reversed patch if it is a
normal diff and if the first command is an append (i.e. it
<br>
should have been a delete) since appends always succeed, due
to the fact that a null context matches anywhere. Luckily,
most patches add or change lines rather than delete <br>
them, so most reversed normal diffs begin with a delete,
which fails, triggering the heuristic.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--read-only=behavior <br>
Behave as requested when trying to modify a read-only file:
ignore the potential problem, warn about it (the default),
or fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reject-format=format <br>
Produce reject files in the specified format (either context
or unified). Without this option, rejected hunks come out in
unified diff format if the input patch was of that <br>
format, otherwise in ordinary context diff form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s or --silent or --quiet <br>
Work silently, unless an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--follow-symlinks <br>
When looking for input files, follow symbolic links.
Replaces the symbolic links, instead of modifying the files
the symbolic links point to. Git-style patches to symbolic
<br>
links will no longer apply. This option exists for backwards
compatibility with previous versions of patch; its use is
discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t or --batch <br>
Suppress questions like -f, but make some different
assumptions: skip patches whose headers do not contain file
names (the same as -f); skip patches for which the file has
the <br>
wrong version for the Prereq: line in the patch; and assume
that patches are reversed if they look like they are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T or --set-time <br>
Set the modification and access times of patched files from
time stamps given in context diff headers. Unless specified
in the time stamps, assume that the context diff head&acirc;
<br>
ers use local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of this option with time
stamps that do not include time zones is not recommended,
because patches using local time cannot easily be used by
people in other time zones, <br>
and because local time stamps are ambiguous when local
clocks move backwards during daylight-saving time
adjustments. Make sure that time stamps include time zones,
or gener&acirc; <br>
ate patches with UTC and use the -Z or --set-utc option
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u or --unified <br>
Interpret the patch file as a unified context diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v or --version <br>
Print out patch&rsquo;s revision header and patch level, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V method or
--version-control=method <br>
Use method to determine backup file names. The method can
also be given by the PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL (or, if
that&rsquo;s not set, the VERSION_CONTROL) environment
variable, which <br>
is overridden by this option. The method does not affect
whether backup files are made; it affects only the names of
any backup files that are made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of method is like the
GNU Emacs &lsquo;version-control&rsquo; variable; patch also
recognizes synonyms that are more descriptive. The valid
values for method are (unique abbre&acirc; <br>
viations are accepted):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">existing or nil <br>
Make numbered backups of files that already have them,
otherwise simple backups. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numbered or t <br>
Make numbered backups. The numbered backup file name for F
is F.~N~ where N is the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">simple or never <br>
Make simple backups. The -B or --prefix, -Y or
--basename-prefix, and -z or --suffix options specify the
simple backup file name. If none of these options are given,
then <br>
a simple backup suffix is used; it is the value of the
SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment variable if set, and is
.orig otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With numbered or simple backups,
if the backup file name is too long, the backup suffix ~ is
used instead; if even appending ~ would make the name too
long, then ~ replaces <br>
the last character of the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Output extra information about the work being done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x num or --debug=num <br>
Set internal debugging flags of interest only to patch
patchers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y pref or
--basename-prefix=pref <br>
Use the simple method to determine backup file names (see
the -V method or --version-control method option), and
prefix pref to the basename of a file name when generating
its <br>
backup file name. For example, with -Y .del/ the simple
backup file name for src/patch/util.c is
src/patch/.del/util.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z suffix or --suffix=suffix
<br>
Use the simple method to determine backup file names (see
the -V method or --version-control method option), and use
suffix as the suffix. For example, with -z - the backup <br>
file name for src/patch/util.c is src/patch/util.c-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z or --set-utc <br>
Set the modification and access times of patched files from
time stamps given in context diff headers. Unless specified
in the time stamps, assume that the context diff head&acirc;
<br>
ers use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, often known as
GMT). Also see the -T or --set-time option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Z or --set-utc and -T or
--set-time options normally refrain from setting a
file&rsquo;s time if the file&rsquo;s original time does not
match the time given in the patch header, or <br>
if its contents do not match the patch exactly. However, if
the -f or --force option is given, the file time is set
regardless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the limitations of diff
output format, these options cannot update the times of
files whose contents have not changed. Also, if you use
these options, you should <br>
remove (e.g. with make clean) all files that depend on the
patched files, so that later invocations of make do not get
confused by the patched files&rsquo; times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PATCH_GET <br>
This specifies whether patch gets missing or read-only files
from RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS by default; see the
-g or --get option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIXLY_CORRECT <br>
If set, patch conforms more strictly to the POSIX standard
by default: see the --posix option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUOTING_STYLE <br>
Default value of the --quoting-style option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX <br>
Extension to use for simple backup file names instead of
.orig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR, TMP, TEMP <br>
Directory to put temporary files in; patch uses the first
environment variable in this list that is set. If none are
set, the default is system-dependent; it is normally /tmp
<br>
on Unix hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION_CONTROL or
PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL <br>
Selects version control style; see the -v or
--version-control option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$TMPDIR/p* <br>
temporary files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/tty <br>

of the user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS <br>
There are several things you should bear in mind if you are
going to be sending out patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create your patch
systematically. A good method is the command diff -Naur old
new where old and new identify the old and new directories.
The names old and new should not con&acirc; <br>
tain any slashes. The diff command&rsquo;s headers should
have dates and times in Universal Time using traditional
Unix format, so that patch recipients can use the -Z or
--set-utc <br>
option. Here is an example command, using Bourne shell
syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur
gcc-2.7 gcc-2.8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tell your recipients how to
apply the patch by telling them which directory to cd to,
and which patch options to use. The option string -Np1 is
recommended. Test your procedure <br>
by pretending to be a recipient and applying your patch to a
copy of the original files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can save people a lot of
grief by keeping a patchlevel.h file which is patched to
increment the patch level as the first diff in the patch
file you send out. If you put a <br>
Prereq: line in with the patch, it won&rsquo;t let them
apply patches out of order without some warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can create a file by sending
out a diff that compares /dev/null or an empty file dated
the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) to the file you want to
create. This only works if <br>
the file you want to create doesn&rsquo;t exist already in
the target directory. Conversely, you can remove a file by
sending out a context diff that compares the file to be
deleted <br>
with an empty file dated the Epoch. The file will be removed
unless patch is conforming to POSIX and the -E or
--remove-empty-files option is not given. An easy way to
generate <br>
patches that create and remove files is to use GNU
diff&rsquo;s -N or --new-file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the recipient is supposed to
use the -pN option, do not send output that looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README
prog/README <br>
--- v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997 <br>
+++ prog/README Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because the two file names have
different numbers of slashes, and different versions of
patch interpret the file names differently. To avoid
confusion, send output that looks <br>
like this instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README
v2.0.30/prog/README <br>
--- v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997 <br>
+++ v2.0.30/prog/README Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid sending patches that
compare backup file names like README.orig, since this might
confuse patch into patching a backup file instead of the
real file. Instead, send patches <br>
that compare the same base file names in different
directories, e.g. old/README and new/README.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Take care not to send out
reversed patches, since it makes people wonder whether they
already applied the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try not to have your patch
modify derived files (e.g. the file configure where there is
a line configure: configure.in in your makefile), since the
recipient should be able to <br>
regenerate the derived files anyway. If you must send diffs
of derived files, generate the diffs using UTC, have the
recipients apply the patch with the -Z or --set-utc option,
<br>
and have them remove any unpatched files that depend on
patched files (e.g. with make clean).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While you may be able to get
away with putting 582 diff listings into one file, it may be
wiser to group related patches into separate files in case
something goes haywire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Diagnostics generally indicate that patch couldn&rsquo;t
parse your patch file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --verbose option is
given, the message Hmm... indicates that there is
unprocessed text in the patch file and that patch is
attempting to intuit whether there is a patch in <br>
that text and, if so, what kind of patch it is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch&rsquo;s exit status is 0
if all hunks are applied successfully, 1 if some hunks
cannot be applied or there were merge conflicts, and 2 if
there is more serious trouble. When <br>
applying a set of patches in a loop it behooves you to check
this exit status so you don&rsquo;t apply a later patch to a
partially patched file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Context diffs cannot reliably represent the creation or
deletion of empty files, empty directories, or special files
such as symbolic links. Nor can they represent changes to
<br>
file metadata like ownership, permissions, or whether one
file is a hard link to another. If changes like these are
also required, separate instructions (e.g. a shell script)
to <br>
accomplish them should accompany the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch cannot tell if the line
numbers are off in an ed script, and can detect bad line
numbers in a normal diff only when it finds a change or
deletion. A context diff using <br>
fuzz factor 3 may have the same problem. You should probably
do a context diff in these cases to see if the changes made
sense. Of course, compiling without errors is a pretty <br>
good indication that the patch worked, but not always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch usually produces the
correct results, even when it has to do a lot of guessing.
However, the results are guaranteed to be correct only when
the patch is applied to exactly <br>
the same version of the file that the patch was generated
from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY ISSUES <br>
The POSIX standard specifies behavior that differs from
patch&rsquo;s traditional behavior. You should be aware of
these differences if you must interoperate with patch
versions 2.1 <br>
and earlier, which do not conform to POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In traditional
patch, the -p option&rsquo;s operand was optional, and a
bare -p was equivalent to -p0. The -p option now requires an
operand, and -p 0 is now equivalent to -p0. <br>
For maximum compatibility, use options like -p0 and -p1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, traditional patch simply
counted slashes when stripping path prefixes; patch now
counts pathname components. That is, a sequence of one or
more adjacent slashes now <br>
counts as a single slash. For maximum portability, avoid
sending patches containing // in file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In traditional
patch, backups were enabled by default. This behavior is now
enabled with the -b or --backup option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversely, in POSIX patch,
backups are never made, even when there is a mismatch. In
GNU patch, this behavior is enabled with the
--no-backup-if-mismatch option, or by con&acirc; <br>
forming to POSIX with the --posix option or by setting the
POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b suffix option of
traditional patch is equivalent to the -b -z suffix options
of GNU patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Traditional
patch used a complicated (and incompletely documented)
method to intuit the name of the file to be patched from the
patch header. This method did not conform to <br>
POSIX, and had a few gotchas. Now patch uses a different,
equally complicated (but better documented) method that is
optionally POSIX-conforming; we hope it has fewer <br>
gotchas. The two methods are compatible if the file names in
the context diff header and the Index: line are all
identical after prefix-stripping. Your patch is normally
<br>
compatible if each header&rsquo;s file names all contain the
same number of slashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When traditional
patch asked the user a question, it sent the question to
standard error and looked for an answer from the first file
in the following list that was a termi&acirc; <br>
nal: standard error, standard output, /dev/tty, and standard
input. Now patch sends questions to standard output and gets
answers from /dev/tty. Defaults for some answers <br>
have been changed so that patch never goes into an infinite
loop when using default answers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Traditional
patch exited with a status value that counted the number of
bad hunks, or with status 1 if there was real trouble. Now
patch exits with status 1 if some hunks <br>
failed, or with 2 if there was real trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Limit yourself
to the following options when sending instructions meant to
be executed by anyone running GNU patch, traditional patch,
or a patch that conforms to POSIX. Spa&acirc; <br>
ces are significant in the following list, and operands are
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
-d dir <br>
-D define <br>
-e <br>
-l <br>
-n <br>
-N <br>
-o outfile <br>
-pnum <br>
-R <br>
-r rejectfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report bugs via email to
&lt;bug-patch@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If code has been duplicated (for
instance with #ifdef OLDCODE ... #else ... #endif), patch is
incapable of patching both versions, and, if it works at
all, will likely patch the <br>
wrong one, and tell you that it succeeded to boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you apply a patch
you&rsquo;ve already applied, patch thinks it is a reversed
patch, and offers to un-apply the patch. This could be
construed as a feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Computing how to merge a hunk is
significantly harder than using the standard fuzzy
algorithm. Bigger hunks, more context, a bigger offset from
the original location, and a <br>
worse match all slow the algorithm down.</p>
