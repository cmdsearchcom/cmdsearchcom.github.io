<b>ncgen-hdf</b> generates either a netCDF file, or C or Fortran source code to
  create a netCDF file. The input to <b>ncgen-hdf</b> is a description of a
  netCDF file in a small language known as CDL (network Common Data form
  Language), described below. If no options are specified in invoking
  <b>ncgen-hdf</b>, it merely checks the syntax of the input CDL file, producing
  error messages for any violations of CDL syntax. Other options can be used to
  create the corresponding netCDF file, to generate a C program that uses the
  netCDF C interface to create the netCDF file, or to generate a Fortran program
  that uses the netCDF Fortran interface to create the same netCDF file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ncgen-hdf</b> may be used with the companion program <b>ncdump</b> to perform
  some simple operations on netCDF files. For example, to rename a dimension in
  a netCDF file, use <b>ncdump</b> to get a CDL version of the netCDF file, edit
  the CDL file to change the name of the dimensions, and use <b>ncgen-hdf</b> to
  generate the corresponding netCDF file from the edited CDL file.

  Syntax Summary</a></h2>
Below is an example of CDL syntax, describing a netCDF file with several named
  dimensions (lat, lon, and time), variables (Z, t, p, rh, lat, lon, time),
  variable attributes (units, long_name, valid_range, _FillValue), and some
  data. CDL keywords are in boldface. (This example is intended to illustrate
  the syntax; a real CDL file would have a more complete set of attributes so
  that the data would be more completely self-describing.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

All CDL statements are terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs, and newlines can
  be used freely for readability. Comments may follow the characters `//' on any
  line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A CDL description consists of three optional parts: <i>dimensions</i>,
  <i>variables</i>, and <i>data</i>, beginning with the keyword
  <b>dimensions:</b>, <b>variables:</b>, and <b>data</b>, respectively. The
  variable part may contain <i>variable</i> <i>declarations</i> and <i>attribute
  assignments</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A netCDF <i>dimension</i> is used to define the shape of one or more of the
  multidimensional variables contained in the netCDF file. A netCDF dimension
  has a name and a size. At most one dimension in a netCDF file can have the
  <b>unlimited</b> size, which means a variable using this dimension can grow to
  any length (like a record number in a file).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>variable</i> represents a multidimensional array of values of the same
  type. A variable has a name, a data type, and a shape described by its list of
  dimensions. Each variable may also have associated <i>attributes</i> (see
  below) as well as data values. The name, data type, and shape of a variable
  are specified by its declaration in the <i>variable</i> section of a CDL
  description. A variable may have the same name as a dimension; by convention
  such a variable is one-dimensional and contains coordinates of the dimension
  it names. Dimensions need not have corresponding variables.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A netCDF <i>attribute</i> contains information about a netCDF variable or about
  the whole netCDF dataset. Attributes are used to specify such properties as
  units, special values, maximum and minimum valid values, scaling factors,
  offsets, and parameters. Attribute information is represented by single values
  or arrays of values. For example, &quot;units&quot; is an attribute
  represented by a character array such as &quot;celsius&quot;. An attribute has
  an associated variable, a name, a data type, a length, and a value. In
  contrast to variables that are intended for data, attributes are intended for
  metadata (data about data).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In CDL, an attribute is designated by a variable and attribute name, separated
  by `:'. It is possible to assign <i>global</i> attributes not associated with
  any variable to the netCDF as a whole by using `:' before the attribute name.
  The data type of an attribute in CDL is derived from the type of the value
  assigned to it. The length of an attribute is the number of data values
  assigned to it, or the number of characters in the character string assigned
  to it. Multiple values are assigned to non-character attributes by separating
  the values with commas. All values assigned to an attribute must be of the
  same type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The names for CDL dimensions, variables, and attributes must begin with an
  alphabetic character or `_', and subsequent characters may be alphanumeric or
  `_' or `-'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The optional <i>data</i> section of a CDL specification is where netCDF
  variables may be initialized. The syntax of an initialization is simple: a
  variable name, an equals sign, and a comma-delimited list of constants
  (possibly separated by spaces, tabs and newlines) terminated with a semicolon.
  For multi-dimensional arrays, the last dimension varies fastest. Thus
  row-order rather than column order is used for matrices. If fewer values are
  supplied than are needed to fill a variable, it is extended with a
  type-dependent `fill value', which can be overridden by supplying a value for
  a distinguished variable attribute named `_FillValue'. The types of constants
  need not match the type declared for a variable; coercions are done to convert
  integers to floating point, for example.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Primitive_Data_Types"><a class="selflink" href="#Primitive_Data_Types">Primitive
  Data Types</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>char</b>	characters
<b>byte</b>	8-bit data
<b>short</b>	16-bit signed integers
<b>long</b>	32-bit signed integers
<b>int</b>	(synonymous with <b>long</b>)
<b>float</b>	IEEE single precision floating point (32 bits)
<b>real</b>	(synonymous with <b>float</b>)
<b>double</b>	IEEE double precision floating point (64 bits)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Except for the added data-type <b>byte</b> and the lack of <b>unsigned</b>, CDL
  supports the same primitive data types as C. The names for the primitive data
  types are reserved words in CDL, so the names of variables, dimensions, and
  attributes must not be type names. In declarations, type names may be
  specified in either upper or lower case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bytes differ from characters in that they are intended to hold a full eight bits
  of data, and the zero byte has no special significance, as it does for
  character data. <b>ncgen-hdf</b> converts <b>byte</b> declarations to
  <b>char</b> declarations in the output C code and to the nonstandard
  <b>BYTE</b> declaration in output Fortran code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Shorts can hold values between -32768 and 32767. <b>ncgen-hdf</b> converts
  <b>short</b> declarations to <b>short</b> declarations in the output C code
  and to the nonstandard <b>INTEGER*2</b> declaration in output Fortran code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Longs can hold values between -2147483648 and 2147483647. <b>ncgen-hdf</b>
  converts <b>long</b> declarations to <b>long</b> declarations in the output C
  code and to <b>INTEGER</b> declarations in output Fortran code. <b>int</b> and
  <b>integer</b> are accepted as synonyms for <b>long</b> in CDL declarations.
  Now that there are platforms with 64-bit representations for C longs, it may
  be better to use the <b>int</b> synonym to avoid confusion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Floats can hold values between about -3.4+38 and 3.4+38. Their external
  representation is as 32-bit IEEE normalized single-precision floating point
  numbers. <b>ncgen-hdf</b> converts <b>float</b> declarations to <b>float</b>
  declarations in the output C code and to <b>REAL</b> declarations in output
  Fortran code. <b>real</b> is accepted as a synonym for <b>float</b> in CDL
  declarations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Doubles can hold values between about -1.7+308 and 1.7+308. Their external
  representation is as 64-bit IEEE standard normalized double-precision floating
  point numbers. <b>ncgen-hdf</b> converts <b>double</b> declarations to
  <b>double</b> declarations in the output C code and to <b>DOUBLE PRECISION</b>
  declarations in output Fortran code.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CDL_Constants"><a class="selflink" href="#CDL_Constants">CDL
  Constants</a></h2>
Constants assigned to attributes or variables may be of any of the basic netCDF
  types. The syntax for constants is similar to C syntax, except that type
  suffixes must be appended to shorts and floats to distinguish them from longs
  and doubles.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>byte</i> constant is represented by a single character or multiple
  character escape sequence enclosed in single quotes. For example,
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
 'a'		// ASCII `a'
 '\0'		// a zero byte
 '\n'		// ASCII newline character
 '\33'		// ASCII escape character (33 octal)
 '\x2b'	// ASCII plus (2b hex)
 '\377'	// 377 octal = 255 decimal, non-ASCII
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Character constants are enclosed in double quotes. A character array may be
  represented as a string enclosed in double quotes. The usual C string escape
  conventions are honored. For example
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
&quot;a&quot;		// ASCII `a'
&quot;Two\nlines\n&quot;	// a 10-character string with two embedded newlines
&quot;a bell:\007&quot;	// a string containing an ASCII bell
</pre>
</div>
Note that the netCDF character array &quot;a&quot; would fit in a one-element
  variable, since no terminating NULL character is assumed. However, a zero byte
  in a character array is interpreted as the end of the significant characters
  by the <b>ncdump</b> program, following the C convention. Therefore, a NULL
  byte should not be embedded in a character string unless at the end: use the
  <i>byte</i> data type instead for byte arrays that contain the zero byte.
  NetCDF and CDL have no string type, but only fixed-length character arrays,
  which may be multi-dimensional.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>short</i> integer constants are intended for representing 16-bit signed
  quantities. The form of a <i>short</i> constant is an integer constant with an
  `s' or `S' appended. If a <i>short</i> constant begins with `0', it is
  interpreted as octal, except that if it begins with `0x', it is interpreted as
  a hexadecimal constant. For example:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
-2s	// a short -2
0123s	// octal
0x7ffs  //hexadecimal
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Long</i> integer constants are intended for representing 32-bit signed
  quantities. The form of a <i>long</i> constant is an ordinary integer
  constant, although it is acceptable to append an optional `l' or `L'. If a
  <i>long</i> constant begins with `0', it is interpreted as octal, except that
  if it begins with `0x', it is interpreted as a hexadecimal constant. Examples
  of valid <i>long</i> constants include:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
-2
1234567890L
0123		// octal
0x7ff		// hexadecimal
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Floating point constants of type <i>float</i> are appropriate for representing
  floating point data with about seven significant digits of precision. The form
  of a <i>float</i> constant is the same as a C floating point constant with an
  `f' or `F' appended. For example the following are all acceptable <i>float</i>
  constants:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
-2.0f
3.14159265358979f	// will be truncated to less precision
1.f
1f
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Floating point constants of type <i>double</i> are appropriate for representing
  floating point data with about sixteen significant digits of precision. The
  form of a <i>double</i> constant is the same as a C floating point constant.
  An optional `d' or `D' may be appended. For example the following are all
  acceptable <i>double</i> constants:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
-2.0
3.141592653589793
1.0e-20
1.d
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The programs generated by <b>ncgen-hdf</b> when using the <b>-c</b> or <b>-f</b>
  use initialization statements to store data in variables, and will fail to
  produce compilable programs if you try to use them for large datasets, since
  the resulting statements may exceed the line length or number of continuation
  statements permitted by the compiler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CDL syntax makes it easy to assign what looks like an array of
  variable-length strings to a netCDF variable, but the strings will simply be
  concatenated into a single array of characters, since netCDF cannot represent
  an array of variable-length strings in one netCDF variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
NetCDF and CDL do not yet support a type corresponding to a 64-bit
  integer.</div>
