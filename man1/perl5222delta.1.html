<p>PERL5222DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5222DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5222delta - what is new for perl v5.22.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.22.1
release and the 5.22.2 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read perl5221delta,
which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.22.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Fix out of boundary access in Win32 path handling <br>
This is CVE-2015-8608. For more information see [perl
#126755]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126755&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fix loss of taint in
&quot;canonpath()&quot; <br>
This is CVE-2015-8607. For more information see [perl
#126862]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126862&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set proper umask before calling
mkstemp(3) <br>
In 5.22.0 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling
mkstemp(3) and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully
tells open(2) to strip the owner read and write bits from
the <br>
given mode before applying it, rather than the intended
negation of leaving only those bits in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systems that use mode 0666 in
mkstemp(3) (like old versions of glibc) create a file with
permissions 0066, leaving world read and write permissions
regardless of current umask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has been fixed by using
umask 0177 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #127322]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127322&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid accessing uninitialized
memory in Win32 &quot;crypt()&quot; <br>
Validation that will detect both a short salt and invalid
characters in the salt has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #126922]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126922&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove duplicate environment
variables from &quot;environ&quot; <br>
Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than
once in &quot;environ[]&quot;, %ENV would contain the last
entry for that name, while a typical &quot;getenv()&quot;
would return the first <br>
entry. We now make sure %ENV contains the same as what
&quot;getenv()&quot; returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly, we now remove
duplicates from &quot;environ[]&quot;, so if a setting with
that name is set in %ENV we won&rsquo;t pass an unsafe value
to a child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is CVE-2016-2381.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with Perl
5.22.1. If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you
submit a report. See &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; File::Spec has been upgraded from version
3.56 to 3.56_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;canonpath()&quot; now
preserves taint. See &quot;Fix loss of taint in
&quot;canonpath()&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList
has been upgraded from version 5.20151213 to 5.20160429.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version number of
Digest::SHA listed for Perl 5.18.4 was wrong and has been
corrected. Likewise for the version number of Config in
5.18.3 and 5.18.4. [perl #127624] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127624&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
Changes to Existing Documentation <br>
perldiag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The explanation
of the warning &quot;unable to close filehandle %s properly:
%s&quot; which can occur when doing an implicit close of a
filehandle has been expanded and improved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlfunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation of &quot;hex()&quot; has been revised to
clarify valid inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Dtrace builds now build successfully on
systems with a newer dtrace that require an input object
file that uses the probes in the .d file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previously the probe would fail
and cause a build failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #122287]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122287&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure no
longer probes for libnm by default. Originally this was the
&quot;New Math&quot; library, but the name has been re-used
by the GNOME NetworkManager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #127131]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127131&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure now
knows about gcc 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Compiling perl
with -DPERL_MEM_LOG now works again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
Darwin <br>
Compiling perl with -Dusecbacktrace on Darwin now works
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #127764]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127764&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS X/Darwin <br>
Builds with both -DDEBUGGING and threading enabled would
fail with a &quot;panic: free from wrong pool&quot; error
when built or tested from Terminal on OS X. This was caused
by <br>
perl&rsquo;s internal management of the environment
conflicting with an atfork handler using the libc
&quot;setenv()&quot; function to update the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now uses
&quot;setenv()&quot;/&quot;unsetenv()&quot; to update the
environment on OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #126240]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppc64el <br>
The floating point format of ppc64el (Debian naming for
little-endian PowerPC) is now detected correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tru64 <br>
A test failure in t/porting/extrefs.t has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; An unwarranted assertion in
&quot;Perl_newATTRSUB_x()&quot; has been removed. If a stub
subroutine definition with a prototype has been seen, then
any subsequent stub (or definition) <br>
of the same subroutine with an attribute was causing an
assertion failure because of a null pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #126845]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126845&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Calls to the placeholder &amp;PL_sv_yes used
internally when an &quot;import()&quot; or
&quot;unimport()&quot; method isn&rsquo;t found now
correctly handle scalar context. [perl #126042] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;pipe()&quot; operator would assert for
&quot;DEBUGGING&quot; builds instead of producing the
correct error message. The condition asserted on is detected
and reported on correctly <br>
without the assertions, so the assertions were removed.
[perl #126480]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126480&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In some cases,
failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed
memory. This was caused by a pointer not being restored
correctly. [perl #126443] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126443&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now reports
more context when it sees an array where it expects to see
an operator, and avoids an assertion failure. [perl #123737]
<br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123737&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a here-doc
was found while parsing another operator, the parser had
already read end of file, and the here-doc was not
terminated, perl could produce an assertion or a <br>
segmentation fault. This now reliably complains about the
unterminated here-doc. [perl #125540]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125540&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parsing beyond
the end of the buffer when processing a &quot;#line&quot;
directive with no filename is now avoided. [perl #127334]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127334&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.22.0
added support for the C99 hexadecimal floating point
notation, but sometimes misparsed hex floats. This has been
fixed. [perl #127183] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127183&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain regex
patterns involving a complemented posix class in an inverted
bracketed character class, and matching something else
optionally would improperly fail to match. <br>
An example of one that could fail is
&quot;qr/_?[^Wbar]/&quot;. This has been fixed. [perl
#127537]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127537&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed an issue
with &quot;pack()&quot; where &quot;pack &quot;H&quot;&quot;
(and &quot;pack &quot;h&quot;&quot;) could read past the
source when given a non-utf8 source and a utf8 target. [perl
#126325] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126325&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed some cases
where perl would abort due to a segmentation fault, or a
C-level assert. [perl #126193]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126193&gt;
[perl #126257] <br>
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126257&gt;
[perl #126258]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126258&gt;
[perl #126405] <br>
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126405&gt;
[perl #126602]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126602&gt;
[perl #127773] <br>
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127773&gt;
[perl #127786]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127786&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A memory leak
when setting $ENV{foo} on Darwin has been fixed. [perl
#126240]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now
correctly raises an error when trying to compile patterns
with unterminated character classes while there are trailing
backslashes. [perl #126141] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126141&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;NOTHING&quot; regops and &quot;EXACTFU_SS&quot; regops
in &quot;make_trie()&quot; are now handled properly. [perl
#126206]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126206&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now only
tests &quot;semctl()&quot; if we have everything needed to
use it. In FreeBSD the &quot;semctl()&quot; entry point may
exist, but it can be disabled by policy. [perl #127533] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127533&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A regression
that allowed undeclared barewords as hash keys to work
despite strictures has been fixed. [perl #126981]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126981&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As an
optimization (introduced in Perl 5.20.0), &quot;uc()&quot;,
&quot;lc()&quot;, &quot;ucfirst()&quot; and
&quot;lcfirst()&quot; sometimes modify their argument
in-place rather than returning a modified copy. <br>
The criteria for this optimization has been made stricter to
avoid these functions accidentally modifying in-place when
they should not, which has been happening in some <br>
cases, e.g. in List::Util.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Excessive memory
usage in the compilation of some regular expressions
involving non-ASCII characters has been reduced. A more
complete fix is forthcoming in Perl 5.24.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/
. There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
