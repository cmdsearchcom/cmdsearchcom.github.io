<p>RESTAUTH-GROUP(1) RestAuth RESTAUTH-GROUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
restauth-group - manage groups in RestAuth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
restauth-group.py [-h] command [option] ... [args] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
restauth-group.py manages groups in RestAuth. Groups are a
powerful but simple way for managing permissions. A user can
be a member in one or more groups, which grants her/him <br>
certain rights. Analogous concepts are used on many systems,
such as Unix and Windows systems and most content management
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A group may itself also be a
member of one or more groups, making it the subgroup of the
groups of which it is a member, which are in turn called
metagroups. A subgroup automati&acirc; <br>
cally inherits all memberships from all metagroups. This way
you can easily grant users multiple memberships at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A group is associated with at
most one service that uses RestAuth. A service can only see
the groups associated with it. If a group is not associated
with any service, the group <br>
can not be seen by any service, the only way to modify them
is via this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a group can be a
member of any other group, even it is associated with a
different service or none at all. A common use-case would be
to have a metagroup called admin <br>
that is either not associated with any service or with some
central management service. Any other services using
RestAuth have their own admin group (which can each have a
dif&acirc; <br>
ferent name, whatever suits the service best), which are
subgroups to the global admin group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Use one of the commands (either add, add-group, add-user,
list, rm, rm-group, rm-user or view) to perform the
respective operation. Each command usually requires more
arguments <br>
to it, see the respective section for arguments (and
possible options) for each command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use &quot;restauth-group.py
--help&quot; to get an authoritative list of available
commands. If you want help on a specific command, use
&quot;restauth-group.py command --help&quot; or see the <br>
AVAILABLE COMMANDS section below.</p>
