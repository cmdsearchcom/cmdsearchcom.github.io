<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
greylist - command line interface to greylistd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
greylist { -h | --help | help } <br>
greylist operation ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program provides a command line interface to
greylistd(8); please refer to that manual page for more
information on the purpose and functionality of this
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
In the following discussion, data... typically refers to the
following triplet of information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;sending host&rsquo;s IP
address&gt; &lt;sender@address&gt;
&lt;recipient@address&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following operations are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add [--white|--grey|--black]
data... <br>
Add data to the corresponding list (white if unspecified).
If the triplet of a future mail deliveriy (subject to
timeouts) matches this data, the idea is that the message
<br>
would be accepted, temporarily rejected, or permanently
rejected, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete data... <br>
Remove data from all lists. If the data exists in any list,
the command returns an exit status of 0, otherwise -1. A
message is printed on standard output indicating the <br>
action taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check [--white|--grey|--black]
data... <br>
Check the current status of data, i.e. if a message delivery
would succeed if its triplet matched this data. If a list is
specified, the word &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; is
<br>
printed, indicating whether the data was in the
corresponding list; the exit status is also set accordingly.
Otherwise, one of the words &quot;white&quot;,
&quot;grey&quot;, and &quot;black&quot; is <br>
written on standard output, and the exit status is 0, 1, or
2, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This operation is
non-intrusive, and thus does not update any of the greylist
data. So, for instance, if the data is currently in the
&quot;grey&quot; list, but its minimum <br>
retry time (retryMin) has elapsed, the text
&quot;white&quot; would be printed. However, unless an
update takes place prior to the retryMax timeout, the data
would still expire <br>
from the &quot;grey&quot; list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update [--white|--grey|--black]
data... <br>
Same, but also update the greylist data accordingly. So if
data is currently greylisted, but the minimum retry time
retryMin has elapsed since it was first seen, data is <br>
moved to the &quot;white&quot; list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This operation would normally be
used by mail transport agents (MTAs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stats Print some statistics on
greylist utilization and hits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mrtg Print statistics on
greylist and whitelist hits in a format that MRTG can use as
an External Monitoring Script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list [--white] [--grey]
[--black] <br>
Print available (original/unhashed) data items from the
corresponding list(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Internally, greylistd(8)
hashes the provided data into a single 32-bit value for
efficiency. Prior to version 0.6, the original data was not
retained; as of version <br>
0.6, data is saved if the &quot;savetriplets&quot; setting
in the [data] section of the configuration file is
&quot;true&quot;. Only data items (i.e. triplets) that have
been seen while this <br>
setting were enabled can be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save Force greylist data to be
immediately saved (synchronized) to the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data is also saved after any
operation if a certain update interval (default is 300
seconds/5 minutes) has elapsed since the last save, and
there are no pending requests <br>
to greylistd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload Save greylist data to
files, then reload configuration and data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear [--white] [--grey]
[--black] <br>
Clear all items in the specified list(s), or all lists if
none is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the whitelist is cleared, all
new data trilplets will initially be in a &quot;grey&quot;
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use with caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
greylist add --white 1.2.3.4 mailinglist@somewhere
subscriber@yourhost <br>
Whitelists messages received from the IP address 1.2.3.4 on
behalf of &lt;mailinglist@somewhere&gt; to
&lt;subscriber@yourhost&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">greylist check --grey 1.2.3.4
mailinglist@somewhere subscriber@yourhost <br>
Prints &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; on standard
output, depending on whether mail received from the IP
address 1.2.3.4 on behalf of &lt;mailinglist@somewhere&gt;
to &lt;subscriber@yourhost&gt; <br>
should be deferred or not, respectively. The data is neither
recorded nor changed to a &quot;white&quot; state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/run/greylistd/socket <br>
The UNIX domain socket providing the main interface to
&quot;greylistd&quot;.</p>
