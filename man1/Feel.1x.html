<p>Feel(1x) AfterStep X11 window manager Feel(1x)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Feel - AfterStep feel configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
AnimateDeskChange</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That setting requests nice
animation to be drawn over the desktop, during desktop
switching.Comment it out to speed up desktop switching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AppsBackingStore</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that app windows
should request backing store. X-terminals and low memory
systems should avoid this as redrawing will be quicker than
pulling the saved image <br>
from swap space. Backing store will always be faster than
redraw on machines that have enough memory. This causes
non-ICCCM compliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoFocus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use. Obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRaise delay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the delay in
milliseconds of focus a window must attain before being
raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoReverse 0|1|2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the window Warping
(also called alt-tabbing) style. 0 (the default) causes
switching among windows in one direction. 1 causes a closed
loop switching - <br>
#1-&gt;#2-&gt;#3-&gt;#4 then #4-&gt;#3-&gt;#2-&gt;#1. 2
causes an open loop switching - #1-&gt;#2-&gt;#3-&gt;#4 then
#4-&gt;#1-&gt;#2-&gt;#3 etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoTabThroughDesks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In conjunction with AutoReverse,
this will Warp (alt-tab) through windows on all desks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackingStore</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that decorations
should request backing store. Refer to AppsBackingStore for
further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CenterOnCirculate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that when Warping
(alt-tabbing), the desktop page containing the window to
which the pointer is moving will be automatically selected
and afterstep will attempt <br>
to center the target window in the desktop viewport, rather
than just flipping to the desktop the window resides in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CirculateSkipIcons</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that all icons should
be skipped when Warping (alt- tabbing) between windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickTime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that afterstep should
consider two mouse clicks made within delay milliseconds to
be a double mouse click, and not two single mouse clicks.
The default delay is <br>
150 milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickToFocus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that the keyboard
input (aka focus) stays with one window until a new
window&rsquo;s TitleBar is clicked on, or gains focus
through Warping or de-iconification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AfterStep will not switch focus
following mouse pointer, but instead will switch it when
window is explicitly clicked. This is the same as before.
The only difference is <br>
that AfterStep will not Raise window automagically, unless
some other settings are set. Possible way to Raise window on
focusing include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- set AutoRaise 0 in feel file (
delay of 0 )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- bind mouse clicks to Raise or
RaiseLower function in feel file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- set ClickToRaise flag in feel
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickToRaise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that windows should be
raised when a button is clicked in the titlebar, handle (low
bar), or application area. buttons specifies the list of
buttons which trig&acirc; <br>
gers this function. In AutoRaise mode this will simply raise
the window if the click is before the delay specified in
AutoRaise. In ClickToFocus mode, this will raise the <br>
window and give it focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CoverAnimationSteps steps
count</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CoverAnimationSteps is the
number of animation steps to take while removing blue-tinted
cover window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CoverAnimationType type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CoverAnimationType determines
what type of animation to use while removing blue-tinted
desktop cover - use values from 0 to 13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursor cursor_number
cursor_type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the cursor_type for
the given cursor_number . Valid cursor_numbers are 0 though
10 and listed in all the shipped feel.name files. The
cursor_types are listed in <br>
the /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CustomCursor path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds a custom cursor from the
search paths. AfterStep searches the following paths in
addition to the system Xorg/Xfree paths:
~/.afterstep/desktop/cursors/ and <br>
$SHAREDIR/afterstep/desktop/cursors/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: under Xorg, this is
probably depreciated. Current Xorg uses the Xcursor library
to load cursor data from a single file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DecorateTransients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that transient windows
(pop-up dialog boxes), which are normally not decorated,
should be given the usual title and low bars. Note: some
pop-up windows and menus <br>
are not managed by the window manager, so do not get these
decorations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultWindowBox
&quot;windowbox_name&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window boxes are processed in
order they were listed in config. If suitable windowbox
could not be found for the window in the database file -
then windowbox named in <br>
DefaultWindowBox will be forced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DeskAnimationSteps steps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies how many animation
steps should be rendered while switching desktops/removing
blue cover. Reduce that number to speedup animation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DeskAnimationType value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This requests particular type of
animation to be rendered while switching desktops. Available
values are in range of 0 to 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontMoveOff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that windows should
not be moved off or initially placed off of the desktop. A
few programs will not work cor- rectly if you use this
option. This only keeps <br>
windows from being completely lost off the edge of the
desktop. It insists on keeping 16 pixels on the desktop, but
does not attempt to keep the entire window on the desk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontRestoreFocus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will not restore focus to the
recently focused application wile switching desktops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeResistance delay pixels</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies how hard it should be
to change views within a desktop by moving the mouse over
the edge of the screen, and how hard it hould be to move a
window over the edge <br>
of a screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The delay in milliseconds,
defines how long the pointer must spend at the screen edge
before that view becomes current. This is useful in
conjunction with EdgeScroll 100 <br>
100, so the views don&rsquo;t get switched accidently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pixels defines how far over
the edge a window must &quot;appear&quot; to move before it
actually moves partially off the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that with EdgeScroll 0 0,
it is still possible to move or resize windows across the
edge of the current screen. By setting the pixels parameter
of EdgeResistance to <br>
10000, this type of motion is impossible. However, with
EdgeResistances less than 10000, but greater than 0, moving
over pages becomes difficult but not impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeScroll horizontal
vertical</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the percentage of a
page to scroll when the cursor hits the edge of a page.
Setting EdgeScroll to 0 0 will disable scrolling. Setting
this option to 100 100 will <br>
scroll whole pages. Set to 1000 1000, scrolling will wrap
around at the edge of the desktop. Both horizontal and
vertical should be positive numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FollowTitleChanges</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That will force AfterStep to
reread and merge all the hints and settings from the
database files, whenever window changes either its name or
icon name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a complex function
definition and is covered in the built-in
command/function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Also: AS Function for
further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconTitle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that a title should be
displayed under an iconified app. The colors used are the
ForeColor and BackColor of the ButtonTitleFocus in the
look.name file. Note: <br>
less space is left for the app&rsquo;s icon, so it will be
resized acordingly. Only a portion of the icon title will be
displayed until the icon gains focus, and then the title
<br>
&quot;box&quot; will expand to reveal the window&rsquo;s
entire name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeepIconWindows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that applications
should be allowed to specify their own icon windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key keyname context modifier
Command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a key-stroke binding
definition, similar to Mouse . keyname is the keyboard key
name. Valid keyname &rsquo;s are found in the
/usr/X11/include/X11/keysymdef.h file and <br>
are specified here without the leading &quot;XK_&quot;. The
context describes where the mouse is resting when the
keyname is pressed and can be any combination of the
following: R = <br>
Root window (main background) F = Window Frame (the
BottomBar handle corners) S = Window TitleBar or BottomBar I
= Iconified Button (minimized window icon) T = Window <br>
TitleBar W = Application Window A = Any of the above except

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenusHigh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that any pop-up
menu&rsquo;s submenu should appear at the top of the parent
menu instead of starting at the point in the parent window
where the submenu item lies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse button context modifier
Command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a mouse binding
definition. button is the mouse button number [0, 1, 2, or

A = Any of the above except for TitleButtons 1-10 =
TitleButton number of the TitleBar, corresponds to the <br>
entry in the look.name file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action to be taken by the
defined TitleButton is defined in the feel.name file.
Defining a TitleButton without having a corresponding entry
in the feel.name file will <br>
cause the TitleButton icon to be displayed, but not react
when pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Species that afterstep should
ignore the PPosition field when placing new windows, in
other words, windows can&rsquo;t choose where to place
themselves. Adherence to the PPosi&acirc; <br>
tion field is required for some applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoSnapKey key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AfterStep now has a feature that
&quot;snaps&quot; windows to different desktop features,
such as edges of other windows and edge of the screen. To
disable it temorarily you can <br>
press and hold Shift key. Use this setting to request
different modifier key instead of Shift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMove %</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the maximum size
window where opaque window movement should be used. % is
percent of the total screen area. Set to 0, all windows will
be moved using the tradi&acirc; <br>
tional rubber-band outline. Set to 100, all windows will be
move as solid windows. The default is 5 which allows small
windows to be moved in an opaque manner, but large <br>
windows to be moved as rubber-bands. Using this option with
large values can slow down video response on slower
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueResize %</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the maximum size
window where opaque resizing should be used. % is percent of
the total screen area. Set to 0, all windows will be resized

should request saveunders. This will cause afterstep to save
those portions of windows that are not visible to system
memory. This can sig&acirc; <br>
nificantly improve the performance during opaque moves, but
it causes a significant increase in memory usage. This can
also cause garbled display with some applications.</p>
