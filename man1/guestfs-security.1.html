<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
guestfs-security - security of libguestfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page discusses security implications of using
libguestfs, particularly with untrusted or malicious guests
or disk images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY OF MOUNTING FILESYSTEMS
<br>
You should never mount an untrusted guest filesystem
directly on your host kernel (eg. using loopback or
kpartx).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you mount a filesystem,
mistakes in the kernel filesystem (VFS) can be escalated
into exploits by attackers creating a malicious filesystem.
These exploits are very severe <br>
for two reasons. Firstly there are very many filesystem
drivers in the kernel, and many of them are infrequently
used and not much developer attention has been paid to the
code. <br>
Linux userspace helps potential crackers by detecting the
filesystem type and automatically choosing the right VFS
driver, even if that filesystem type is unexpected.
Secondly, <br>
a kernel-level exploit is like a local root exploit (worse
in some ways), giving immediate and total access to the
system right down to the hardware level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These exploits can be present in
the kernel for a very long time
(https://lwn.net/Articles/538898/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libguestfs provides a layered
approach to protecting you from exploits:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">untrusted filesystem <br>
-------------------------------------- <br>
appliance kernel <br>
-------------------------------------- <br>
qemu process running as non-root <br>
-------------------------------------- <br>
sVirt [if using libvirt + SELinux] <br>
-------------------------------------- <br>
host kernel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We run a Linux kernel inside a
qemu virtual machine, usually running as a non-root user.
The attacker would need to write a filesystem which first
exploited the kernel, and then <br>
exploited either qemu virtualization (eg. a faulty qemu
driver) or the libguestfs protocol, and finally to be as
serious as the host kernel exploit it would need to escalate
its <br>
privileges to root. Additionally if you use the libvirt back
end and SELinux, sVirt is used to confine the qemu process.
This multi-step escalation, performed by a static piece <br>
of data, is thought to be extremely hard to do, although we
never say &rsquo;never&rsquo; about security issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Callers can also reduce the
attack surface by forcing the filesystem type when mounting
(use &quot;guestfs_mount_vfs&quot; in guestfs(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
<br>
Be careful with any files or data that you download from a
guest (by &quot;download&quot; we mean not just the
&quot;guestfs_download&quot; in guestfs(3) command but any
command that reads files, <br>
filenames, directories or anything else from a disk image).
An attacker could manipulate the data to fool your program
into doing the wrong thing. Consider cases such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the data (file
etc) not being present</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; being present
but empty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; being much
larger than normal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; containing
arbitrary 8 bit data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; being in an
unexpected character encoding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; containing
homoglyphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL SECURITY <br>
The protocol is designed to be secure, being based on RFC
4506 (XDR) with a defined upper message size. However a
program that uses libguestfs must also take care - for
example <br>
you can write a program that downloads a binary from a disk
image and executes it locally, and no amount of protocol
security will save you from the consequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSPECTION SECURITY <br>
Parts of the inspection API (see &quot;INSPECTION&quot; in
guestfs(3)) return untrusted strings directly from the
guest, and these could contain any 8 bit data. Callers
should be careful <br>
to escape these before printing them to a structured file
(for example, use HTML escaping if creating a web page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guest configuration may be
altered in unusual ways by the administrator of the virtual
machine, and may not reflect reality (particularly for
untrusted or actively malicious <br>
guests). For example we parse the hostname from
configuration files like /etc/sysconfig/network that we find
in the guest, but the guest administrator can easily
manipulate <br>
these files to provide the wrong hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inspection API parses guest
configuration using two external libraries: Augeas (Linux
configuration) and hivex (Windows Registry). Both are
designed to be robust in the face <br>
of malicious data, although denial of service attacks are
still possible, for example with oversized configuration
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING UNTRUSTED GUEST COMMANDS
<br>
Be very cautious about running commands from the guest. By
running a command in the guest, you are giving CPU time to a
binary that you do not control, under the same user <br>
account as the library, albeit wrapped in qemu
virtualization. More information and alternatives can be
found in &quot;RUNNING COMMANDS&quot; in guestfs(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2010-3851 <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/642934</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This security bug concerns the
automatic disk format detection that qemu does on disk
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A raw disk image is just the raw
bytes, there is no header. Other disk images like qcow2
contain a special header. Qemu deals with this by looking
for one of the known headers, <br>
and if none is found then assuming the disk image must be
raw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows a guest which has
been given a raw disk image to write some other header. At
next boot (or when the disk image is accessed by libguestfs)
qemu would do autodetection <br>
and think the disk image format was, say, qcow2 based on the
header written by the guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This in itself would not be a
problem, but qcow2 offers many features, one of which is to
allow a disk image to refer to another image (called the
&quot;backing disk&quot;). It does this <br>
by placing the path to the backing disk into the qcow2
header. This path is not validated and could point to any
host file (eg. &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;). The backing disk is
then exposed <br>
through &quot;holes&quot; in the qcow2 disk image, which of
course is completely under the control of the attacker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In libguestfs this is rather
hard to exploit except under two circumstances:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. You have enabled the network
or have opened the disk in write mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. You are also running
untrusted code from the guest (see &quot;RUNNING
COMMANDS&quot; in guestfs(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way to avoid this is to
specify the expected disk format when adding disks (the
optional &quot;format&quot; option to
&quot;guestfs_add_drive_opts&quot; in guestfs(3)). You
should always do <br>
this if the disk is raw format, and it&rsquo;s a good idea
for other cases too. (See also &quot;DISK IMAGE
FORMATS&quot; in guestfs(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For disks added from libvirt
using calls like &quot;guestfs_add_domain&quot; in
guestfs(3), the format is fetched from libvirt and passed
through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For libguestfs tools, use the
--format command line parameter as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2011-4127 <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/752375</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a bug in the kernel
which allowed guests to overwrite parts of the host&rsquo;s
drives which they should not normally have access to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is sufficient to update
libguestfs to any version &acirc;&yen; 1.16 which contains a
change that mitigates the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2012-2690 <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/831117</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old versions of both virt-edit
and the guestfish &quot;edit&quot; command created a new
file containing the changes but did not set the permissions,
etc of the new file to match the old <br>
one. The result of this was that if you edited a security
sensitive file such as /etc/shadow then it would be left
world-readable after the edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is sufficient to update
libguestfs to any version &acirc;&yen; 1.16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2013-2124 <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/968306</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This security bug was a flaw in
inspection where an untrusted guest using a specially
crafted file in the guest OS could cause a double-free in
the C library (denial of service).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is sufficient to update
libguestfs to a version that is not vulnerable: libguestfs
&acirc;&yen; 1.20.8, &acirc;&yen; 1.22.2 or &acirc;&yen;
1.23.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2013-4419 <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1016960</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the guestfish(1)
--remote or guestfish --listen options, guestfish would
create a socket in a known location
(/tmp/.guestfish-$UID/socket-$PID).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The location has to be a known
one in order for both ends to communicate. However no
checking was done that the containing directory
(/tmp/.guestfish-$UID) is owned by the user. <br>
Thus another user could create this directory and
potentially hijack sockets owned by another user&rsquo;s
guestfish client or server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is sufficient to update
libguestfs to a version that is not vulnerable: libguestfs
&acirc;&yen; 1.20.12, &acirc;&yen; 1.22.7 or &acirc;&yen;
1.24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Denial of service when
inspecting disk images with corrupt btrfs volumes <br>
It was possible to crash libguestfs (and programs that use
libguestfs as a library) by presenting a disk image
containing a corrupt btrfs volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was caused by a NULL
pointer dereference causing a denial of service, and is not
thought to be exploitable any further.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See commit
d70ceb4cbea165c960710576efac5a5716055486 for the fix. This
fix is included in libguestfs stable branches
&acirc;&yen;&Acirc;&nbsp;1.26.0,
&acirc;&yen;&Acirc;&nbsp;1.24.6 and
&acirc;&yen;&Acirc;&nbsp;1.22.8, and also in RHEL
&acirc;&yen;&Acirc;&nbsp;7.0. <br>
Earlier versions of libguestfs are not vulnerable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2014-0191 <br>
Libguestfs previously used unsafe libxml2 APIs for parsing
libvirt XML. These APIs defaulted to allowing network
connections to be made when certain XML documents were <br>
presented. Using a malformed XML document it was also
possible to exhaust all CPU, memory or file descriptors on
the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the libvirt XML comes from
a trusted source (the libvirt daemon) it is not thought that
this could have been exploitable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was fixed in libguestfs
&acirc;&yen; 1.27.9 and the fix was backported to stable
versions &acirc;&yen; 1.26.2, &acirc;&yen; 1.24.9,
&acirc;&yen; 1.22.10 and &acirc;&yen; 1.20.13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shellshock (bash CVE-2014-6271)
<br>
This bash bug indirectly affects libguestfs. For more
information see:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2014-September/msg00252.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2014-8484 <br>
CVE-2014-8485 <br>
These two bugs in binutils affect the GNU strings(1)
program, and thus the &quot;guestfs_strings&quot; in
guestfs(3) and &quot;guestfs_strings_e&quot; in guestfs(3)
APIs in libguestfs. Running <br>
strings on an untrusted file could cause arbitrary code
execution (confined to the libguestfs appliance).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In libguestfs &acirc;&yen;
1.29.5 and &acirc;&yen; 1.28.3, libguestfs uses the
&quot;strings&quot; -a option to avoid BFD parsing on the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2015-5745 <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1251157</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not a vulnerability in
libguestfs, but because we always give a virtio-serial port
to each guest (since that is how guest-host communication
happens), an escalation from <br>
the appliance to the host qemu process is possible. This
could affect you if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; your libguestfs
program runs untrusted programs out of the guest (using
&quot;guestfs_sh&quot; in guestfs(3) etc), or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; another exploit
was found in (for example) kernel filesystem code that
allowed a malformed filesystem to take over the
appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use sVirt to confine
qemu, that would thwart some attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions of .ssh and
.ssh/authorized_keys <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1260778</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tools virt-customize(1),
virt-sysprep(1) and virt-builder(1) have an --ssh-inject
option for injecting an SSH key into virtual machine disk
images. They may create a <br>
~user/.ssh directory and ~user/.ssh/authorized_keys file in
the guest to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In libguestfs &lt; 1.31.5 and
libguestfs &lt; 1.30.2, the new directory and file would get
mode 0755 and mode 0644 respectively. However these
permissions (especially for ~user/.ssh) <br>
are wider than the permissions that OpenSSH uses. In current
libguestfs, the directory and file are created with mode
0700 and mode 0600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2015-8869 <br>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2015-8869</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This vulnerability in OCaml
might affect virt tools written in the OCaml programming
language. It affects only 64 bit platforms. Because this bug
affects code generation it is <br>
difficult to predict which precise software could be
affected, and therefore our recommendation is that you
recompile libguestfs using a version of the OCaml compiler
where this <br>
bug has been fixed (or ask your Linux distro to do the
same).</p>
