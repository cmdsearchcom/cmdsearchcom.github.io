guestfs-security - security of libguestfs
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This manual page discusses security implications of using libguestfs,
  particularly with untrusted or malicious guests or disk images.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SECURITY_OF_MOUNTING_FILESYSTEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_OF_MOUNTING_FILESYSTEMS">SECURITY
  OF MOUNTING FILESYSTEMS</a></h2>
You should never mount an untrusted guest filesystem directly on your host
  kernel (eg. using loopback or kpartx).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you mount a filesystem, mistakes in the kernel filesystem (VFS) can be
  escalated into exploits by attackers creating a malicious filesystem. These
  exploits are very severe for two reasons. Firstly there are very many
  filesystem drivers in the kernel, and many of them are infrequently used and
  not much developer attention has been paid to the code. Linux userspace helps
  potential crackers by detecting the filesystem type and automatically choosing
  the right VFS driver, even if that filesystem type is unexpected. Secondly, a
  kernel-level exploit is like a local root exploit (worse in some ways), giving
  immediate and total access to the system right down to the hardware level.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These exploits can be present in the kernel for a very long time
  (https://lwn.net/Articles/538898/).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Libguestfs provides a layered approach to protecting you from exploits:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   untrusted filesystem
 --------------------------------------
   appliance kernel
 --------------------------------------
   qemu process running as non-root
 --------------------------------------
   sVirt [if using libvirt + SELinux]
 --------------------------------------
   host kernel
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We run a Linux kernel inside a qemu virtual machine, usually running as a
  non-root user. The attacker would need to write a filesystem which first
  exploited the kernel, and then exploited either qemu virtualization (eg. a
  faulty qemu driver) or the libguestfs protocol, and finally to be as serious
  as the host kernel exploit it would need to escalate its privileges to root.
  Additionally if you use the libvirt back end and SELinux, sVirt is used to
  confine the qemu process. This multi-step escalation, performed by a static
  piece of data, is thought to be extremely hard to do, although we never say
  'never' about security issues.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Callers can also reduce the attack surface by forcing the filesystem type when
  mounting (use &quot;guestfs_mount_vfs&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3)).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="GENERAL_SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERAL_SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS">GENERAL
  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</a></h2>
Be careful with any files or data that you download from a guest (by
  &quot;download&quot; we mean not just the &quot;guestfs_download&quot; in
  <i>guestfs</i>(3) command but any command that reads files, filenames,
  directories or anything else from a disk image). An attacker could manipulate
  the data to fool your program into doing the wrong thing. Consider cases such
  as:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the data (file etc) not being present</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">being present but empty</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">being much larger than normal</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">containing arbitrary 8 bit data</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">being in an unexpected character encoding</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">containing homoglyphs.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PROTOCOL_SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#PROTOCOL_SECURITY">PROTOCOL
  SECURITY</a></h2>
The protocol is designed to be secure, being based on RFC 4506 (XDR) with a
  defined upper message size. However a program that uses libguestfs must also
  take care - for example you can write a program that downloads a binary from a
  disk image and executes it locally, and no amount of protocol security will
  save you from the consequences.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INSPECTION_SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#INSPECTION_SECURITY">INSPECTION
  SECURITY</a></h2>
Parts of the inspection API (see &quot;INSPECTION&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3))
  return untrusted strings directly from the guest, and these could contain any
  8 bit data. Callers should be careful to escape these before printing them to
  a structured file (for example, use HTML escaping if creating a web page).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Guest configuration may be altered in unusual ways by the administrator of the
  virtual machine, and may not reflect reality (particularly for untrusted or
  actively malicious guests). For example we parse the hostname from
  configuration files like <i>/etc/sysconfig/network</i> that we find in the
  guest, but the guest administrator can easily manipulate these files to
  provide the wrong hostname.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The inspection API parses guest configuration using two external libraries:
  Augeas (Linux configuration) and hivex (Windows Registry). Both are designed
  to be robust in the face of malicious data, although denial of service attacks
  are still possible, for example with oversized configuration files.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="RUNNING_UNTRUSTED_GUEST_COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNNING_UNTRUSTED_GUEST_COMMANDS">RUNNING
  UNTRUSTED GUEST COMMANDS</a></h2>
Be very cautious about running commands from the guest. By running a command in
  the guest, you are giving CPU time to a binary that you do not control, under
  the same user account as the library, albeit wrapped in qemu virtualization.
  More information and alternatives can be found in &quot;RUNNING COMMANDS&quot;
  in <i>guestfs</i>(3).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CVE-2010-3851"><a class="selflink" href="#CVE-2010-3851">CVE-2010-3851</a></h2>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/642934
<div class="Pp"></div>
This security bug concerns the automatic disk format detection that qemu does on
  disk images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A raw disk image is just the raw bytes, there is no header. Other disk images
  like qcow2 contain a special header. Qemu deals with this by looking for one
  of the known headers, and if none is found then assuming the disk image must
  be raw.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allows a guest which has been given a raw disk image to write some other
  header. At next boot (or when the disk image is accessed by libguestfs) qemu
  would do autodetection and think the disk image format was, say, qcow2 based
  on the header written by the guest.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This in itself would not be a problem, but qcow2 offers many features, one of
  which is to allow a disk image to refer to another image (called the
  &quot;backing disk&quot;). It does this by placing the path to the backing
  disk into the qcow2 header. This path is not validated and could point to any
  host file (eg. &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;). The backing disk is then exposed
  through &quot;holes&quot; in the qcow2 disk image, which of course is
  completely under the control of the attacker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In libguestfs this is rather hard to exploit except under two circumstances:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You have enabled the network or have opened the disk in
      write mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You are also running untrusted code from the guest (see
      &quot;RUNNING COMMANDS&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3)).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way to avoid this is to specify the expected disk format when adding disks
  (the optional &quot;format&quot; option to &quot;guestfs_add_drive_opts&quot;
  in <i>guestfs</i>(3)). You should always do this if the disk is raw format,
  and it's a good idea for other cases too. (See also &quot;DISK IMAGE
  FORMATS&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For disks added from libvirt using calls like &quot;guestfs_add_domain&quot; in
  <i>guestfs</i>(3), the format is fetched from libvirt and passed through.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For libguestfs tools, use the <i>--format</i> command line parameter as
  appropriate.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/752375
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a bug in the kernel which allowed guests to overwrite parts of the
  host's drives which they should not normally have access to.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is sufficient to update libguestfs to any version &#x2265; 1.16 which
  contains a change that mitigates the problem.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CVE-2012-2690"><a class="selflink" href="#CVE-2012-2690">CVE-2012-2690</a></h2>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/831117
<div class="Pp"></div>
Old versions of both virt-edit and the guestfish &quot;edit&quot; command
  created a new file containing the changes but did not set the permissions, etc
  of the new file to match the old one. The result of this was that if you
  edited a security sensitive file such as <i>/etc/shadow</i> then it would be
  left world-readable after the edit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is sufficient to update libguestfs to any version &#x2265; 1.16.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CVE-2013-2124"><a class="selflink" href="#CVE-2013-2124">CVE-2013-2124</a></h2>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/968306
<div class="Pp"></div>
This security bug was a flaw in inspection where an untrusted guest using a
  specially crafted file in the guest OS could cause a double-free in the C
  library (denial of service).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is sufficient to update libguestfs to a version that is not vulnerable:
  libguestfs &#x2265; 1.20.8, &#x2265; 1.22.2 or &#x2265; 1.23.2.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CVE-2013-4419"><a class="selflink" href="#CVE-2013-4419">CVE-2013-4419</a></h2>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1016960
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using the <i>guestfish</i>(1) <i>--remote</i> or guestfish <i>--listen</i>
  options, guestfish would create a socket in a known location (
  <i>/tmp/.guestfish-$UID/socket-$PID</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The location has to be a known one in order for both ends to communicate.
  However no checking was done that the containing directory (
  <i>/tmp/.guestfish-$UID</i>) is owned by the user. Thus another user could
  create this directory and potentially hijack sockets owned by another user's
  guestfish client or server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is sufficient to update libguestfs to a version that is not vulnerable:
  libguestfs &#x2265; 1.20.12, &#x2265; 1.22.7 or &#x2265; 1.24.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Denial_of_service_when_inspecting_disk_images_with_corrupt_btrfs_volumes"><a class="selflink" href="#Denial_of_service_when_inspecting_disk_images_with_corrupt_btrfs_volumes">Denial
  of service when inspecting disk images with corrupt btrfs volumes</a></h2>
It was possible to crash libguestfs (and programs that use libguestfs as a
  library) by presenting a disk image containing a corrupt btrfs volume.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This was caused by a NULL pointer dereference causing a denial of service, and
  is not thought to be exploitable any further.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See commit d70ceb4cbea165c960710576efac5a5716055486 for the fix. This fix is
  included in libguestfs stable branches &#x2265;&#x00A0;1.26.0,
  &#x2265;&#x00A0;1.24.6 and &#x2265;&#x00A0;1.22.8, and also in RHEL
  &#x2265;&#x00A0;7.0. Earlier versions of libguestfs are not vulnerable.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CVE-2014-0191"><a class="selflink" href="#CVE-2014-0191">CVE-2014-0191</a></h2>
Libguestfs previously used unsafe libxml2 APIs for parsing libvirt XML. These
  APIs defaulted to allowing network connections to be made when certain XML
  documents were presented. Using a malformed XML document it was also possible
  to exhaust all CPU, memory or file descriptors on the machine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the libvirt XML comes from a trusted source (the libvirt daemon) it is not
  thought that this could have been exploitable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This was fixed in libguestfs &#x2265; 1.27.9 and the fix was backported to
  stable versions &#x2265; 1.26.2, &#x2265; 1.24.9, &#x2265; 1.22.10 and
  &#x2265; 1.20.13.

These two bugs in binutils affect the GNU <i>strings</i>(1) program, and thus
  the &quot;guestfs_strings&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3) and
  &quot;guestfs_strings_e&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3) APIs in libguestfs. Running
  strings on an untrusted file could cause arbitrary code execution (confined to
  the libguestfs appliance).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In libguestfs &#x2265; 1.29.5 and &#x2265; 1.28.3, libguestfs uses the
  &quot;strings&quot; <i>-a</i> option to avoid BFD parsing on the file.

<div class="Pp"></div>
This is not a vulnerability in libguestfs, but because we always give a
  virtio-serial port to each guest (since that is how guest-host communication
  happens), an escalation from the appliance to the host qemu process is
  possible. This could affect you if:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">your libguestfs program runs untrusted programs out of the
      guest (using &quot;guestfs_sh&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3) etc), or</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">another exploit was found in (for example) kernel
      filesystem code that allowed a malformed filesystem to take over the
      appliance.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use sVirt to confine qemu, that would thwart some attacks.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Permissions_of_.ssh_and_.ssh/authorized_keys"><a class="selflink" href="#Permissions_of_.ssh_and_.ssh/authorized_keys">Permissions
  of <i>.ssh</i> and <i>.ssh/authorized_keys</i></a></h2>
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1260778
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tools <i>virt-customize</i>(1), <i>virt-sysprep</i>(1) and
  <i>virt-builder</i>(1) have an <i>--ssh-inject</i> option for injecting an SSH
  key into virtual machine disk images. They may create a <i>~user/.ssh</i>
  directory and <i>~user/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> file in the guest to do this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In libguestfs &lt; 1.31.5 and libguestfs &lt; 1.30.2, the new directory and file
  would get mode 0755 and mode 0644 respectively. However these permissions
  (especially for <i>~user/.ssh</i>) are wider than the permissions that OpenSSH
  uses. In current libguestfs, the directory and file are created with mode 0700
  and mode 0600.

<div class="Pp"></div>
This vulnerability in OCaml might affect virt tools written in the OCaml
  programming language. It affects only 64 bit platforms. Because this bug
  affects code generation it is difficult to predict which precise software
  could be affected, and therefore our recommendation is that you recompile
  libguestfs using a version of the OCaml compiler where this bug has been fixed
  (or ask your Linux distro to do the same).
