<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Adds, removes, or reads notes attached to objects, without
touching the objects themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, notes are saved to
and read from refs/notes/commits, but this default can be
overridden. See the OPTIONS, CONFIGURATION, and ENVIRONMENT
sections below. If this ref <br>
does not exist, it will be quietly created when it is first
needed to store a note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical use of notes is to
supplement a commit message without changing the commit
itself. Notes can be shown by git log along with the
original commit message. To distinguish <br>
these notes from the message stored in the commit object,
the notes are indented like the message, after an unindented
line saying &quot;Notes (&lt;refname&gt;):&quot; (or
&quot;Notes:&quot; for <br>
refs/notes/commits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes can also be added to
patches prepared with git format-patch by using the --notes
option. Such notes are added as a patch commentary after a
three dash separator line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To change which notes are shown
by git log, see the &quot;notes.displayRef&quot;
configuration in git-log(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the
&quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; configuration for
a way to carry notes across commands that rewrite
commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBCOMMANDS <br>
list <br>
List the notes object for a given object. If no object is
given, show a list of all note objects and the objects they
annotate (in the format &quot;&lt;note object&gt;
&lt;annotated <br>
object&gt;&quot;). This is the default subcommand if no
subcommand is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add <br>
Add notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD). Abort if
the object already has notes (use -f to overwrite existing
notes). However, if you&acirc;re using add interactively
(using <br>
an editor to supply the notes contents), then - instead of
aborting - the existing notes will be opened in the editor
(like the edit subcommand).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy <br>
Copy the notes for the first object onto the second object.
Abort if the second object already has notes, or if the
first object has none (use -f to overwrite existing notes
<br>
to the second object). This subcommand is equivalent to: git
notes add [-f] -C $(git notes list &lt;from-object&gt;)
&lt;to-object&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In --stdin mode, take lines in
the format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;from-object&gt; SP
&lt;to-object&gt; [ SP &lt;rest&gt; ] LF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on standard input, and copy the
notes from each &lt;from-object&gt; to its corresponding
&lt;to-object&gt;. (The optional &lt;rest&gt; is ignored so
that the command can read the input given <br>
to the post-rewrite hook.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append <br>
Append to the notes of an existing object (defaults to
HEAD). Creates a new notes object if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit <br>
Edit the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show <br>
Show the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge <br>
Merge the given notes ref into the current notes ref. This
will try to merge the changes made by the given notes ref
(called &quot;remote&quot;) since the merge-base (if any)
into the <br>
current notes ref (called &quot;local&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If conflicts arise and a
strategy for automatically resolving conflicting notes (see
the -s/--strategy option) is not given, the
&quot;manual&quot; resolver is used. This resolver <br>
checks out the conflicting notes in a special worktree
(.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE), and instructs the user to
manually resolve the conflicts there. When done, the user
can <br>
either finalize the merge with git notes merge --commit, or
abort the merge with git notes merge --abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove <br>
Remove the notes for given objects (defaults to HEAD). When
giving zero or one object from the command line, this is
equivalent to specifying an empty note message to the <br>
edit subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prune <br>
Remove all notes for non-existing/unreachable objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-ref <br>
Print the current notes ref. This provides an easy way to
retrieve the current notes ref (e.g. from scripts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f, --force <br>
When adding notes to an object that already has notes,
overwrite the existing notes (instead of aborting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;msg&gt;,
--message=&lt;msg&gt; <br>
Use the given note message (instead of prompting). If
multiple -m options are given, their values are concatenated
as separate paragraphs. Lines starting with # and empty <br>
lines other than a single line between paragraphs will be
stripped out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;file&gt;,
--file=&lt;file&gt; <br>
Take the note message from the given file. Use - to read the
note message from the standard input. Lines starting with #
and empty lines other than a single line between <br>
paragraphs will be stripped out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;object&gt;,
--reuse-message=&lt;object&gt; <br>
Take the given blob object (for example, another note) as
the note message. (Use git notes copy &lt;object&gt; instead
to copy notes between objects.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;object&gt;,
--reedit-message=&lt;object&gt; <br>
Like -C, but with -c the editor is invoked, so that the user
can further edit the note message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ref &lt;ref&gt; <br>
Manipulate the notes tree in &lt;ref&gt;. This overrides
GIT_NOTES_REF and the &quot;core.notesRef&quot;
configuration. The ref is taken to be in refs/notes/ if it
is not qualified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing <br>
Do not consider it an error to request removing notes from
an object that does not have notes attached to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
Also read the object names to remove notes from from the
standard input (there is no reason you cannot combine this
with object names from the command line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Do not remove anything; just report the object names whose
notes would be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;strategy&gt;,
--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt; <br>
When merging notes, resolve notes conflicts using the given
strategy. The following strategies are recognized:
&quot;manual&quot; (default), &quot;ours&quot;,
&quot;theirs&quot;, &quot;union&quot; and <br>
&quot;cat_sort_uniq&quot;. See the &quot;NOTES MERGE
STRATEGIES&quot; section below for more information on each
notes merge strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--commit <br>
Finalize an in-progress git notes merge. Use this option
when you have resolved the conflicts that git notes merge
stored in .git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE. This amends the <br>
partial merge commit created by git notes merge (stored in
.git/NOTES_MERGE_PARTIAL) by adding the notes in
.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE. The notes ref stored in the <br>
.git/NOTES_MERGE_REF symref is updated to the resulting
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort <br>
Abort/reset a in-progress git notes merge, i.e. a notes
merge with conflicts. This simply removes all files related
to the notes merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
When merging notes, operate quietly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
When merging notes, be more verbose. When pruning notes,
report all object names whose notes are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
Commit notes are blobs containing extra information about an
object (usually information to supplement a commit&acirc;s
message). These blobs are taken from notes refs. A notes ref
is <br>
usually a branch which contains &quot;files&quot; whose
paths are the object names for the objects they describe,
with some directory separators included for performance
reasons [1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every notes change creates a new
commit at the specified notes ref. You can therefore inspect
the history of the notes by invoking, e.g., git log -p
notes/commits. Currently the <br>
commit message only records which operation triggered the
update, and the commit authorship is determined according to
the usual rules (see git-commit(1)). These details may <br>
change in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also permitted for a notes
ref to point directly to a tree object, in which case the
history of the notes can be read with git log -p -g
&lt;refname&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES <br>
The default notes merge strategy is &quot;manual&quot;,
which checks out conflicting notes in a special work tree
for resolving notes conflicts (.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE),
and instructs <br>
the user to resolve the conflicts in that work tree. When
done, the user can either finalize the merge with git notes
merge --commit, or abort the merge with git notes merge <br>
--abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ours&quot; automatically
resolves conflicting notes in favor of the local version
(i.e. the current notes ref).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;theirs&quot; automatically
resolves notes conflicts in favor of the remote version
(i.e. the given notes ref being merged into the current
notes ref).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;union&quot; automatically
resolves notes conflicts by concatenating the local and
remote versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cat_sort_uniq&quot; is
similar to &quot;union&quot;, but in addition to
concatenating the local and remote versions, this strategy
also sorts the resulting lines, and removes duplicate lines
<br>
from the result. This is equivalent to applying the
&quot;cat | sort | uniq&quot; shell pipeline to the local
and remote versions. This strategy is useful if the notes
follow a line-based <br>
format where one wants to avoid duplicated lines in the
merge result. Note that if either the local or remote
version contain duplicate lines prior to the merge, these
will also <br>
be removed by this notes merge strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
You can use notes to add annotations with information that
was not available at the time a commit was written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes: <br>
Tested-by: Johannes Sixt &lt;j6t@kdbg.org&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In principle, a note is a
regular Git blob, and any kind of (non-)format is accepted.
You can binary-safely create notes from arbitrary files
using git hash-object:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cc *.c <br>
$ blob=$(git hash-object -w a.out) <br>
$ git notes --ref=built add -C &quot;$blob&quot; HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(You cannot simply use git notes
--ref=built add -F a.out HEAD because that is not
binary-safe.) Of course, it doesn&acirc;t make much sense to
display non-text-format notes with git <br>
log, so if you use such notes, you&acirc;ll probably need to
write some special-purpose tools to do something useful with
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
core.notesRef <br>
Notes ref to read and manipulate instead of
refs/notes/commits. Must be an unabbreviated ref name. This
setting can be overridden through the environment and
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.displayRef <br>
Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once),
in addition to the default set by core.notesRef or
GIT_NOTES_REF, to read notes from when showing commit
messages <br>
with the git log family of commands. This setting can be
overridden on the command line or by the
GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF environment variable. See
git-log(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;
<br>
When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently amend
or rebase), if this variable is false, git will not copy
notes from the original to the rewritten commit. Defaults to
<br>
true. See also &quot;notes.rewriteRef&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting can be overridden
by the GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.rewriteMode <br>
When copying notes during a rewrite, what to do if the
target commit already has a note. Must be one of overwrite,
concatenate, and ignore. Defaults to concatenate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting can be overridden
with the GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.rewriteRef <br>
When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully
qualified) ref whose notes should be copied. May be a glob,
in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied.
<br>
You may also specify this configuration several times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Does not have a default value;
you must configure this variable to enable note
rewriting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can be overridden with the
GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
GIT_NOTES_REF <br>
Which ref to manipulate notes from, instead of
refs/notes/commits. This overrides the core.notesRef
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF <br>
Colon-delimited list of refs or globs indicating which refs,
in addition to the default from core.notesRef or
GIT_NOTES_REF, to read notes from when showing commit
messages. <br>
This overrides the notes.displayRef setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A warning will be issued for
refs that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any
refs is silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE <br>
When copying notes during a rewrite, what to do if the
target commit already has a note. Must be one of overwrite,
concatenate, and ignore. This overrides the <br>
core.rewriteMode setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF <br>
When rewriting commits, which notes to copy from the
original to the rewritten commit. Must be a colon-delimited
list of refs or globs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not set in the environment,
the list of notes to copy depends on the
notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt; and notes.rewriteRef
settings.</p>
