<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pgmcrater - create cratered terrain by fractal forgery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pgmcrater</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-number n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-height|-ysize s]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgmcrater creates a PGM image
which mimics cratered terrain. The PGM image is created by
simulating the impact of a given number of craters with
random position and size, then <br>
rendering the resulting terrain elevations based on a light
source shining from one side of the screen. The size
distribution of the craters is based on a power law which
<br>
results in many more small craters than large ones. The
number of craters of a given size varies as the reciprocal
of the area as described on pages 31 and 32 of Peitgen and
<br>
Saupe[1]; cratered bodies in the Solar System are observed
to obey this relationship. The formula used to obtain crater
radii governed by this law from a uniformly distributed <br>
pseudorandom sequence was developed by Rudy Rucker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">High resolution images with
large numbers of craters often benefit from being piped
through pnmsmooth. The averaging performed by this process
eliminates some of the jagged pix&acirc; <br>
els and lends a mellow &lsquo;&lsquo;telescopic
image&rsquo;&rsquo; feel to the overall picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgmcrater simulates only small
craters, which are hemispherical in shape (regardless of the
incidence angle of the impacting body, as long as the
velocity is sufficiently high). <br>
Large craters, such as Copernicus and Tycho on the Moon,
have a &lsquo;&lsquo;walled plain&rsquo;&rsquo; shape with a
cross-section more like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/&nbsp; / _____/
____________/____________/ _____</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Larger craters should really use
this profile, including the central peak, and totally
obliterate the pre-existing terrain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The randomness in the image is
limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) -- if you run
the program twice in the same second, you may get identical
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-number n <br>
Causes n craters to be generated. If no -number
specification is given, 50000 craters will be generated.
Don&rsquo;t expect to see them all! For every large crater
there are <br>
many, many more tiny ones which tend simply to erode the
landscape. In general, the more craters you specify the more
realistic the result; ideally you want the entire <br>
terrain to have been extensively turned over again and again
by cratering. High resolution images containing five to ten
million craters are stunning but take quite a <br>
while to create.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-height height <br>
Sets the height of the generated image to height pixels. The
default height is 256 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width width <br>
Sets the width of the generated image to width pixels. The
default width is 256 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsize width <br>
Sets the width of the generated image to width pixels. The
default width is 256 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ysize height <br>
Sets the height of the generated image to height pixels. The
default height is 256 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma factor <br>
The specified factor is used to gamma adjust the image in
the same manner as performed by pnmgamma. The default value
is 1.0, which results in a medium contrast image. <br>
Values larger than 1 lighten the image and reduce contrast,
while values less than 1 darken the image, increasing
contrast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is separate from
the gamma correction that is part of the definition of the
PGM format. The image pnmgamma generates is a genuine,
gamma-corrected PGM <br>
image in any case. This option simply changes the contrast
and may compensate for a display device that does not
correctly render PGM images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-randomseed=integer <br>
This is the seed for the random number generator that
generates the pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this to ensure you get the
same image on separate invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pgmnoise uses a seed
derived from the time of day and process ID, which gives you
fairly uncorrelated results in multiple invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.61 (December 2012).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESIGN NOTES <br>
The-gamma option isn&rsquo;t really necessary since you can
achieve the same effect by piping the output from pgmcrater
through pnmgamma. However, pgmcrater performs an internal
gamma <br>
map anyway in the process of rendering the elevation array
into the PGM format, so there&rsquo;s no additional overhead
in allowing an additional gamma adjustment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Real craters have two distinct
morphologies.</p>
