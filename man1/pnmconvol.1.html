This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmconvol</b> reads a Netpbm image as input, convolves it with a specified
  convolution matrix, and writes a Netpbm image as output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Convolution means replacing each pixel with a weighted average of the nearby
  pixels. The weights and the area to average are determined by the convolution
  matrix (sometimes called a convolution kernel), which you supply in one of
  several ways. See <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="#convolutionmatrix">
<br/>
 Convolution Matrix</a> .
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the edges of the convolved image, where the convolution matrix would extend
  over the edge of the image, <b>pnmconvol</b> just copies the input pixels
  directly to the output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The convolution computation can result in a value which is outside the range
  representable in the output. When that happens, <b>pnmconvol</b> just clips
  the output, which means brightness is not conserved.

There are three ways to specify the convolution matrix:

  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In a file (or set of them) named by a <b>-matrixfile</b>
      option, whose contents are similar to a <b>-matrix</b> option value.

  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">With a special PNM file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The PNM file option is the hardest, and exists only because until Netpbm 10.49
  (December 2009), it was the only way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The regular convolution matrix file is slightly easier to read than the
  <b>-matrix</b> option value, and makes your command line less messy, but
  requires you to manage a separate file. With the file, you can have separate
  convolution matrices for the individual color components, which you can't do
  with <b>-matrix</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In any case, the convolution matrix <b>pnmconvol</b> uses is a matrix of real
  numbers. They can be whole or fractional, positive, negative, or zero.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The convolution matrix always has an odd width and height, so that there is a
  center element. <b>pnmconvol</b> figuratively places that center element over
  a pixel of the input image and weights that pixel and its neighbors as
  indicated by the convolution matrix to produce the pixel in the same location
  of the output image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a normal convolution, where you're neither adding nor subtracting total
  value from the image, but merely moving it around, you'll want to make sure
  that all the numbers in the matrix add up to 1. If they don't,
  <b>pnmconvol</b> warns you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The elements of the matrix are actually tuples, one for each sample in the
  input. (I.e. if the input is an RGB image, each element of the convolution
  matrix has one weight for red, one for green, and one for blue.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Directly On the Command Line</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example of a <b>-matrix</b> option is
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    -matrix=0,.2,0;.2,.2,.2;0,.2,0
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value consists of each row of the matrix from top to bottom, separated by
  semicolons. Each row consists of the elements of the row from left to right,
  separated by commas. You must of course have the same number of elements in
  each row. Each element is a decimal floating point number and is the weight to
  give to each component of a pixel that corresponds to that matrix location.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that when you supply this option via a shell, semicolon (';') probably
  means something to the shell, so use quotation marks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no way with this method to have different weights for different
  components of a pixel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-normalize</b> option is often quite handy with <b>-matrix</b> because it
  lets you quickly throw together the command without working out the math to
  make sure the matrix isn't biased. Note that if you use the <b>-normalize</b>
  option, the weights in the matrix aren't actually the numbers you specify in
  the <b>-matrix</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Regular Matrix File</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specify the name of the matrix file with a <b>-matrixfile</b> option. Or specify
  a list of them, one for each plane of the image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    -matrixfile=mymatrix
<div class="Pp"></div>
    -matrixfile=myred,mygreen,myblue
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each file applies to one plane of the image (e.g. red, green, or blue), in
  order. The matrix in each file must have the same dimensions. If the input
  image has more planes than the number of files you specify, the first file
  applies to the extra planes as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmconvol</b> interprets the file as text, with lines delimited by Unix
  newline characters (line feeds).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each line of the file is one row of the matrix, in order from top to bottom.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each row, the file contains a floating point decimal number for each element
  in the row, from left to right, separated by spaces. This is not just any old
  white space -- it is exactly one space. Two spaces in a row mean you've
  specified a null string for an element (which is invalid). If you want to line
  up your matrix visually, use leading and trailing zeroes in the floating point
  numbers to do it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no way to put comments in the file. There is no signature or any other
  metadata in the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you use the <b>-normalize</b> option, the weights in the matrix
  aren't actually what is in the file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>PNM File</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), this was the only way to specify a
  convolution matrix. <b>pnmconvol</b> used this method in an attempt to exploit
  the generic matrix processing capabilities of Netpbm, but as the Netpbm
  formats don't directly allow matrices with the kinds of numbers you need in a
  convolution matrix, it is quite cumbersome. In fact, there simply is no way to
  specify some convolution matrices with a legal Netpbm image, so make it work,
  <b>pnmconvol</b> has to relax the Netpbm file requirement that sample values
  be no greater than the image's maxval. I.e. it isn't even a real PNM file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way you select this method of supplying the convolution matrix is to
  <i>not</i> specify <b>-matrix</b> or <b>-matrixfile</b>. When you do that, you
  must specify a second non-option argument -- that is the name of the PNM file
  (or PNM equivalent PAM file).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two ways <b>pnmconvol</b> interprets the PNM convolution matrix image
  pixels as weights: with offsets, and without offsets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The simpler of the two is without offsets. That is what happens when you specify
  the <b>-nooffset</b> option. In that case, <b>pnmconvol</b> simply normalizes
  the sample values in the PNM image by dividing by the maxval.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, here is a sample convolution file that causes an output pixel to be
  a simple average of its corresponding input pixel and its 8 neighbors,
  resulting in a smoothed image:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    P2
    3 3
    18
    2 2 2
    2 2 2
    2 2 2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note that the above text is an actual PGM file -- you can cut and paste it. If
  you're not familiar with the plain PGM format, see
  <b>the</b>PGM<b>format</b>specification<b>(1)</b> ).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmconvol</b> divides each of the sample values (2) by the maxval (18) so the
  weight of each of the 9 input pixels gets is 1/9, which is exactly what you
  want to keep the overall brightness of the image the same. <b>pnmconvol</b>
  creates an output pixel by multiplying the values of each of 9 pixels by 1/9
  and adding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that with maxval 18, the range of possible values is 0 to 18. After
  scaling, the range is 0 to 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a normal convolution, where you're neither adding nor subtracting total
  value from the image, but merely moving it around, you'll want to make sure
  that all the scaled values in (each plane of) your convolution PNM add up to
  1, which means all the actual sample values add up to the maxval.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you <i>don't</i> specify <b>-nooffset</b>, <b>pnmconvol</b> applies an
  offset, the purpose of which is to allow you to indicate negative weights even
  though PNM sample values are never negative. In this case, <b>pnmconvol</b>
  subtracts half the maxval from each sample and then normalizes by dividing by
  half the maxval. So to get the same result as we did above with
  <b>-nooffset</b>, the convolution matrix PNM image would have to look like
  this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    P2
    3 3
    18
    10 10 10
    10 10 10
    10 10 10
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To see how this works, do the above-mentioned offset: 10 - 18/2 gives 1. The
  normalization step divides by 18/2 = 9, which makes it 1/9 - exactly what you
  want. The equivalent matrix for 5x5 smoothing would have maxval 50 and be
  filled with 26.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that with maxval 18, the range of possible values is 0 to 18. After offset,
  that's -9 to 9, and after normalizing, the range is -1 to 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The convolution file will usually be a PGM, so that the same convolution gets
  applied to each color component. However, if you want to use a PPM and do a
  different convolution to different colors, you can certainly do that.

<b>pnmconvol</b> does only arithmetic, linear combination convolution. There are
  other forms of convolution that are especially useful in image processing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pgmmedian</b> does median filtering, which is a form of convolution where the
  output pixel value, rather than being a linear combination of the pixels in
  the window, is the median of a certain subset of them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pgmmorphconv</b> does dilation and erosion, which is like the median filter
  but the output value is the minimum or maximum of the values in the window.

  <dd class="It-tag">This option says to adjust the weights in your convolution
      matrix so they all add up to one. You usually want them to add up to one
      so that the convolved result tends to have the same overall brightness as
      the input. With <b>-normalize</b>, <b>pnmconvol</b> scales all the weights
      by the same factor to make the sum one. It does this for each plane.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This can be quite convenient because you can just throw numbers into the
      matrix that have roughly the right relationship to each other and let
      <b>pnmconvol</b> do the work of normalizing them. And you can adjust a
      matrix by raising or lowering certain weights without having to modify all
      the other weights to maintain normalcy. And you can use friendly integers.

The <b>-nooffset</b> option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), making it
  substantially easier to specify a convolution matrix, but still hard. In
  Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), the PNM convolution matrix tyranny was finally
  ended with the <b>-matrix</b> and <b>-matrixfile</b> options. In between,
  <b>pnmconvol</b> was broken for a while because the Netpbm library started
  enforcing the requirement that a sample value not exceed the maxval of the
  image. <b>pnmconvol</b> used the Netpbm library to read the PNM convolution
  matrix file, but in the pseudo-PNM format that <b>pnmconvol</b> uses, a sample
  value sometimes has to exceed the maxval.
