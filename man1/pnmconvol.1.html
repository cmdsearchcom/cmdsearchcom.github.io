<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmconvol - general MxN convolution on a Netpbm image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmconvol { -matrix=convolution_matrix |
-matrixfile=filename[,filename[, ...]] } [netpbmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmconvol
convolution_matrix_file [-normalize] [-nooffset]
[netpbmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmconvol reads a Netpbm image
as input, convolves it with a specified convolution matrix,
and writes a Netpbm image as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Convolution means replacing each
pixel with a weighted average of the nearby pixels. The
weights and the area to average are determined by the
convolution matrix (sometimes <br>
called a convolution kernel), which you supply in one of
several ways. See <br>
Convolution Matrix
&acirc;&uml;#convolutionmatrix&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the edges of the convolved
image, where the convolution matrix would extend over the
edge of the image, pnmconvol just copies the input pixels
directly to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The convolution computation can
result in a value which is outside the range representable
in the output. When that happens, pnmconvol just clips the
output, which means bright&acirc; <br>
ness is not conserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Convolution Matrix <br>
There are three ways to specify the convolution matrix:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; directly with a
-matrix option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In a file (or
set of them) named by a -matrixfile option, whose contents
are similar to a -matrix option value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With a special
PNM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PNM file option is the
hardest, and exists only because until Netpbm 10.49
(December 2009), it was the only way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The regular convolution matrix
file is slightly easier to read than the -matrix option
value, and makes your command line less messy, but requires
you to manage a separate file. <br>
With the file, you can have separate convolution matrices
for the individual color components, which you can&rsquo;t
do with -matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any case, the convolution
matrix pnmconvol uses is a matrix of real numbers. They can
be whole or fractional, positive, negative, or zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The convolution matrix always
has an odd width and height, so that there is a center
element. pnmconvol figuratively places that center element
over a pixel of the input image <br>
and weights that pixel and its neighbors as indicated by the
convolution matrix to produce the pixel in the same location
of the output image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a normal convolution, where
you&rsquo;re neither adding nor subtracting total value from
the image, but merely moving it around, you&rsquo;ll want to
make sure that all the numbers in <br>
the matrix add up to 1. If they don&rsquo;t, pnmconvol warns
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The elements of the matrix are
actually tuples, one for each sample in the input. (I.e. if
the input is an RGB image, each element of the convolution
matrix has one weight for <br>
red, one for green, and one for blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directly On the Command Line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of a -matrix option
is</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-matrix=0,.2,0;.2,.2,.2;0,.2,0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value consists of each row
of the matrix from top to bottom, separated by semicolons.
Each row consists of the elements of the row from left to
right, separated by commas. <br>
You must of course have the same number of elements in each
row. Each element is a decimal floating point number and is
the weight to give to each component of a pixel that
cor&acirc; <br>
responds to that matrix location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when you supply this
option via a shell, semicolon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;) probably
means something to the shell, so use quotation marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way with this method
to have different weights for different components of a
pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -normalize option is often
quite handy with -matrix because it lets you quickly throw
together the command without working out the math to make
sure the matrix isn&rsquo;t biased. <br>
Note that if you use the -normalize option, the weights in
the matrix aren&rsquo;t actually the numbers you specify in
the -matrix option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular Matrix File</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the name of the matrix
file with a -matrixfile option. Or specify a list of them,
one for each plane of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-matrixfile=mymatrix</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-matrixfile=myred,mygreen,myblue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file applies to one plane
of the image (e.g. red, green, or blue), in order. The
matrix in each file must have the same dimensions. If the
input image has more planes than <br>
the number of files you specify, the first file applies to
the extra planes as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmconvol interprets the file as
text, with lines delimited by Unix newline characters (line
feeds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line of the file is one row
of the matrix, in order from top to bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each row, the file contains
a floating point decimal number for each element in the row,
from left to right, separated by spaces. This is not just
any old white space -- it <br>
is exactly one space. Two spaces in a row mean you&rsquo;ve
specified a null string for an element (which is invalid).
If you want to line up your matrix visually, use leading and
<br>
trailing zeroes in the floating point numbers to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to put comments
in the file. There is no signature or any other metadata in
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you use the
-normalize option, the weights in the matrix aren&rsquo;t
actually what is in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PNM File</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.49 (December
2009), this was the only way to specify a convolution
matrix. pnmconvol used this method in an attempt to exploit
the generic matrix processing <br>
capabilities of Netpbm, but as the Netpbm formats
don&rsquo;t directly allow matrices with the kinds of
numbers you need in a convolution matrix, it is quite
cumbersome. In fact, <br>
there simply is no way to specify some convolution matrices
with a legal Netpbm image, so make it work, pnmconvol has to
relax the Netpbm file requirement that sample values be <br>
no greater than the image&rsquo;s maxval. I.e. it
isn&rsquo;t even a real PNM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way you select this method
of supplying the convolution matrix is to not specify
-matrix or -matrixfile. When you do that, you must specify a
second non-option argument -- <br>
that is the name of the PNM file (or PNM equivalent PAM
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways pnmconvol
interprets the PNM convolution matrix image pixels as
weights: with offsets, and without offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simpler of the two is
without offsets. That is what happens when you specify the
-nooffset option. In that case, pnmconvol simply normalizes
the sample values in the PNM <br>
image by dividing by the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, here is a sample
convolution file that causes an output pixel to be a simple
average of its corresponding input pixel and its 8
neighbors, resulting in a smoothed <br>
image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P2 <br>
3 3 <br>
18 <br>
2 2 2 <br>
2 2 2 <br>
2 2 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that the above text is an
actual PGM file -- you can cut and paste it. If you&rsquo;re
not familiar with the plain PGM format, see
thePGMformatspecification(1) ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmconvol divides each of the
sample values (2) by the maxval (18) so the weight of each
of the 9 input pixels gets is 1/9, which is exactly what you
want to keep the overall <br>
brightness of the image the same. pnmconvol creates an
output pixel by multiplying the values of each of 9 pixels
by 1/9 and adding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that with maxval 18, the
range of possible values is 0 to 18. After scaling, the
range is 0 to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a normal convolution, where
you&rsquo;re neither adding nor subtracting total value from
the image, but merely moving it around, you&rsquo;ll want to
make sure that all the scaled values <br>
in (each plane of) your convolution PNM add up to 1, which
means all the actual sample values add up to the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you don&rsquo;t specify
-nooffset, pnmconvol applies an offset, the purpose of which
is to allow you to indicate negative weights even though PNM
sample values are never negative. <br>
In this case, pnmconvol subtracts half the maxval from each
sample and then normalizes by dividing by half the maxval.
So to get the same result as we did above with -nooffset,
<br>
the convolution matrix PNM image would have to look like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P2 <br>
3 3 <br>
18 <br>
10 10 10 <br>
10 10 10 <br>
10 10 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see how this works, do the
above-mentioned offset: 10 - 18/2 gives 1. The normalization
step divides by 18/2 = 9, which makes it 1/9 - exactly what
you want. The equivalent <br>
matrix for 5x5 smoothing would have maxval 50 and be filled
with 26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that with maxval 18, the
range of possible values is 0 to 18. After offset,
that&rsquo;s -9 to 9, and after normalizing, the range is -1
to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The convolution file will
usually be a PGM, so that the same convolution gets applied
to each color component. However, if you want to use a PPM
and do a different convolution <br>
to different colors, you can certainly do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Forms of Convolution <br>
pnmconvol does only arithmetic, linear combination
convolution. There are other forms of convolution that are
especially useful in image processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgmmedian does median filtering,
which is a form of convolution where the output pixel value,
rather than being a linear combination of the pixels in the
window, is the median of <br>
a certain subset of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgmmorphconv does dilation and
erosion, which is like the median filter but the output
value is the minimum or maximum of the values in the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-matrix=convolution_matrix <br>
The value of the convolution matrix. See Convolution Matrix
&acirc;&uml;#matrixopt&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may not specify both this
and -matrixfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.49 (December 2009). Before that, use a PNM file for the
convolution matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-matrixfile=filename <br>
This specifies that you are supplying the convolution matrix
in a file and names that file. See Convolution Matrix
&acirc;&uml;#matrixfile&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may not specify both this
and -matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.49 (December 2009). Before that, use a PNM file for the
convolution matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-normalize <br>
This option says to adjust the weights in your convolution
matrix so they all add up to one. You usually want them to
add up to one so that the convolved result tends to <br>
have the same overall brightness as the input. With
-normalize, pnmconvol scales all the weights by the same
factor to make the sum one. It does this for each plane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be quite convenient
because you can just throw numbers into the matrix that have
roughly the right relationship to each other and let
pnmconvol do the work of <br>
normalizing them. And you can adjust a matrix by raising or
lowering certain weights without having to modify all the
other weights to maintain normalcy. And you can use <br>
friendly integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pnmconvol myimage.ppm
-normalize -matrix=1,1,1;1,1,1;1,1,1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is of course a basic 3x3
average, but without you having to specify 1/9 (.1111111)
for each weight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect when
you specify the convolution matrix via pseudo-PNM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.50 (March 2010).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nooffset= <br>
This is part of the obsolete PNM image method of specifying
the convolution matrix. See Convolution Matrix
&acirc;&uml;#matrixpnm&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The -nooffset option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004),
making it substantially easier to specify a convolution
matrix, but still hard. In Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), the
<br>
PNM convolution matrix tyranny was finally ended with the
-matrix and -matrixfile options. In between, pnmconvol was
broken for a while because the Netpbm library started <br>
enforcing the requirement that a sample value not exceed the
maxval of the image. pnmconvol used the Netpbm library to
read the PNM convolution matrix file, but in the pseudo-
<br>
PNM format that pnmconvol uses, a sample value sometimes has
to exceed the maxval.</p>
