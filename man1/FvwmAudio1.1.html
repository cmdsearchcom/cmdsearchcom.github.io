<p>FvwmAudio(1) General Commands Manual FvwmAudio(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmAudio - the FVWM Audio module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
FvwmAudio is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
will work. From within the .fvwmrc file, FvwmAudio is
spawned as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module FvwmAudio</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or from within an fvwm pop-up
menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The FvwmAudio module communicates with the Fvwm window
manager to bind audio sounds to window manager actions.
Different audio queues may be assigned to any window manager
<br>
action. FvwmAudio can be used with any independent audio
player, and therefore requires no special audio library APIs
of its own. Simple in its design, it merely binds the audio
<br>
filenames to particular actions and forks off the audio
player program with the appropriate filename when that
action occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmAudio can also have builtin
support for the rplay library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
FvwmAudio reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm(1) reads when
it starts up, and looks for certain configuration
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudioPlayCmd
/usr/bin/X11/demos/auplay <br>
This determines the independent audio player program that
will actually play the sounds. If the play command is set to
builtin-rplay then the builtin rplay support will <br>
be used. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudioPlayCmd
builtin-rplay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudioDir /usr/lib/sounds
<br>
Specifies the directory to look for the audio files. This
option is ignored when rplay is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudioDelay 5 <br>
Specifies that sound events will only be played if they
occur at least 5 seconds after the previous event. Sounds
events that occur during the delay period are ignored. <br>
This option is useful if you don&rsquo;t want several sounds
playing at the same time. The default delay is 0 which
disables the audio delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudioRplayHost hostname
<br>
Specifies what host the sounds will play on. The hostname
can also be an environment variable such as $HOSTDISPLAY.
This option is only valid with builtin rplay support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudioRplayPriority 0 <br>
Specifies what priority will be assigned to the sounds when
they are played. This option is only valid with builtin
rplay support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudioRplayVolume 127 <br>
Specifies what volume will be assigned to the sounds when
they are played. This option is only valid with builtin
rplay support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudio window-manager_action
audio_filename <br>
Binds particular window manager actions to sound queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section. No
command line invocation is possible. FvwmAudio must be
invoked by the fvwm window manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It&rsquo;s REALLY noisy when fvwm starts and restarts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHTS <br>
This module is heavily based on a similar Fvwm module called
FvwmSound by Mark Boyns. FvwmAudio simply takes Mark&rsquo;s
original program and extends it to make it generic enough to
<br>
work with any audio player. The concept for interfacing this
module to the Window Manager, is original work by Robert
Nation.</p>
