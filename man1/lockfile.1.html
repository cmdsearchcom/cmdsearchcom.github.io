<p>LOCKFILE(1) General Commands Manual LOCKFILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lockfile - conditional semaphore-file creator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lockfile -sleeptime | -r retries | <br>
-l locktimeout | -s suspend | -! | -ml | -mu | filename
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lockfile can be used to create one or more semaphore files.
If lockfile can&rsquo;t create all the specified files (in
the specified order), it waits sleeptime (defaults to 8)
seconds <br>
and retries the last file that didn&rsquo;t succeed. You can
specify the number of retries to do until failure is
returned. If the number of retries is -1 (default, i.e.,
-r-1) lock&acirc; <br>
file will retry forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the number of retries expires
before all files have been created, lockfile returns failure
and removes all the files it created up till that point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using lockfile as the condition
of a loop in a shell script can be done easily by using the
-! flag to invert the exit status. To prevent infinite
loops, failures for any rea&acirc; <br>
son other than the lockfile already existing are not
inverted to success but rather are still returned as
failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All flags can be specified
anywhere on the command line, they will be processed when
encountered. The command line is simply parsed from left to
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files created by lockfile
will be read-only, and therefore will have to be removed
with rm -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify a locktimeout
then a lockfile will be removed by force after locktimeout
seconds have passed since the lockfile was last
modified/created (most likely by some <br>
other program that unexpectedly died a long time ago, and
hence could not clean up any leftover lockfiles). Lockfile
is clock skew immune. After a lockfile has been removed by
<br>
force, a suspension of suspend seconds (defaults to 16) is
taken into account, in order to prevent the inadvertent
immediate removal of any newly created lockfile by another
pro&acirc; <br>
gram (compare SUSPEND in procmail(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailbox locks <br>
If the permissions on the system mail spool directory allow
it, or if lockfile is suitably setgid, it will be able to
lock and unlock your system mailbox by using the options -ml
<br>
and -mu respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Suppose you want to make sure that access to the file
&quot;important&quot; is serialised, i.e., no more than one
program or shell script should be allowed to access it. For
simplicity&rsquo;s <br>
sake, let&rsquo;s suppose that it is a shell script. In this
case you could solve it like this: <br>
... <br>
lockfile important.lock <br>
... <br>
access_&quot;important&quot;_to_your_hearts_content <br>
... <br>
rm -f important.lock <br>
... <br>
Now if all the scripts that access &quot;important&quot;
follow this guideline, you will be assured that at most one
script will be executing between the &lsquo;lockfile&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;rm&rsquo; commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LOGNAME used as a hint to determine the invoker&rsquo;s
loginname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/passwd to verify and/or correct the invoker&rsquo;s
loginname (and to find out his HOME directory, if
needed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME.lock
<br>
lockfile for the system mailbox, the environment variables
present in here will not be taken from the environment, but
will be determined by looking in <br>
/etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
rm(1), mail(1), binmail(1), sendmail(8), procmail(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Filename too long, ... Use shorter filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forced unlock denied on
&quot;x&quot; <br>
No write permission in the directory where lockfile
&quot;x&quot; resides, or more than one lockfile trying to
force a lock at exactly the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forcing lock on &quot;x&quot;
Lockfile &quot;x&quot; is going to be removed by force
because of a timeout (compare LOCKTIMEOUT in
procmail(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory, ... The system is
out of swap space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal received, ... Lockfile
will remove anything it created till now and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sorry, ... The retries limit has
been reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Truncating &quot;x&quot; and
retrying lock <br>
&quot;x&quot; does not seem to be a valid filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try praying, ... Missing
subdirectories or insufficient privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Definitely less than one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
The behavior of the -! flag, while useful, is not
necessarily intuitive or consistent. When testing
lockfile&rsquo;s return value, shell script writers should
consider carefully <br>
whether they want to use the -! flag, simply reverse the
test, or do a switch on the exact exitcode. In general, the
-! flag should only be used when lockfile is the
condi&acirc; <br>
tional of a loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS <br>
Lockfile is NFS-resistant and eight-bit clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Calling up lockfile with the -h or -? options will cause it
to display a command-line help page. Calling it up with the
-v option will cause it to display its version
informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple -! flags will toggle
the return status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since flags can occur anywhere
on the command line, any filename starting with a
&rsquo;-&rsquo; has to be preceded by &rsquo;./&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of retries will not
be reset when any following file is being created (i.e.,
they are simply used up). It can, however, be reset by
specifying -rnewretries after ev&acirc; <br>
ery file on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although files with any name can
be used as lockfiles, it is common practice to use the
extension &lsquo;.lock&rsquo; to lock mailfolders (it is
appended to the mailfolder name). In case <br>
one does not want to have to worry about too long filenames
and does not have to conform to any other lockfilename
convention, then an excellent way to generate a lockfilename
<br>
corresponding to some already existing file is by taking the
prefix &lsquo;lock.&rsquo; and appending the i-node number
of the file which is to be locked.</p>
