<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
latexdiff - determine and markup differences between two
latex files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
latexdiff [ OPTIONS ] old.tex new.tex &gt; diff.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Briefly, latexdiff is a utility program to aid in the
management of revisions of latex documents. It compares two
valid latex files, here called &quot;old.tex&quot; and
&quot;new.tex&quot;, finds <br>
significant differences between them (i.e., ignoring the
number of white spaces and position of line breaks), and
adds special commands to highlight the differences. Where
<br>
visual highlighting is not possible, e.g. for changes in the
formatting, the differences are nevertheless marked up in
the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program treats the preamble
differently from the main document. Differences between the
preambles are found using line-based differencing (similarly
to the Unix diff <br>
command, but ignoring white spaces). A comment,
&quot;&quot;%DIF &gt;&quot;&quot; is appended to each added
line, i.e. a line present in &quot;new.tex&quot; but not in
&quot;old.tex&quot;. Discarded lines <br>
are deactivated by prepending &quot;&quot;%DIF
&lt;&quot;&quot;. Changed blocks are preceded by comment
lines giving information about line numbers in the original
files. Where there are <br>
insignificant differences, the resulting file
&quot;diff.tex&quot; will be similar to &quot;new.tex&quot;.
At the end of the preamble, the definitions for latexdiff
markup commands are inserted. <br>
In differencing the main body of the text, latexdiff
attempts to satisfy the following guidelines (in order of
priority):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If both &quot;old.tex&quot;
and &quot;new.tex&quot; are valid LaTeX, then the resulting
&quot;diff.tex&quot; should also be valid LateX. (NB If a
few plain TeX commands are used within &quot;old.tex&quot;
or <br>
&quot;new.tex&quot; then &quot;diff.tex&quot; is not
guaranteed to work but usually will).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Significant differences are
determined on the level of individual words. All significant
differences, including differences between comments should
be clearly marked in the <br>
resulting source code &quot;diff.tex&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If a changed passage contains
text or text-producing commands, then running
&quot;diff.tex&quot; through LateX should produce output
where added and discarded passages are highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Where there are insignificant
differences, e.g. in the positioning of line breaks,
&quot;diff.tex&quot; should follow the formatting of
&quot;new.tex&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For differencing the same
algorithm as diff is used but words instead of lines are
compared. An attempt is made to recognize blocks which are
completely changed such that they <br>
can be marked up as a unit. Comments are differenced line by
line but the number of spaces within comments is ignored.
Commands including all their arguments are generally <br>
compared as one unit, i.e., no mark-up is inserted into the
arguments of commands. However, for a selected number of
commands (for example, &quot; commands) the last argument is
known to be text. This text is split into words and
differenced just as ordinary text (use options to show and
change the list of text commands, <br>
see below). As the algorithm has no detailed knowledge of
LaTeX, it assumes all pairs of curly braces immediately
following a command (i.e. a sequence of letters beginning
with a <br>
backslash) are arguments for that command. As a restriction
to condition 1 above it is thus necessary to surround all
arguments with curly braces, and to not insert extraneous
<br>
spaces. For example, write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tion{extem{This is an emphasized
section title}}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and not</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tion {extem{This is an
emphasized section title}}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tionextem{This is an emphasized
section title}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even though all varieties are
the same to LaTeX (but see --allow-spaces option which
allows the second variety).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For environments whose content
does not conform to standard LaTeX or where graphical markup
does not make sense all markup commands can be removed by
setting the PICTUREENV <br>
configuration variable, set by default to
&quot;picture&quot; and &quot;DIFnomarkup&quot;
environments; see --config option). The latter environment
(&quot;DIFnomarkup&quot;) can be used to protect parts of
<br>
the latex file where the markup results in illegal markup.
You have to surround the offending passage in both the old
and g i n { D I F n o m new file by &quot;a r k u p } &quot;
a n d <br>
&quot;\nd{DIFnomarkup}&quot;. You must define the
environment in the preambles of both old and new documents.
I prefer to define it as a null-environment,</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;0wenvironment{DIFnomarkup}{}{}&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but the choice is yours. Any
markup within the environment will be removed, and generally
everything within the environment will just be taken from
the new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to
difference files which do not have a preamble. <br>
In this case, the file is processed in the main document
mode, but the definitions of the markup commands are not
inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All markup commands inserted by
latexdiff begin with &quot;&quot; <br>
&quot; <br>
&quot; <br>
other commands as well as braces &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;}&quot; are never put within the scope of &quot;F &gt;
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within deleted blocks text is
highlighted with &quot;F &lt; &quot;&quot;. Non-safe command
and curly braces within deleted blocks are <br>
commented out with &quot;&quot;%DIFDELCMD &lt;
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Preamble <br>
The following options determine the visual markup style by
adding the appropriate command definitions to the preamble.
See the end of this section for a description of available
<br>
styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--type=markupstyle or -t
markupstyle <br>
Add code to preamble for selected markup style. This option
defines &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNDERLINE CTRADITIONAL
TRADITIONAL CFONT FONTSTRIKE INVISIBLE CHANGEBAR CCHANGEBAR
CULINECHBAR CFONTCBHBAR BOLD&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ Default: &quot;UNDERLINE&quot;
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--subtype=markstyle or -s
markstyle <br>
Add code to preamble for selected style for bracketing
commands (e.g. to mark changes in margin). This option
defines &quot; <br>
&quot;N COLOR DVIPSCOL ZLABEL ONLYCHANGEDPAGE
(LABEL)*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ Default: &quot;SAFE&quot; ] *
Subtype &quot;LABEL&quot; is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--floattype=markstyle or -f
markstyle <br>
Add code to preamble for selected style which replace
standard marking and markup commands within floats (e.g.,
marginal remarks cause an error within floats so marginal
<br>
marking can be disabled thus). This option defines all
&quot;TIONALSAFE IDENTICAL&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ Default: &quot;FLOATSAFE&quot;
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--encoding=enc or -e enc <br>
Specify encoding of old.tex and new.tex. Typical encodings
are &quot;ascii&quot;, &quot;utf8&quot;, &quot;latin1&quot;,
&quot;latin9&quot;. A list of available encodings can be
obtained by executing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perl -MEncode -e
&rsquo;print join (&quot;0,Encode-&quot;encodings(
&quot;:all&quot; )) ;&rsquo; &gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Default encoding is utf8 unless
the first few lines of the preamble contain an invocation
&quot;sepackage[..]{inputenc}&quot; in which case the
encoding chosen by this command is <br>
asssumed. Note that ASCII (standard latex) is a subset of
utf8]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preamble=file or -p file <br>
Insert file at end of preamble instead of generating
preamble. The preamble must define the following commands
&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option is set -t, -s, and -f
options are ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--packages=pkg1,pkg2,.. <br>
Tell latexdiff that .tex file is processed with the packages
in list loaded. This is normally not necessary if the .tex
file includes the preamble, as the preamble is <br>
automatically scanned for &quot;sepackage&quot; commands.
Use of the --packages option disables automatic scanning, so
if for any reason package specific parsing needs to be <br>
switched off, use --packages=none. The following packages
trigger special behaviour:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;amsmath&quot; <br>
Configuration variable MATHARRREPL is set to
&quot;align*&quot; (Default: &quot;eqnarray*&quot;). (Note
that many of the amsmath array environments are already
recognised by default as <br>
such)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;endfloat&quot; g i n {
<br>
Ensure that &quot;f}&quot; and &quot;\nd{figure}&quot;
always i g u r appear by themselves on a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hyperref&quot; <br>
Change name of &quot; <br>
commands, using them for the text but not for the link
defining command (where any markup would cause errors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;apacite&quot; <br>
Redefine the commands recognised as citation commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;siunitx&quot; <br>
Treat &quot; as equivalent to citation commands (i.e.
protect with &quot;ox&quot; if markup style uses ulem
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cleveref&quot; <br>
Treat &quot; <br>
&quot;glossaries&quot; <br>
Define most of the glossaries commands as safe, protecting
them with ox&rsquo;es where needed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;mhchem&quot; <br>
Treat &quot; <br>
&quot;chemformula&quot; or &quot;chemmacros&quot; <br>
Treat &quot; <br>
[ Default: scan the preamble for &quot;sepackage&quot;
commands to determine <br>
loaded packages. ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-preamble <br>
Print generated or included preamble commands to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration <br>
--exclude-safecmd=exclude-file or -A exclude-file or
--exclude-safecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
--replace-safecmd=replace-file <br>
--append-safecmd=append-file or -a append-file or
--append-safecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
Exclude from, replace or append to the list of regular
expressions (RegEx) matching commands which are safe to use
within the scope of a &quot; <br>
file must contain one Perl-RegEx per line (Comment lines
beginning with # or % are ignored). Note that the RegEx
needs to match the whole of the token, i.e., /^regex$/ is
<br>
implied and that the initial &quot; <br>
can be used repeatedly to add cumulatively to the lists.
<br>
--exclude-safecmd and --append-safecmd can also take a comma
separated list as input. If a comma for one of the regex is
required, escape it thus &quot;&quot;. In most cases it will
<br>
be necessary to protect the comma-separated list from the
shell by putting it in quotation marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-textcmd=exclude-file
or -X exclude-file or
--exclude-textcmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
--replace-textcmd=replace-file <br>
--append-textcmd=append-file or -x append-file or
--append-textcmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
Exclude from, replace or append to the list of regular
expressions matching commands whose last argument is text.
See entry for --exclude-safecmd directly above for further
<br>
details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replace-context1cmd=replace-file
<br>
--append-context1cmd=append-file or =item
--append-context1cmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
Replace or append to the list of regex matching commands
whose last argument is text but which require a particular
context to work, e.g. figure or table. These commands behave
like text commands, except when they occur in a deleted
section, when they are disabled, but their argument is shown
as deleted text.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replace-context2cmd=replace-file
<br>
--append-context2cmd=append-file or =item
--append-context2cmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
As corresponding commands for context1. The only difference
is that context2 commands are completely disabled in deleted
sections, including their arguments.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-mboxsafecmd=exclude-file
or --exclude-mboxsafecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
--append-mboxsafecmd=append-file or
--append-mboxsafecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot; <br>
Define safe commands, which additionally need to be
protected by encapsulating in an \mbox{..}. This is
sometimes needed to get around incompatibilities between
external <br>
packages and the ulem package, which is used for
highlighting in the default style UNDERLINE as well as
CULINECHBAR CFONTSTRIKE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config var1=val1,var2=val2,...
or -c var1=val1,.. <br>
-c configfile <br>
Set configuration variables. The option can be repeated to
set different variables (as an alternative to the
comma-separated list). Available variables (see below for
<br>
further explanations):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ARRENV&quot; (RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;COUNTERCMD&quot;
(RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;FLOATENV&quot; (RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ITEMCMD&quot; (RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;LISTENV&quot; (RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHARRENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHARRREPL&quot;
(String)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHENV&quot; (RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHREPL&quot;
(String)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;MINWORDSBLOCK&quot;
(integer)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;PICTUREENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-safecmd <br>
Print list of RegEx matching and excluding safe
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-textcmd <br>
Print list of RegEx matching and excluding commands with
text argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-config <br>
Show values of configuration variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-all <br>
Combine all --show commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NB For all --show commands, no
&quot;old.tex&quot; or &quot;new.tex&quot; file needs to be
specified, and no differencing takes place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other configuration options:
<br>
--allow-spaces <br>
Allow spaces between bracketed or braced arguments to
commands. Note that this option might have undesirable side
effects (unrelated scope might get lumpeded with preceding
<br>
commands) so should only be used if the default produces
erroneous results. (Default requires arguments to directly
follow each other without intervening spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--math-markup=level <br>
Determine granularity of markup in displayed math
environments: Possible values for level are (both numerical
and text labels are acceptable):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;off&quot; or 0: suppress
markup for math environments. Deleted equations will not
appear in diff file. This mode can be used if all the other
modes cause invalid latex code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;whole&quot; or 1:
Differencing on the level of whole equations. Even trivial
changes to equations cause the whole equation to be marked
changed. This mode can be used if <br>
processing in coarse or fine mode results in invalid latex
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;coarse&quot; or 2: Detect
changes within equations marked up with a coarse
granularity; changes in equation type (e.g.displaymath to
equation) appear as a change to the complete <br>
equation. This mode is recommended for situations where the
content and order of some equations are still being changed.
[Default]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;fine&quot; or 3: Detect
small change in equations and mark up at fine granularity.
This mode is most suitable, if only minor changes to
equations are expected, e.g. correction <br>
of typos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-citation-markup or
--disable-auto-mbox <br>
Suppress citation markup and markup of other vulnerable
commands in styles using ulem (UNDERLINE,FONTSTRIKE,
CULINECHBAR) (the two options are identical and are simply
<br>
aliases)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-citation-markup or
--enforce-auto-mbox <br>
Protect citation commands and other vulnerable commands in
changed sections with &quot;ox&quot; command, i.e. use
default behaviour for ulem package for other packages (the
two <br>
options are identical and are simply aliases)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
--verbose or -V <br>
Output various status information to stderr during
processing. Default is to work silently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--driver=type <br>
Choose driver for changebar package (only relevant for
styles using <br>
changebar: CCHANGEBAR CFONTCHBAR CULINECHBAR CHANGEBAR).
Possible drivers are listed in changebar manual, e.g.
pdftex,dvips,dvitops <br>
[Default: dvips]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-warnings <br>
Suppress warnings about inconsistencies in length between
input and parsed strings and missing characters. These
warning messages are often related to non-standard latex or
<br>
latex constructions with a syntax unknown to
&quot;latexdiff&quot; but the resulting difference argument
is often fully functional anyway, particularly if the
non-standard latex only <br>
occurs in parts of the text which have not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--label=label or -L label <br>
Sets the labels used to describe the old and new files. The
first use of this option sets the label describing the old
file and the second use of the option sets the label <br>
for the new file, i.e. set both labels like this &quot;-L
labelold -L labelnew&quot;. [Default: use the filename and
modification dates for the label]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-label <br>
Suppress inclusion of old and new file names as comment in
output file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--visble-label <br>
Include old and new filenames (or labels set with
&quot;--label&quot; option) as visible output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flatten <br>
Replace &quot;input&quot; and &quot;include&quot; commands
within body by the content of the files in their argument.
If &quot;includeonly&quot; is present in the preamble, only
those files are <br>
expanded into the document. However, no recursion is done,
i.e. &quot;input&quot; and &quot;include&quot; commands
within included sections are not expanded. The included
files are assumed to <br>
be located in the same directories as the old and new master
files, respectively, making it possible to organise files
into old and new directories. --flatten is applied <br>
recursively, so inputted files can contain further
&quot;input&quot; statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of this option might result
in prohibitive processing times for larger documents, and
the resulting difference document no longer reflects the
structure of the input <br>
documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help or -h <br>
Show help text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Predefined styles <br>
Major types <br>
The major type determine the markup of plain text and some
selected latex commands outside floats by defining the
markup commands &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNDERLINE&quot; <br>
Added text is wavy-underlined and blue, discarded text is
struck out and red (Requires color and ulem packages).
Overstriking does not work in displayed math equations <br>
such that deleted parts of equation are underlined, not
struck out (this is a shortcoming inherent to the ulem
package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CTRADITIONAL&quot; <br>
Added text is blue and set in sans-serif, and a red footnote
is created for each discarded piece of text. (Requires color
package)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TRADITIONAL&quot; <br>
Like &quot;CTRADITIONAL&quot; but without the use of
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CFONT&quot; Added text is
blue and set in sans-serif, and discarded text is red and
very small size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;FONTSTRIKE&quot; <br>
Added tex is set in sans-serif, discarded text small and
struck out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CCHANGEBAR&quot; <br>
Added text is blue, and discarded text is red. Additionally,
the changed text is marked with a bar in the margin
(Requires color and changebar packages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CFONTCHBAR&quot; <br>
Like &quot;CFONT&quot; but with additional changebars
(Requires color and changebar packages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CULINECHBAR&quot; <br>
Like &quot;UNDERLINE&quot; but with additional changebars
(Requires color, ulem and changebar packages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CHANGEBAR&quot; <br>
No mark up of text, but mark margins with changebars
(Requires changebar package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;INVISIBLE&quot; <br>
No visible markup (but generic markup commands will still be
inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BOLD&quot; Added text is
set in bold face, discarded is not shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subtypes <br>
The subtype defines the commands that are inserted at the
begin and end of added or discarded blocks, irrespectively
of whether these blocks contain text or commands (Defined
<br>
commands: &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SAFE&quot; No additional
markup (Recommended choice)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;MARGIN&quot; Mark
beginning and end of changed blocks with symbols in the
margin nearby (using the standard &quot;rginpar&quot;
command - note that this sometimes moves somewhat from the
<br>
intended position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;COLOR&quot; An alternative
way of marking added passages in blue, and deleted ones in
red. (It is recommeneded to use instead the main types to
effect colored markup, although in <br>
some cases coloring with dvipscol can be more complete, for
example with citation commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DVIPSCOL&quot; <br>
An alternative way of marking added passages in blue, and
deleted ones in red. Note that &quot;DVIPSCOL&quot; only
works with the dvips converter, e.g. not pdflatex. (it is
<br>
recommeneded to use instead the main types to effect colored
markup, although in some cases coloring with dvipscol can be
more complete).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ZLABEL&quot; can be used
to highlight only changed pages, but requires
post-processing. It is recommend to not call this option
manually but use &quot;latexdiff-vc&quot; with
&quot;--only-changes&quot; <br>
option. Alternatively, use the script given within preamble
of diff files made using this style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ONLYCHANGEDPAGE&quot; <br>
also highlights changed pages, without the need for
post-processing, but might not work reliably if there is
floating material (figures, tables).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;LABEL&quot; is similar to
&quot;ZLABEL&quot;, but does not need the zref package and
works less reliably (deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Float Types <br>
Some of the markup used in the main text might cause
problems when used within floats (e.g. figures or tables).
For this reason alternative versions of all markup commands
are <br>
used within floats. The float type defines these alternative
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;FLOATSAFE&quot; <br>
Use identical markup for text as in the main body, but set
all commands marking the begin and end of changed blocks to
null-commands. You have to choose this float <br>
type if your subtype is &quot;MARGIN&quot; as
&quot;rginpar&quot; does not work properly within
floats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TRADITIONALSAFE&quot; <br>
Mark additions the same way as in the main text. Deleted
environments are marked by angular brackets and ] and the
deleted text is set in scriptscript size. This <br>
float type should always be used with the
&quot;TRADITIONAL&quot; and &quot;CTRADITIONAL&quot; markup
types as the otnote command does not work properly in
floating environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON PROBLEMS AND FAQ <br>
Citations result in overfull boxes <br>
There is an incompatibility between the &quot;ulem&quot;
package, which &quot;latexdiff&quot; uses for underlining
and striking out in the UNDERLINE style, the default style,
and the way <br>
citations are generated. In order to be able to mark up
citations properly, they are enclosed with an &quot;ox&quot;
command. As mboxes cannot be broken across lines, this <br>
procedure frequently results in overfull boxes, possibly
obscuring the content as it extends beyond the right margin.
The same occurs for some other packages (e.g., <br>
siunitx). If this is a problem, you have two
possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Use &quot;CFONT&quot; type
markup (option &quot;-t CFONT&quot;): If this markup is
chosen, then changed citations are no longer marked up with
the wavy line (additions) or struck out <br>
(deletions), but are still highlighted in the appropriate
color, and deleted text is shown with a different font.
Other styles not using the &quot;ulem&quot; package will
also <br>
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Choose option
&quot;--disable-citation-markup&quot; which turns off the
marking up of citations: deleted citations are no longer
shown, and added citations are shown without <br>
markup. (This was the default behaviour of latexdiff at
versions 0.6 and older)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For custom packages you can
define the commands which need to be protected by
&quot;ox&quot; with &quot;--append-mboxsafecmd&quot; and
&quot;--excludemboxsafecmd&quot; options (submit your lists
<br>
of command as feature request at github page to set the
default behaviour of future versions, see section 6)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes in complicated
mathematical equations result in latex processing errors
<br>
Try options &quot;--math-markup=whole&quot;. If even that
fails, you can turn off mark up for equations with
&quot;--math-markup=off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I just show the pages
where changes had been made <br>
Use options -&quot;-s ZLABEL&quot; (some postprocessing
required) or &quot;-s ONLYCHANGEDPAGE&quot;.
&quot;latexdiff-vc --ps|--pdf&quot; with
&quot;--only-changes&quot; option takes care of the post-
<br>
processing for you (requires zref package to be
installed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Option allow-spaces not implemented entirely consistently.
It breaks the rules that number and type of white space does
not matter, as different numbers of inter-argument spaces
<br>
are treated as significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please submit bug reports using
the issue tracker of the github repository page
https://github.com/ftilmann/latexdiff.git, or send them to
tilmann -- AT -- gfz-potsdam.de. <br>
Include the version number of latexdiff (from comments at
the top of the source or use --version). If you come across
latex files that are error-free and conform to the <br>
specifications set out above, and whose differencing still
does not result in error-free latex, please send me those
files, ideally edited to only contain the offending passage
<br>
as long as that still reproduces the problem. If your file
relies on non-standard class files, you must include those.
I will not look at examples where I have trouble to latex
<br>
the original files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
latexrevise, latexdiff-vc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTABILITY <br>
latexdiff does not make use of external commands and thus
should run on any platform supporting Perl 5.6 or higher. If
files with encodings other than ASCII or UTF-8 are <br>
processed, Perl 5.8 or higher is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard version of
latexdiff requires installation of the Perl package
&quot;Algorithm::Diff&quot; (available from www.cpan.org -
http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15) <br>
but a stand-alone version, latexdiff-so, which has this
package inlined, is available, too. latexdiff-fast requires
the diff command to be present.</p>
