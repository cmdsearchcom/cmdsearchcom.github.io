<p>GRIG(1) User Commands GRIG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grig - graphical user interface for the Ham Radio Control
Libraries (hamlib)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grig [OPTION]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Grig is a simple Ham Radio control (CAT) program based on
the Ham Radio Control Libraries. It is intended to be highly
generic presenting the user to the same graphical user <br>
interface regardless of which radio is being controlled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grig does not store any radio
configuration, instead it takes a number of command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --model=ID <br>
select radio model number; see --list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rig-file=DEVICE <br>
set device of the radio, eg. /dev/ttyS0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --speed=BAUD <br>
set transfer rate (serial port only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --civ-addr=ID <br>
set CI-V address (decimal, ICOM only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C,
--set-conf=par=val[,par2=val2] <br>
set additiional configuration parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug=LEVEL <br>
set hamlib debug level (0..5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delay=VALUE <br>
set delay between commands in msec (see below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nothread <br>
use timeout calls instead of thread (see below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
list supported radios and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --enable-ptt <br>
enable ptt control</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --enable-pwr <br>
enable power status control</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
show a brief help message and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
show version information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: Start grig using YAESU
FT-990 connected to the first serial port, using 4800 baud
and debug level set to warning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grig -m 116 -r /dev/ttyS0 -s
4800 -d 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or if you prefer the long
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grig --model=116
--rig-file=/dev/ttyS0 --speed=4800 --debug=3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is usually enough to specify
the model ID and the DEVICE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you start grig without any
options it will use the Dummy backend and set the debug
level to 0 (RIG_DEBUG_NONE). If you do not specify the
transfer rate for the serial port, <br>
the default serial speed will be used by the backend and
even if you specify a value, it can be overridden by the
backend. If you omit the radio device (port) grig will use
<br>
/dev/ttyS0 or localhost if the selected radio is
RPC-rig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG LEVELS <br>
0 No debug, keep quiet. <br>
1 Serious bug. <br>
2 Error case (e.g. protocol, memory allocation). <br>
3 Warnings. <br>
4 Verbose information. <br>
5 Trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grig has its own debug message
handler, which will manage messages from hamlib too. The
messages are printed to STDERR by default but they can be
redirected to a file. In bash <br>
shell you would write something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grig [options] 2&gt;
grig.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can then use the Message
Window in the View menu to view these messages. The debug
messages printed by grig a formatted in a structured way
with each line containing both <br>
time, source and level of the message. Each field is
separated with ;; so you can also import the log file into a
spread sheet for further analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
Grig 0.8.1 supports the most commonly used CAT command
implemented by hamlib. These include frequency, mode, filter
and various level settings. Please note that not all
features <br>
have been thoroughly tested since I don&rsquo;t have access
to any modern high-end radios. Therefore, comments regarding
success or failure in using grig will be highly
appreciated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
Buffer Overflow in Radio <br>
By default, grig tries to execute rig commands as fast as
possible in order to achieve an almost real-time remote
control experience. This strategy has turned out to cause
<br>
problems with some radios, probably because these radios
acknowledge the reception of a command before executing
them, whereby the next command will be sent before the <br>
previous one has terminated. To avoid any possible buffer
overflow in these situations, one can try to experiment with
the -D or --delay command line argument, which will <br>
put the specified delay in between each executed command.
The default value is 10 milliseconds and the smallest
possible value is 1 millisecond (if one specifies 0
mil&acirc; <br>
lisecond on the command line, the default value will be <br>
used). If you find a value which is better for your radio
than the default value, please let us know about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daemon Never Starts on FreeBSD
<br>
There have been reports on that the new, thread-based daemon
process is never started on FreeBSD, while the old,
timeout-based daemon worked fine. It is therefore possible
<br>
to choose the two ways to run the daemon process. The
default is the new thread based daemon, but if you use
FreeBSD and nothing seems to work after start-up you can
<br>
select the timout-based daemon with the -n or --nothread
command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connection Settings <br>
Once you have started grig you can not change the radio
settings (model, device, speed). You will have to restart
the program if you want to change any of these settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple Radios <br>
Grig can control only one radio at the time. There are,
however, no problems in starting several instances of grig
as long as they do not try to control the same radio. An
<br>
exception to this is the RPC-rig backend in which case the
rpc rig daemon will act as a server while grig or any other
hamlib frontends will act as a clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Power OFF State <br>
On some radios, grig does not cope very well with the power
off state. It is yet not known whether this is a bug in the
hamlib backend or in grig and we will definitely <br>
appreciate your input. The situation gets even more
complicated due to the fact that different radios behave in
a different ways when they are powered OFF; some of them
<br>
will continue to respond to remote commands, while others
will not. Even the same radio, like the FT-817, can behave
differently depending on whether it is powered from <br>
internal batteries or external power supply. Grig tries to
handle this mess by suspending all rig commands while in
power OFF state. Only the power ON command will be <br>
sent to the rig. By default, the power status control is
disabled and must explicitly be enabled using the -P or
--enable-pwr command line switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PTT Control <br>
Similar to the power state, the PTT has caused strange
behaviour on some radios. Consequently, it has been disabled
by default but can be enabled using the -p or <br>
--enable-ptt command line aguments.</p>
