<p>LURKER-INDEX(1) General Commands Manual
LURKER-INDEX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lurker-index &acirc; imports messages into the archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lurker-index [-c &lt;config-file&gt;] [-l &lt;list&gt;] [-i
&lt;mbox/maildir&gt;] [-v -d -n -u -f] [-m]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lurker-index indexes messages from standard input and stores
them in the lurker database. It imports either a single
message, or a batch of messages in mbox format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to note that
lurker messages in order and may miss new messages delivered
during the import. For this reason, you should setup lurker
to receive new mail before <br>
importing old mail. Only use lurker-index on inactive mail
folders!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, lurker-index reads
from standard input in mbox format, delimited by &rsquo;From
&lt;addr&gt; &lt;date&gt;&rsquo; lines. Be aware that if the
mbox is not delimited correctly between messages <br>
it will be interpretted as a single message with an invalid
date. To read other sources, see the &rsquo;-i&rsquo;
option. If input is a single email, use
&rsquo;-m&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c config-file <br>
Use this config file for lurker settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l listid Import messages to the
named mailing list. This should match the value in the
lurker.conf after the &rsquo;list = &rsquo; entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Import a single message. In
this mode lurker will never interpret &rsquo;From &rsquo;
lines as message delimiters. When being fed newly delivered
mail, this is the preferred mode <br>
of operation. Try to turn off the &rsquo;From &rsquo;
escaping of your MTA when using this mode, as lurker does
it&rsquo;s own escaping which is generally smarter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option should be used when
lurker-index is invoked by the MTA for newly delivered
email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i mbox/maildir <br>
Import messages from the specified mailbox or maildir.
Lurker-index by default reads a mailbox (mbox format) from
standard input. If the &rsquo;-i&rsquo; parameter is a file,
the <br>
file is assumed to be in the mbox format and is read instead
of standard input. If the parameter is a directory, the
directory is assumed to be in maildir format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &rsquo;-m&rsquo; is used, the
input MUST be a raw email, preferably with a mbox header,
never a maildir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation. Lurker
will output statistics about import speed to assist you in
tweaking options for best throughput on your system. It also
helps you know how <br>
much longer you will have to wait.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Drop duplicates per list.
This option will check the database to see if the message
has already been imported to a mailing list. Only if it has
not been imported will <br>
lurker append it to the mailbox. Even without this option
lurker does not index a message twice. If an import failed
part-way through, you probably want this option to <br>
avoid needless replication. However, to generate mailboxes
which accurately reflect delivery, leave the option off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Don&rsquo;t compress
messages. This will increase the database size and import
speed. Lurker can handle a database with mixed compressed
and uncompressed messages. However, <br>
zcat/gzip and database upgrades cannot. If you need these to
function, you should never mix compressed and uncompressed
messages within a single mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Trust user Date headers from
the email more than the delivery time. Normally lurker
compares the two and if the user time differs too much from
the delivery time, the <br>
delivery time is used instead. When this option is used,
lurker will simply trust the user Date header whenever it
exists, otherwise it uses the delivery time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option should never be used
as a default. It is intended for dealing with corrupt
mailboxes or maildirs. A better solution than using this
option is to find an <br>
uncorrupted copy of the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fast import (but vulnerable
to power-failure). This may improve the lifetime of your
hard-disk and increase import speed by up to 30%. However,
if the power fails dur&acirc; <br>
ing import or shortly thereafter, it is possible you will
have a corrupted database. If you use a journaling
filesystem, lurker guarantees no corruption when you OMIT
<br>
this parameter.</p>
