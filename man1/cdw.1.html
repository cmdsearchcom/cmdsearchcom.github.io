<p>cdw(1) General Commands Manual cdw(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cdw - front-end for cdrecord, mkisofs, growisofs, mkudffs
and other tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cdw [--help] [--version] [--enable-dvd-rp-dl]
[--escdelay=X]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cdw is a front-end for command-line tools used for burning
data CD and DVD discs and for related tasks. The tools are:
cdrecord/wodim, mkisofs/genisoimage, growisofs, <br>
dvd+rw-mediainfo, dvd+rw-format, xorriso. You can also use
cdw to rip tracks from your audio CD to raw audio files.
Limited support for copying content of CD and DVD discs to
<br>
image files is also provided. cdw can utilize md5sum program
to verify correctness of writing ISO image to CD and DVD
disc. cdw can be also used to create UDF image file using
<br>
mkudffs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdw uses ncurses library to
build user-friendly interface and it can be used in UNIX
terminal window and in terminal emulator (like konsole, rxvt
or gnome-console) in X environ&acirc; <br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdw supports ISO9660 file system
for optical media: ISO9660 file system can be written to
stand-alone .iso file, or burned to optical disc. cdw also
supports UDF file system: <br>
UDF file system can be written to stand-alone .udf file.
Currently there is no support for burning UDF file system
directly to optical disc. Other filesystem for optical media
<br>
are not supported nor recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED MEDIA <br>
Scope of supported features depends on which tools are
installed on end user&rsquo;s system. Full list of supported
media and actions is listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CD-AUDIO <br>
ripping audio tracks to raw audio files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CD-R writing files and ISO
images (single- and multi-session) with cdrecord/wodim and
xorriso; copying content of first session to image file on
your hard disc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CD-RW writing files and ISO
images (single- and multi-session), erasing (erasing only
TOC or blanking whole disc) with cdrecord/wodim and xorriso;
copying content of first ses&acirc; <br>
sion to image file on your hard disc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DVD-R, DVD+R <br>
writing files and ISO images (multi-session, but without
closing disc, or single-session) with cdrecord/wodim,
dvd+rw-tools and xorriso</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DVD-RW writing files and ISO
images (multi-session or single-session); erasing,
formatting - quick or slow (full) method; dvd+rw-tools only.
WARNING: multiple blanking may <br>
quickly render your DVD-RW unusable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DVD+RW writing files and ISO
images (both writing to disc from scratch and appending
data), without closing disc; blanking disc, but takes lots
of time, and you don&rsquo;t need to do <br>
it anyway - you can always start writing to the same disc
like you would write to blank disc. DVD+RW can be handled by
both cdrecord/wodim and dvd+rw-tools. Notice that <br>
when using wodim you may encounter problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DVD+R DL <br>
there is now partial support for DVD+R DL discs: cdw can
burn ISO image and files in single session. User has to
explicitly enable it by passing
&quot;--enable-dvd-rp-dl&quot; com&acirc; <br>
mand line argument to cdw; cdw can handle DVD+R DL discs
only using dvd+rw-tools; this feature is very incomplete and
possibly buggy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dual-layer media other than
DVD+R DL are not yet supported. DVD-RAM, Blu-ray, HD-DVD
discs are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANUAL <br>
You can write data discs either by using previously created
ISO image file, or by selecting files from hard drive and
writing them directly to disc. cdw provides UI elements for
<br>
both actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First action before creating new
ISO/UDF image or writing files to disc is selecting files
from your hard drive. You can do this by selecting &quot;Add
files&quot; in left-hand menu. You <br>
will be presented with simple file selector. Use Up/Down
arrows or Page Up/Page Down keys to move, Enter key to
change current directory, Space key to select files or
directo&acirc; <br>
ries. Selected items will be added to list displayed in main
window. Use Escape key to close file selector window. The
selector window shows you all files and directories <br>
(including hidden files) in current directory. You will see
file size information for every file on the list. You can
also delete previously selected files from list: select <br>
&quot;Delete files&quot; from the menu and use Up/Down arrow
keys to move and Delete key to delete highlighted item. Use
Escape key when you finish deleting files from list of
selected <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now you can select &quot;Create
image&quot; from left-hand menu. cdw will display a wizard
window where you can change most common options for creating
ISO9660 or UDF image, and where you <br>
can select path to target image file on your hard disc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also select &quot;Write
files to disc&quot; to write selected files to optical disc.
If you select the option, cdw will display a wizard dialog
window, in which you can adjust most <br>
common options related to burning files to disc (for this
function only ISO9660 file system is supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to write ISO image
file to optical disc, use &quot;Write image to disc&quot;
option in left hand menu. You will be presented with file
picker dialog that allows you to select <br>
existing ISO image file from your hard disc. After that cdw
will display a wizard window, where you can modify most
common options available for burning a disc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdw allows you to verify
correctness of this operation by checking a digest (e.g. md5
sum) of ISO file and of track written to disc. You can
request this by checking &quot;Verify <br>
write&quot; checkbox that will appear in write wizard.
Please note that this checkbox is visible only when you are
writing ISO file to empty CD or DVD disc. This function is
still <br>
experimental. Make sure that a program for calculating
digests is installed on your machine. cdw supports following
programs: md5sum sha1sum sha224sum sha256sum sha384sum <br>
sha512sum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another operation you can
perform is erasing optical disc - CD-RW, DVD-RW (both
Sequential Recording and Restricted Overwrite) or DVD+RW.
You can do this by selecting &quot;Erase <br>
disc&quot; option in cdw left-hand menu. Please note that
extensive erasing of DVD-RW may render your disc unusable.
In case of CD-RW and DVD-RW you will be asked what type of
blank&acirc; <br>
ing you want to perform. You can choose fast mode or full
mode. First one doesn&rsquo;t take too much time (in case of
CD-RW it only erases table of content of your disc), second
one <br>
can be very time-consuming, depending on disc size and
selected speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you will attempt to blank
DVD-RW disc, blanking wizard will display dropdown that
allows you to choose mode (format) of DVD-RW disc:
Restricted Overwrite or Sequential <br>
Recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdw can be useful when you want
to copy your data CD or DVD to ISO image on your hard drive.
You do this by selecting &quot;Read disc&quot; option from
left-hand menu. This function allows <br>
you to copy first track from your data CD or DVD. Reading
second and following tracks from data discs, and reading
discs written in mixed mode (one or more data tracks + audio
<br>
tracks) are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use cdw to copy
your audio CD to separate files (each track will be written
to separate file). You do this by selecting &quot;Read
disc&quot; option from menu. cdw can&rsquo;t con&acirc; <br>
vert audio tracks to any popular audio format. The tracks
are written to files in the same format as they appear on CD
(2 channels, 44100 samples per second, 16 bit signed PCM,
<br>
little endian (intel)). The file names have following name
format: track_xx.raw (where xx is track number). You can
convert raw track file to wav file using e.g. sox
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sox -c 2 -r 44100 -L -2 -s
track_name.raw -t wav track_name.wav</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last operation that cdw
offers is verification of data. You can use it for two
purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; calculating a
digest of selected file from hard disc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; comparing
selected file with content of first track on optical disc;
The second option also utilizes digest tool (e.g. md5sum),
but may not work correctly, so it is <br>
marked in cdw as &quot;Experimental&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdw has Configuration window,
accessed by selecting &quot;Configuration&quot; item in
left-hand menu. The window allows you to set up some options
for tools used by cdw, and for cdw <br>
itself. Configuration window has following tabs (you can
access them using keys F2-F6):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Log and misc -
contains options related to log file in which cdw logs its
operations, and to some aspects of behavior of cdw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tools - options
in this tab allow you to select tools from your operating
system that will be used to create ISO9660 images, burn data
to disc etc. You can safely leave <br>
&quot;Configure tools manually&quot; checkbox unmarked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Audio - contains
options related to ripping audio CDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hardware -
probably will be visited only once, when you use cdw for the
first time or when you change your hardware configuration.
Here you can set paths to your <br>
devices used by cdw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; UDF - this tab
contains only text information about requirements for
creating UDF file system. There are no options available in
this tab. All options for creating UDF <br>
file system can be accessed through UDF image wizard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options available in
Configuration window are described below, in CONFIGURATION
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You have to use F9 or F10 key to
save any changes made in Configuration window and close the
window. To close Configuration window without saving changes
use Escape key. Values <br>
from &quot;Tools&quot; tab are saved only temporarily, they
aren&rsquo;t stored in permanent configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can control cdw using
application&rsquo;s menu (visible on left side of screen),
or using hotkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main menu items <br>

often it is equal to capacity of optical disc that you want
burn data to. This is a dropdown, <br>
from which you can select one of preselected values, or
select &quot;Custom size&quot;. Value of custom size can be
entered below the dropdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Custom size -

the place where you can enter nonstandard value of target
ISO/UDF filesystem size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a checkbox for
following symbolic links in selected files. Read the text
next to the checkbox for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a checkbox
modifying style of navigation in file system browser
windows. When this field checked, you can use Left/Right
keys on keyboard to move up/down in hierar&acirc; <br>
chy of directories in file system. This option work
similarly to Midnight Commander&rsquo;s &quot;Lynx-like

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tools (second
tab):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First thing that you will see in
this tab &quot;Configure tools manually&quot; checkbox, it
is unchecked by default, and this is safe default value. In
this state cdw select <br>
tools itself. If you check this checkbox you will be
presented with six dropdowns: first three allow you to
select tools or families of tools intended for specific <br>
tasks. Remaining dropdowns allow you to select paths to some
tools used by cdw for some tasks. All these dropdowns are
explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Tool for
creating stand alone ISO9660 file&quot; - here you select a
tool used to create ISO9660 file saved on hard disc
(stand-alone file). Depending on configuration <br>
of your software, here you can find mkisofs (genisoimage)
and xorriso.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Tools for
handling CDs&quot; dropdown - here you select a tool that
will be used to burn data to CD/CD-RW discs and to erase
CD-RW discs. Depending on configuration of <br>
your software, here you can find cdrecord (wodim) and
xorriso.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Tools for
handling DVDs&quot; dropdown - here you select a tool that
will be used to burn data to DVD discs and to erase DVD+/-RW
discs. Depending on configuration of <br>
your software, here you can find dvd+rw-tools, cdrecord
(wodim) and xorriso. Note that xorriso can be used only for
DVD+/-R discs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Path to
mkisofs&quot; dropdown - here you can select one of
implementations of mkisofs installed in your system (e.g. if
you have mkisofs and genisoimage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Path to
cdrecord&quot; dropdown - here you can select one of
implementations of cdrecord installed in your system (e.g.
if you have cdrecord and wodim).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Digest
tool&quot; - here you can select a tool used for calculating
digest (checksum) - the tool is used e.g. during
verification of burning of ISO9660 file to optical <br>
disc. md5sum tool is the default one, if found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that these settings are
saved only for your current session with cdw, and that the
settings will be discarded when you close cdw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Audio (third
tab):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Audio output dir
- path to directory, into which cdw will write raw audio
tracks, ripped from audio CD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hardware (fourth
tab):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;cdw should
use this drive&quot; dropdown - option allowing you to
select one of detected drives, or to use path to drive
entered manually (&quot;custom path&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Custom
path to drive&quot; - field in which you can specify your
own path to a device, to be used when cdw can&rsquo;t
autodetect all drives in your computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SCSI device -
parameters describing your SCSI hardware, in following
format: scsibus,target,lun (for a SCSI-emulated IDE CDRW:
0,0,0). It is used only by cdrecord <br>
and you should enter appropriate value only if cdrecord has
problems with device path in form of &rsquo;/dev/xxx&rsquo;.
Otherwise this field should be left empty. This option <br>
hasn&rsquo;t been tested, so use it at your own risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; UDF (fifth tab):
This tab contains only basic information about what is
required by cdw to create UDF file systems. Options related
to UDF file system are available in <br>
UDF image wizard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that cdw doesn&rsquo;t
specify (almost) any default options for mkudffs or rsync.
User has to select himself the best set of options for these
programs that suit his <br>
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-a&quot; option for rsync
is a good starting point. If your version of rsync supports
&quot;--info=progress2&quot; and you enter this option in
rsync options field, cdw will show a <br>
better progress indication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Command line options are following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -- help <br>
displays information about invoking cdw and its options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
displays cdw version and copyright information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-dvd+rp-dl <br>
enables very basic support for DVD+R DL discs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--escdelay=X <br>
modifies delay time between pressing Escape key in cdw
window and reaction to the key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
&Acirc;&middot; cdw.conf: Configuration file, usually stored
in $HOME/.cdw/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cdw.log: Log
file, by default stored in $HOME/.cdw/ directory. Path to
this file can be modified in Configuration window (&quot;Log
and misc&quot; tab &gt; &rsquo;Log file path&rsquo;
field).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cdw.colors: File
with definition of color schemes used to customize interface
of cdw. File is stored in $HOME/.cdw/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; temporary files:
cdw uses some small temporary files to store various
information. They are usually created in /tmp directory. If
everything goes well they are very <br>
short-lived and are removed as soon as they are no longer
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
&Acirc;&middot; HOME - cdw assumes that this variable exists
and is set to valid user directory. If not, then user is
asked to select some other &rsquo;base&rsquo; directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PATH - cdw reads
this environment variable to find directories with
executable files. cdw will search in these directories for
some tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
cdw uses log file ($HOME/.cdw/cdw.log by default) to store
information about actions performed. You can access this
file using your file manager, or pressing &rsquo;L&rsquo;
key in cdw win&acirc; <br>
dow. Read this file for any hints if you experience any
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are still some bugs related to memory management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdw is developed and tested
almost exclusively on x64 GNU/Linux, running cdw on other
platforms may produce some platform-specific bugs. Currently
I can&rsquo;t verify them in any way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdw still fails to detect some
problems reported by wodim/cdrecord mkisofs/genisoimage or
growisofs, although things have improved in latest few
versions. Support for xorriso is <br>
brand new, so there is a lot error messages printed by
xorriso, that cdw is unaware of, and will happily ignore
them. It is recommended to read log file after every
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copying data CDs to ISO image
may finish with message &quot;Problems occurred when copying
tracks&quot;. This does not have to mean that output ISO
file is corrupted: this be a sign of <br>
some low-level problems when reading from optical disc.
Similar message displayed after ripping audio CD may mean
that one or more track files created on your hard disc is
cor&acirc; <br>
rupted and it is caused by invalid audio CD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you notice any other bugs
please let me know. You can do this either using bug tracker
on cdw project site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdw/)
or by sending me an e-mail: <br>
acerion@wp.pl.</p>
