<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aespipe - AES encrypting or decrypting pipe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aespipe [options] &lt;inputfile &gt;outputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
aespipe reads from standard input and writes to standard
output. It can be used to create and restore encrypted tar
or cpio archives. It can be used to encrypt and decrypt
loop- <br>
AES compatible encrypted disk images. aespipe encrypts and
decrypts blocks of data. If you are looking for general
purpose encrypting tool that preserves data size at byte
gran&acirc; <br>
ularity, then please take a look at GnuPG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AES cipher is used in CBC
(cipher block chaining) mode. Data is encrypted and
decrypted in 512 byte chains. aespipe supports three key
setup modes; single-key, multi-key-v2 <br>
and multi-key-v3 modes. Single-key mode uses simple sector
IV and one AES key to encrypt and decrypt all data sectors.
Multi-key-v2 mode uses cryptographically more secure MD5 IV
<br>
and 64 different AES keys to encrypt and decrypt data
sectors. In multi-key mode first key is used for first
sector, second key for second sector, and so on.
Multi-key-v3 is <br>
same as multi-key-v2 except is uses one extra 65th key as
additional input to MD5 IV computation. See -K option for
more information about how to enable multi-key-v3 mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recommended key setup mode is
multi-key-v3, which is based on gpg encrypted key files. In
this mode, the passphrase is protected against optimized
dictionary attacks via salting <br>
and key iteration of gpg. Passphrase length should be 20
characters or more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single-key mode preserves input
size at 16 byte granularity. Multi-key mode preserves input
size at 512 byte granularity. If input size is not multiple
of 16 or 512 bytes, input <br>
data is padded with null bytes so that both input and output
sizes are multiples of 16 or 512 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;ulimit -l&quot; is set
to &quot;unlimited&quot; then aespipe attempts to lock its
RAM so that encryption keys do not leak to unencrypted swap.
If &quot;ulimit -l&quot; is something other than
&quot;unlim&acirc; <br>
ited&quot; then aespipe will proceed without locked RAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A gpgAgentSocket <br>
Read passphrase of gpg encrypted key file from gpg-agent
instead of the terminal. aespipe runs gpg to decrypt a key
file, and gpg talks to gpg-agent using gpgAgentSocket. <br>
Usually this data is in GPG_AGENT_INFO environment variable.
The environment that is passed to gpg is very minimal.
Normally gpg passes some environment variables to gpg- <br>
agent, but in this case, there aren&rsquo;t any. For best
results, you may want to configure gpg-agent so that it
&quot;keeps&quot; and uses its own environment. Defining
&quot;keep-tty&quot;, <br>
&quot;keep-display&quot; and &quot;pinentry-program&quot; in
$HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf configuration file is a good
start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C itercountk <br>
Runs hashed passphrase through itercountk thousand
iterations of AES-256 before using it for data encryption.
This consumes lots of CPU cycles at program start time but
<br>
not thereafter. In combination with passphrase seed this
slows down dictionary attacks. Iteration is not done in
multi-key mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Decrypt data. If this option
is not specified, default operation is to encrypt data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e encryption <br>
Following encryption types are recognized: AES128 (default),
AES192 and AES256. Encryption type names are case
insensitive. AES128 defaults to using SHA-256 passphrase
<br>
hash, AES192 defaults to using SHA-384 passphrase hash, and
AES256 defaults to using SHA-512 passphrase hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G gpghome <br>
Set gpg home directory to gpghome, so that gpg uses
public/private keys on gpghome directory. This is only used
when gpgkey file needs to be decrypted using public/private
<br>
keys. If gpgkey file is encrypted with symmetric cipher
only, public/private keys are not required and this option
has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H phash <br>
Uses phash function to hash passphrase. Available hash
functions are sha256, sha384, sha512 and rmd160. unhashed1
and unhashed2 functions also exist for compatibility with
<br>
some obsolete implementations. Hash type names are case
insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K gpgkey <br>
Passphrase is piped to gpg so that gpg can decrypt file
gpgkey which contains the real keys that are used to encrypt
data. If decryption requires public/private keys and <br>
gpghome is not specified, all users use their own gpg
public/private keys to decrypt gpgkey. Decrypted gpgkey
should contain 1 or 64 or 65 keys, each key at least 20
char&acirc; <br>
acters and separated by newline. If decrypted gpgkey
contains 64 or 65 keys, then aespipe is put to multi-key
mode. 65th key, if present, is used as additional input to
<br>
MD5 IV computation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O sectornumber <br>
Set IV offset in 512 byte units. Default is zero. Data is
encrypted in 512 byte CBC chains and each 512 byte chain
starts with IV whose computation depends on offset <br>
within the data. This option can be used to start encryption
or decryption in middle of some existing encrypted disk
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p fdnumber <br>
Read the passphrase from file descriptor fdnumber instead of
the terminal. If -K option is not being used (no gpg key
file), then aespipe attempts to read 65 keys from <br>
passwdfd, each key at least 20 characters and separated by
newline. If aespipe successfully reads 64 or 65 keys, then
aespipe is put to multi-key mode. If aespipe encoun&acirc;
<br>
ters end-of-file before 64 keys are read, then only first
key is used in single-key mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P cleartextkey <br>
Read the passphrase from file cleartextkey instead of the
terminal. If -K option is not being used (no gpg key file),
then aespipe attempts to read 65 keys from cleartex&acirc;
<br>
tkey, each key at least 20 characters and separated by
newline. If aespipe successfully reads 64 or 65 keys, then
aespipe is put to multi-key mode. If aespipe encounters <br>
end-of-file before 64 keys are read, then only first key is
used in single-key mode. If both -p and -P options are used,
then -p option takes precedence. These are equiva&acirc;
<br>
lent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aespipe -p3 -K foo.gpg -e AES128
... 3&lt;someFileName</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aespipe -P someFileName -K
foo.gpg -e AES128 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In first line of above example,
in addition to normal open file descriptors (0==stdin
1==stdout 2==stderr), shell opens the file and passes open
file descriptor to started <br>
aespipe program. In second line of above example, aespipe
opens the file itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet and don&rsquo;t
complain about write errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S pseed <br>
Sets encryption passphrase seed pseed which is appended to
user supplied passphrase before hashing. Using different
seeds makes dictionary attacks slower but does not
pre&acirc; <br>
vent them if user supplied passphrase is guessable. Seed is
not used in multi-key mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Asks passphrase twice instead
of just once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Prints
diagnostics to stderr about key length, single/multi key
mode, and selected code optimizations
(x86/amd64/padlock/intelaes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w number <br>
Wait number seconds before asking passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
aespipe returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure.</p>
