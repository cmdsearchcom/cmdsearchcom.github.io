<p>MOST(1) General Commands Manual MOST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
most - browse or page through a text file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
most [-1bCcdMstuvwz] [+lineno] [+c] [+d] [+s] [+u]
[+/string] [filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
most is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a
time, the contents of a file on a terminal. It pauses after
each windowful and prints on the window status line the <br>
screen the file name, current line number, and the
percentage of the file so far displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike other paging programs,
most is capable of displaying an arbitrary number of windows
as long as each window occupies at least two screen lines.
Each window may contain the <br>
same file or a different file. In addition, each window has
its own mode. For example, one window may display a file
with its lines wrapped while another may be truncating the
<br>
lines. Windows may be &lsquo;locked&rsquo; together in the
sense that if one of the locked windows scrolls, all locked
windows will scroll. most is also capable of ignoring lines
that are <br>
indented beyond a user specified value. This is useful when
viewing computer programs to pick out gross features of the
code. See the &lsquo;:o&rsquo; command for a description of
this <br>
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to displaying
ordinary text files, most can also display binary files as
well as files with arbitrary ascii characters. When a file
is read into a buffer, most exam&acirc; <br>
ines the first 32 bytes of the file to determine if the file
is a binary file and then switches to the appropriate mode.
However, this feature may be disabled with the -k <br>
option. See the description of the -b, -k, -v, and -t
options for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text files may contain
combinations of underscore and backspace characters causing
a printer to underline or overstrike. When most recognizes
this, it inserts the appropriate <br>
escape sequences to achieve the desired effect. In addition,
some files cause the printer to overstrike some characters
by embedding carriage return characters in the middle of
<br>
a line. When this occurs, most displays the overstruck
character with a bold attribute. This feature facilitates
the reading of UNIX man pages or a document produced by
runoff. <br>
In particular, viewing this document with most should
illustrate this behavior provided that the underline
characters have not been stripped. This may be turned off
with the -v <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, lines with more
characters than the terminal width are not wrapped but are
instead truncated. When truncation occurs, this is indicated
by a &lsquo;$&rsquo; in the far right <br>
column of the terminal screen. The RIGHT and LEFT arrow keys
may be used to view lines which extend past the margins of
the screen. The -w option may be used to override this <br>
feature. When a window is wrapped, the character
&lsquo;&acute; will appear at the right edge of the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-1 VT100 mode. This is meaningful only on VMS systems. This
option should be used if the terminal is strictly a VT100.
This implies that the terminal does not have the <br>
ability to delete and insert multiple lines. VT102s and
above have this ability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Binary mode. Use this switch
when you want to view files containing 8 bit characters.
most will display the file 16 bytes per line in hexadecimal
notation. A typical <br>
line looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">01000000 40001575 9C23A020
4000168D ....@..u.#. @...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with the -v option,
the same line looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^A^@^@^@ @^@^U u 9C #A0 @^@^V8D
....@..u.#. @...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Disable color support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Omit the backslash mark used
to denote a wrapped line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Disable the use of mmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Squeeze. Replace multiple
blank lines with a single blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z option turns off
gunzip-on-the-fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display control characters as
in &lsquo;^A&rsquo; for control A. Normally most does not
interpret control characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Display tabs as
&lsquo;^I&rsquo;. This option is meaningful only when used
with the -v option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+lineno <br>
Start up at lineno.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Make searches case sensitive.
By default, they are not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Disable UTF-8 mode even if
the locale dictates it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+u Force UTF-8 mode. By default
most will use the current locale to determine if UTF-8 mode
shoul be used. The +u and -u switches allow the behavior to
be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+d This switch should only be
used if you want the option to delete a file while viewing
it. This makes it easier to clean unwanted files out of a
directory. The file is <br>
deleted with the interactive key sequence &lsquo;:D&rsquo;
and then confirming with &lsquo;y&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/string <br>
Start up at the line containing the first occurrence of
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND USAGE <br>
The commands take effect immediately; it is not necessary to
type a carriage return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following commands, i is
a numerical argument (1 by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPACE, CTRL-D, NEXT_SCREEN <br>
Display another windowful, or jump i windowfuls if i is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN, DOWN_ARROW, V, CTRL-N
<br>
Display another line, or i more lines, if specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UP_ARROW, ^, CTRL-P <br>
Display previous line, or i previous lines, if
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T, ESCAPE&lt; <br>
Move to top of buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B, ESCAPE&gt; <br>
Move to bottom of buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RIGHT_ARROW, TAB, &gt; <br>
Scroll window left 60i columns to view lines that are beyond
the right margin of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEFT_ARROW, CTRL-B, &lt; <br>
Scroll window right 60i columns to view lines that are
beyond the left margin of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U, CTRL-U, DELETE, PREV_SCREEN
<br>
Skip back i windowfuls and then print a windowful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R, CTRL-R <br>
Redraw the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">J, G If i is not specified, then
prompt for a line number then jump to that line otherwise
just jump to line i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% If i is not specified, then
prompt for a percent number then jump to that percent of the
file otherwise just jump to i percent of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W, w If the current screen width
is 80, make it 132 and vice-versa. For other values, this
command is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q, CTRL-X CTRL-C, CTRL-K E <br>
Exit from most. On VMS, ^Z also exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h, CTRL-H, HELP, PF2 <br>
Help. Give a description of all the most commands. The most
environment variable MOST_HELP must be set for this to be
meaningful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f, /, CTRL-F, FIND, GOLD PF3
<br>
Prompt for a string and search forward from the current line
for ith distinct line containing the string. CTRL-G
aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prompt for a string and search
backward for the ith distinct line containing the string.
CTRL-G aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Search for the next i lines
containing an occurrence of the last search string in the
direction of the previous search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m, SELECT, CTRL-@, CTRL-K M,
PERIOD <br>
Set a mark on the current line for later reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSERT_HERE, CTRL-X CTRL-X,
COMMA, CTRL-K RETURN, GOLD PERIOD <br>
Set a mark on the current line but return to previous mark.
This allows the user to toggle back and forth between two
positions in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l, L Toggle locking for this
window. The window is locked if there is a &lsquo;*&rsquo;
at the left edge of the status line. Windows locked
together, scroll together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CTRL-X 2, CTRL-W 2, GOLD X <br>
Split this window in half.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CTRL-X o, CTRL-W o, o, GOLDUP,
GOLDDOWN <br>
Move to other window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CTRL-X 0, CTRL-W 0, GOLD V <br>
Delete this window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CTRL-X 1, CTRL-W 1, GOLD O <br>
Delete all other windows, leaving only one window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E, e Edit this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$, ESC $ <br>
This is system dependent. On VMS, this causes most to spawn
a subprocess. When the user exits the process, most is
resumed. On UNIX systems, most simply suspends <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:n Skip to the next filename
given in the command line. Use the arrow keys to scroll
forward or backward through the file list. &lsquo;Q&rsquo;
quits most and any other key selects the <br>
given file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:c Toggle case sensitive
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:D Delete current file. This
command is only meaningful with the +d switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:o, :O Toggle various options.
With this key sequence, most displays a prompt asking the
user to hit one of: bdtvw. The &lsquo;b&rsquo;,
&lsquo;t&rsquo;, &lsquo;v&rsquo;, and &lsquo;w&rsquo;
options have the same meaning as <br>
the command line switches. For example, the &lsquo;w&rsquo;
option will toggle wrapping on and off for the current
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;d&rsquo; option must
be used with a prefix integer i. All lines indented beyond i
columns will not be displayed. For example, consider the
fragment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int main(int argc, char **argv)
<br>
{ <br>
int i;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (i = 0; i &lt; argc, i++)
<br>
{ <br>
fprintf(stdout,&quot;%i: %s0,i,argv[i]); <br>
} <br>
return 0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key sequence
&lsquo;1:od&rsquo; will cause most to display the file
ignoring all lines indented beyond the first column. So for
the example above, most would display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int main(int argc, char
**argv)... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the &lsquo;...&rsquo;
indicates lines follow are not displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
CTRL-G aborts the commands requiring the user to type
something in at a prompt. The backquote key has a special
meaning here. It is used to quote certain characters. This
is <br>
useful when search for the occurrence of a string with a
control character or a string at the beginning of a line. In
the latter case, to find the occurrence of &lsquo;The&rsquo;
at the <br>
beginning of a line, enter &lsquo;^JThe where &lsquo; quotes
the CTRL-J.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
most uses the following environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOST_SWITCHES <br>
This variable sets commonly used switches. For example, some
people prefer to use most with the -s option so that excess
blank lines are not displayed. On VMS this is <br>
normally done done in the login.com through the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ define MOST_SWITCHES
&quot;-s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOST_EDITOR, SLANG_EDITOR <br>
Either of these environment variables specify an editor for
most to invoke to edit a file. The value can contain %s and
%d formatting descriptors that represent the file <br>
name and line number, respectively. For example, if JED is
your editor, then set MOST_EDITOR to &rsquo;jed %s -g
%d&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOST_HELP <br>
This variable may be used to specify an alternate help
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOST_INITFILE <br>
Set this variable to specify the initialization file to load
during startup. The default action is to load the system
configuration file and then a personal configuration <br>
file called .mostrc on Unix, and most.rc on other
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX <br>
When most starts up, it tries to read a system configuration
file and then a personal configuration file. These files may
be used to specify keybindings and colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To bind a key to a particular
function use the syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setkey function-name
key-sequence</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The setkey command requires two
arguments. The function-name argument specifies the function
that is to be executed as a response to the keys specified
by the key-sequence argu&acirc; <br>
ment are pressed. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setkey &quot;up&quot;
&quot;^P&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indicates that when Ctrl-P is
pressed then the function up is to be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, it is necessary to
first unbind a key-sequence before rebinding it in order via
the unsetkey function:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsetkey &quot;^F&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colors may be defined through
the use of the color keyword in the the configuration file
using the syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color OBJECT-NAME
FOREGROUND-COLOR BACKGROUND-COLOR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, OBJECT-NAME can be any one
of the following items:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status -- the status line <br>
underline -- underlined text <br>
overstrike -- overstriked text <br>
normal -- anything else</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the sample configuration
files for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Almost all of the known bugs or limitations of most are due
to a desire to read and interpret control characters in
files. One problem concerns the use of backspace characters
<br>
to underscore or overstrike other characters. most makes an
attempt to use terminal escape sequences to simulate this
behavior. One side effect is the one does not always get
<br>
what one expects when scrolling right and left through a
file. When in doubt, use the -v and -b options of most.</p>
