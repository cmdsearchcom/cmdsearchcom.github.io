<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
afterstep_faq - This document is an ever growing set of
questions, statements, ideas and complaints about AfterStep
version 2.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. General Information <br>
1.1. About this Document. <br>
This document is an ever growing set of questions,
statements, ideas and complaints about AfterStep version
2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get this FAQ at the
following locations: http://www.afterstep.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of this document
assumes you are running AfterStep 2.0. If you are running a
version of AfterStep prior to version 2.0, this document
will suggests only one thing: <br>
upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2. What is AfterStep? <br>
AfterStep is a Window Manager for the X Window System
(hereafter referred to as X). It was started to emulate the
look and feel of NeXTSTEP(tm), but has evolved into
something <br>
that while still being able to emulate NeXT, can do much
much more. Without using much memory or cpu time, AfterStep
provides all the features one could want in a Window
Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.3. What is AfterStep&rsquo;s
history? <br>
Original AfterStep was a continuation of the BowMan Window
Manager which was originally put together by Bo Yang. BowMan
was based on the fvwm Window Manager, written by Robert <br>
Nation. Fvwm was based on code from twm. And so on....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Idea was to emulate some of the
look and feel of the NEXTSTEP(tm) user interface, but
overtime it evolved to include other concepts, as dictated
by end user needs. It is that <br>
unholy direction that made Alfredo Kojima abandon project in
1997 and create a Window Manger of its own - Window Maker,
which had a goal of strict adherance to NEXTSTEP interface
<br>
ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After releasing version 1.8.11
it became aparent for developers that old AfterStep codebase
had reached its limits and required a substantial redesign.
Such redesign began with <br>
development of radically new image handling library
libAfterImage, introducing high quality image manipulation,
blending, TrueType fonts, XML image scripting, and more.
Building <br>
off of libAfterImage and incorporating new developments in X
Window management, AfterStep 2.0 was born and released in
September, 2004. As of now AfterStep code base contains <br>
none of the original fvwm parts, and association to fvwm,
twm and BowMan remain only in history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.4. Fine, what if I&rsquo;m not
running AfterStep 2.0? Is there a FAQ for me? <br>
Yes. There should be a version of the AfterStep FAQ
available within your specific AfterStep distribution. If
you are using a version earlier than 2.0, it is strongly
suggested <br>
you upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.5. What is X? What are these
window managers ? <br>
&quot;X&quot; is shorthand for The X Window System. It is a
basis for building graphical user interfaces for UNIX (it is
available for non-UNIX systems, but wasn&rsquo;t designed to
be as such). <br>
&quot;X&quot; is not the interface itself, just a foundation
for one. For more information, check www.x.org .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Window Manager is a program
that manages your windows during your X session. AfterStep
is one of many available window managers .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.6. What are AfterStep&rsquo;s
main features? <br>
The Wharf <br>
Similar to NeXTSTEP&rsquo;s(tm) Dock, it allows applications
to be Swallowed, shortcuts with icons, and many other
things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Pager <br>
Shows a miniature view of the Afterstep desktops, you can
move between them, and move windows around in the Pager as
though it were a miniature desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The WinList <br>
A list of all the windows, clicking on the items can show
that window, destroy it, shade it, or anything you might
want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configurability <br>
Almost anything can be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XML image scripting <br>
AfterStep allows XML scripts to be used to assemble complex
images for things like buttons, frame sides, etc, from
other, simpler images or graphical primitives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrueType fonts support <br>
Antialised TrueType fonts could be used to render window
titles and other labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode, UTF8 and other
encodings support <br>
Most international character encodings are supported as long
as fonts provide glyphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColorSchemes <br>
AfterStep can calculate a set of about 34 colors to create
looks with harmonious color composition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.7. Is AfterStep 2.0 GNOME
and/or KDE compliant? <br>
AfterStep 2.0 supports Extended Window Manager Hints, ICCCM
protocol and Motif hints, thus making it as compatible as
possible with both GNOME and KDE, as well as most other X
<br>
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.8. Can I run it in Microsoft
Windows(tm)? <br>
AfterStep 2.0 does run under Windows using CYGWIN
compatibility layer, while running any X server. Some of the
X servers available under Windows allow so-called root-less
mode, <br>
where X applications can coincide with native applications.
See sample screenshot .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Getting and Installing
AfterStep 2.0 <br>
3.1. Where can I get AfterStep 2.0? <br>
You can download AfterStep 2.0 at any of the following
locations: <br>
ftp://ftp.afterstep.org/stable/ SourceForge.net RPM
packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.2. What do I need to compile
and install AfterStep? <br>
Because AfterStep is an X application, you need to have X
installed, and the X development libraries (note, in this
case &quot;development&quot; means libraries need to compile
things with <br>
X, not development level code). It&rsquo;s probably a good
idea to also have a working C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AfterStep includes some image
libraries, but it is recommended that you install those
libraries using your distribution&rsquo;s package management
system. Note that you will need <br>
development libraries in addition to run-time libraries. The
following are the libraries that AfterStep can take
advantage of : libJPEG - support for JPEG image format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libPNG - support for PNG image
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libTIFF - support for TIFF image
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Freetype - support for TrueType
fonts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that following image format
do not require any external libraries : XPM, PPM, BMP, ICO,
XCF, GIF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.3. Can I install AfterStep
without being root? <br>
Yes, before compiling AfterStep, do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir ~/bin mkdir -p ~/man/man1
./configure --prefix ~/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then follow the normal install
directions, allowing you to <br>
make install <br>
without being root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.4. How do I upgrade AfterStep
from AfterStep version prior to 2.0.0? <br>
Install AfterStep 2.0 and then run it. It will start with
default configuration that you may or maynot like. If you
wish to try and reuse your old configuration files, then
copy <br>
them over from your old ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/
directory and into ~/.afterstep/. Restart AfterStep to make
changes effective. If some of the features do not work quite
<br>
right - feel free to submit bug report along with your
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended though that
you start with default configuration and try out all of the
supplied looks and color schemes. Select whichever is close
to what you want and then <br>
modify it to your liking. These approach will allow you to
take advantage of many new features, available in AfterStep
2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.4. How do I upgrade AfterStep
from AfterStep version higher then 2.0.0? <br>
Make sure that all configuration files that you ever changed
are in your home directory at ~/.afterstep/, as installing
afterstep will replace everything in global shared
loca&acirc; <br>
tion (/usr/local/share/afterstep). Install afterstep and
run. You should not have any trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.5. What&rsquo;s up with all
these compile errors? <br>
Most likely, you don&rsquo;t have the X devel package
(should have come with your operating system, if not, check
http://www.x.org/ ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.6. How the hell does one
configure AfterStep? <br>
Configuration files are usually either in
/usr(/local)/share/afterstep for system wide configuration
and ~/.afterstep for personal settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration is handled in
multiple files: look file (in looks subdirectory) for visual
attributes, feel file (in feels subdirectory) for the
general behaviour; wharf, winlist, <br>
banner, pager, animate for module specific
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just copy any file you want to
modify over from /usr(/local)/share/afterstep to
~/.afterstep to override system wide defaults retaining
subdirectory layout.</p>
