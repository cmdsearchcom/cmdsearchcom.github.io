<p>DEBDELTA-UPGRADE(1) User Commands
DEBDELTA-UPGRADE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debdelta-upgrade - Downloads all deltas that may be used to
&rsquo;apt-get upgrade&rsquo;, and apply them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debdelta-upgrade [OPTION]... [PACKAGE] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is designed to download changes (deltas) that
may be used to apt-get upgrade all listed packages, and
apply them. If no package is listed in the command line,
then <br>
it will apply to all upgradable packages. See debdelta(1)
for more details on the delta files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--dir DIR <br>
directory where to save results. (default:
/var/cache/apt/archives for root, /tmp/archive for non-root
users)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--format FORMAT <br>
format of recreated debs. FORMAT=deb is the usual,
FORMAT=unzipped means that the data.tar part is not
compressed, (and this may save some time)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deb-policy POLICY <br>
policy to decide which debs to download, it is a comma
separated list of (abbreviations of) <br>
source = there is no /etc/debdelta/sources.conf line <br>
big = the delta is too big <br>
error = the delta fails to apply in the client <br>
tiny = the new package is small (the server ignores such
packages) <br>
fail = the server failed to create the delta <br>
unavailable = all other cases <br>
after = continue downloading debs after patching has ended
<br>
default is s,b,e,t,f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose (can be added
multiple times).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d print full traceback on
Python errors; save useful info in temporary files in case
that a delta fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keep temporary files (use for
debugging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A --accept-unsigned <br>
accept unsigned deltas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gpg-home <br>
specify a different home for GnuPG, default for root is
/etc/debdelta/gnupg while for other users is unset. See
--homedir in gpg(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forensic METHOD <br>
if a delta fails, report logs so that the problem may be
addressed. Method may be <br>
do <br>
just prepare logs and say where they are <br>
mutt <br>
send logs by email using mutt <br>
icedove <br>
send logs by email using icedove (as root!) <br>
http <br>
send by http (the easiest and most recommended method!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout SECONDS <br>
adjust timeout for connections, default is 15 seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
When invoked as root, apt-get update &amp;&amp;
debdelta-upgrade &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade will download
delta files, recreate the needed Debian packages, and then
upgrade your Debian host. <br>
When only slow Internet connection is available, the above
procedure may be significantly faster than &quot;apt-get
update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade&quot;. (Use -v to see how
much faster.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The package manager cupt uses
deltas as well when upgrading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
A Debian package that is recreated using debdelta-upgrade is
byte-by-byte identical to the original one; when
&quot;apt-get upgrade&quot; is subsequently invoked, the
cryptographic ar&acirc; <br>
chive authentication support (see apt-secure (8) ) will
guarantee that it can be trusted to be installed. Moreover,
the delta files themselves are cryptographically protected
<br>
using GnuPG, MD5 and SHA1 (using the same method as
dpkg-sig(1) ), and debdelta-upgrade will refuse to apply
corrupted or unsigned deltas (but, see option -A ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOWNLOAD AND PROXIES <br>
debdelta-upgrade downloads deltas in two passes: in the
first pass, it downloads the first kB of each delta, to
extract the delta parameters and to examine them. If the
delta <br>
does not exist, it checks if the debdelta-too-big timestamp
file exists, and then it examines the --deb-policy to decide
if to download the deb instead. In the second pass, it <br>
downloads (the rest of) the deltas and queues them in a
patching queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For plain direct http downloads,
debdelta-upgrade uses the Python library
&rsquo;httplib&rsquo; directly; in particular, it uses
keep-alive features, and this speeds up a lot the first
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If variables such as http_proxy
are set in the environment, then instead debdelta-upgrade
will use the &rsquo;urllib2&rsquo; module: this though slows
down sensibly the first pass above <br>
(since &rsquo;urllib2&rsquo; opens a different connection
for each download); moreover &rsquo;urllib2&rsquo; seems to
be buggy in some places (for example, it transforms http
response &quot;401&quot; into &quot;404&quot; <br>
, and &quot;302&quot; into &quot;200&quot;) so the output
explanation printed by debdelta-upgrade in case of download
error may be wrong; and the --deb-policy big is currently
disabled (until the <br>
author understands &rsquo;urllib2&rsquo; better).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
See debdelta(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Report bugs to &lt;mennucc1@debian.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIZES <br>
In the program printout kB = 1024 bytes and MB = 1024^2
bytes .</p>
