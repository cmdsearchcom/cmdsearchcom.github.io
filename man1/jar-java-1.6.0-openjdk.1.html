<p style="margin-top: 1em">where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cuxtiv0Mmfe <br>
Options that control the jar command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jarfile <br>
Jar file to be created (c), updated (u), extracted (x), or
have its table of contents viewed (t). The -f option and
filename jarfile are a pair -- if either is present, <br>
they must both appear. Note that omitting f and jarfile
accepts a &quot;jar file&quot; from standard input (for x
and t) or sends the &quot;jar file&quot; to standard output
(for c and u).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inputfiles <br>
Files or directories, separated by spaces, to be combined
into jarfile (for c and u), or to be extracted (for x) or
listed (for t) from jarfile. All directories are pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed recursively. The files are compressed unless option 0
(zero) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manifest <br>
Pre-existing manifest file whose name: value pairs are to be
included in MANIFEST.MF in the jar file. The -m option and
filename manifest are a pair -- if either is <br>
present, they must both appear. The letters m, f and e must
appear in the same order that manifest, jarfile, entrypoint
appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entrypoint <br>
The name of the class that set as the application entry
point for stand-alone applications bundled into executable
jar file. The -e option and entrypoint are a pair -- if <br>
either is present, they must both appear. The letters m, f
and e must appear in the same order that manifest, jarfile,
entrypoint appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C dir <br>
Temporarily changes directories to dir while processing the
following inputfiles argument. Multiple -C dir inputfiles
sets are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Joption <br>
Option to be passed into the Java runtime environment.
(There must be no space between -J and option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The jar tool combines multiple files into a single JAR
archive file. jar is a general-purpose archiving and
compression tool, based on ZIP and the ZLIB @ <br>
http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ compression format. However, jar
was designed mainly package java applets or applications
into a single archive. When the components of an applet or
<br>
application (files, images and sounds) are combined into a
single archive, they can be downloaded by a java agent (like
a browser) in a single HTTP transaction, rather than <br>
requiring a new connection for each piece. This dramatically
improves download times. jar also compresses files and so
further improves download time. In addition, it allows <br>
individual entries in a file to be signed by the applet
author so that their origin can be authenticated. The syntax
for the jar tool is almost identical to the syntax for the
<br>
tar command. A jar archive can be used as a class path @
<br>
http://ccc.sfbay/4291383/attachment/classpath.html entry,
whether or not it is compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typical usage to combine files
into a jar file is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar cf myFile.jar *.class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, all the class
files in the current directory are placed into the file
named myFile.jar. The jar tool automatically generates a
manifest file entry named <br>
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. It is always the first entry in the
jar file. The manifest file declares meta-information about
the archive, and stores that data as name : value pairs.
<br>
Refer to the JAR file specification @ <br>
http://ccc.sfbay/guide/jar/jar.html#JAR%20Manifest for
details explaining how the jar tool stores meta-information
in the manifest file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a jar file should include
name : value pairs contained in an existing manifest file,
specify that file using the -m option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar cmf myManifestFile
myFile.jar *.class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An existing manifest file must
end with a new line character. jar does not parse the last
line of a manifest file if it does not end with a new line
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: A jar command that
specifies cfm on the command line instead of cmf (the order
of the m and -f options are reversed), the jar command line
must specify the name of the jar <br>
archive first, followed by the name of the manifest
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar cfm myFile.jar
myManifestFile *.class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The manifest is in a text format
inspired by RFC822 ASCII format, so it is easy to view and
process manifest-file contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract the files from a jar
file, use x:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar xf myFile.jar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract individual files from
a jar file, supply their filenames:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar xf myFile.jar foo bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with version 1.3 of
the Java 2 SDK, the jar utility supports JarIndex @ <br>
http://ccc.sfbay/guide/jar/jar.html#JAR%20Index, which
allows application class loaders to load classes more
efficiently from jar files. If an application or applet is
bundled <br>
into multiple jar files, only the necessary jar files will
be downloaded and opened to load classes. This performance
optimization is enabled by running jar with the -ioption.
<br>
It will generate package location information for the
specified main jar file and all the jar files it depends on,
which need to be specified in the Class-Path attribute of
the <br>
main jar file&rsquo;s manifest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar i main.jar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, an INDEX.LIST
file is inserted into the META-INF directory of main.jar.
<br>
The application class loader uses the information stored in
this file for efficient class loading. For details about how
location information is stored in the index file, refer <br>
to the JarIndex specification. <br>
To copy directories, first compress files in dir1 to stdout,
then extract from stdin to dir2 (omitting the -f option from
both jar commands):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% (cd dir1; jar c .) | (cd dir2;
jar x)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To review command samples which
use jar to opeate on jar files and jar file manifests, see
Examples, below. Also refer to the jar trail of the Java
Tutorial @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
c Creates a new archive file named jarfile (if f is
specified) or to standard output (if f and jarfile are
omitted). Add to it the files and directories specified by
inputfiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Updates an existing file
jarfile (when f is specified) by adding to it files and
directories specified by inputfiles. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar uf foo.jar foo.class <br>
would add the file foo.class to the existing jar file
foo.jar. The -u option can also update the manifest entry,
as given by this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar umf manifest foo.jar <br>
updates the foo.jar manifest with the name : value pairs in
manifest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Extracts files and directories
from jarfile (if f is specified) or standard input (if f and
jarfile are omitted). If inputfiles is specified, only those
specified files and <br>
directories are extracted. Otherwise, all files and
directories are extracted. The time and date of the
extracted files are those given in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Lists the table of contents
from jarfile (if f is specified) or standard input (if f and
jarfile are omitted). If inputfiles is specified, only those
specified files and <br>
directories are listed. Otherwise, all files and directories
are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Generate index information for
the specified jarfile and its dependent jar files. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar i foo.jar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would generate an INDEX.LIST
file in foo.jar which contains location information for each
package in foo.jar and all the jar files specified in the
Class-Path attribute of <br>
foo.jar. See the index example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Specifies the file jarfile to
be created (c), updated (u), extracted (x), indexed (i), or
viewed (t). The -f option and filename jarfile are a pair --
if present, they must <br>
both appear. Omitting f and jarfile accepts a jar file name
from stdin(for x and t) or sends jar file to stdout (for c
and u).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Generates verbose output to
standard output. Examples shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 (zero) Store without using ZIP
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Do not create a manifest file
entry (for c and u), or delete a manifest file entry if one
exists (for u).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Includes name : value
attribute pairs from the specified manifest file manifest in
the file at META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. jar adds a name : value
pair unless an entry already <br>
exists with the same name, in which case jar updates its
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the command line, the letters
m and f must appear in the same order that manifest and
jarfile appear. Example use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar cmf myManifestFile
myFile.jar *.class <br>
You can add special-purpose name : value attribute pairs to
the manifest that aren&rsquo;t contained in the default
manifest. For example, you can add attributes specifying
vendor <br>
information, version information, package sealing, or to
make JAR-bundled applications executable. See the JAR Files
@ <br>
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar/ trail in the
Java Tutorial for examples of using the -m option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Sets entrypoint as the
application entry point for stand-alone applications bundled
into executable jar file. The use of this option creates or
overrides the Main-Class <br>
attribute value in the manifest file. This option can be
used during creation of jar file or while updating the jar
file. This option specifies the application entry point <br>
without editing or creating the manifest file. <br>
For example, this command creates Main.jar where the
Main-Class attribute value in the manifest is set to
Main:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar cfe Main.jar Main
Main.class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The java runtime can directly
invoke this application by running the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java -jar Main.jar <br>
If the entrypoint class name is in a package it may use
either a dot (&quot;.&quot;) or slash (&quot;/&quot;)
character as the delimiter. For example, if Main.class is in
a package called foo the <br>
entry point can be specified in the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar -cfe Main.jar foo/Main
foo/Main.class <br>
or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar -cfe Main.jar foo.Main
foo/Main.class <br>
Note: specifying both -m and -e options together when the
given manifest also contains the Main-Class attribute
results in an ambigous Main.class specification, leading to
an <br>
error and the jar creation or update operation is
aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C dir <br>
Temporarily changes directories (cd dir) during execution of
the jar command while processing the following inputfiles
argument. Its operation is intended to be similar to the
<br>
-C option of the UNIX tar utility. <br>
For example, this command changes to the classes directory
and adds the bar.class from that directory to foo.jar:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar uf foo.jar -C classes
bar.class <br>
This command changes to the classes directory and adds to
foo.jar all files within the classes directory (without
creating a classes directory in the jar file), then changes
back <br>
to the original directory before changing to the bin
directory to add xyz.class to foo.jar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jar uf foo.jar -C classes . -C
bin xyz.class <br>
If classes holds files bar1 and bar2, then here&rsquo;s what
the jar file will contain using jar tf foo.jar:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">META-INF/ <br>
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF <br>
bar1 <br>
bar2 <br>
xyz.class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Joption <br>
Pass option to the Java runtime environment, where option is
one of the options described on the reference page for the
java application launcher @ <br>
http://ccc.sfbay/4291383/attachment/java.html#options. For
example, -J-Xmx48M sets the maximum memory to 48 megabytes.
It is a common convention for -J to pass options to the <br>
underlying runtime environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT FILES <br>
To shorten or simplify the jar command line, you can specify
one or more files that themselves contain arguments to the
jar command (except -J options). This enables you to
cre&acirc; <br>
ate jar commands of any length, overcoming command line
limits imposed by the operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An argument file can include
options and filenames. The arguments within a file can be
space&amp;ndash;separated or newline-separated. Filenames
within an argument file are relative <br>
to the current directory, not relative to the location of
the argument file. Wildcards (*) that might otherwise be
expanded by the operating system shell are not expanded. Use
of <br>
the @ character to recursively interpret files is not
supported. The -J options are not supported because they are
passed to the launcher, which does not support argument
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When executing jar, pass in the
path and name of each argument file with the @ leading
character. When jar encounters an argument beginning with
the character @, it expands the <br>
contents of that file into the argument list. <br>
The example below, classes.list holds the names of files
output by a find command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% find . -name
&rsquo;*.class&rsquo; -print &gt; classes.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can then execute the jar
command on Classes.list by passing it to jar using argfile
syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar cf my.jar
@classes.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An argument file can specify a
path, but any filenames inside the argument file that have
relative paths are relative to the current working
directory, not to the path passed in. <br>
Here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar @path1/classes.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To add all the files in a particular directory to an archive
(overwriting contents if the archive already exists).
Enumerating verbosely (with the -v option) will tell you
more <br>
information about the files in the archive, such as their
size and last modified date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ls <br>
1.au Animator.class monkey.jpg <br>
2.au Wave.class spacemusic.au <br>
3.au at_work.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar cvf bundle.jar * <br>
added manifest <br>
adding: 1.au(in = 2324) (out= 67)(deflated 97%) <br>
adding: 2.au(in = 6970) (out= 90)(deflated 98%) <br>
adding: 3.au(in = 11616) (out= 108)(deflated 99%) <br>
adding: Animator.class(in = 2266) (out= 66)(deflated 97%)
<br>
adding: Wave.class(in = 3778) (out= 81)(deflated 97%) <br>
adding: at_work.gif(in = 6621) (out= 89)(deflated 98%) <br>
adding: monkey.jpg(in = 7667) (out= 91)(deflated 98%) <br>
adding: spacemusic.au(in = 3079) (out= 73)(deflated 97%)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you already have separate
subdirectories for images, audio files and classes, you can
combine them into a single jar file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ls -F <br>
audio/ classes/ images/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar cvf bundle.jar audio
classes images <br>
added manifest <br>
adding: audio/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) <br>
adding: audio/1.au(in = 2324) (out= 67)(deflated 97%) <br>
adding: audio/2.au(in = 6970) (out= 90)(deflated 98%) <br>
adding: audio/3.au(in = 11616) (out= 108)(deflated 99%) <br>
adding: audio/spacemusic.au(in = 3079) (out= 73)(deflated
97%) <br>
adding: classes/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) <br>
adding: classes/Animator.class(in = 2266) (out= 66)(deflated
97%) <br>
adding: classes/Wave.class(in = 3778) (out= 81)(deflated
97%) <br>
adding: images/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) <br>
adding: images/monkey.jpg(in = 7667) (out= 91)(deflated 98%)
<br>
adding: images/at_work.gif(in = 6621) (out= 89)(deflated
98%)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ls -F <br>
audio/ bundle.jar classes/ images/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see the entry names in the
jarfile, use the t option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% jar tf bundle.jar <br>
META-INF/ <br>
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF <br>
audio/1.au <br>
audio/2.au <br>
audio/3.au <br>
audio/spacemusic.au <br>
classes/Animator.class <br>
classes/Wave.class <br>
images/monkey.jpg <br>
images/at_work.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add an index file to the jar
file for speeding up class loading, use the i option. <br>
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you split the inter-dependent
classes for a stock trade application into three jar files:
main.jar, buy.jar, and sell.jar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify the Class-path
attribute in the main.jar manifest as: <br>
Class-Path: buy.jar sell.jar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then you can use the -i option
to speed up the class loading time for your application:
<br>
% jar i main.jar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An INDEX.LIST file is inserted
to the META-INF directory. This enables the application
class loader to download the specified jar files when it is
searching for classes or <br>
resources.</p>
