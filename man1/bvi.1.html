<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bvi, bview - visual editor for binary files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
bvi-1.4.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bvi [-R] [-c cmd] [-f script] [-s skip] [-e end] [-n length]
file... bview [-R] [-c cmd] [-f script] [-s skip] [-e end]
[-n length] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
file... <br>
A list of filenames. The first one will be the current file
and will be read into the buffer. The cursor will be
positioned on the first line of the buffer. You <br>
can get to the other files with the &quot;:next&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &quot;Readonly&quot;: The
readonly flag is set for all the files, preventing
accidental overwriting with a write command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s skip <br>
causes bvi to load a file not from the start but from offset
skip. Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the input. By
default, offset is interpreted as a decimal number. <br>
With a leading 0x or 0X, offset is interpreted as a
hexadecimal number, otherwise, with a leading 0, offset is
interpreted as an octal number. Appending the character b,
k, <br>
or m to offset causes it to be interpreted as a multiple of
512, 1024, or 1048576, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e end <br>
causes bvi to load a file not till end but till address
end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n length <br>
causes bvi not to load the complete file but only length
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cmd <br>
cmd will be executed after the first file has been read. If
the cmd contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes
(this depends on the shell that is <br>
used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f script <br>
This command provides a means for collecting a series of
&quot;ex&quot; (colon) commands into a script file, then
using this file to edit other files. Since there is no
binary stream <br>
editor &quot;bsed&quot;, you can use this option to make
several global changes in a binary file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bvi stands for &quot;Binary VIsual editor&quot;. Bvi is a
screen oriented editor for binary files; its command set is
based on that of the vi(1) text editor. As a binary editor
does not <br>
have the concept of &quot;lines&quot; there are differences
from Vi commands wherever the latter are line orientate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPARISON <br>
The main differences between Vi and Bvi are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The screen is divided in three
sections or panes: The byte offset (extreme left), the hex
pane (middle), and an ascii pane (right) which shows as
printable characters those bytes <br>
in the hex pane. On an 80 column terminal there will be
sixteen hex values and their ASCII values on each screen
line. Note that (as one would expect) the first byte has the
<br>
offset &rsquo;0&rsquo; (zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can toggle between the hex
and ascii windows with the tab key (TAB). Toggling between
these two windows does not change the current position
(offset) within the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No &quot;lines&quot; concept:
Files are treated as one long stream of bytes. The
characters &quot;newline&quot; and &quot;carriage
return&quot; are not special, id est they never mark the end
of lines. <br>
Therefore the lines on the screen do not represent lines in
the usual way. Data is broken across screen lines
arbitarily. As a consequence there are no commands in bvi
from ex <br>
or vi that are based on line numbers, eg &quot;dd&quot;,
&quot;yy&quot;, &rsquo;C&rsquo;, &rsquo;S&rsquo;,
&rsquo;o&rsquo;, &rsquo;O&rsquo;. This also changes the
meaning of &quot;range&quot; before the &quot;:write&quot;
command to a byte offset, ie the command <br>
&quot;:100,200w foo&quot; writes all *bytes* (not lines)
from offset 100 to offset 200 to the file
&quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No &quot;text objects&quot;:
There are also no text-specific arrangements like words,
paragraphs, sentences, sections and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended &quot;ruler&quot;: The
bottom line of the screen shows the current address (byte
offset) and the current character in these notations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">octal, hexadecimal, decimal and
ascii.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search patterns: All search
commands understand these special characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. any character <br>
[] set of characters <br>
* zero or more occurrences of previous char or set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But as there is no concept of
lines you cannot use the standard symbols
(&quot;anchors&quot;) for &quot;begin-of-line&quot;
(&rsquo;^&rsquo;) and &quot;end-of-line&quot;
(&rsquo;$&rsquo;). Searching for the start/end of lines must
<br>
be done explicitly by adding these special characters to
your search pattern using these meta sequences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newline <br>
return <br>
tab <br>
binary zero</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional search commands:
Similar to the text search commands there are additional
hex-search functions &rsquo;&acute; and &rsquo;#&rsquo;
which allow to search for any byte value. Example: &quot;62
76 <br>
69&quot; will search for the string &quot;bvi&quot;. Spaces
between hex value are optional, so searching for
&quot;6775636B6573&quot; will find &quot;guckes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing the length of data
(insertion, deletion) moves the data to other addresses;
this is bad for many cases (eg. databases, program files)
and is thus disabled by default. <br>
You can enable this commands by typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:set memmove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BVI Modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Mode (Normal Mode):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input is treated as command.
Note that command mode is the default mode after startup and
after escaping from input mode. Use ESC (escape) to cancel a
partial (uncompleted) <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input is treated as replacement
of current characters or (after the end of the file) is
appended to the current file. This mode is entered from
command mode by typing one of <br>
&rsquo;i&rsquo;, &rsquo;I&rsquo;, &rsquo;A&rsquo;,
&rsquo;r&rsquo;, or &rsquo;R&rsquo;. You can enter the
characters from the keyboard (in the ASCII window) or
hexadecimal values (in the HEX window). Type TAB to switch
between these two <br>
windows. Type ESC to finish the current input and return to
command mode. Type CTRL-C to cancel current command
abnormally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line mode (Last Line
Mode or : mode):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to vi, this mode is
entered by typing one of the characters : / ? &nbsp;# ! The
command is terminated and executed by typing a carriage
return; to cancel a partially typed <br>
command, type ESC to cancel the current command and return
to command mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The editor recognizes the environment variable BVIINIT as a
command (or list of commands) to run when it starts up. If
this variable is undefined, the editor checks for <br>
startup commands in the file ~/.bvirc file, which you must
own. However, if there is a .bvirc owned by you in the
current directory, the editor takes its startup <br>
commands from this file - overriding both the file in your
home directory and the environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINOLOGY <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional edit commands <br>
You can insert/append/change bytes in ASCII/binary/decimal/
hexadecimal or octal representation. You can enter several
(screen) lines of input. A line with only a period (.) in
<br>
it will terminate the command. You must not type in values
greater than a byte value. This causes an abandonment of the
command. Pressing the CR key does not insert a newline -
<br>
character into the file. If you use ASCII mode you can use,
and . the special characters 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:i aCR insert bytes (ASCII) at
cursor position <br>
:a bCR append bytes (Binary) at end of file <br>
:c hCR change bytes (hexadecimal) at cursor position</p>

:and n bitwise &rsquo;and&rsquo; operation with value n <br>
:or n bitwise &rsquo;or&rsquo; operation with value n <br>
:xor n bitwise &rsquo;xor&rsquo; operation with value n <br>
:neg two&rsquo;s complement <br>
:not logical negation <br>
:sl i shift each byte i bits to the left <br>
:sr i shift each byte i bits to the right <br>
:rl i rotate each byte i bits to the left <br>

/pat next line matching pat <br>
?pat previous line matching pat <br>
jump to next occurrence of hex string hex <br>
#hex jump to previous occurrence of hex string hex <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Marking and returning: <br>
mx mark current position with lower-case letter x <br>
Note: this command works for all lower-case letters <br>
&rsquo;x move cursor to mark x in ASCII section <br>
&lsquo;x move cursor to mark x in HEX section <br>
&rsquo;&rsquo; move cursor to previous context in ASCII
section <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo; move cursor to previous context in HEX
section</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line positioning: <br>
H jump to first line on screen (&quot;top&quot;) <br>
L jump to last line on screen (&quot;low&quot;) <br>
M jump to middle line on screen (&quot;middle&quot;) <br>

CR same as + <br>
DOWN or j next line, same column <br>
UP or k previous line, same column</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character positioning: <br>
^ first byte in HEX window <br>
$ end of screen line <br>

w jump to next begin of word <br>
b jump to previous begin of word <br>
W forward to next string delimited with a <br>
or <br>
B back to previous string delimited with a <br>
nonprinting char</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Corrections during insert: <br>
^H erase last character (backspace) <br>
erase your erase character, same as ^H (backspace) <br>
ESC ends insertion, back to command mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Append and replace: <br>
A append at end of file <br>
rx replace current bte with char &rsquo;x&rsquo; <br>
R enter replace mode; for all subsequent input, <br>
the current byte is overwritten with the next input
character; leave replace mode with ESC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous Operations: <br>
TAB toggle between ASCII and HEX section</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yank and Put: <br>
