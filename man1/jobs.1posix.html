<p>JOBS(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
JOBS(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jobs &acirc; display status of jobs in the current
session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jobs [&acirc;l|&acirc;p] [job_id...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The jobs utility shall display the status of jobs that were
started in the current shell environment; see Section 2.12,
Shell Execution Environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When jobs reports the
termination status of a job, the shell shall remove its
process ID from the list of those &lsquo;&lsquo;known in the
current shell execution environment&rsquo;&rsquo;; see
Section <br>
2.9.3.1, Examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The jobs utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;l (The letter ell.)
Provide more information about each job listed. This
information shall include the job number, current job,
process group ID, state, and the command <br>
that formed the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Display only the
process IDs for the process group leaders of the selected
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the jobs utility
shall display the status of all stopped jobs, running
background jobs and all jobs whose status has changed and
have not been reported by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">job_id Specifies the jobs for
which the status is to be displayed. If no job_id is given,
the status information for all jobs shall be displayed. The
format of job_id is <br>
described in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 3.204, Job Control Job ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of jobs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If the &acirc;p option is specified, the output shall
consist of one line for each process ID:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d0, &lt;process
ID&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if the &acirc;l
option is not specified, the output shall be a series of
lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;[%d] %c %s %s0,
&lt;job-number&gt;, &lt;current&gt;, &lt;state&gt;,
&lt;command&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the fields shall be as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;current&gt; The character
&rsquo;+&rsquo; identifies the job that would be used as a
default for the fg or bg utilities; this job can also be
specified using the job_id %+ or &quot;%%&quot;. The
char&acirc; <br>
acter &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; identifies the job that would
become the default if the current default job were to exit;
this job can also be specified using the job_id %&acirc;.
For other jobs, <br>
this field is a &lt;space&gt;. At most one job can be
identified with &rsquo;+&rsquo; and at most one job can be
identified with &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;. If there is any
suspended job, then the current <br>
job shall be a suspended job. If there are at least two
suspended jobs, then the previous job also shall be a
suspended job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;job-number&gt; <br>
A number that can be used to identify the process group to
the wait, fg, bg, and kill utilities. Using these utilities,
the job can be identified by prefixing the job <br>
number with &rsquo;%&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;state&gt; One of the
following strings (in the POSIX locale):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running Indicates that the job
has not been suspended by a signal and has not exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Done Indicates that the job
completed and returned exit status zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Done(code) <br>
Indicates that the job completed normally and that it exited
with the specified non-zero exit status, code, expressed as
a decimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped Indicates that the job
was suspended by the SIGTSTP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGTSTP) <br>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTSTP
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGSTOP) <br>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGSTOP
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGTTIN) <br>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTIN
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopped (SIGTTOU) <br>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTOU
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The implementation may
substitute the string Suspended in place of Stopped. If the
job was terminated by a signal, the format of &lt;state&gt;
is unspecified, but it shall <br>
be visibly distinct from all of the other &lt;state&gt;
formats shown here and shall indicate the name or
description of the signal causing the termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;command&gt; The associated
command that was given to the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;l option is
specified, a field containing the process group ID shall be
inserted before the &lt;state&gt; field. Also, more
processes in a process group may be output on sepa&acirc;
<br>
rate lines, using only the process ID and &lt;command&gt;
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The &acirc;p option is the only portable way to find out the
process group of a job because different implementations
have different strategies for defining the process group of
the <br>
job. Usage such as $(jobs &acirc;p) provides a way of
referring to the process group of the job in an
implementation-independent way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The jobs utility does not work
as expected when it is operating in its own utility
execution environment because that environment has no
applicable jobs to manipulate. See the <br>
APPLICATION USAGE section for bg. For this reason, jobs is
generally implemented as a shell regular built-in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Both &quot;%%&quot; and &quot;%+&quot; are used to refer to
the current job. Both forms are of equal validity&acirc;the
&quot;%%&quot; mirroring &quot;$$&quot; and &quot;%+&quot;
mirroring the output of jobs. Both forms reflect his&acirc;
<br>
torical practice of the KornShell and the C shell with job
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job control features
provided by bg, fg, and jobs are based on the KornShell. The
standard developers examined the characteristics of the C
shell versions of these utilities <br>
and found that differences exist. Despite widespread use of
the C shell, the KornShell versions were selected for this
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 to maintain a degree of
uniformity <br>
with the rest of the KornShell features selected (such as
the very popular command line editing features).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The jobs utility is not
dependent on the job control option, as are the seemingly
related bg and fg utilities because jobs is useful for
examining background jobs, regardless of <br>
the condition of job control. When the user has invoked a
set +m command and job control has been turned off, jobs can
still be used to examine the background jobs associated <br>
with that current session. Similarly, kill can then be used
to kill background jobs with kill %&lt;background job
number&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output for terminated jobs
is left unspecified to accommodate various historical
systems. The following formats have been witnessed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Killed(signal name)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. signal name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. signal name(coredump)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. signal description&acirc;
core dumped</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most users should be able to
understand these formats, although it means that
applications have trouble parsing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calculation of job IDs was
not described since this would suggest an implementation,
which may impose unnecessary restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an early proposal, a &acirc;n
option was included to &lsquo;&lsquo;Display the status of
jobs that have changed, exited, or stopped since the last
status report&rsquo;&rsquo;. It was removed because the <br>
shell always writes any changed status of jobs before each
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
