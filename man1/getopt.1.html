<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
getopt - parse command options (enhanced)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
getopt optstring parameters <br>
getopt [options] [--] optstring parameters <br>
getopt [options] -o|--options optstring [options] [--]
parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
getopt is used to break up (parse) options in command lines
for easy parsing by shell procedures, and to check for legal
options. It uses the GNU getopt(3) routines to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters getopt is called
with can be divided into two parts: options which modify the
way getopt will parse (options and -o|--options optstring in
the SYNOPSIS), and the <br>
parameters which are to be parsed (parameters in the
SYNOPSIS). The second part will start at the first
non-option parameter that is not an option argument, or
after the first <br>
occurrence of &rsquo;--&rsquo;. If no &rsquo;-o&rsquo; or
&rsquo;--options&rsquo; option is found in the first part,
the first parameter of the second part is used as the short
options string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set, or if its first parameter is not
an option (does not start with a &rsquo;-&rsquo;, this is
the first format in the SYNOPSIS), getopt <br>
will generate output that is compatible with that of other
versions of getopt(1). It will still do parameter shuffling
and recognize optional arguments (see section
COMPATIBIL&acirc; <br>
ITY for more information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Traditional implementations of
getopt(1) are unable to cope with whitespace and other
(shell-specific) special characters in arguments and
non-option parameters. To solve this <br>
problem, this implementation can generate quoted output
which must once again be interpreted by the shell (usually
by using the eval command). This has the effect of
preserving <br>
those characters, but you must call getopt in a way that is
no longer compatible with other versions (the second or
third format in the SYNOPSIS). To determine whether this
<br>
enhanced version of getopt(1) is installed, a special test
option (-T) can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --alternative <br>
Allow long options to start with a single
&rsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Output a small usage guide and exit successfully. No other
output is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --longoptions longopts <br>
The long (multi-character) options to be recognized. More
than one option name may be specified at once, by separating
the names with commas. This option may be given <br>
more than once, the longopts are cumulative. Each long
option name in longopts may be followed by one colon to
indicate it has a required argument, and by two colons to
<br>
indicate it has an optional argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --name progname <br>
The name that will be used by the getopt(3) routines when it
reports errors. Note that errors of getopt(1) are still
reported as coming from getopt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --options shortopts <br>
The short (one-character) options to be recognized. If this
option is not found, the first parameter of getopt that does
not start with a &rsquo;-&rsquo; (and is not an option
argu&acirc; <br>
ment) is used as the short options string. Each short option
character in shortopts may be followed by one colon to
indicate it has a required argument, and by two colons <br>
to indicate it has an optional argument. The first character
of shortopts may be &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo; to
influence the way options are parsed and output is generated
(see section <br>
SCANNING MODES for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Disable error reporting by getopt(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --quiet-output <br>
Do not generate normal output. Errors are still reported by
getopt(3), unless you also use -q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --shell shell <br>
Set quoting conventions to those of shell. If no -s argument
is found, the BASH conventions are used. Valid arguments are
currently &rsquo;sh&rsquo; &rsquo;bash&rsquo;,
&rsquo;csh&rsquo;, and &rsquo;tcsh&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unquoted <br>
Do not quote the output. Note that whitespace and special
(shell-dependent) characters can cause havoc in this mode
(like they do with other getopt(1) implementations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --test <br>
Test if your getopt(1) is this enhanced version or an old
version. This generates no output, and sets the error status
to 4. Other implementations of getopt(1), and this <br>
version if the environment variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is
set, will return &rsquo;--&rsquo; and error status 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output version information and exit successfully. No other
output is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARSING <br>
This section specifies the format of the second part of the
parameters of getopt (the parameters in the SYNOPSIS). The
next section (OUTPUT) describes the output that is
gener&acirc; <br>
ated. These parameters were typically the parameters a shell
function was called with. Care must be taken that each
parameter the shell function was called with corresponds to
<br>
exactly one parameter in the parameter list of getopt (see
the EXAMPLES). All parsing is done by the GNU getopt(3)
routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters are parsed from
left to right. Each parameter is classified as a short
option, a long option, an argument to an option, or a
non-option parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple short option is a
&rsquo;-&rsquo; followed by a short option character. If the
option has a required argument, it may be written directly
after the option character or as the next <br>
parameter (ie. separated by whitespace on the command line).
If the option has an optional argument, it must be written
directly after the option character if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to specify
several short options after one &rsquo;-&rsquo;, as long as
all (except possibly the last) do not have required or
optional arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A long option normally begins
with &rsquo;--&rsquo; followed by the long option name. If
the option has a required argument, it may be written
directly after the long option name, separated <br>
by &rsquo;=&rsquo;, or as the next argument (i.e. separated
by whitespace on the command line). If the option has an
optional argument, it must be written directly after the
long option <br>
name, separated by &rsquo;=&rsquo;, if present (if you add
the &rsquo;=&rsquo; but nothing behind it, it is interpreted
as if no argument was present; this is a slight bug, see the
BUGS). Long options <br>
may be abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation is not
ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each parameter not starting with
a &rsquo;-&rsquo;, and not a required argument of a previous
option, is a non-option parameter. Each parameter after a
&rsquo;--&rsquo; parameter is always interpreted <br>
as a non-option parameter. If the environment variable
POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, or if the short option string
started with a &rsquo;+&rsquo;, all remaining parameters are
interpreted as <br>
non-option parameters as soon as the first non-option
parameter is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
Output is generated for each element described in the
previous section. Output is done in the same order as the
elements are specified in the input, except for non-option
param&acirc; <br>
eters. Output can be done in compatible (unquoted) mode, or
in such way that whitespace and other special characters
within arguments and non-option parameters are preserved
<br>
(see QUOTING). When the output is processed in the shell
script, it will seem to be composed of distinct elements
that can be processed one by one (by using the shift command
in <br>
most shell languages). This is imperfect in unquoted mode,
as elements can be split at unexpected places if they
contain whitespace or special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are problems parsing
the parameters, for example because a required argument is
not found or an option is not recognized, an error will be
reported on stderr, there will <br>
be no output for the offending element, and a non-zero error
status is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a short option, a single
&rsquo;-&rsquo; and the option character are generated as
one parameter. If the option has an argument, the next
parameter will be the argument. If the option <br>
takes an optional argument, but none was found, the next
parameter will be generated but be empty in quoting mode,
but no second parameter will be generated in unquoted
(compati&acirc; <br>
ble) mode. Note that many other getopt(1) implementations do
not support optional arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If several short options were
specified after a single &rsquo;-&rsquo;, each will be
present in the output as a separate parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a long option,
&rsquo;--&rsquo; and the full option name are generated as
one parameter. This is done regardless whether the option
was abbreviated or specified with a single &rsquo;-&rsquo;
in the <br>
input. Arguments are handled as with short options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, no non-option
parameters output is generated until all options and their
arguments have been generated. Then &rsquo;--&rsquo; is
generated as a single parameter, and after it the <br>
non-option parameters in the order they were found, each as
a separate parameter. Only if the first character of the
short options string was a &rsquo;-&rsquo;, non-option
parameter output <br>
is generated at the place they are found in the input (this
is not supported if the first format of the SYNOPSIS is
used; in that case all preceding occurrences of
&rsquo;-&rsquo; and &rsquo;+&rsquo; <br>
are ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUOTING <br>
In compatible mode, whitespace or &rsquo;special&rsquo;
characters in arguments or non-option parameters are not
handled correctly. As the output is fed to the shell script,
the script does <br>
not know how it is supposed to break the output into
separate parameters. To circumvent this problem, this
implementation offers quoting. The idea is that output is
generated <br>
with quotes around each parameter. When this output is once
again fed to the shell (usually by a shell eval command), it
is split correctly into separate parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoting is not enabled if the
environment variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set, if the first
form of the SYNOPSIS is used, or if the option
&rsquo;-u&rsquo; is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Different shells use different
quoting conventions. You can use the &rsquo;-s&rsquo; option
to select the shell you are using. The following shells are
currently supported: &rsquo;sh&rsquo;, &rsquo;bash&rsquo;,
<br>
&rsquo;csh&rsquo; and &rsquo;tcsh&rsquo;. Actually, only two
&rsquo;flavors&rsquo; are distinguished: sh-like quoting
conventions and csh-like quoting conventions. Chances are
that if you use another shell script <br>
language, one of these flavors can still be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCANNING MODES <br>
The first character of the short options string may be a
&rsquo;-&rsquo; or a &rsquo;+&rsquo; to indicate a special
scanning mode. If the first calling form in the SYNOPSIS is
used they are ignored; <br>
the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is still examined,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first character is
&rsquo;+&rsquo;, or if the environment variable
POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, parsing stops as soon as the first
non-option parameter (ie. a parameter that does not <br>
start with a &rsquo;-&rsquo;) is found that is not an option
argument. The remaining parameters are all interpreted as
non-option parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first character is a
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, non-option parameters are outputted at the
place where they are found; in normal operation, they are
all collected at the end of output after a <br>
&rsquo;--&rsquo; parameter has been generated. Note that
this &rsquo;--&rsquo; parameter is still generated, but it
will always be the last parameter in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
This version of getopt(1) is written to be as compatible as
possible to other versions. Usually you can just replace
them with this version without any modifications, and with
<br>
some advantages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first character of the
first parameter of getopt is not a &rsquo;-&rsquo;, getopt
goes into compatibility mode. It will interpret its first
parameter as the string of short options, <br>
and all other arguments will be parsed. It will still do
parameter shuffling (ie. all non-option parameters are
outputted at the end), unless the environment variable <br>
POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
GETOPT_COMPATIBLE forces getopt into compatibility mode.
Setting both this environment variable and POSIXLY_CORRECT
offers 100% compatibility for &rsquo;dif&acirc; <br>
ficult&rsquo; programs. Usually, though, neither is
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In compatibility mode, leading
&rsquo;-&rsquo; and &rsquo;+&rsquo; characters in the short
options string are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN CODES <br>
getopt returns error code 0 for successful parsing, 1 if
getopt(3) returns errors, 2 if it does not understand its
own parameters, 3 if an internal error occurs like
out-of-mem&acirc; <br>
ory, and 4 if it is called with -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example scripts for (ba)sh and (t)csh are provided with the
getopt(1) distribution, and are optionally installed in
/usr/share/getopt/ or /usr/share/docs/ in util-linux
subdirec&acirc; <br>
tory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
POSIXLY_CORRECT <br>
This environment variable is examined by the getopt(3)
routines. If it is set, parsing stops as soon as a parameter
is found that is not an option or an option argument. <br>
All remaining parameters are also interpreted as non-option
parameters, regardless whether they start with a
&rsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETOPT_COMPATIBLE <br>
Forces getopt to use the first calling format as specified
in the SYNOPSIS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
getopt(3) can parse long options with optional arguments
that are given an empty optional argument (but can not do
this for short options). This getopt(1) treats optional
argu&acirc; <br>
ments that are empty as if they were not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax if you do not want
any short option variables at all is not very intuitive (you
have to set them explicitly to the empty string).</p>
