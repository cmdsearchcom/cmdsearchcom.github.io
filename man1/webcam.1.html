webcam - capture images and upload them to a webserver using ftp
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>webcam [ config file ]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>webcam</b> captures images from a video4linux device like bttv, annotates
  them and and uploads them to a webserver using ftp in a endless loop.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
At startup <b>webcam</b> reads the configuration from the given config file or
  ~/.webcamrc if none is specified in the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The config file has at least two sections. The &quot;grab&quot; section holds
  the capture parameters. Any other section describes where the image should be
  uploaded. Older versions used &quot;ftp&quot; as name for that section.
  Recently the webcam utility got support for multiple connections, thus any
  section name is accepted and you can have more than one ftp section (you have
  to use another name for each section througth, name them by upload servers for
  example).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is an sample config file (the given values are the defaults):
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
[grab]
device = /dev/video0
driver = libv4l
text = &quot;webcam %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;
infofile = filename
fg_red = 255
fg_green = 255
fg_blue = 255
width = 320
height = 240
delay = 3
wait = 0
input = composite1
norm = pal
rotate = 0
top = 0
left = 0
bottom = -1
right = -1
quality = 75
trigger = 0
once = 0
<div class="Pp"></div>
[ftp]
host = www
user = webcam
pass = xxxxxx
dir  = public_html/images
file = webcam.jpeg
tmp  = uploading.jpeg
passive = 1
debug = 0
auto = 0
local = 0
ssh = 0
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
The annotation <b>text</b> is processed with strftime. Check the strftime(3) or
  date(1) manpage to see how you can format the timestamps. The text can also be
  read from a extern file (use <b>infofile</b> for that). The default color for
  the text overlay is white (RGB=255,255,255). Entries in the range of 0 through
  255 for <b>fg_red,</b> <b>fg_green,</b> and <b>fg_blue</b> can be used to
  define a different color. Likewise <b>bg_red,</b> <b>bg_green,</b> and
  <b>bg_blue</b> can be used to set the background color (which defaults to
  transparent).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>input</b> is the video source (TV/composite/whatever), <b>norm</b> the TV
  norm. <b>delay</b> is the delay between two images in seconds. <b>wait</b> is
  the initial delay before the first image is grabbed (some cameras need some
  time for adapting to lightning, thus don't return images with reasonable
  quality within the first few seconds ...). <b>quality</b> is the JPEG quality
  for the stored images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>top, bottom, left,</b> and <b>right</b> in the grab section allow cropping
  the image after it is grabbed. They should satisfy
  0&lt;=top&lt;bottom&lt;=height and 0&lt;=left&lt;right&lt;=width. (0,0 is the
  top, left corner.) If <b>rotate</b> is positive, the output image will be
  rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees that number of times (1, 2, or 3).
<div class="Pp"></div>
With <b>trigger</b> set to a non-zero value webcam will upload the image only if
  the content of the image has changed. It just looks for the maximum difference
  between the last uploaded and current image and if it is greater than the
  specified value the image will be uploaded. If <b>once</b> is set to 1 webcam
  will upload a single frame and quit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>archive</b> can be used to create a (local) archive of the webcam images.
  Just specify the filename for the files as argument. The filename will be
  processed with strftime(3), so you can use the place the usual time format
  controls into the string to get unique filenames. Non-existing directories are
  created if needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>debug</b> in the ftp section is set to 1 the complete communication
  between webcam and the ftp utility is printed to stderr. <b>auto</b> enables
  autologin via ~/.netrc (starts the ftp utility without the '-n' switch, check
  the ftp(1) man page for more info about the ~/.netrc file). If <b>local</b> in
  the ftp section is non-zero, files will be stored locally (using the <b>dir,
  tmp,</b> and <b>file</b> parameters) rather than ftped. <b>ssh</b> set to
  non-zero makes webcam use ssh instead of ftp.
