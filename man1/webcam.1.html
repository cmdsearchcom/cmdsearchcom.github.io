<p>webcam(1) General Commands Manual webcam(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
webcam - capture images and upload them to a webserver using
ftp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
webcam [ config file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
webcam captures images from a video4linux device like bttv,
annotates them and and uploads them to a webserver using ftp
in a endless loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
At startup webcam reads the configuration from the given
config file or ~/.webcamrc if none is specified in the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The config file has at least two
sections. The &quot;grab&quot; section holds the capture
parameters. Any other section describes where the image
should be uploaded. Older versions used <br>
&quot;ftp&quot; as name for that section. Recently the
webcam utility got support for multiple connections, thus
any section name is accepted and you can have more than one
ftp section <br>
(you have to use another name for each section througth,
name them by upload servers for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an sample config file
(the given values are the defaults):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[grab] <br>
device = /dev/video0 <br>
driver = libv4l <br>
text = &quot;webcam %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot; <br>
infofile = filename <br>
fg_red = 255 <br>
fg_green = 255 <br>
fg_blue = 255 <br>
width = 320 <br>
height = 240 <br>
delay = 3 <br>
wait = 0 <br>
input = composite1 <br>
norm = pal <br>
rotate = 0 <br>
top = 0 <br>
left = 0 <br>
bottom = -1 <br>
right = -1 <br>
quality = 75 <br>
trigger = 0 <br>
once = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ftp] <br>
host = www <br>
user = webcam <br>
pass = xxxxxx <br>
dir = public_html/images <br>
file = webcam.jpeg <br>
tmp = uploading.jpeg <br>
passive = 1 <br>
debug = 0 <br>
auto = 0 <br>
local = 0 <br>
ssh = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The annotation text is processed
with strftime. Check the strftime(3) or date(1) manpage to
see how you can format the timestamps. The text can also be
read from a extern file <br>
(use infofile for that). The default color for the text
overlay is white (RGB=255,255,255). Entries in the range of
0 through 255 for fg_red, fg_green, and fg_blue can be used
<br>
to define a different color. Likewise bg_red, bg_green, and
bg_blue can be used to set the background color (which
defaults to transparent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input is the video source
(TV/composite/whatever), norm the TV norm. delay is the
delay between two images in seconds. wait is the initial
delay before the first image is <br>
grabbed (some cameras need some time for adapting to
lightning, thus don&rsquo;t return images with reasonable
quality within the first few seconds ...). quality is the
JPEG quality <br>
for the stored images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">top, bottom, left, and right in
the grab section allow cropping the image after it is
grabbed. They should satisfy 0&lt;=top&lt;bottom&lt;=height
and 0&lt;=left&lt;right&lt;=width. (0,0 is the <br>
top, left corner.) If rotate is positive, the output image
will be rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees that number of
times (1, 2, or 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With trigger set to a non-zero
value webcam will upload the image only if the content of
the image has changed. It just looks for the maximum
difference between the last <br>
uploaded and current image and if it is greater than the
specified value the image will be uploaded. If once is set
to 1 webcam will upload a single frame and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive can be used to create a
(local) archive of the webcam images. Just specify the
filename for the files as argument. The filename will be
processed with strftime(3), so <br>
you can use the place the usual time format controls into
the string to get unique filenames. Non-existing directories
are created if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If debug in the ftp section is
set to 1 the complete communication between webcam and the
ftp utility is printed to stderr. auto enables autologin via
~/.netrc (starts the ftp <br>
utility without the &rsquo;-n&rsquo; switch, check the
ftp(1) man page for more info about the ~/.netrc file). If
local in the ftp section is non-zero, files will be stored
locally (using <br>
the dir, tmp, and file parameters) rather than ftped. ssh
set to non-zero makes webcam use ssh instead of ftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORRECTION OF DISTORTION <br>
contributed by Frederic Helin, the parameters belong into
the [grab] section of the config file too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distor = 1 <br>
If distor param is set to 1, the correction of distortion
works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distor_k = 700 <br>
This is the coefficient of distortion. This algorithm is
based on the paper &quot;Correcting Distortion of Image by
Image Registration&quot; of Toru Tamaki, Tsuyoshi Yamamura
and <br>
Noboru Ahnishi. More your lens has an important distortion,
more &rsquo;distor_k&rsquo; must be neared of 0. 700 is the
default value. Coefficient k of program is x100 than
article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distor_cx = 192</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distor_cy = 144 <br>
Coordinates of the lens optical axis: width/2 and height/2
are the default values. The axis doesn&rsquo;t go through
the image center. So, you can change its coordinates around
<br>
the center of image to affine correction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distor_zoom = 30 <br>
Zoom parameter is used to cache the distorted borders of
image, if you don&rsquo;t like this. Default value is
100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distor_sensorw = 320</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distor_sensorh = 240 <br>
Dimensions of camera sensor. Default values are for 1/4p
sensor. This parameters used to have the same k coefficient
than article.</p>
