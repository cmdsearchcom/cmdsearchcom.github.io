<p>GLOBUS-JOB-SUBMIT(1) Globus Toolkit Manual
GLOBUS-JOB-SUBMIT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
globus-job-submit - Submit a batch job using GRAM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
globus-job-submit [-dumprsl|-dryrun|-verify] [-file
ARGUMENT_FILE] SERVICE-CONTACT [OPTIONS] EXECUTABLE
ARGUMENT...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">globus-job-submit [-help |
-usage | -version | -versions]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The globus-job-submit program constructs a job description
from its command-line options and then submits the job to
the GRAM service running at SERVICE_CONTACT. The executable
<br>
and arguments to the executable are provided on the
command-line after all other options. Note that the
-dumprsl, -dryrun, -verify, and -file command-line options
must occur <br>
before the first non-option argument, the
SERVICE_CONTACT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The globus-job-submit provides
similar functionality to globusrun in that it allows batch
submission of GRAM jobs. However, unlike globusrun, it uses
command-line parameters to <br>
define the job instead of RSL expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To retrieve the output and error
streams of the job, use the program globus-job-get-output.
To reclaim resources used by the job by deleting cached
files and job state, use the <br>
program globus-job-clean. To cancel a batch job submitted by
globus-job-submit, use the program globus-job-cancel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The full set of options to globus-job-submit are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help, -usage <br>
Display a help message to standard error and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Display the software version of the globus-job-submit
program to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-versions <br>
Display the software version of the globus-job-submit
program including DiRT information to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumprsl <br>
Translate the command-line options to globus-job-submit into
an RSL expression that can be used with tools such as
globusrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dryrun <br>
Submit the job request to the GRAM service with the dryrun
option enabled. When this option is used, the GRAM service
prepares to execute the job but stops before submitting <br>
the job to the LRM. This can be used to diagnose some
problems such as missing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verify <br>
Submit the job request to the GRAM service with the dryrun
option enabled and then without it enabled if the dryrun is
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file ARGUMENT_FILE <br>
Read additional command-line options from ARGUMENT_FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-np PROCESSES, -count PROCESSES
<br>
Start PROCESSES instances of the executable as a single
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MAX_TIME, -maxtime MAX_TIME
<br>
Schedule the job to run for a maximum of MAX_TIME
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PROJECT, -project PROJECT
<br>
Request that the job use the allocation PROJECT when
submitting the job to the LRM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q QUEUE, -queue QUEUE <br>
Request that the job be submitted to the LRM using the named
QUEUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DIRECTORY, -directory
DIRECTORY <br>
Run the job in the directory named by DIRECTORY. Input and
output files will be interpreted relative to this directory.
This directory must exist on the file system on the <br>
LRM-managed resource. If not specified, the job will run in
the home directory of the user the job is running as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-env NAME=VALUE <br>
Define an environment variable named by NAME with the value
VALUE in the job environment. This option may be specified
multiple times to define multiple environment <br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdin [-l | -s] STDIN_FILE <br>
Use the file named by STDIN_FILE as the standard input of
the job. If the -l option is specified, then this file is
interpreted to be on a file system local to the LRM. If <br>
the -s option is specified, then this file is interpreted to
be on the file system where globus-job-submit is being
executed, and the file will be staged via GASS. If neither
<br>
is specified, the local behavior is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdout [-l | -s] STDOUT_FILE
<br>
Use the file named by STDOUT_FILE as the destination for the
standard output of the job. If the -l option is specified,
then this file is interpreted to be on a file system <br>
local to the LRM. If the -s option is specified, then this
file is interpreted to be on the file system where
globus-job-submit is being executed, and the file will be
staged <br>
via GASS. If neither is specified, the local behavior is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stderr [-l | -s] STDERR_FILE
<br>
Use the file named by STDERR_FILE as the destination for the
standard error of the job. If the -l option is specified,
then this file is interpreted to be on a file system <br>
local to the LRM. If the -s option is specified, then this
file is interpreted to be on the file system where
globus-job-submit is being executed, and the file will be
staged <br>
via GASS. If neither is specified, the local behavior is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x RSL_CLAUSE <br>
Add a set of custom RSL attributes described by RSL_CLAUSE
to the job description. The clause must be an RSL
conjunction and may contain one or more attributes. This can
be <br>
used to include attributes which can not be defined by other
command-line options of globus-job-submit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
When included outside the context of -stdin, -stdout, or
-stderr command-line options, -l option alters the
interpretation of the executable path. If the -l option is
<br>
specified, then the executable is interpreted to be on a
file system local to the LRM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
When included outside the context of -stdin, -stdout, or
-stderr command-line options, -l option alters the
interpretation of the executable path. If the -s option is
<br>
specified, then the executable is interpreted to be on the
file system where globus-job-run is being executed, and the
file will be staged via GASS. If neither is specified, <br>
the local behavior is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If the following variables affect the execution of
globus-job-submit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X509_USER_PROXY <br>
Path to proxy credential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X509_CERT_DIR <br>
Path to trusted certificate directory.</p>
