<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
prooftree - proof-tree display for Proof General</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
prooftree [Options...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Prooftree visualizes proof trees during proof development
with Proof General. Currently it only works for Coq, though
adding support for other proof assistants should be
rela&acirc; <br>
tively easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start a proof-tree display,
hit the Prooftree icon in the Proof General tool-bar or
select the menu entry Proof-General -&gt; Start/Stop
Prooftree or type C-c C-d (which runs <br>
proof-tree-external-display-toggle). Inside a proof, this
will immediately start a proof-tree display for the current
proof. Outside a proof, Proof General remembers to start
<br>
the proof-tree display for the next proof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under normal circumstances
Prooftree is started by Proof General as an Emacs
subprocess. The user interacts with Prooftree only through
the graphical user interface. A substan&acirc; <br>
tial part of the proof-tree visualization task is done by
Proof General. Therefore not only the Prooftree command line
arguments but also other aspects can only be configured <br>
inside Proof General, see Proof General Customization
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help Print synopsis and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config <br>
Open the configuration dialog on startup (if you want to
change the configuration without starting Proof
General).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry spec <br>
Sets the X geometry of the main window. spec is a standard X
geometry string in the form xposxypos[+xoff[+yoff]].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tee file <br>
Write all input to file (usually for debugging
purposes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Provide more details on
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help-dialog <br>
Open the help dialog on startup. Mainly useful for
proofreading the help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIN PROOF DISPLAY <br>
Prooftree opens one window for each proof that it is
requested to display. This window contains the proof-tree
graph and a small display for sequents and proof
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colors <br>
The branches in the proof-tree graph are colored according
to their state. Prooftree distinguishes between the
following states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">current (blue by default) <br>
The current branch is the branch from the root of the proof
tree to the current goal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unproven (default foreground
color) <br>
A branch is unproven if it contains open proof goals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proved incomplete (cyan by
default) <br>
An incompletely proved branch has its proof finished, but
some of the existential variables that have been introduced
in this branch are not (yet) instantiated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proved partially (dark green by
default) <br>
In a partially proved branch all existential variables of
the branch itself are instantiated, but some of those
instantiations contain existential variables that are not
<br>
(yet) instantiated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proved complete (green by
default) <br>
A branch is proved complete if all its existential variables
are instantiated with terms that themselves do not contain
any existential variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cheated (red by default) <br>
A cheated branch contains a cheating proof command, such as
admit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colors as well as many other
Prooftree parameters can be changed in the Prooftree
Configuration Dialog (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Navigation <br>
When the proof tree grows large one can navigate by a
variety of means. In addition to scroll bars and the usual
keys one can move the proof tree by dragging with mouse
button 1 <br>
pressed. By default, dragging moves the viewport (i.e., the
proof tree underneath moves in the opposite direction).
After setting a negative value for Drag acceleration in the
<br>
Prooftree Configuration Dialog, dragging will move the proof
tree instead (i.e, the proof tree moves in the same
direction as the mouse).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sequent Display <br>
The sequent display below the proof tree normally shows the
ancestor sequent of the current goal. With a single left
mouse click one can display any goal or proof command in the
<br>
sequent display. A single click outside the proof tree will
switch back to default behavior. The initial size of the
sequent display can be set in the Prooftree Configuration
<br>
Dialog. A value of 0 hides the sequent display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tool Tips <br>
Abbreviated proof commands and sequents are shown in full as
tool tips when the mouse pointer rests over them. Both, the
tool tips for abbreviated proof commands and for sequents
<br>
can be independently switched off in the Prooftree
Configuration Dialog. The length at which proof commands are
abbreviated can be configured as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional Displays <br>
A double click or a shift-click displays any goal or proof
command in an additional window. These additional windows
are automatically updated, for instance, if an existential
<br>
variable is instantiated. For additional sequent displays
one can browse the instantiation history of the sequent
using the forward and backward buttons. These additional
windows <br>
can be detached from the proof tree. A detached display is
neither automatically updated nor automatically deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Existential Variables <br>
Prooftree keeps track of existential variables, whether they
have been instantiated and whether they depend on some
other, not (yet) instantiated existential. It uses different
<br>
colors for proved branches that contain non-instantiated
existential variables and branches that only depend on some
not instantiated existential. The list of currently not <br>
(yet) instantiated existential variables is appended to
proof commands and sequents in tool-tips and the other
displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Existential Variable Dialog
displays a table with all existential variables of the
current proof and their dependencies. Each line of the table
contains a button that marks <br>
the proof command that introduced this variable (with yellow
background, by default) and, if present, the proof command
that instantiated this variable (with orange background,
<br>
by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main Menu <br>
The Menu button displays the main menu. The Clone item
clones the current proof tree in an additional window. This
additional window continues to display a snapshot of the
cloned <br>
proof tree, no matter what happens with the original
proof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Show current and Show
selected items move the viewport of the proof tree such that
the current proof goal, or, respectively, the selected node
will be visible (if they <br>
exist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Exit item terminates
Prooftree and closes all proof-tree displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining three items
display, respectively, the Prooftree Configuration Dialog,
and the Help and About windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context Menu <br>
A right click displays the Context Menu, which contains
additional items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The item Undo to point is active
over sequent nodes in the proof tree. There, it sends an
retract or undo request to Proof General that retracts the
scripting buffer up to that <br>
sequent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The items Insert command and
Insert subproof are active over proof commands. They sent,
respectively, the selected proof command or all proof
commands in the selected subtree, to <br>
Proof General, which inserts them at point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Prooftree Configuration Dialog <br>
The Save button stores the current configuration (as
marshaled OCaml record) in ~/.prooftree, which will
overwrite the built-in default configuration for the
following Prooftree <br>
runs. The Revert button loads and applies the saved
configuration. The Cancel and OK buttons close the dialog,
but Cancel additionally resets the configuration to the
state <br>
before the start of the dialog. To avoid opening partial
file names, the Log Proof General input check box is
deactivated when typing the log file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proof General Customization <br>
The location of the Prooftree executable and the command
line arguments are in the customization group proof-tree.
Prover specific points, such as the regular expressions for
<br>
navigation and cheating commands are in the customization
group proof-tree-internals. To visit a customization group,
type M-x customize-group followed by the name of the
cus&acirc; <br>
tomization group inside Proof General.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
For Coq &gt;= 8.5, existential variables in Prooftree are
severely broken because Coq does not provide the necessary
information, see Coq bug 4504.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Coq, proofs must be started
with command Proof, which is the recommended practice anyway
(see Coq problem report 2776).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In additional sequent displays,
the information about existential variables is only shown
for the latest version of the sequent and not for older
versions in the instantiation <br>
history. The current communication protocol between Proof
General and Prooftree does not permit more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREREQUISITES <br>
This version of Prooftree requires Coq 8.4beta or better and
Proof General 4.3pre130327 or better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.prooftree <br>
Saved Prooftree configuration. Is loaded at application
start-up for overwriting the built-in default configuration.
Must contain a marshaled OCaml configuration record.</p>
