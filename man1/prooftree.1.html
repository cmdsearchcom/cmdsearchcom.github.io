prooftree - proof-tree display for Proof General
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>prooftree [<i>Options...</i>]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Prooftree</b> visualizes proof trees during proof development with <b>Proof
  General.</b> Currently it only works for <b>Coq</b>, though adding support for
  other proof assistants should be relatively easy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start a proof-tree display, hit the <b>Prooftree</b> icon in the <b>Proof
  General</b> tool-bar or select the menu entry <i>Proof-General</i> -&gt;
  <i>Start/Stop Prooftree</i> or type <i>C-c C-d</i> (which runs
  <i>proof-tree-external-display-toggle).</i> Inside a proof, this will
  immediately start a proof-tree display for the current proof. Outside a proof,
  <b>Proof General</b> remembers to start the proof-tree display for the next
  proof.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under normal circumstances <b>Prooftree</b> is started by <b>Proof General</b>
  as an <b>Emacs</b> subprocess. The user interacts with <b>Prooftree</b> only
  through the graphical user interface. A substantial part of the proof-tree
  visualization task is done by <b>Proof General.</b> Therefore not only the
  <b>Prooftree</b> command line arguments but also other aspects can only be
  configured inside <b>Proof General,</b> see <b>Proof General Customization</b>
  below.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MAIN_PROOF_DISPLAY"><a class="selflink" href="#MAIN_PROOF_DISPLAY">MAIN
  PROOF DISPLAY</a></h1>
<b>Prooftree</b> opens one window for each proof that it is requested to
  display. This window contains the proof-tree graph and a small display for
  sequents and proof commands.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Colors"><a class="selflink" href="#Colors">Colors</a></h2>
The branches in the proof-tree graph are colored according to their state.
  <b>Prooftree</b> distinguishes between the following states.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">current (blue by default)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The current branch is the branch from the root of the proof
      tree to the current goal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">unproven (default foreground color)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A branch is unproven if it contains open proof goals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">proved incomplete (cyan by default)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An incompletely proved branch has its proof finished, but
      some of the existential variables that have been introduced in this branch
      are not (yet) instantiated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">proved partially (dark green by default)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In a partially proved branch all existential variables of
      the branch itself are instantiated, but some of those instantiations
      contain existential variables that are not (yet) instantiated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">proved complete (green by default)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A branch is proved complete if all its existential
      variables are instantiated with terms that themselves do not contain any
      existential variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">cheated (red by default)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A cheated branch contains a cheating proof command, such as
      <i>admit</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The colors as well as many other <b>Prooftree</b> parameters can be changed in
  the <b>Prooftree Configuration Dialog</b> (see below).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Navigation"><a class="selflink" href="#Navigation">Navigation</a></h2>
When the proof tree grows large one can navigate by a variety of means. In
  addition to scroll bars and the usual keys one can move the proof tree by
  dragging with mouse button 1 pressed. By default, dragging moves the viewport
  (i.e., the proof tree underneath moves in the opposite direction). After
  setting a negative value for <i>Drag acceleration</i> in the <b>Prooftree
  Configuration Dialog,</b> dragging will move the proof tree instead (i.e, the
  proof tree moves in the same direction as the mouse).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sequent_Display"><a class="selflink" href="#Sequent_Display">Sequent
  Display</a></h2>
The sequent display below the proof tree normally shows the ancestor sequent of
  the current goal. With a single left mouse click one can display any goal or
  proof command in the sequent display. A single click outside the proof tree
  will switch back to default behavior. The initial size of the sequent display
  can be set in the <b>Prooftree Configuration Dialog.</b> A value of 0 hides
  the sequent display.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Tool_Tips"><a class="selflink" href="#Tool_Tips">Tool
  Tips</a></h2>
Abbreviated proof commands and sequents are shown in full as tool tips when the
  mouse pointer rests over them. Both, the tool tips for abbreviated proof
  commands and for sequents can be independently switched off in the
  <b>Prooftree Configuration Dialog.</b> The length at which proof commands are
  abbreviated can be configured as well.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Additional_Displays"><a class="selflink" href="#Additional_Displays">Additional
  Displays</a></h2>
A double click or a shift-click displays any goal or proof command in an
  additional window. These additional windows are automatically updated, for
  instance, if an existential variable is instantiated. For additional sequent
  displays one can browse the instantiation history of the sequent using the
  forward and backward buttons. These additional windows can be <i>detached</i>
  from the proof tree. A detached display is neither automatically updated nor
  automatically deleted.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Existential_Variables"><a class="selflink" href="#Existential_Variables">Existential
  Variables</a></h2>
<b>Prooftree</b> keeps track of existential variables, whether they have been
  instantiated and whether they depend on some other, not (yet) instantiated
  existential. It uses different colors for proved branches that contain
  non-instantiated existential variables and branches that only depend on some
  not instantiated existential. The list of currently not (yet) instantiated
  existential variables is appended to proof commands and sequents in tool-tips
  and the other displays.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Existential Variable Dialog</b> displays a table with all existential
  variables of the current proof and their dependencies. Each line of the table
  contains a button that marks the proof command that introduced this variable
  (with yellow background, by default) and, if present, the proof command that
  instantiated this variable (with orange background, by default).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Main_Menu"><a class="selflink" href="#Main_Menu">Main
  Menu</a></h2>
The <i>Menu</i> button displays the main menu. The <i>Clone</i> item clones the
  current proof tree in an additional window. This additional window continues
  to display a snapshot of the cloned proof tree, no matter what happens with
  the original proof.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>Show current</i> and <i>Show selected</i> items move the viewport of the
  proof tree such that the current proof goal, or, respectively, the selected
  node will be visible (if they exist).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>Exit</i> item terminates <b>Prooftree</b> and closes all proof-tree
  displays.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remaining three items display, respectively, the <b>Prooftree Configuration
  Dialog,</b> and the <b>Help</b> and <b>About</b> windows.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Context_Menu"><a class="selflink" href="#Context_Menu">Context
  Menu</a></h2>
A right click displays the <i>Context Menu,</i> which contains additional items.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The item <i>Undo to point</i> is active over sequent nodes in the proof tree.
  There, it sends an retract or undo request to Proof General that retracts the
  scripting buffer up to that sequent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The items <i>Insert command</i> and <i>Insert subproof</i> are active over proof
  commands. They sent, respectively, the selected proof command or all proof
  commands in the selected subtree, to Proof General, which inserts them at
  point.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Prooftree_Configuration_Dialog"><a class="selflink" href="#Prooftree_Configuration_Dialog">Prooftree
  Configuration Dialog</a></h2>
The <i>Save</i> button stores the current configuration (as marshaled
  <b>OCaml</b> record) in <i>~/.prooftree,</i> which will overwrite the built-in
  default configuration for the following <b>Prooftree</b> runs. The
  <i>Revert</i> button loads and applies the saved configuration. The
  <i>Cancel</i> and <i>OK</i> buttons close the dialog, but <i>Cancel</i>
  additionally resets the configuration to the state before the start of the
  dialog. To avoid opening partial file names, the <i>Log Proof General
  input</i> check box is deactivated when typing the log file name.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Proof_General_Customization"><a class="selflink" href="#Proof_General_Customization">Proof
  General Customization</a></h2>
The location of the <b>Prooftree</b> executable and the command line arguments
  are in the customization group <i>proof-tree.</i> Prover specific points, such
  as the regular expressions for navigation and cheating commands are in the
  customization group <i>proof-tree-internals.</i> To visit a customization
  group, type <i>M-x customize-group</i> followed by the name of the
  customization group inside <b>Proof General.</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
For <b>Coq</b> &gt;= 8.5, existential variables in <b>Prooftree</b> are severely
  broken because <b>Coq</b> does not provide the necessary information, see
  <b>Coq</b> bug 4504.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In <b>Coq,</b> proofs must be started with command <i>Proof,</i> which is the
  recommended practice anyway (see Coq problem report 2776).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In additional sequent displays, the information about existential variables is
  only shown for the latest version of the sequent and not for older versions in
  the instantiation history. The current communication protocol between <b>Proof
  General</b> and <b>Prooftree</b> does not permit more.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREREQUISITES"><a class="selflink" href="#PREREQUISITES">PREREQUISITES</a></h1>
This version of <b>Prooftree</b> requires <b>Coq</b> 8.4beta or better and
  <b>Proof General</b> 4.3pre130327 or better.
