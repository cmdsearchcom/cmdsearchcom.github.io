<p>KUVERT(1) User Commands KUVERT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kuvert - Automatically sign and/or encrypt emails based on
the recipients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kuvert [-d] [-o] [-r|-k]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Kuvert is a tool to protect the integrity and secrecy of
your outgoing email independent of your mail client and with
minimal user interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It reads mails from its queue
(or accepts SMTP submissions), analyzes the recipients and
decides to whom it should encrypt and/or sign the mail. The
resulting mail is coerced <br>
into the PGP-MIME framework defined in RFC3156 and finally
sent to your outbound mail server. Kuvert uses GnuPG for all
cryptographic tasks and is designed to interface cleanly
<br>
with external secret caching tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
After startup kuvert periodically scans its queue directory
and processes mails from there; depending on your GnuPG
passphrase setup kuvert may daemonize itself. In either
case, <br>
kuvert runs forever until actively terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kuvert&rsquo;s behaviour is
configured primarily using a configuration file, with
exception of the following commandline options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enables debugging mode: extra
debugging information is written to STDERR. (This is
independent of normal logging.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Enables one-shot mode: kuvert
does not loop forever but processes only the current queue
contents and then exits. Kuvert does also not start an SMTP
listener in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Tells a running kuvert daemon
to reload the configuration file and the gpg keyring. This
is equivalent to sending a SIGUSR1 to the respective
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Tells a running kuvert daemon
to terminate cleanly. This is equivalent to sending a
SIGTERM to the respective process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
At startup kuvert reads its configuration file and your
gnugp keyring and remembers the association of email
addresses to keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kuvert then works as a wrapper
around your mail transfer agent (MTA): you author your
emails like always but instead of sending them out directly
you submit them to kuvert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Periodically kuvert scans its
queue and processes any email therein. If your keyring
contains a key for a recipient, kuvert will encrypt and sign
the email to that recipient. If <br>
no key is available, kuvert will only (clear/detached-)sign
the email. Subsequently, the email is sent onwards using
your MTA program or SMTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emails to be processed can have
any valid MIME structure; kuvert unpacks the MIME structure
losslessly and repacks the (encrypted/signed) mail into a
PGP/MIME object as described <br>
in RFC3156. The mail&rsquo;s structure is preserved.
Signature and encryption cover all of the mail content with
the exception of the top-level headers: for example the
&quot;Subject&quot; <br>
header will be passed in clear, whereas any body or attached
MIME object will be signed/encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The encrypt-or-sign decision can
be overridden on a per-address basis using the configuration
file or, even more fine-grainedly, by using directives in
the actual email. Kuvert <br>
can also be told not to modify an email at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submitting Emails to Kuvert <br>
Kuvert primarily relies on mails being dumped into its queue
directory. Kuvert operates on files with numeric file names
only. Anything that you store in its queue directory <br>
with such a filename will be treated as containing a single
RFC2822-formatted email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, no mainstream MUA
supports such a drop-your-files-somewhere scheme, and
therefore kuvert comes with a helper program called
kuvert_submit (see kuvert_submit(1)) which <br>
mimics sendmail&rsquo;s mail submission behaviour but feeds
to the kuvert queue. If your MUA can be instructed to run a
program for mail submission, kuvert_submit can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can send your
email to kuvert via SMTP. Kuvert comes with a built-in
receive-only mail server, which feeds to the queue
directory. As allowing others to <br>
submit emails for your signature would be silly and
dangerous, kuvert&rsquo;s mail server only listens on the
localhost IP address and requires that your MUA uses SMTP
Authentication <br>
to ensure that only your submissions are accepted. If your
MUA supports SMTP AUTH PLAIN or LOGIN and can be told to use
localhost and a specific port for outbound email, then you
<br>
can use this mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transporting Emails Onwards <br>
Kuvert can send outbound emails either by running a local
MTA program or by speaking SMTP to some (fixed) outbound
mail server of your choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recipients, Identities and the
SMTP Envelope <br>
In general kuvert identifies recipients using the To, Cc,
Bcc and Resent-To headers of the queued email. If the
mechanism you used to submit the mail to kuvert did
explicitely <br>
set recipients, then these override the headers within the
email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the case if
kuvert_submit is called with a list of recipients and no -t
option and for SMTP submission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If kuvert enqueues email via
inbound SMTP, the SMTP envelope overrides the email headers:
recipients that are present in the envelope but not the
headers are treated as Bcc&rsquo;d, <br>
and recipients listed in the headers but not the envelope
are ignored. Any Resent-To header is ignored for
SMTP-submitted email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only if no overriding recipients
are given, kuvert checks the mail for a Resent-To header. If
present, the email is sent out immediately to the Resent-To
addresses without <br>
further processing. (This is the standard &quot;bounce&quot;
behaviour for MUAs that don&rsquo;t pass recipients on to an
MSP/MTA directly.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sending outbound email,
kuvert usually uses the From header from the queued email as
identity. If the email was queued via SMTP, the envelope
again overrides the mail <br>
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that kuvert sets the
envelope sender using &quot;-f&quot; if sending email via a
local MTA program; if you are not sufficiently trusted by
your MTA to do such, your mail may get an <br>
X-Authentication-Warning header tacked on that indicates
your username and the fact that the envelope was set
explicitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passphrase Handling <br>
Kuvert does not handle your precious keys&rsquo;
passphrases. You can either elect to use gpg-agent as an
(on-demand or caching) passphrase store, or you can tell
kuvert what program <br>
it should run to query for a passphrase when required. Such
a query program will be run in a pipeline to GnuPG, and
kuvert will not access, store or cache the passphrases <br>
themselves: there are better options available for secret
caching, for example the Linux in-kernel keystorage
(keyctl(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How Kuvert Decides What (Not) To
Do <br>
For each recipient, kuvert can be told to apply one of four
different actions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
The email is sent as-is (except for configuration directive
removal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signonly <br>
The email is (clear/detached-) signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fallback <br>
The email is encrypted and signed if there is a key
available for this recipient or only signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fallback-all <br>
The email is encrypted and signed if keys are available for
all recipients, or only signed otherwise. Recipients whose
action is set to &quot;none&quot; and Bcc&rsquo;d recipients
are not <br>
affected by this action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fallback-all action is an
&quot;all-or-nothing&quot; action as far as encryption is
concerned and ensures that no mix of encrypted or
unencrypted versions of this email are sent <br>
out: if we can we use encryption for everybody, or otherwise
everybody gets it signed (or even unsigned). (Bcc&rsquo;d
recipients are the exception.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying Actions <br>
Kuvert uses four sources for action specifications:
directives in the individual email addresses, action
directives in the configuration file, an X-Kuvert header in
your email, <br>
and finally the default action given in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. First kuvert looks for action
directives in your configuration file. Such directives are
given as action plus regular expression to be matched
against an address, and the <br>
first matching directive is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If no matching directive is
found, the default action given in the configuration file is
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Kuvert now checks for the
presence of an X-Kuvert header: its content must be an
action keyword, which is applied to all recipients of this
email except the ones whose action <br>
at this stage is &quot;none&quot;. (In other words: if you
specify &quot;no encryption/signing&quot; for some
addresses, then this cannot be overridden in a blanket
fashion.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Kuvert then analyzes each
recipient email address. If an address has the format <br>
Some Text &quot;action=someaction&quot;
&lt;user@some.host&gt;&quot;, kuvert strips the quoted part
and overrides the addressee&rsquo;s action with
someaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Finally kuvert checks if any
recipient has action &quot;fallback-all&quot;. If so,
kuvert</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) checks if any recipients
(except Bcc&rsquo;d) have action &quot;signonly&quot; or
&quot;none&quot;. If this is the case, all
&quot;fallback&quot; and &quot;fallback-all&quot; actions
are downgraded to &quot;signonly&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b) checks if keys for all
recipients (except Bcc&rsquo;d) are available. If not, all
&quot;fallback&quot; and &quot;fallback-all&quot; actions
are downgraded to &quot;signonly&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Recipients which are given in
a Bcc: header are always treated independently and
separately from all others: any &quot;fallback-all&quot;
action is downgraded to &quot;fallback&quot; for Bcc&rsquo;d
<br>
addresses, and if encryption is used, the email is encrypted
separately so that no record of the Bcc&rsquo;d recipient is
visible in the email as sent out to the &quot;normal&quot;
<br>
recipients. Also, any Bcc: header is removed before sending
an email onwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Selection <br>
Kuvert depends on the order of keys in your keyring to
determine which key (of potentially many) with a given
address should be used for encryption. By default kuvert
uses the <br>
last key that it encounters for a given address. For people
who have multiple keys for a single address this can cause
problems, and therefore kuvert has override mechanisms for
<br>
encryption key selection: You can specify a key to encrypt
to for an address in the configuration file (see below), or
you can override the key selection for and within a single
<br>
mail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the recipient address is
given in the format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some Name &quot;key=keyid&quot;
&lt;user@some.host&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kuvert will strip the
double-quoted part and use this particular key for this
recipient and for this single email. The keyid must be given
as the hex key identifier. This <br>
mechanism overrides whatever associations your keyring
contains and should be used with caution. Note that both key
and action overrides can be given concurrently as a single
<br>
comma-separated entry like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some Name
&quot;action=fallback,key=0x12345&quot;
&lt;user@some.host&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The signing key can be
overridden in a similar fashion: if the From address
contains a &quot;key=keyid&quot; stanza, kuvert will use
this key for signing this single email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The kuvert configuration file is plain text, blank lines and
lines that start with &quot;#&quot; are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration has of two
categories: options and address/action specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address and Action <br>
Address+action specifications are given one per line. Such
lines must start with some whitespace, followed by an
address regexp, followed by some whitespace and the action
<br>
keyword. For actions &quot;fallback&quot; and
&quot;fallback-all&quot; kuvert also allows you to specify a
single key identifier like this:
&quot;fallback,0x42BD645D&quot;. The remainder of the line
is <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The address regexp is a full
Perl regular expression and will be applied to the raw SMTP
address (i.e. not to the comment or name in the email
address), case-insensitively. The <br>
regular expression may need to be anchored with ^ and $;
kuvert does not do that for you. You must give just the core
of the regexp (no m// or //), like in this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># don&rsquo;t confuse mailing
list robots <br>
^.*-request@.*$ none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action keyword must be one
of &quot;none&quot;, &quot;signonly&quot;,
&quot;fallback&quot; or &quot;fallback-all&quot;; see
section &quot;How Kuvert Decides What (Not) To Do&quot; for
semantics. Order of action <br>
specifications in the config file is significant: the search
terminates on first match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
Options are given one per line, and option lines must start
with the option name followed by some whitespace. All
options are case-sensitive. Depending on the option content,
<br>
some or all of the remainder of the option line will be
assigned as option value. Inline comments are not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following list of options
angle brackets denote required arguments like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaultkey &lt;hexkeyid&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options that have boolean
arguments recognize &quot;1&quot;, &quot;on&quot; and
&quot;t&quot; as true and &quot;0&quot;, &quot;off&quot;,
&quot;f&quot; as false (plus their upper-case versions).
Other options have more restricted <br>
argument types; kuvert generally sanity-checks options at
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Options <br>
syslog &lt;syslog facility or blank&gt; <br>
Whether kuvert should use syslog for logging, and if so,
what facility to use. Default: nothing. This is independent
of the logfile option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logfile &lt;path or blank&gt;
<br>
Whether kuvert should write log messages to a file,
appending to it. Default: not set. This is independent of
the syslog option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail-on-error &lt;email address
or blank&gt; <br>
If kuvert encounters serious or fatal errors, an email is
sent back to this address if set. Default: undef. This email
is sent in addition to the normal logging via syslog or <br>
logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">queuedir &lt;path&gt; <br>
Where kuvert and its helper programs store mails to be
processed. Default: ~/.kuvert_queue. The directory is
created if necessary. The directory must be owned by the
user <br>
running kuvert and have mode 0700.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tempdir &lt;path&gt; <br>
Where kuvert stores temporary files. Default: a directory
called kuvert.&lt;username&gt;.&lt;pid&gt; in $TMPDIR or
/tmp. The directory is created if necessary, and must be
owned by the <br>
user running kuvert and have mode 0700. This directory is
completely emptied after processing an email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">identify &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Whether kuvert should add an X-Mailer header to outbound
emails. Default: false. The X-Mailer header consists of the
program name and version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preamble &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Whether kuvert should include an explanatory preamble in the
generated MIME mail. Default: true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interval &lt;number&gt; <br>
This sets the queue checking interval in seconds. Default:
60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msserver
&lt;hostname-or-address&gt; <br>
Mail Submission Server for outbound email. Default: unset.
If this is set, kuvert will use SMTP to send outbound
emails. If not set, kuvert uses the mail submission program
<br>
on the local machine. See msp below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msport &lt;portnumber&gt; <br>
The TCP port on which the Mail Submission Server listens.
Default: 587. Ignored if msserver is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl &lt;string&gt; <br>
Whether SSL or STARTTLS are to be used for outbound SMTP
submission. The value must be either &quot;starttls&quot; to
use STARTTLS or &quot;ssl&quot; for raw SSL. SSL encryption
is not used if <br>
this option is unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl-cert &lt;client cert
path.pem&gt; <br>
ssl-key &lt;client key path.pem&gt; <br>
ssl-ca &lt;ca cert path.pem&gt; <br>
If an SSL client certificate is to be presented to the SMTP
server, set both ssl-cert and ssl-key. If your system-wide
CA certificate setup doesn&rsquo;t include the certificate
<br>
your SMTP server uses, set ssl-ca to point to a PEM file
containing all the relevant CA certificates. All these are
ignored if the ssl option isn&rsquo;t set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msuser &lt;username&gt; <br>
The username to use for SMTP authentication at the Mail
Submission Server. SMTP Auth is not attempted if msuser
isn&rsquo;t set. Ignored if msserver is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mspass &lt;password&gt; <br>
The password for SMTP authentication. Ignored if msserver or
msuser are not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mspass-from-query-secret
&lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Whether the mspass should be retrieved using the
query-secret program instead of giving the mspass in the
config file. Ignored if msserver or msuser are not set. If
this <br>
option is set, the query-secret program will be used to ask
for the &quot;smtp-password&quot; when the first mail is
processed. The password will be cached if authentication
succeeds <br>
or you will be asked again, until authentication
succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msp &lt;program-path and
args&gt; <br>
Defines the program kuvert should use to deliver email.
Default: &quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail -om -oi -oem&quot;. This
is ignored if msserver is set. The argument must include the
full <br>
path to the program, and the program must accept the common
mail transfer agent arguments as defined in the Linux
Standards Base (see <br>

&lt;http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_2.0.0/LSB-Core/LSB-Core.html#BASELIB-SENDMAIL-1&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can-detach &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Indicates to kuvert that it can background itself on
startup, detaching from the terminal. Default: false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detaching works only if your
chosen mechanism for passphrase entry doesn&rsquo;t require
interaction via the original terminal. This is the case if
you delegate passphrase handling <br>
to gpg-agent and configure it for X11 pinentry, or if your
secret-query program is an X11 program with its own
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maport &lt;portnumber&gt; <br>
Kuvert can accept email for processing via SMTP. This option
sets the TCP port kuvert listens on (localhost only).
Default: 2587. Ignored if ma-user and ma-pass are not both
<br>
set. If you want to use this mechanism, tell your mail
program to use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as outgoing mail
server and enable SMTP Authentication (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ma-user &lt;username&gt; <br>
This option sets the required SMTP authentication username
for accepting mails via SMTP. Default: undef. Kuvert does
not listen for SMTP submissions unless both ma-user and <br>
ma-pass are set. Kuvert does not accept emails for
processing via SMTP unless you prove your identity with SMTP
Authentication (or anybody on your local machine could use
<br>
kuvert to send emails signed by you!). Kuvert currently
supports only AUTH PLAIN and LOGIN (which is not a major
problem as we listen on the loopback interface only). This
<br>
option sets the username kuvert recognizes as yours. This
can be anything and doesn&rsquo;t have to be a real account
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ma-pass &lt;password&gt; <br>
This option sets the password your mail user agent must use
for SMTP Authentication if submitting mails via SMTP.
Default: unset. Kuvert does not listen for SMTP submissions
<br>
unless both ma-user and ma-pass are set. This password does
not have to be (actually shouldn&rsquo;t be) your real
account&rsquo;s password. Note that using SMTP submission
requires that <br>
you protect your kuvert configuration file with strict
permissions (0600 is suggested).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaultkey &lt;hexkeyid&gt; <br>
Specifies a default key to use as signing key. Default:
unset, which means GnuPG gets to choose (usually the first
available secret key). Can be overridden in the From: <br>
address, see section &quot;Key Selection&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaultaction &lt;action&gt;
<br>
Which action is to be taken if no overrides are found for a
recipient. Default: none. See section &quot;How Kuvert
Decides What (Not) To Do&quot; for recognized actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alwaystrust &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Whether gpg should be told to trust all keys for encryption
or not. Default: false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use-agent &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Whether kuvert should delegate all passphrase handling to
the gpg-agent and call gpg with appropriate options.
Default: false. If not set, kuvert will ask the user (or
some <br>
nominated passphrase store) for passphrases on demand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">query-secret &lt;program-path
and args with %s&gt; <br>
Tells kuvert which program to use for passphrase retrieval.
Default: &quot;/bin/sh -c &rsquo;stty -echo; read -p <br>
set. Kuvert does not store passphrases internally but rather
runs the indicated program in a pipeline with gpg when
signing. If you use a passphrase store (like the Linux- <br>
kernel keyutils or secret-agent or the like), enter your
retrieval program here. The program is run with
kuvert&rsquo;s environment, the first %s in the argument
spec is replaced <br>
with the hex keyid and the passphrase is expected on stdout.
The exit code is ignored. If can-detach is not set, the
program has access to kuvert&rsquo;s terminal. Note that the
<br>
default query program prohibits kuvert from backgrounding
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush-secret &lt;program-path
and args with %s&gt; <br>
This program is called to invalidate an external passphrase
cache if kuvert is notified by gpg of the passphrase being
invalid. Default: undef. Ignored if use-agent is set. <br>
The program is run with kuvert&rsquo;s environment and with
the first %s of its argument spec being replaced by the hex
keyid in question. Its exit code is ignored. If can-detach
<br>
is not set, the program has access to kuvert&rsquo;s
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Kuvert usually logs informational messages to syslog and/or
its own logfile, both of which can be disabled and
adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If kuvert detects a fault that
makes successful processing of a particular email
impossible, kuvert will report that on STDERR (if not
detached) and also email an error report if <br>
the option mail-on-error is enabled. Such partially or
completely unprocessed mails are left in the queue but are
renamed (the name is prefixed with &quot;failed.&quot;); it
is up to you <br>
to either remove such leftovers or rename them to something
all-numeric once the problem has been resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour is similar if
fatal problems are encountered; after alerting kuvert will
terminate with exit code 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT AND SIGNALS <br>
Kuvert itself uses only on environment variable: $TMPDIR
provides the fallback location for kuvert&rsquo;s temporary
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kuvert passes its complete
environment to child processes, namely gpg and any
passphrase-query programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On reception of SIGUSR1, kuvert
reloads its configuration file and keyring. Any one of
SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM causes kuvert to
terminate cleanly, invalidating the <br>
passphrases if a query program is used. All other signals
are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.kuvert <br>
The configuration file read by kuvert and kuvert_submit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.kuvert_queue <br>
The default queue directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/kuvert.pid.&lt;uid&gt; <br>
holds the pid of a running kuvert daemon.</p>
