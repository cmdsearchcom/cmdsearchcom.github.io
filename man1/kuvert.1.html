kuvert - Automatically sign and/or encrypt emails based on the recipients
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
kuvert [-d] [-o] [-r|-k]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Kuvert is a tool to protect the integrity and secrecy of your outgoing email
  independent of your mail client and with minimal user interaction.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It reads mails from its queue (or accepts SMTP submissions), analyzes the
  recipients and decides to whom it should encrypt and/or sign the mail. The
  resulting mail is coerced into the PGP-MIME framework defined in RFC3156 and
  finally sent to your outbound mail server. Kuvert uses GnuPG for all
  cryptographic tasks and is designed to interface cleanly with external secret
  caching tools.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
After startup kuvert periodically scans its queue directory and processes mails
  from there; depending on your GnuPG passphrase setup kuvert may daemonize
  itself. In either case, kuvert runs forever until actively terminated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Kuvert's behaviour is configured primarily using a configuration file, with
  exception of the following commandline options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-d</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables debugging mode: extra debugging information is
      written to STDERR. (This is independent of normal logging.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables one-shot mode: kuvert does not loop forever but
      processes only the current queue contents and then exits. Kuvert does also
      not start an SMTP listener in this mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-r</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells a running kuvert daemon to reload the configuration
      file and the gpg keyring. This is equivalent to sending a SIGUSR1 to the
      respective process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-k</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells a running kuvert daemon to terminate cleanly. This is
      equivalent to sending a SIGTERM to the respective process.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#OPERATION">OPERATION</a></h1>
At startup kuvert reads its configuration file and your gnugp keyring and
  remembers the association of email addresses to keys.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Kuvert then works as a wrapper around your mail transfer agent (MTA): you author
  your emails like always but instead of sending them out directly you submit
  them to kuvert.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Periodically kuvert scans its queue and processes any email therein. If your
  keyring contains a key for a recipient, kuvert will encrypt and sign the email
  to that recipient. If no key is available, kuvert will only
  (clear/detached-)sign the email. Subsequently, the email is sent onwards using
  your MTA program or SMTP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Emails to be processed can have any valid MIME structure; kuvert unpacks the
  MIME structure losslessly and repacks the (encrypted/signed) mail into a
  PGP/MIME object as described in RFC3156. The mail's structure is preserved.
  Signature and encryption cover all of the mail content with the exception of
  the top-level headers: for example the &quot;Subject&quot; header will be
  passed in clear, whereas any body or attached MIME object will be
  signed/encrypted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The encrypt-or-sign decision can be overridden on a per-address basis using the
  configuration file or, even more fine-grainedly, by using directives in the
  actual email. Kuvert can also be told not to modify an email at all.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Submitting_Emails_to_Kuvert"><a class="selflink" href="#Submitting_Emails_to_Kuvert">Submitting
  Emails to Kuvert</a></h2>
Kuvert primarily relies on mails being dumped into its queue directory. Kuvert
  operates on files with numeric file names only. Anything that you store in its
  queue directory with such a filename will be treated as containing a single
  RFC2822-formatted email.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, no mainstream MUA supports such a drop-your-files-somewhere scheme, and
  therefore kuvert comes with a helper program called kuvert_submit (see
  <i>kuvert_submit</i>(1)) which mimics sendmail's mail submission behaviour but
  feeds to the kuvert queue. If your MUA can be instructed to run a program for
  mail submission, kuvert_submit can be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, you can send your email to kuvert via SMTP. Kuvert comes with a
  built-in receive-only mail server, which feeds to the queue directory. As
  allowing others to submit emails for your signature would be silly and
  dangerous, kuvert's mail server only listens on the localhost IP address and
  requires that your MUA uses SMTP Authentication to ensure that only your
  submissions are accepted. If your MUA supports SMTP AUTH PLAIN or LOGIN and
  can be told to use localhost and a specific port for outbound email, then you
  can use this mechanism.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Transporting_Emails_Onwards"><a class="selflink" href="#Transporting_Emails_Onwards">Transporting
  Emails Onwards</a></h2>
Kuvert can send outbound emails either by running a local MTA program or by
  speaking SMTP to some (fixed) outbound mail server of your choice.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Recipients,_Identities_and_the_SMTP_Envelope"><a class="selflink" href="#Recipients,_Identities_and_the_SMTP_Envelope">Recipients,
  Identities and the SMTP Envelope</a></h2>
In general kuvert identifies recipients using the To, Cc, Bcc and Resent-To
  headers of the queued email. If the mechanism you used to submit the mail to
  kuvert did explicitely set recipients, then these <b>override</b> the headers
  within the email.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the case if kuvert_submit is called with a list of recipients and no -t
  option and for SMTP submission.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If kuvert enqueues email via inbound SMTP, the SMTP envelope <b>overrides</b>
  the email headers: recipients that are present in the envelope but not the
  headers are treated as Bcc'd, and recipients listed in the headers but not the
  envelope are <b>ignored</b>. Any Resent-To header is ignored for
  SMTP-submitted email.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only if no overriding recipients are given, kuvert checks the mail for a
  Resent-To header. If present, the email is sent out immediately to the
  Resent-To addresses <i>without further processing</i>. (This is the standard
  &quot;bounce&quot; behaviour for MUAs that don't pass recipients on to an
  MSP/MTA directly.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
When sending outbound email, kuvert usually uses the From header from the queued
  email as identity. If the email was queued via SMTP, the envelope again
  <b>overrides</b> the mail headers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that kuvert sets the envelope sender using &quot;-f&quot; if sending email
  via a local MTA program; if you are not sufficiently trusted by your MTA to do
  such, your mail may get an X-Authentication-Warning header tacked on that
  indicates your username and the fact that the envelope was set explicitely.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Passphrase_Handling"><a class="selflink" href="#Passphrase_Handling">Passphrase
  Handling</a></h2>
Kuvert does not handle your precious keys' passphrases. You can either elect to
  use gpg-agent as an (on-demand or caching) passphrase store, or you can tell
  kuvert what program it should run to query for a passphrase when required.
  Such a query program will be run in a pipeline to GnuPG, and kuvert will not
  access, store or cache the passphrases themselves: there are better options
  available for secret caching, for example the Linux in-kernel keystorage (
  <i>keyctl</i>(1)).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_Kuvert_Decides_What_(Not)_To_Do"><a class="selflink" href="#How_Kuvert_Decides_What_(Not)_To_Do">How
  Kuvert Decides What (Not) To Do</a></h2>
For each recipient, kuvert can be told to apply one of four different actions:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">none</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The email is sent as-is (except for configuration directive
      removal).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">signonly</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The email is (clear/detached-) signed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fallback</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The email is encrypted and signed if there is a key
      available for this recipient or only signed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fallback-all</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The email is encrypted and signed if keys are available for
      <b>all</b> recipients, or only signed otherwise. Recipients whose action
      is set to &quot;none&quot; and Bcc'd recipients are not affected by this
      action.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The fallback-all action is an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; action as far as
      encryption is concerned and ensures that no mix of encrypted or
      unencrypted versions of this email are sent out: if we can we use
      encryption for everybody, or otherwise everybody gets it signed (or even
      unsigned). (Bcc'd recipients are the exception.)</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Specifying_Actions"><a class="selflink" href="#Specifying_Actions">Specifying
  Actions</a></h2>
Kuvert uses four sources for action specifications: directives in the individual
  email addresses, action directives in the configuration file, an X-Kuvert
  header in your email, and finally the default action given in the
  configuration file.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">First kuvert looks for action directives in your
      configuration file. Such directives are given as action plus regular
      expression to be matched against an address, and the first matching
      directive is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If no matching directive is found, the default action given
      in the configuration file is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Kuvert now checks for the presence of an X-Kuvert header:
      its content must be an action keyword, which is applied to all recipients
      of this email except the ones whose action at this stage is
      &quot;none&quot;. (In other words: if you specify &quot;no
      encryption/signing&quot; for some addresses, then this cannot be
      overridden in a blanket fashion.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      separately so that no record of the Bcc'd recipient is visible in the

      header is removed before sending an email onwards.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Key_Selection"><a class="selflink" href="#Key_Selection">Key
  Selection</a></h2>
Kuvert depends on the order of keys in your keyring to determine which key (of
  potentially many) with a given address should be used for encryption. By
  default kuvert uses the <b>last</b> key that it encounters for a given
  address. For people who have multiple keys for a single address this can cause
  problems, and therefore kuvert has override mechanisms for encryption key
  selection: You can specify a key to encrypt to for an address in the
  configuration file (see below), or you can override the key selection for and
  within a single mail:
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the recipient address is given in the format
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 Some Name &quot;key=keyid&quot; &lt;user@some.host&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Kuvert will strip the double-quoted part and use this particular key for this
  recipient and for this single email. The keyid must be given as the hex key
  identifier. This mechanism overrides whatever associations your keyring
  contains and should be used with caution. Note that both key and action
  overrides can be given concurrently as a single comma-separated entry like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 Some Name &quot;action=fallback,key=0x12345&quot; &lt;user@some.host&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The signing key can be overridden in a similar fashion: if the From address
  contains a &quot;key= <b>keyid</b>&quot; stanza, kuvert will use this key for
  signing this single email.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The kuvert configuration file is plain text, blank lines and lines that start
  with &quot;#&quot; are ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration has of two categories: options and address/action
  specifications.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Address_and_Action"><a class="selflink" href="#Address_and_Action">Address
  and Action</a></h2>
Address+action specifications are given one per line. Such lines must start with
  some whitespace, followed by an address regexp, followed by some whitespace
  and the action keyword. For actions &quot;fallback&quot; and
  &quot;fallback-all&quot; kuvert also allows you to specify a single key
  identifier like this: &quot;fallback,0x42BD645D&quot;. The remainder of the
  line is ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The address regexp is a full Perl regular expression and will be applied to the
  raw SMTP address (i.e. not to the comment or name in the email address),
  case-insensitively. The regular expression may need to be anchored with ^ and
  $; kuvert does not do that for you. You must give just the core of the regexp
  (no m// or //), like in this example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 # don't confuse mailing list robots
 ^.*-request@.*$        none
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The action keyword must be one of &quot;none&quot;, &quot;signonly&quot;,
  &quot;fallback&quot; or &quot;fallback-all&quot;; see section &quot;How Kuvert
  Decides What (Not) To Do&quot; for semantics. Order of action specifications
  in the config file is significant: the search terminates on first match.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Options">Options</a></h2>
Options are given one per line, and option lines must start with the option name
  followed by some whitespace. All options are case-sensitive. Depending on the
  option content, some or all of the remainder of the option line will be
  assigned as option value. Inline comments are not supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the following list of options angle brackets denote required arguments like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 defaultkey &lt;hexkeyid&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options that have boolean arguments recognize &quot;1&quot;, &quot;on&quot; and
  &quot;t&quot; as true and &quot;0&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, &quot;f&quot; as
  false (plus their upper-case versions). Other options have more restricted
  argument types; kuvert generally sanity-checks options at startup.

  <dd class="It-tag">Whether kuvert should delegate all passphrase handling to

      Default: &quot;/bin/sh -c 'stty -echo; read -p \&quot;Passphrase %s:
      \&quot; X; \ stty echo; echo $X'&quot; Ignored if use-agent is set. Kuvert
      does not store passphrases internally but rather runs the indicated
      program in a pipeline with gpg when signing. If you use a passphrase store
      (like the Linux-kernel keyutils or secret-agent or the like), enter your
      retrieval program here. The program is run with kuvert's environment, the
      first %s in the argument spec is replaced with the hex keyid and the
      passphrase is expected on stdout. The exit code is ignored. If can-detach
      is not set, the program has access to kuvert's terminal. Note that the
      default query program prohibits kuvert from backgrounding itself.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">This program is called to invalidate an external passphrase

      Default: undef. Ignored if use-agent is set. The program is run with
      kuvert's environment and with the first %s of its argument spec being
      replaced by the hex keyid in question. Its exit code is ignored. If
      can-detach is not set, the program has access to kuvert's terminal.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
Kuvert usually logs informational messages to syslog and/or its own logfile,
  both of which can be disabled and adjusted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If kuvert detects a fault that makes successful processing of a particular email
  impossible, kuvert will report that on STDERR (if not detached) and also email
  an error report if the option mail-on-error is enabled. Such partially or
  completely unprocessed mails are left in the queue but are renamed (the name
  is prefixed with &quot;failed.&quot;); it is up to you to either remove such
  leftovers or rename them to something all-numeric once the problem has been
  resolved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The behaviour is similar if fatal problems are encountered; after alerting
  kuvert will terminate with exit code 1.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_AND_SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_AND_SIGNALS">ENVIRONMENT
  AND SIGNALS</a></h1>
Kuvert itself uses only on environment variable: $TMPDIR provides the fallback
  location for kuvert's temporary directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Kuvert passes its complete environment to child processes, namely gpg and any
  passphrase-query programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On reception of SIGUSR1, kuvert reloads its configuration file and keyring. Any
  one of SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM causes kuvert to terminate cleanly,
  invalidating the passphrases if a query program is used. All other signals are
  ignored.
