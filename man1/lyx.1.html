<p>LYX(1) LyX 2.2.2 LYX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
LyX - A Document Processor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lyx [ command-line switches ] [ name[.lyx] ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
LyX is too complex to be described completely in the
&quot;man&quot; page format. If your system is properly
configured, you can access the full documentation within LyX
under the Help <br>
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LyX is a document preparation
system. It excels at letting you create complex technical
and scientific articles with mathematics, cross-references,
bibliographies, indices, etc. <br>
It is very good at documents of any length in which the
usual processing abilities are required: automatic
sectioning and pagination, spellchecking, and so forth. It
can also be <br>
used to write a letter to your mom, though granted, there
are probably simpler programs available for that. It is
definitely not the best tool for creating banners, flyers,
or <br>
advertisements, though with some effort all these can be
done, too. Some examples of what it is used for: memos,
letters, dissertations and theses, lecture notes, seminar
note&acirc; <br>
books, conference proceedings, software documentation, books
(on PostgreSQL, remote sensing, cryptology, fictional
novels, poetry, and even a children&rsquo;s book or two),
articles in <br>
refereed scientific journals, scripts for plays and movies,
business proposals... you get the idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, LyX uses the Qt4
library as a toolkit. LyX should run everywhere, where this
library runs. This is on all major Unix platforms as well as
Windows and Mac OS X (which <br>
actually is a unix platform).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
LyX supports the following command-line switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help summarizes LyX usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
provides version information on the build of LyX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sysdir directory <br>
sets system directory. Normally not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-userdir directory <br>
sets user directory. Needed if you want to use LyX with
different lyxrc settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry WxH+X+Y <br>
set geometry of the main window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dbg feature[,feature...] <br>
where feature is a name or number. Use &quot;lyx -dbg&quot;
to see the list of available debug features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x [--execute] command <br>
where command is a lyx command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e [--export] fmt <br>
where fmt is the export format of choice (latex, pdflatex,
luatex, xetex, xhtml, text, lyx, ps, pdf, ...). Note that
the order of -e and -x switches matters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E [--export-to] fmt filename
<br>
where fmt is the export format of choice (see --export), and
filename is the destination filename. Note that any
additional external file needed by filename (such as image
<br>
files) will be exported as well to the folder containing
filename (preserving the relative path embedded within the
original LyX document, if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i [--import] fmt file.xxx <br>
where fmt is the import format of choice and file.xxx is the
file to be imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f [--force-overwrite] what <br>
where what is is either &quot;all&quot;, &quot;main&quot; or
&quot;none&quot;. Specify &quot;all&quot; to allow
overwriting all files during a batch export,
&quot;main&quot; to allow overwriting the main file only, or
<br>
&quot;none&quot; to disallow overwriting any file. When this
switch is followed by anything else other than
&quot;all&quot;, &quot;main&quot; or &quot;none&quot;, the
behavior is as if &quot;all&quot; was specified, but <br>
what follows is left on the command line for further
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n [--no-remote] <br>
open documents passed as arguments in a new instance, even
if another instance of LyX is already running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r [--remote] <br>
by using the lyxpipe, ask an already running instance of LyX
to open the documents passed as arguments and then exit. If
the lyxpipe is not set up or is not working, a new <br>
instance is created and execution continues normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-batch <br>
causes LyX to run the given commands without opening a GUI
window. Thus, something like: <br>
lyx -batch -x &quot;buffer-print printer default dvips&quot;
myfile.lyx <br>
will cause LyX to print myfile.lyx to the default printer,
using dvips and the default print settings (which, of
course, have to have been configured already).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LYX_DIR_22x <br>
can be used to specify which system directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system directory is
determined by searching for the file
&quot;chkconfig.ltx&quot;. Directories are searched in this
order: <br>
1) -sysdir command line parameter <br>
2) LYX_DIR_22x environment variable <br>
3) Maybe &lt;path of binary&gt;/TOP_SRCDIR/lib <br>
4) &lt;path of binary&gt;/../share/&lt;name of binary&gt;/
<br>
5) hardcoded lyx_dir (at build time: /usr/share/lyx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LYX_USERDIR_22x <br>
can be used to specify which user directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user directory is, in order
of precedence: <br>
1) -userdir command line parameter <br>
2) LYX_USERDIR_22x environment variable <br>
3) $HOME/.&lt;name of binary&gt; if no explicit setting is
made</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LYX_LOCALEDIR <br>
can be used to tell LyX where to look for the translations
of its GUI strings in other languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LYX_FORCE_OVERWRITE <br>
can be used to change the default behavior when exporting
from command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, LyX overwrites the
main file when exporting from command line but not the
ancillary files. This behavior can be changed by setting
this environment variable, which <br>
relieves the need of using the -f switch. Allowed values are
either &quot;all&quot;, &quot;main&quot; or
&quot;none&quot;, with same meaning as for the -f
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.lyx/preferences Personal configuration file <br>
~/.lyx/lyxrc.defaults Personal autodetected configuration
file <br>

tex2lyx(1), latex(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full documentation in either
native LyX or postscript format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS/LIMITATIONS <br>
There are still some bugs in LyX. To report one, read if
possible the Introduction found under the Help menu in LyX.
You&rsquo;ll find detailed info on submitting bug reports
there. If <br>
you can&rsquo;t do that, send details to the LyX Developers
mailing list lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org, or use the LyX bug
tracker at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.
Don&rsquo;t for&acirc; <br>
get to mention which version you are having problems
with!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LaTeX import is still not
perfect and may produce buggy *.lyx files. Consult the
tex2lyx documentation.</p>
