<p>GIT-MERGE(1) Git Manual GIT-MERGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-merge - Join two or more development histories
together</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git merge [-n] [--stat] [--no-commit] [--squash]
[--[no-]edit] <br>
[-s &lt;strategy&gt;] [-X &lt;strategy-option&gt;] <br>
[--[no-]rerere-autoupdate] [-m &lt;msg&gt;]
[&lt;commit&gt;...] <br>
git merge &lt;msg&gt; HEAD &lt;commit&gt;... <br>
git merge --abort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time
their histories diverged from the current branch) into the
current branch. This command is used by git pull to <br>
incorporate changes from another repository and can be used
by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assume the following history
exists and the current branch is &quot;master&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B---C topic <br>
/ <br>
D---E---F---G master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then &quot;git merge topic&quot;
will replay the changes made on the topic branch since it
diverged from master (i.e., E) until its current commit (C)
on top of master, and record the <br>
result in a new commit along with the names of the two
parent commits and a log message from the user describing
the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B---C topic <br>
/ D---E---F---G---H master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second syntax (&lt;msg&gt;
HEAD &lt;commit&gt;...) is supported for historical reasons.
Do not use it from the command line or in new scripts. It is
the same as git merge -m &lt;msg&gt; <br>
&lt;commit&gt;....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third syntax (&quot;git
merge --abort&quot;) can only be run after the merge has
resulted in conflicts. git merge --abort will abort the
merge process and try to reconstruct the <br>
pre-merge state. However, if there were uncommitted changes
when the merge started (and especially if those changes were
further modified after the merge was started), git merge
<br>
--abort will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the
original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Running git merge with
uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it
leaves you in a state that is hard to back out of in the
case of a conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--commit, --no-commit <br>
Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be
used to override --no-commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --no-commit perform the
merge but pretend the merge failed and do not autocommit, to
give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the
merge result before <br>
committing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edit, --no-edit <br>
Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical
merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so
that the user can explain and justify the merge. The <br>
--no-edit option can be used to accept the auto-generated
message (this is generally discouraged). The --edit option
is still useful if you are giving a draft message with <br>
the -m option from the command line and want to edit it in
the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Older scripts may depend on the
historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the
merge log message. They will see an editor opened when they
run git merge. To make <br>
it easier to adjust such scripts to the updated behaviour,
the environment variable GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT can be set to no
at the beginning of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ff <br>
When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the
branch pointer, without creating a merge commit. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ff <br>
Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a
fast-forward. This is the default behaviour when merging an
annotated (and possibly signed) tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ff-only <br>
Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the
current HEAD is already up-to-date or the merge can be
resolved as a fast-forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log <br>
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits
that are being merged. See also git-fmt-merge-msg(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --no-log do not list
one-line descriptions from the actual commits being
merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat, -n, --no-stat <br>
Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is
also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -n or --no-stat do not show
a diffstat at the end of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--squash, --no-squash <br>
Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
happened (except for the merge information), but do not
actually make a commit or move the HEAD, nor record <br>
$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD to cause the next git commit command to
create a merge commit. This allows you to create a single
commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the <br>
same as merging another branch (or more in case of an
octopus).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --no-squash perform the
merge and commit the result. This option can be used to
override --squash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;strategy&gt;,
--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt; <br>
Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once
to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there
is no -s option, a built-in list of strategies is <br>
used instead (git merge-recursive when merging a single
head, git merge-octopus otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X &lt;option&gt;,
--strategy-option=&lt;option&gt; <br>
Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify-signatures,
--no-verify-signatures <br>
Verify that the commits being merged have good and trusted
GPG signatures and abort the merge in case they do not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary, --no-summary <br>
Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and
will be removed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress, --no-progress <br>
Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
progress is shown if standard error is connected to a
terminal. Note that not all merge strategies may support
<br>
progress reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;msg&gt; <br>
Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in
case one is created).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --log is specified, a
shortlog of the commits being merged will be appended to the
specified message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The git fmt-merge-msg command
can be used to give a good default for automated git merge
invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]rerere-autoupdate <br>
Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the
result of auto-conflict resolution if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort <br>
Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to
reconstruct the pre-merge state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there were uncommitted
worktree changes present when the merge started, git merge
--abort will in some cases be unable to reconstruct these
changes. It is therefore <br>
recommended to always commit or stash your changes before
running git merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git merge --abort is equivalent
to git reset --merge when MERGE_HEAD is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;commit&gt;... <br>
Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our
branch. Specifying more than one commit will create a merge
with more than two parents (affectionately called an <br>
Octopus merge).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no commit is given from the
command line, and if merge.defaultToUpstream configuration
variable is set, merge the remote-tracking branches that the
current branch is <br>
configured to use as its upstream. See also the
configuration section of this manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRE-MERGE CHECKS <br>
Before applying outside changes, you should get your own
work in good shape and committed locally, so it will not be
clobbered if there are conflicts. See also git-stash(1). git
<br>
pull and git merge will stop without doing anything when
local uncommitted changes overlap with files that git
pull/git merge may need to update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid recording unrelated
changes in the merge commit, git pull and git merge will
also abort if there are any changes registered in the index
relative to the HEAD commit. <br>
(One exception is when the changed index entries are in the
state that would result from the merge already.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all named commits are already
ancestors of HEAD, git merge will exit early with the
message &quot;Already up-to-date.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAST-FORWARD MERGE <br>
Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named
commit. This is the most common case especially when invoked
from git pull: you are tracking an upstream repository, you
<br>
have committed no local changes, and now you want to update
to a newer upstream revision. In this case, a new commit is
not needed to store the combined history; instead, the <br>
HEAD (along with the index) is updated to point at the named
commit, without creating an extra merge commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior can be suppressed
with the --no-ff option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRUE MERGE <br>
Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to
be merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has
both of them as its parents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A merged version reconciling the
changes from all branches to be merged is committed, and
your HEAD, index, and working tree are updated to it. It is
possible to have <br>
modifications in the working tree as long as they do not
overlap; the update will preserve them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it is not obvious how to
reconcile the changes, the following happens:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The HEAD pointer stays the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The MERGE_HEAD ref is set to
point to the other branch head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Paths that merged cleanly are
updated both in the index file and in your working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. For conflicting paths, the
index file records up to three versions: stage 1 stores the
version from the common ancestor, stage 2 from HEAD, and
stage 3 from MERGE_HEAD (you <br>
can inspect the stages with git ls-files -u). The working
tree files contain the result of the &quot;merge&quot;
program; i.e. 3-way merge results with familiar conflict
markers <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt;&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. No other changes are made. In
particular, the local modifications you had before you
started merge will stay the same and the index entries for
them stay as they were, i.e. <br>
matching HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you tried a merge which
resulted in complex conflicts and want to start over, you
can recover with git merge --abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERGING TAG <br>
When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git
always creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge
is possible, and the commit message template is prepared
with <br>
the tag message. Additionally, if the tag is signed, the
signature check is reported as a comment in the message
template. See also git-tag(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you want to just integrate
with the work leading to the commit that happens to be
tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream release point,
you may not want to make an <br>
unnecessary merge commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In such a case, you can
&quot;unwrap&quot; the tag yourself before feeding it to git
merge, or pass --ff-only when you do not have any work on
your own. e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--- git fetch origin git merge
v1.2.3^0 git merge --ff-only v1.2.3 ---</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED <br>
During a merge, the working tree files are updated to
reflect the result of the merge. Among the changes made to
the common ancestor&acirc;s version, non-overlapping ones
(that is, you <br>
changed an area of the file while the other side left that
area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the final
result verbatim. When both sides made changes to the same
<br>
area, however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the
other, and asks you to resolve it by leaving what both sides
did to that area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, Git uses the same
style as the one used by the &quot;merge&quot; program from
the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are lines that are either
unchanged from the common <br>
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt <br>
Conflict resolution is hard; <br>
let&rsquo;s go shopping. <br>
======= <br>
Git makes conflict resolution easy. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt <br>
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or
unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The area where a pair of
conflicting changes happened is marked with markers
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. The part before the ======= is
typically your side, and the part <br>
afterwards is typically their side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format does not show
what the original said in the conflicting area. You cannot
tell how many lines are deleted and replaced with
Barbie&acirc;s remark on your side. The <br>
only thing you can tell is that your side wants to say it is
hard and you&acirc;d prefer to go shopping, while the other
side wants to claim it is easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative style can be used
by setting the &quot;merge.conflictstyle&quot; configuration
variable to &quot;diff3&quot;. In &quot;diff3&quot; style,
the above conflict may look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are lines that are either
unchanged from the common <br>
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt <br>
Conflict resolution is hard; <br>
let&rsquo;s go shopping. <br>
||||||| <br>
Conflict resolution is hard. <br>
======= <br>
Git makes conflict resolution easy. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt <br>
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or
unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; markers, it uses another
||||||| marker that is followed by the original text. You
can tell that the original just stated a fact, <br>
and your side simply gave in to that statement and gave up,
while the other side tried to have a more positive attitude.
You can sometimes come up with a better resolution by <br>
viewing the original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS <br>
After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Decide not to
merge. The only clean-ups you need are to reset the index
file to the HEAD commit to reverse 2. and to clean up
working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; git <br>
merge --abort can be used for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Resolve the
conflicts. Git will mark the conflicts in the working tree.
Edit the files into shape and git add them to the index. Use
git commit to seal the deal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can work through the
conflict with a number of tools:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use a mergetool.
git mergetool to launch a graphical mergetool which will
work you through the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Look at the
diffs. git diff will show a three-way diff, highlighting
changes from both the HEAD and MERGE_HEAD versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Look at the
diffs from each branch. git log --merge -p &lt;path&gt; will
show diffs first for the HEAD version and then the
MERGE_HEAD version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Look at the
originals. git show :1:filename shows the common ancestor,
git show :2:filename shows the HEAD version, and git show
:3:filename shows the MERGE_HEAD version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Merge branches fixes and enhancements on top
of the current branch, making an octopus merge:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git merge fixes
enhancements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Merge branch
obsolete into the current branch, using ours merge
strategy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git merge -s ours obsolete</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Merge branch
maint into the current branch, but do not make a new commit
automatically:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git merge --no-commit
maint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used when you want
to include further changes to the merge, or want to write
your own merge commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should refrain from abusing
this option to sneak substantial changes into a merge
commit. Small fixups like bumping release/version name would
be acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERGE STRATEGIES <br>
The merge mechanism (git-merge and git-pull commands) allows
the backend merge strategies to be chosen with -s option.
Some strategies can also take their own options, which can
<br>
be passed by giving -X&lt;option&gt; arguments to git-merge
and/or git-pull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolve <br>
This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and
another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge
algorithm. It tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge
<br>
ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursive <br>
This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that
can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the
<br>
common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the
3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge
conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests done <br>
on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel
development history. Additionally this can detect and handle
merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy
<br>
when pulling or merging one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recursive strategy can take
the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ours <br>
This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
cleanly by favoring our version. Changes from the other tree
that do not conflict with our side are reflected to <br>
the merge result. For a binary file, the entire contents are
taken from our side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should not be confused with
the ours merge strategy, which does not even look at what
the other tree contains at all. It discards everything the
other tree did, <br>
declaring our history contains all that happened in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">theirs <br>
This is the opposite of ours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patience <br>
With this option, merge-recursive spends a little extra time
to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant
matching lines (e.g., braces from distinct <br>
functions). Use this when the branches to be merged have
diverged wildly. See also git-diff(1)--patience.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]
<br>
Tells merge-recursive to use a different diff algorithm,
which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant
matching lines (such as braces from distinct <br>
functions). See also git-diff(1)--diff-algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore-space-change,
ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol <br>
Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace
changes mixed with other changes to a line are not <br>
ignored. See also git-diff(1)-b, -w, and
--ignore-space-at-eol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If their version
only introduces whitespace changes to a line, our version is
used;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If our version
introduces whitespace changes but their version includes a
substantial change, their version is used;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Otherwise, the
merge proceeds in the usual way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renormalize <br>
This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This
option is meant to be used when merging branches with <br>
different clean filters or end-of-line normalization rules.
See &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
attributes&quot; in gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-renormalize <br>
Disables the renormalize option. This overrides the
merge.renormalize configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Controls the similarity threshold used for rename detection.
See also git-diff(1)-M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtree[=&lt;path&gt;] <br>
This option is a more advanced form of subtree strategy,
where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be
shifted to match with each other when merging. Instead, <br>
the specified path is prefixed (or stripped from the
beginning) to make the shape of two trees to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">octopus <br>
This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to
do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is
primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads
<br>
together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or
merging more than one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ours <br>
This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of
the merge is always that of the current branch head,
effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches. It
<br>
is meant to be used to supersede old development history of
side branches. Note that this is different from the -Xours
option to the recursive merge strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtree <br>
This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A
and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first
adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of <br>
reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also
done to the common ancestor tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
merge.conflictstyle <br>
Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out
to working tree files upon merge. The default is
&quot;merge&quot;, which shows a
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; conflict marker, changes made
by <br>
one side, a ======= marker, changes made by the other side,
and then a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marker. An alternate
style, &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a ||||||| marker and the
original text before the <br>
======= marker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.defaultToUpstream <br>
If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
upstream branches configured for the current branch by using
their last observed values stored in their <br>
remote-tracking branches. The values of the
branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge that name the branches
at the remote named by branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.remote
are consulted, and then <br>
they are mapped via remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch to their
corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of
these tracking branches are merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.ff <br>
By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when
merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit.
Instead, the tip of the current branch is <br>
fast-forwarded. When set to false, this variable tells Git
to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent
to giving the --no-ff option from the command line). <br>
When set to only, only such fast-forward merges are allowed
(equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command
line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.log <br>
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
at most the specified number of one-line descriptions from
the actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to <br>
false, and true is a synonym for 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.renameLimit <br>
The number of files to consider when performing rename
detection during a merge; if not specified, defaults to the
value of diff.renameLimit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.renormalize <br>
Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits
record text files with CRLF line endings, but recent ones
use LF <br>
line endings). In such a repository, Git can convert the
data recorded in commits to a canonical form before
performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more
<br>
information, see section &quot;Merging branches with
