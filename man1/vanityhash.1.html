<p>VANITYHASH(1) VANITYHASH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vanityhash - A hex hash fragment creation tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vanityhash [ options ] hexfragment &lt; inputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vanityhash --append [ options ]
hexfragment &lt; inputfile &gt; outputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
vanityhash is a tool that can discover data to be added to
the end of a file to produce a desired hex hash fragment. It
searches a message space and runs a hashing algorithm <br>
against the original data plus the appended data to
determine if the desired hash fragment is present.
vanityhash can run multiple parallel workers to effectively
make use of <br>
multiple processors/cores/threads, and supports multiple
hash digest types (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vanityhash can be used to append
data to files that are capable of ignoring garbage data at
the end of the file (such as ISO images and some types of
graphic images), in order to <br>
produce a &quot;vanity&quot; hash. vanityhash is fast, as it
only reads the base input data once, and then reverts back
to that base state over and over while it permeates the
search <br>
space, rather than hashing the entire source during each
permeation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vanityhash operates on the
concept of a &quot;search space&quot;. For example, given a
24-bit search space, vanityhash will run from 0x00000000 to
0x00ffffff, append the 4-byte packed <br>
version of each number to the end of the input data,
calculate the resulting hash, and search the hash value for
the desired hex fragment pattern. A desired hex fragment can
be <br>
larger than the search space (for example, searching for
&quot;abcdef&quot; in a 16-bit search space), but the
chances of finding a match reduce drastically the larger the
desired hex <br>
fragment is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In its default operation,
vanityhash will search the entire specified search space and
output all matching results to STDOUT, one result per line,
in the form &quot;extradata hash&quot;, <br>
where both &quot;extradata&quot; and &quot;hash&quot; are in
hex form. When the --append option is specified, this
behavior changes. If a match is found, the original input
data plus the extra <br>
data (in byte form) are outputted, and searching ends after
the first successful match. If no matches are found, the
original data only is outputted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b bits, --bits=bits <br>
Space to be searched, in bits. Allowed values range from 1
to 64. Default is 24. Search spaces larger than 32 bits
require a 64-bit operating system, and a version of Perl
<br>
compiled with 64-bit integer support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p position, --position=position
<br>
The position within the hex hash to look for the desired
fragment, in hex digits. The beginning starts at 0. Default
is 0. A position that extends the fragment beyond the <br>
length of the hash is not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --any-position <br>
When enabled, this option will override --position and will
return hashes that contain the desired fragment in any
position within the hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s seconds, --progress=seconds
<br>
The number of seconds between printing of progress lines,
default 5 seconds. A decimal value may be specified. A value
of 0 disabled printing progress lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w workers, --workers=workers
<br>
The number of workers to be spawned. Default is 1.
Recommended value is the number of logical processors on the
running system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d digesttype,
--digest=digesttype <br>
The hashing digest type to use. Default is &quot;md5&quot;
Allowed values are &quot;md2&quot;, &quot;md4&quot;,
&quot;md5&quot;, and &quot;shaN&quot; where N is a valid SHA
digest value. &quot;sha1alt&quot; is accepted to use <br>
Digest::SHA1 instead of Digest::SHA. Note that for many
digest types, the appropriate Perl module must be installed
and available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --append <br>
When enabled, the original data is outputted back to STDOUT.
Then, when/if the first matching hash is found, the data
fragment used to produce the matching hash is outputted <br>
to STDOUT. STDOUT can then be redirected to another file to
produce the modified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Normally vanityhash sends a fair amount of status
information to STDERR during operation. When enabled, all
non-error status information is instead suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Print a synposis and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS / LIMITATIONS <br>
Search spaces larger than 32 bits require a 64-bit operating
system, and a version of Perl compiled with 64-bit integer
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A block of computed data is
added equal to the size of the integer type the search space
fits into (1 byte for 8 bits or less, 2 bytes for 9 through
16 bits, 4 bytes for 17 <br>
through 32 bits, 8 bytes for 33 through 64 bits), even if
the search space could fit into a smaller raw byte block
(say, 3 bytes for a 20-bit search space). While this does
not <br>
reduce (or increase) the possibility of finding a match in a
given search space, the extra null byte(s) in the block are
technically wasteful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra bytes are packed according
to system endianness. Thus, search results will be different
between big and little endian systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vanityhash should work fine on
any POSIX operating system, and has been tested on Linux and
Mac OS X. It mostly works with Strawberry Perl for Windows,
but crashes at the end. <br>
Suggestions to fix this would be welcomed.</p>
