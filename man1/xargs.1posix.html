<p>XARGS(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
XARGS(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xargs &acirc; construct argument lists and invoke
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xargs [&acirc;ptx] [&acirc;E eofstr] [&acirc;I
replstr|&acirc;L number|&acirc;n number] <br>
[&acirc;s size] [utility [argument...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xargs utility shall construct a command line consisting
of the utility and argument operands specified followed by
as many arguments read in sequence from standard input as
<br>
fit in length and number constraints specified by the
options. The xargs utility shall then invoke the constructed
command line and wait for its completion. This sequence
shall <br>
be repeated until one of the following occurs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An end-of-file condition is
detected on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An argument consisting of just
the logical end-of-file string (see the &acirc;E eofstr
option) is found on standard input after double-quote
processing, &lt;apostrophe&gt; processing, <br>
and &lt;backslash&gt;-escape processing (see next
paragraph). All arguments up to but not including the
argument consisting of just the logical end-of-file string
shall be used as <br>
arguments in constructed command lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An invocation of a constructed
command line returns an exit status of 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application shall ensure
that arguments in the standard input are separated by
unquoted &lt;blank&gt; characters, unescaped &lt;blank&gt;
characters, or &lt;newline&gt; characters. A string of <br>
zero or more non-double-quote (&rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;)
characters and non-&lt;newline&gt; characters can be quoted
by enclosing them in double-quotes. A string of zero or more
non-&lt;apostrophe&gt; (&rsquo;&acute;&rsquo;) <br>
characters and non-&lt;newline&gt; characters can be quoted
by enclosing them in &lt;apostrophe&gt; characters. Any
unquoted character can be escaped by preceding it with a
&lt;backslash&gt;. The <br>
utility named by utility shall be executed one or more times
until the end-of-file is reached or the logical end-of file
string is found. The results are unspecified if the
util&acirc; <br>
ity named by utility attempts to read from its standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated command line
length shall be the sum of the size in bytes of the utility
name and each argument treated as strings, including a null
byte terminator for each of <br>
these strings. The xargs utility shall limit the command
line length such that when the command line is invoked, the
combined argument and environment lists (see the exec family
<br>
of functions in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008) shall not exceed {ARG_MAX}&acirc;2048
bytes. Within this constraint, if neither the &acirc;n nor
the &acirc;s option is specified, the <br>
default command line length shall be at least
{LINE_MAX}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The xargs utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;E eofstr Use eofstr as
the logical end-of-file string. If &acirc;E is not
specified, it is unspecified whether the logical end-of-file
string is the &lt;underscore&gt; character (&rsquo;_&rsquo;)
or <br>
the end-of-file string capability is disabled. When eofstr
is the null string, the logical end-of-file string
capability shall be disabled and &lt;underscore&gt;
characters <br>
shall be taken literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;I replstr <br>
Insert mode: utility is executed for each logical line from
standard input. Arguments in the standard input shall be
separated only by unescaped &lt;newline&gt; characters, <br>
not by &lt;blank&gt; characters. Any unquoted unescaped
&lt;blank&gt; characters at the beginning of each line shall
be ignored. The resulting argument shall be inserted in
argu&acirc; <br>
ments in place of each occurrence of replstr. At least five
arguments in arguments can each contain one or more
instances of replstr. Each of these constructed argu&acirc;
<br>
ments cannot grow larger than an implementation-defined
limit greater than or equal to 255 bytes. Option &acirc;x
shall be forced on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;L number The utility
shall be executed for each non-empty number lines of
arguments from standard input. The last invocation of
utility shall be with fewer lines of arguments if <br>
fewer than number remain. A line is considered to end with
the first &lt;newline&gt; unless the last character of the
line is a &lt;blank&gt;; a trailing &lt;blank&gt; signals
continua&acirc; <br>
tion to the next non-empty line, inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n number Invoke utility
using as many standard input arguments as possible, up to
number (a positive decimal integer) arguments maximum. Fewer
arguments shall be used if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The command line length
accumulated exceeds the size specified by the &acirc;s
option (or {LINE_MAX} if there is no &acirc;s option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The last iteration has fewer
than number, but not zero, operands remaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Prompt mode: the user
is asked whether to execute utility at each invocation.
Trace mode (&acirc;t) is turned on to write the command
instance to be executed, followed by a <br>
prompt to standard error. An affirmative response read from
/dev/tty shall execute the command; otherwise, that
particular invocation of utility shall be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s size Invoke utility
using as many standard input arguments as possible yielding
a command line length less than size (a positive decimal
integer) bytes. Fewer arguments <br>
shall be used if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The total number of arguments
exceeds that specified by the &acirc;n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The total number of lines
exceeds that specified by the &acirc;L option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* End-of-file is encountered on
standard input before size bytes are accumulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values of size up to at least
{LINE_MAX} bytes shall be supported, provided that the
constraints specified in the DESCRIPTION are met. It shall
not be considered an <br>
error if a value larger than that supported by the
implementation or exceeding the constraints specified in the
DESCRIPTION is given; xargs shall use the largest value <br>
it supports within the constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t Enable trace mode. Each
generated command line shall be written to standard error
just prior to invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;x Terminate if a
constructed command line will not fit in the implied or
specified size (see the &acirc;s option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utility The name of the utility
to be invoked, found by search path using the PATH
environment variable, described in the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 8, <br>
Environment Variables. If utility is omitted, the default
shall be the echo utility. If the utility operand names any
of the special built-in utilities in Section <br>
2.14, Special Built-In Utilities, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument An initial option or
operand for the invocation of utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be a text file. The results are
unspecified if an end-of-file condition is detected
immediately following an escaped &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The file /dev/tty shall be used to read responses required
by the &acirc;p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of xargs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence
classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the
extended regular expression defined for the <br>
yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files) and the behavior of character classes used
in the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale used to process affirmative responses,
and the locale used to affect the format and contents of
diagnostic messages and prompts written to standard <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the location of
utility, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and
the &acirc;t and &acirc;p options. If the &acirc;t option is
specified, the utility and its constructed argument list
shall be written <br>
to standard error, as it will be invoked, prior to
invocation. If &acirc;p is specified, a prompt of the
following format shall be written (in the POSIX locale):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;?...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at the end of the line of the
output from &acirc;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All invocations of utility
returned exit status zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1&acirc;125 A command line
meeting the specified requirements could not be assembled,
one or more of the invocations of utility returned a
non-zero exit status, or some other error <br>
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 The utility specified by
utility was found but could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 The utility specified by
utility could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If a command line meeting the specified requirements cannot
be assembled, the utility cannot be invoked, an invocation
of the utility is terminated by a signal, or an invocation
<br>
of the utility exits with exit status 255, the xargs utility
shall write a diagnostic message and exit without processing
any remaining input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The 255 exit status allows a utility being used by xargs to
tell xargs to terminate if it knows no further invocations
using the current data stream will succeed. Thus, utility
<br>
should explicitly exit with an appropriate value to avoid
accidentally returning with 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since input is parsed
as lines, &lt;blank&gt; characters separate arguments, and
&lt;backslash&gt;, &lt;apostrophe&gt;, and double-quote
characters are used for quoting, if xargs is used <br>
to bundle the output of commands like find dir &acirc;print
or ls into commands to be executed, unexpected results are
likely if any filenames contain &lt;blank&gt;,
&lt;newline&gt;, or quoting <br>
characters. This can be solved by using find to call a
script that converts each file found into a quoted string
that is then piped to xargs, but in most cases it is
preferable <br>
just to have find do the argument aggregation itself by
using &acirc;exec with a &rsquo;+&rsquo; terminator instead
of &rsquo;;&rsquo;. Note that the quoting rules used by
xargs are not the same as in the <br>
shell. They were not made consistent here because existing
applications depend on the current rules. An easy (but
inefficient) method that can be used to transform input
consist&acirc; <br>
ing of one argument per line into a quoted form that xargs
interprets correctly is to precede each non-&lt;newline&gt;
character with a &lt;backslash&gt;. More efficient
alternatives are <br>
shown in Example 2 and Example 5 below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On implementations with a large
value for {ARG_MAX}, xargs may produce command lines longer
than {LINE_MAX}. For invocation of utilities, this is not a
problem. If xargs is <br>
being used to create a text file, users should explicitly
set the maximum command line length with the &acirc;s
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command, env, nice, nohup,
time, and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit
code 127 if an error occurs so that applications can
distinguish &lsquo;&lsquo;failure to find a <br>
utility&rsquo;&rsquo; from &lsquo;&lsquo;invoked utility
exited with an error indication&rsquo;&rsquo;. The value 127
was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
meanings; most utilities use small values <br>
for &lsquo;&lsquo;normal error conditions&rsquo;&rsquo; and
the values above 128 can be confused with termination due to
receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar
manner to indicate <br>
that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some
scripts produce meaningful error messages differentiating
the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes
126 and <br>
127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all
attempts to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses
126 when any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
<br>
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following command combines the output of the
parenthesized commands (minus the &lt;apostrophe&gt;
characters) onto one line, which is then appended to the
file log. It assumes <br>
that the expansion of &quot;$0$*&quot; does not include any
&lt;apostrophe&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(logname; date; printf
&quot;&rsquo;%s&rsquo;00 $*&quot;) | xargs &acirc;E
&quot;&quot; &gt;&gt;log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command invokes
diff with successive pairs of arguments originally typed as
command line arguments. It assumes there are no embedded
&lt;newline&gt; characters in the <br>
elements of the original argument list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;%s0@&quot; | sed
&rsquo;s/[^[:alnum:]]/\&amp;/g&rsquo; | <br>
xargs &acirc;E &quot;&quot; &acirc;n 2 &acirc;x diff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. In the following commands,
the user is asked which files in the current directory
(excluding dotfiles) are to be archived. The files are
archived into arch; a, one at a time <br>
or b, many at a time. The commands assume that no filenames
contain &lt;blank&gt;, &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;backslash&gt;,
&lt;apostrophe&gt;, or double-quote characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. ls | xargs &acirc;E
&quot;&quot; &acirc;p &acirc;L 1 ar &acirc;r arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. ls | xargs &acirc;E
&quot;&quot; &acirc;p &acirc;L 1 | xargs &acirc;E
&quot;&quot; ar &acirc;r arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The following command invokes
command1 one or more times with multiple arguments, stopping
if an invocation of command1 has a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xargs &acirc;E &quot;&quot; sh
&acirc;c &rsquo;command1 &quot;$@&quot; || exit 255&rsquo;
sh &lt; xargs_input</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. On XSI-conformant systems,
the following command moves all files from directory $1 to
directory $2, and echoes each move command just before doing
it. It assumes no filenames <br>
contain &lt;newline&gt; characters and that neither $1 nor
$2 contains the sequence &quot;{}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls &acirc;A &quot;$1&quot; | sed
&acirc;e &rsquo;s/&quot;/&quot;\&quot;&quot;/g&rsquo;
&acirc;e &rsquo;s/.*/&quot;&amp;&quot;/&rsquo; | <br>
xargs &acirc;E &quot;&quot; &acirc;I {} &acirc;t mv
&quot;$1&quot;/{} &quot;$2&quot;/{}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The xargs utility was usually found only in System V-based
systems; BSD systems included an apply utility that provided
functionality similar to xargs &acirc;n number. The SVID
lists <br>
xargs as a software development extension. This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 does not share the view that it is used
only for development, and therefore it is not optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The classic application of the
xargs utility is in conjunction with the find utility to
reduce the number of processes launched by a simplistic use
of the find &acirc;exec combination. <br>
The xargs utility is also used to enforce an upper limit on
memory required to launch a process. With this basis in
mind, this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 selected only the
minimal <br>
features required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the 255 exit status is
mostly an accident of historical implementations, it allows
a utility being used by xargs to tell xargs to terminate if
it knows no further invo&acirc; <br>
cations using the current data stream shall succeed. Any
non-zero exit status from a utility falls into the
1&acirc;125 range when xargs exits. There is no statement of
how the various <br>
non-zero utility exit status codes are accumulated by xargs.
The value could be the addition of all codes, their highest
value, the last one received, or a single value such as <br>
1. Since no algorithm is arguably better than the others,
and since many of the standard utilities say little more
(portably) than &lsquo;&lsquo;pass/fail&rsquo;&rsquo;, no
new algorithm was invented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several other xargs options were
removed because simple alternatives already exist within
this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. For example, the &acirc;i
replstr option can be just as effi&acirc; <br>
ciently performed using a shell for loop. Since xargs calls
an exec function with each input line, the &acirc;i option
does not usually exploit the grouping capabilities of
xargs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The requirement that xargs never
produces command lines such that invocation of utility is
within 2048 bytes of hitting the POSIX exec {ARG_MAX}
limitations is intended to guar&acirc; <br>
antee that the invoked utility has room to modify its
environment variables and command line arguments and still
be able to invoke another utility. Note that the minimum
<br>
{ARG_MAX} allowed by the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 is 4096 bytes and the minimum value
allowed by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 is 2048 bytes;
therefore, the 2048 <br>
bytes difference seems reasonable. Note, however, that xargs
may never be able to invoke a utility if the environment
passed in to xargs comes close to using {ARG_MAX} bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version of xargs required by
this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 is required to wait for
the completion of the invoked command before invoking
another command. This was done because <br>
historical scripts using xargs assumed sequential execution.
Implementations wanting to provide parallel operation of the
invoked utilities are encouraged to add an option <br>
enabling parallel invocation, but should still wait for
termination of all of the children before xargs terminates
normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;e option was omitted
from the ISO POSIX&acirc;2:1993 standard in the belief that
the eofstr option-argument was recognized only when it was
on a line by itself and before quote <br>
and escape processing were performed, and that the logical
end-of-file processing was only enabled if a &acirc;e option
was specified. In that case, a simple sed script could be
used <br>
to duplicate the &acirc;e functionality. Further
investigation revealed that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The logical end-of-file string
was checked for after quote and escape processing, making a
sed script that provided equivalent functionality much more
difficult to write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The default was to perform
logical end-of-file processing with an &lt;underscore&gt; as
the logical end-of-file string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To correct this
misunderstanding, the &acirc;E eofstr option was adopted
from the X/Open Portability Guide. Users should note that
the description of the &acirc;E option matches historical
<br>
documentation of the &acirc;e option (which was not adopted
because it did not support the Utility Syntax Guidelines),
by saying that if eofstr is the null string, logical
end-of-file <br>
processing is disabled. Historical implementations of xargs
actually did not disable logical end-of-file processing;
they treated a null argument found in the input as a logical
<br>
end-of-file string. (A null string argument could be
generated using single or double-quotes (&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&quot;&quot;). Since this behavior was not documented
historically, it is considered to <br>
be a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;I, &acirc;L, and
&acirc;n options are mutually-exclusive. Some
implementations use the last one specified if more than one
is given on a command line; other implementations treat
combi&acirc; <br>
nations of the options in different ways.</p>
