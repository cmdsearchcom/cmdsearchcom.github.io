<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
verga - VERrilog simulator for tkGAte</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
verga [-eslqi] [-d dtype] [-S script] [-P mods] [-t mod] [-B
dir] [-D hash] [-W wmode] [files...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Verga is a verilog simulator designed to be used with
tkgate, but it can also be used as a stand-alone
simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verga documentation can be found
at:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.tkgate.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Dump the list of error codes
and associated messages that can be produced by verga. This
option is primarily for developer purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Scan a Verilog file and
output information about its modules and nets. This option
is primarily used internally by tkgate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Show the verga license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Run in &rsquo;quiet&rsquo;
mode, suppressing extraneous messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Run in
&rsquo;interactive&rsquo; mode. This mode is intended
primarily for use when verga is being invoked by tkgate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dtype Type of delays to use.
Can be &rsquo;min&rsquo;, &rsquo;max&rsquo; or
&rsquo;typical&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S script Load simulation
scripts for each &rsquo;-S&rsquo; switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P mod Print the named module
from the parsed structure for each &rsquo;-P&rsquo;
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t mod Override the default and
designate &rsquo;mod&rsquo; as the top-level module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B dir Directory to use as base
directory when loading files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D hash Delete the input files
after loading if &rsquo;hash&rsquo; exactly matches a hash
code computed on the file name. This option should only be
used by tkgate which writes the <br>
file to simulate to a temporary file before invoking the
simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W wmode Mode for warning
message handling. Can be 1 for &quot;ignore warnings&quot;,
2 for &quot;report warnings only if there were errors&quot;,
3 for &quot;always report warnings&quot; or 4 for <br>
&quot;always report warnings and stop simulator even if only
warnings&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY &amp; CREDITS <br>
TkGate begin life as an undergraduate project at Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU) in 1987. At that time it was called
simply &rsquo;gate&rsquo; and ran under the &rsquo;wm&rsquo;
window manager, a win&acirc; <br>
dowing system developed at CMU before X11 was widely used.
In this incarnation it was used by students in the computer
architecture course at CMU to develop a simple
micropro&acirc; <br>
cessor (dubbed &quot;The Bat Computer&quot;). After laying
dormant for several years, it was resurrected in 1991 and
ported to run under X11 with the Xlib API. In this
incarnation it was <br>
used several times by students in the introductory digital
logic course, but after the author graduated and left CMU,
it went into hibernation again. This Tcl/Tk incarnation was
<br>
begun in 1998. While there is certainly some cruftyness in
the implementation in places due to the multiple
reincarnations, many new features have been added since the
older wm <br>
and X11 versions, and the interface has been made much
easier to use.</p>
