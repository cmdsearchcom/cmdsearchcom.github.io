<p>CD(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
CD(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cd &acirc; change the working directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cd [&acirc;L|&acirc;P] [directory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd &acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cd utility shall change the working directory of the
current shell execution environment (see Section 2.12, Shell
Execution Environment) by executing the following steps in
<br>
sequence. (In the following steps, the symbol curpath
represents an intermediate value used to simplify the
description of the algorithm used by cd. There is no
requirement that <br>
curpath be made visible to the application.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If no directory operand is
given and the HOME environment variable is empty or
undefined, the default behavior is implementation-defined
and no further steps shall be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If no directory operand is
given and the HOME environment variable is set to a
non-empty value, the cd utility shall behave as if the
directory named in the HOME environment <br>
variable was specified as the directory operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the directory operand
begins with a &lt;slash&gt; character, set curpath to the
operand and proceed to step 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the first component of the
directory operand is dot or dot-dot, proceed to step 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Starting with the first
pathname in the &lt;colon&gt;-separated pathnames of CDPATH
(see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section) if the pathname is
non-null, test if the concatenation <br>
of that pathname, a &lt;slash&gt; character if that pathname
did not end with a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the
directory operand names a directory. If the pathname is
null, test if the <br>
concatenation of dot, a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the
operand names a directory. In either case, if the resulting
string names an existing directory, set curpath to that
string <br>
and proceed to step 7. Otherwise, repeat this step with the
next pathname in CDPATH until all pathnames have been
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Set curpath to the directory
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. If the &acirc;P option is in
effect, proceed to step 10. If curpath does not begin with a
&lt;slash&gt; character, set curpath to the string formed by
the concatenation of the value of <br>
PWD, a &lt;slash&gt; character if the value of PWD did not
end with a &lt;slash&gt; character, and curpath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. The curpath value shall then
be converted to canonical form as follows, considering each
component from beginning to end, in sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. Dot components and any
&lt;slash&gt; characters that separate them from the next
component shall be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. For each dot-dot component,
if there is a preceding component and it is neither root nor
dot-dot, then:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i. If the preceding component
does not refer (in the context of pathname resolution with
symbolic links followed) to a directory, then the cd utility
shall display an <br>
appropriate error message and no further steps shall be
taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ii. The preceding component, all
&lt;slash&gt; characters separating the preceding component
from dot-dot, dot-dot, and all &lt;slash&gt; characters
separating dot-dot from the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing component (if any) shall be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. An implementation may further
simplify curpath by removing any trailing &lt;slash&gt;
characters that are not also leading &lt;slash&gt;
characters, replacing multiple non-leading <br>
consecutive &lt;slash&gt; characters with a single
&lt;slash&gt;, and replacing three or more leading
&lt;slash&gt; characters with a single &lt;slash&gt;. If, as
a result of this canonicaliza&acirc; <br>
tion, the curpath variable is null, no further steps shall
be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. If curpath is longer than
{PATH_MAX} bytes (including the terminating null) and the
directory operand was not longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes
(including the terminating null), <br>
then curpath shall be converted from an absolute pathname to
an equivalent relative pathname if possible. This conversion
shall always be considered possible if the value of <br>
PWD, with a trailing &lt;slash&gt; added if it does not
already have one, is an initial substring of curpath.
Whether or not it is considered possible under other
circumstances is <br>
unspecified. Implementations may also apply this conversion
if curpath is not longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes or the
directory operand was longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. The cd utility shall then
perform actions equivalent to the chdir() function called
with curpath as the path argument. If these actions fail for
any reason, the cd utility <br>
shall display an appropriate error message and the remainder
of this step shall not be executed. If the &acirc;P option
is not in effect, the PWD environment variable shall be set
<br>
to the value that curpath had on entry to step 9 (i.e.,
before conversion to a relative pathname). If the &acirc;P
option is in effect, the PWD environment variable shall be
set to <br>
the string that would be output by pwd &acirc;P. If there is
insufficient permission on the new directory, or on any
parent of that directory, to determine the current working
<br>
directory, the value of the PWD environment variable is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, during the execution of the
above steps, the PWD environment variable is set, the OLDPWD
environment variable shall also be set to the value of the
old working directory <br>
(that is the current working directory immediately prior to
the call to cd).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The cd utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;L Handle the operand
dot-dot logically; symbolic link components shall not be
resolved before dot-dot components are processed (see steps
8. and 9. in the DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;P Handle the operand
dot-dot physically; symbolic link components shall be
resolved before dot-dot components are processed (see step
7. in the DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both &acirc;L and &acirc;P
options are specified, the last of these options shall be
used and all others ignored. If neither &acirc;L nor
&acirc;P is specified, the operand shall be handled dot-dot
<br>
logically; see the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory An absolute or
relative pathname of the directory that shall become the new
working directory. The interpretation of a relative pathname
by cd depends on the &acirc;L option <br>
and the CDPATH and PWD environment variables. If directory
is an empty string, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc; When a &lt;hyphen&gt; is
used as the operand, this shall be equivalent to the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd &quot;$OLDPWD&quot;
&amp;&amp; pwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which changes to the previous
working directory and then writes its name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of cd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDPATH A &lt;colon&gt;-separated
list of pathnames that refer to directories. The cd utility
shall use this list in its attempt to change the directory,
as described in the DESCRIP&acirc; <br>
TION. An empty string in place of a directory pathname
represents the current directory. If CDPATH is not set, it
shall be treated as if it were an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME The name of the directory,
used when no directory operand is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDPWD A pathname of the
previous working directory, used by cd &acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PWD This variable shall be set
as specified in the DESCRIPTION. If an application sets or
unsets the value of PWD, the behavior of cd is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if cd
&acirc; is used, an absolute pathname of the new working
directory shall be written to the standard output as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;new
directory&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, there shall be no
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The directory was successfully
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
The working directory shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Since cd affects the current shell execution environment, it
is always provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is
called in a subshell or separate utility execution
environ&acirc; <br>
ment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(cd /tmp) <br>
nohup cd <br>
find . &acirc;exec cd {} ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it does not affect the working
directory of the caller&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user must have execute
(search) permission in directory in order to change to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following template can be used to perform processing in
the directory specified by location and end up in the
current working directory in use before the first cd command
was <br>
issued:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd location <br>
if [ $? -ne 0 ] <br>
then <br>
print error message <br>
exit 1 <br>
fi <br>
... do whatever is desired as long as the OLDPWD environment
variable <br>
is not modified <br>
cd -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The use of the CDPATH was introduced in the System V shell.
Its use is analogous to the use of the PATH variable in the
shell. The BSD C shell used a shell parameter cdpath for
<br>
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common extension when HOME is
undefined is to get the login directory from the user
database for the invoking user. This does not occur on
System V implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical shells, such as
the KornShell, took special actions when the directory name
contained a dot-dot component, selecting the logical parent
of the directory, rather <br>
than the actual parent directory; that is, it moved up one
level toward the &rsquo;/&rsquo; in the pathname,
remembering what the user typed, rather than performing the
equivalent of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir(&quot;..&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In such a shell, the following
commands would not necessarily produce equivalent output for
all directories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd .. &amp;&amp; ls ls ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior is now the
default. It is not consistent with the definition of dot-dot
in most historical practice; that is, while this behavior
has been optionally available in <br>
the KornShell, other shells have historically not supported
this functionality. The logical pathname is stored in the
PWD environment variable when the cd utility completes and
<br>
this value is used to construct the next directory name if
cd is invoked with the &acirc;L option.</p>
