<p>PMMGR(1) General Commands Manual PMMGR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmmgr - pcp daemon manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmmgr [-v] [-c config-directory] [-p polling-interval] [-l
log-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmmgr manages a collection of PCP daemons for a set of
discovered local and remote hosts running the Performance
Metrics Collection Daemon (PMCD), according to zero or more
con&acirc; <br>
figuration directories. It keeps a matching set of pmlogger,
pmie, and other clients/daemons running, and their
archives/logs merged/rotated. It supplants the older
pmlogger_* <br>
and pmie_* check/daily management shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmmgr is largely
self-configuring and perseveres despite most run-time
errors. pmmgr runs in the foreground until interrupted. When
signaled, it will stop its running daemons <br>
before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A description of the command
line options specific to pmmgr follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c directory adds a given
configuration directory to pmmgr. pmmgr can supervise
multiple different configurations at the same time, so this
option may be repeated. Errors in <br>
the configuration may be noted to standard error, but pmmgr
will fill in missing information with built-in defaults. The
default directory is $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmmgr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p polling-interval sets the
host-discovery polling interval to the given number of
seconds. The default is 60. Daemons for a particular target
host will be restarted no more <br>
frequently than this interval. There may be a short-lived
thread inside pmmgr for startup &amp; shutdown of each
daemon for each target host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l log-file redirects standard
output &amp; error to the given log file, which is created
anew</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v adds more verbose tracing to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
A pmmgr configuration identifies which hosts should be
monitored, which daemons should be maintained for them, and
what options those daemons should be run with. pmmgr uses a
<br>
small number of files in a configuration directory, instead
of lines in a text file. The individual files carry zero or
more lines of 100% pure configuration text, and no
com&acirc; <br>
ments. (If desired, a configuration may be commented upon
with any other file, such as a free-form README.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGET SELECTION <br>
This set of configuration files identifies where pmmgr
should search for pmcd instances, how to uniquely identify
them, and where state such as log files should be kept for
each. <br>
Ideally, a persistent &amp; unique host-id string is
computed for each potential target pmcd from specified
metric values. This host-id is also used as a subdirectory
name for <br>
locating daemon data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostid-metrics <br>
This file contains one or more lines of metric
specifications in the format accepted by pmParseMetricSpec.
Metrics without instance specifiers mean all instances of
that <br>
metric. These are used to generate the unique host-id string
for each pmcd server that pmmgr discovers. Upon discovery,
all the metrics/instances named are queried, <br>
string values fetched, and normalized/concatenated into a
single hyphenated printable string. The default is the
single metric pmcd.hostname, which is sufficient if all <br>
the hosts discovered have unique hostname(2). If they
don&rsquo;t, you should add other pcp metric specifications
to set them apart at your site. The more you add, the longer
<br>
the host-id string, but the more likely that accidental
duplication is prevented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, it may be desirable for
a host-id to also be persistent, so that if the target host
goes offline and later returns, the new host-id matches the
previous one, <br>
because then old and new histories can be joined. This
argues against using metrics whose values vary from boot to
boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some candidate metrics to
consider: network.interface.hw_addr,
network.interface.inet_addr[&quot;eth0&quot;],
network.interface.ipv6_addr, kernel.uname.nodename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log-directory <br>
This file contains the path of a directory beneath which the
per-host-id subdirectories are to be created by pmmgr. If it
is not a full path, it is implicitly relative to <br>
the configuration directory itself. The default is
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmmgr/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-host <br>
This file contains one or more lines containing pmcd host
specifications, as described on the PCPintro(1) man page.
Each poll interval, pmmgr will attempt to make a brief <br>
pmNewContext connection to the host to check liveness. It is
not a problem if more than one specification for the same
host is listed, because the host-id processing <br>
eliminates duplicates, and chooses an arbitrary
specification among them. The default is to target pmcd at
local:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-discovery <br>
This file contains one or more lines containing
specifications for the pmDiscoverServices PMAPI call, each
of which may map onto a fluctuating set of local or remote
pmcd <br>
servers. Each poll interval, pmmgr will attempt to rerun
discovery with all of the given specifications. Again, it is
not a problem if more than one specification <br>
matches the same actual pmcd: one confirmed access path is
arbitrarily selected. The default is to do no discovery.
Consider including avahi,timeout=5 to rely in pmcd <br>
self-announcements on the local network (searching for up to
five seconds each time). Consider including
probe=192.168.1.0/24 to quickly scan the given IP address
range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtarget-containers <br>
If this file exists, pmmgr will scan each host that is found
for running containers. For each running container, it will
create independent subtargets for running <br>
requested daemons. The host-id string for these subtargets
is the host&rsquo;s host-id string, followed by a
double-hyphen, then the full unique container instance-name
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-threads <br>
This file contains a limit on the number of concurrent
threads that analyze potential target pmcds for their
hostids and/or containers. The default is a few dozen
threads <br>
per CPU core, if known. Set this to zero if remote pmcds
should be analyzed sequentially. A small number of threads
is not a good idea if any potential target pmcds are <br>
unreachable, since $PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT may be several
seconds long each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log-subdirectory-gc <br>
This file may contain a time interval specification as per
the PCPintro man page. All subdirectories of the
log-directory are presumed to contain data for
pmmgr-monitored <br>
servers. Those that have not been touched (in the stat/mtime
sense) in at least that long, and not associated with a
currently monitored target, are deleted entirely. <br>
This value should be longer than the longest interval that
pmmgr normally recreates archives (such as due to pmmgr
restarts, and pmlogmerge intervals). The default value <br>
is 90days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMLOGGER CONFIGURATION <br>
This group of configuration options controls a pmlogger
daemon for each host. This may include generating its
configuration, and managing its archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogger <br>
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will maintain a
pmlogger daemon for each targeted host. This file contains
one line of additional space-separated options for the <br>
pmie daemon. (pmmgr already adds -h, -f, -r, -l, and perhaps
-c.) The default is to maintain no pmlogger (and no other
configuration in this section is processed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogconf <br>
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will run pmlogconf to
generate a configuration file for each target pmcd. The file
contains one line of space-separated additional <br>
options for the pmlogconf program. pmlogconf&rsquo;s
generated output file will be stored under the
log-directory/hostid subdirectory. (pmmgr already adds -c,
-r, and -h.) <br>
The default is no pmlogconf, so instead, the pmlogger file
above should probably contain a -c option, to specify a
fixed pmlogger configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARCHIVE LOG MANAGEMENT <br>
Default pmlogger configurations can collect tens of
megabytes of data per day (possibly split into multiple
archives), per target host. If your disk space is less than
infinite, <br>
or archive-splitting unwieldy, this should be managed. In
the default, unmanaged case, the system administrator is
responsible for managing the individual archive-* files from
<br>
the per-host logging subdirectories. pmmgr offers several
other options, each representing different performance /
usability tradeoffs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARCHIVE LOG MANAGEMENT -
pmlogmerge <br>
This style of archive log management regularly creates a
single merged archive from prior archives for each target
host, in effect lopping off old data and appending the new.
A <br>
single merged archive can be relatively large (defaults to
approximately 100-400 MB per host), and puts a corresponding
I/O load on storage, but is most convenient for a detailed
<br>
long-timeframe analysis. Once pmlogger is restarted, it
always creates a new archive, so in the steady state, there
will be one merged archive of recent history, and one
current <br>
archive being written-to by pmlogger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogmerge <br>
If this file exists, pmmgr will run pmlogextract to
periodically merge together preexisting log archives for
each target pmcd into a single large one. Then, the
preexist&acirc; <br>
ing log archives are deleted (including any prior merged
ones). This configuration file may contain a time interval
specification as per the PCPintro man page, represent&acirc;
<br>
ing the period after which pmlogger should be temporarily
stopped, and archives merged. It represents the maximum
amount of time that the merged archive lags the present <br>
time. The default is 24hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogmerge-granular <br>
If this file exists, pmmgr will merge only a subset of
preexisting log archives into the new one, instead of all of
them, so as to approximate a granular, aligned set of <br>
merged archives. The subset chosen corresponds to the
previous time interval specified by the pmlogmerge control
file. The default is no granularity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogmerge-rewrite <br>
If this file exists, pmmgr will run pmlogrewrite -i (plus
any other options listed in this file) on each input archive
before merging it. This will naturally require more <br>
disk I/O. The default is no rewriting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogmerge-retain <br>
pmmgr reduces/deletes any original-resolution archives after
a time period specified by this file, as measured by the
file mtime. The period will also be passed to pmlo&acirc;
<br>
gextract as a negative parameter to -S. The default is
14days. To store archives indefinitely, set this to a large
quantity like &quot;99999weeks&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogreduce <br>
If this file exists, then prior to removing archives that
expire past the pmlogmerge-retain period, they are processed
with pmlogreduce to create reduced archives (named <br>
reduced-*). If the file contains space-separated options,
they are passed onto pmlogreduce. (By default, pmlogreduce
downsamples to a 600-second interval.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogreduce-retain <br>
If this file exists, then reduced archives (identified by
the reduced-* pattern) are deleted after a time period
specified by this file, as measured from the file mtime.
<br>
Since this time is likely that of the pmlogreduce run, the
total retention time will be approximately the
pmlogmerge-retain time plus the pmlogreduce-retain time. The
<br>
default is 90days. To store reduced archives indefinitely,
set this to a large quantity like
&quot;99999weeks&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMIE CONFIGURATION <br>
This group of configuration options controls a pmie daemon
for each host. This may include generating a custom
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmie If and only if this file
exists, pmmgr will maintain a pmie daemon for each targeted
pmcd. This file contains one line of additional
space-separated options for the pmie <br>
daemon. (pmmgr already adds -h, -f, -l, and perhaps -c.) The
default is to maintain no pmie (and no other configuration
in this section is processed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmieconf <br>
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will run pmieconf to
generate a configuration file for each target pmcd. The file
contains one line of space-separated additional <br>
options for the pmieconf program. pmieconf&rsquo;s generated
output file will be stored under the log-directory/hostid
subdirectory. (pmmgr already adds -F, -c, and -f.) The <br>
default is no pmieconf, so instead, the pmie file above
should probably contain a -c option, to specify a fixed pmie
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR DAEMON MANAGEMENT <br>
In addition to pmlogger and pmie, pmmgr may be used to
invoke arbitrary pcp client programs for each target pmcd.
This can enable automated invocation of reporting or
relaying <br>
tools, such as pmrep or pcp2graphite, without needing a
specialized system service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor <br>
If this file exists, then for each line in this file, a new
background process will be invoked. (It is restarted if it
exits.) The line specifies the beginning of the <br>
command line (including the program name); pmmgr appends a
-h HOSTSPEC, and arranges to collect the standard output and
standard error into separate monitor-NN.out and <br>
monitor-NN.err files under the log directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmmgr/ <br>
default configuration directory <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmmgr/ <br>
default logging directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parametrize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
val&acirc; <br>
ues for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be used
to specify an alternative configuration file, as described
in pcp.conf(5).</p>
