<p>XSERVER(1) General Commands Manual XSERVER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Xserver - X Window System display server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
X [option ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
X is the generic name for the X Window System display
server. It is frequently a link or a copy of the appropriate
server binary for driving the most frequently used server on
a <br>
given machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTING THE SERVER <br>
The X server is usually started from the X Display Manager
program xdm(1) or a similar display manager program. This
utility is run from the system boot files and takes care of
<br>
keeping the server running, prompting for usernames and
passwords, and starting up the user sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installations that run more than
one window system may need to use the xinit(1) utility
instead of a display manager. However, xinit is to be
considered a tool for building <br>
startup scripts and is not intended for use by end users.
Site administrators are strongly urged to use a display
manager, or build other interfaces for novice users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X server may also be started
directly by the user, though this method is usually reserved
for testing and is not recommended for normal operation. On
some platforms, the <br>
user must have special permission to start the X server,
often because access to certain devices (e.g. /dev/mouse) is
restricted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the X server starts up, it
typically takes over the display. If you are running on a
workstation whose console is the display, you may not be
able to log into the console <br>
while the server is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Many X servers have device-specific command line options.
See the manual pages for the individual servers for more
details; a list of server-specific manual pages is provided
in <br>
the SEE ALSO section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the X servers accept the
command line options described below. Some X servers may
have alternative ways of providing the parameters described
here, but the values pro&acirc; <br>
vided via the command line options should override values
specified via other mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:displaynumber <br>
The X server runs as the given displaynumber, which by
default is 0. If multiple X servers are to run
simultaneously on a host, each must have a unique display
number. <br>
See the DISPLAY NAMES section of the X(7) manual page to
learn how to specify which display number clients should try
to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a number <br>
sets pointer acceleration (i.e. the ratio of how much is
reported to how much the user actually moved the
pointer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ac disables host-based access
control mechanisms. Enables access by any host, and permits
any host to modify the access control list. Use with extreme
caution. This <br>
option exists primarily for running test suites
remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-audit level <br>
sets the audit trail level. The default level is 1, meaning
only connection rejections are reported. Level 2
additionally reports all successful connections and
discon&acirc; <br>
nects. Level 4 enables messages from the SECURITY extension,
if present, including generation and revocation of
authorizations and violations of the security policy. <br>
Level 0 turns off the audit trail. Audit lines are sent as
standard error output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-auth authorization-file <br>
specifies a file which contains a collection of
authorization records used to authenticate access. See also
the xdm(1) and Xsecurity(7) manual pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background none <br>
Asks the driver not to clear the background on startup, if
the driver supports that. May be useful for smooth
transition with eg. fbdev driver. For security reasons <br>
this is not the default as the screen contents might show a
previous user session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-br sets the default root window
to solid black instead of the standard root weave pattern.
This is the default unless -retro or -wr is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bs disables backing store
support on all screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c turns off key-click.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c volume <br>
sets key-click volume (allowable range: 0-100).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc class <br>
sets the visual class for the root window of color screens.
The class numbers are as specified in the X protocol. Not
obeyed by all servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-core causes the server to
generate a core dump on fatal errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-displayfd fd <br>
specifies a file descriptor in the launching process. Rather
than specify a display number, the X server will attempt to
listen on successively higher display numbers, <br>
and upon finding a free one, will write the display number
back on this file descriptor as a newline-terminated string.
The -pn option is ignored when using -displayfd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-deferglyphs whichfonts <br>
specifies the types of fonts for which the server should
attempt to use deferred glyph loading. whichfonts can be all
(all fonts), none (no fonts), or 16 (16 bit fonts <br>
only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dpi resolution <br>
sets the resolution for all screens, in dots per inch. To be
used when the server cannot determine the screen size(s)
from the hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpms enables DPMS (display power
management services), where supported. The default state is
platform and configuration specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dpms disables DPMS (display
power management services). The default state is platform
and configuration specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extensionextensionName <br>
disables named extension. If an unknown extension name is
specified, a list of accepted extension names is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+extensionextensionName <br>
enables named extension. If an unknown extension name is
specified, a list of accepted extension names is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f volume <br>
sets beep (bell) volume (allowable range: 0-100).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fc cursorFont <br>
sets default cursor font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fn font <br>
sets the default font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fp fontPath <br>
sets the search path for fonts. This path is a comma
separated list of directories which the X server searches
for font databases. See the FONTS section of this manual
<br>
page for more information and the default list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help prints a usage
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I causes all remaining command
line arguments to be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iglx Prohibit creating indirect
GLX contexts. Indirect GLX is of limited use, since it lacks
support for many modern OpenGL features and extensions;
it&rsquo;s slower than direct <br>
contexts; and it opens a large attack surface for protocol
parsing errors. This is the default unless +iglx is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+iglx Allow creating indirect
GLX contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxbigreqsize size <br>
sets the maximum big request to size MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocursor <br>
disable the display of the pointer cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolisten trans-type <br>
disables a transport type. For example, TCP/IP connections
can be disabled with -nolisten tcp. This option may be
issued multiple times to disable listening to differ&acirc;
<br>
ent transport types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-listen trans-type <br>
enables a transport type. For example, TCP/IP connections
can be enabled with -listen tcp. This option may be issued
multiple times to enable listening to different <br>
transport types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noreset <br>
prevents a server reset when the last client connection is
closed. This overrides a previous -terminate command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p minutes <br>
sets screen-saver pattern cycle time in minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pn permits the server to
continue running if it fails to establish all of its
well-known sockets (connection points for clients), but
establishes at least one. This option <br>
is set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nopn causes the server to exit
if it fails to establish all of its well-known sockets
(connection points for clients).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r turns off auto-repeat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r turns on auto-repeat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-retro starts the stipple with
the classic stipple and cursor visible. The default is to
start with a black root window, and to suppress display of
the cursor until the first <br>
time an application calls XDefineCursor(). For kdrive
servers, this implies -zap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s minutes <br>
sets screen-saver timeout time in minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-su disables save under support
on all screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-seat seat <br>
seat to run on. Takes a string identifying a seat in a
platform specific syntax. On platforms which support this
feature this may be used to limit the server to expose <br>
only a specific subset of devices connected to the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t number <br>
sets pointer acceleration threshold in pixels (i.e. after
how many pixels pointer acceleration should take
effect).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-terminate <br>
causes the server to terminate at server reset, instead of
continuing to run. This overrides a previous -noreset
command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-to seconds <br>
sets default connection timeout in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tst disables all testing
extensions (e.g., XTEST, XTrap, XTestExtension1,
RECORD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttyxx ignored, for servers
started the ancient way (from init).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v sets video-off screen-saver
preference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v sets video-on screen-saver
preference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wm forces the default
backing-store of all windows to be WhenMapped. This is a
backdoor way of getting backing-store to apply to all
windows. Although all mapped windows <br>
will have backing store, the backing store attribute value
reported by the server for a window will be the last value
established by a client. If it has never been set <br>
by a client, the server will report the default value,
NotUseful. This behavior is required by the X protocol,
which allows the server to exceed the client&rsquo;s backing
<br>
store expectations but does not provide a way to tell the
client that it is doing so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wr sets the default root window
to solid white instead of the standard root weave
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x extension <br>
loads the specified extension at init. This is a no-op for
most implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+-]xinerama <br>
enables(+) or disables(-) the XINERAMA extension. The
default state is platform and configuration specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER DEPENDENT OPTIONS <br>
Some X servers accept the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ld kilobytes <br>
sets the data space limit of the server to the specified
number of kilobytes. A value of zero makes the data size as
large as possible. The default value of -1 leaves <br>
the data space limit unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lf files <br>
sets the number-of-open-files limit of the server to the
specified number. A value of zero makes the limit as large
as possible. The default value of -1 leaves the <br>
limit unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls kilobytes <br>
sets the stack space limit of the server to the specified
number of kilobytes. A value of zero makes the stack size as
large as possible. The default value of -1 leaves <br>
the stack space limit unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxclients <br>
64|128|256|512 Set the maximum number of clients allowed to
connect to the X server. Acceptable values are 64, 128, 256
or 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-render default|mono|gray|color
sets the color allocation policy that will be used by the
render extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default selects the default
policy defined for the display depth of the X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mono don&rsquo;t use any color
cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gray use a gray map of 13 color
cells for the X render extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color use a color cube of at
most 4*4*4 colors (that is 64 color cells).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumbSched <br>
disables smart scheduling on platforms that support the
smart scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-schedInterval interval <br>
sets the smart scheduler&rsquo;s scheduling interval to
interval milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XDMCP OPTIONS <br>
X servers that support XDMCP have the following options. See
the X Display Manager Control Protocol specification for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-query hostname <br>
enables XDMCP and sends Query packets to the specified
hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-broadcast <br>
enable XDMCP and broadcasts BroadcastQuery packets to the
network. The first responding display manager will be chosen
for the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multicast [address [hop count]]
<br>
Enable XDMCP and multicast BroadcastQuery packets to the
network. The first responding display manager is chosen for
the session. If an address is specified, the mul&acirc; <br>
ticast is sent to that address. If no address is specified,
the multicast is sent to the default XDMCP IPv6 multicast
group. If a hop count is specified, it is used as <br>
the maximum hop count for the multicast. If no hop count is
specified, the multicast is set to a maximum of 1 hop, to
prevent the multicast from being routed beyond the <br>
local network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-indirect hostname <br>
enables XDMCP and send IndirectQuery packets to the
specified hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-port port-number <br>
uses the specified port-number for XDMCP packets, instead of
the default. This option must be specified before any
-query, -broadcast, -multicast, or -indirect options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-from local-address <br>
specifies the local address to connect from (useful if the
connecting host has multiple network interfaces). The
local-address may be expressed in any form acceptable to
<br>
the host platform&rsquo;s gethostbyname(3)
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-once causes the server to
terminate (rather than reset) when the XDMCP session
ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-class display-class <br>
XDMCP has an additional display qualifier used in resource
lookup for display-specific options. This option sets that
value, by default it is &quot;MIT-Unspecified&quot; (not a
<br>
very useful value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cookie xdm-auth-bits <br>
When testing XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1, a private key is shared
between the server and the manager. This option sets the
value of that private data (not that it is very pri&acirc;
<br>
vate, being on the command line!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-displayID display-id <br>
Yet another XDMCP specific value, this one allows the
display manager to identify each display so that it can
locate the shared key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XKEYBOARD OPTIONS <br>
X servers that support the XKEYBOARD (a.k.a.
&quot;XKB&quot;) extension accept the following options. All
layout files specified on the command line must be located
in the XKB base direc&acirc; <br>
tory or a subdirectory, and specified as the relative path
from the XKB base directory. The default XKB base directory
is /usr/lib/X11/xkb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+-]accessx [ timeout [
timeout_mask [ feedback [ options_mask ] ] ] ] <br>
enables(+) or disables(-) AccessX key sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xkbdir directory <br>
base directory for keyboard layout files. This option is not
available for setuid X servers (i.e., when the X
server&rsquo;s real and effective uids are different).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ardelay milliseconds <br>
sets the autorepeat delay (length of time in milliseconds
that a key must be depressed before autorepeat starts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arinterval milliseconds <br>
sets the autorepeat interval (length of time in milliseconds
that should elapse between autorepeat-generated
keystrokes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xkbmap filename <br>
loads keyboard description in filename on server
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETWORK CONNECTIONS <br>
The X server supports client connections via a
platform-dependent subset of the following transport types:
TCPIP, Unix Domain sockets, DECnet, and several varieties of
SVR4 local <br>
connections. See the DISPLAY NAMES section of the X(7)
manual page to learn how to specify which transport type
clients should try to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRANTING ACCESS <br>
The X server implements a platform-dependent subset of the
following authorization protocols: MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1,
XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2, SUN-DES-1, and
MIT- <br>
KERBEROS-5. See the Xsecurity(7) manual page for information
on the operation of these protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authorization data required by
the above protocols is passed to the server in a private
file named with the -auth command line option. Each time the
server is about to accept <br>
the first connection after a reset (or when the server is
starting), it reads this file. If this file contains any
authorization records, the local host is not automatically
<br>
allowed access to the server, and only clients which send
one of the authorization records contained in the file in
the connection setup information will be allowed access. See
<br>
the Xau manual page for a description of the binary format
of this file. See xauth(1) for maintenance of this file, and
distribution of its contents to remote hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X server also uses a
host-based access control list for deciding whether or not
to accept connections from clients on a particular machine.
If no other authorization mecha&acirc; <br>
nism is being used, this list initially consists of the host
on which the server is running as well as any machines
listed in the file /etc/Xn.hosts, where n is the display
num&acirc; <br>
ber of the server. Each line of the file should contain
either an Internet hostname (e.g. expo.lcs.mit.edu) or a
DECnet hostname in double colon format (e.g. hydra::) or a
com&acirc; <br>
plete name in the format family:name as described in the
xhost(1) manual page. There should be no leading or trailing
spaces on any lines. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">joesworkstation <br>
corporate.company.com <br>
star:: <br>
inet:bigcpu <br>
local:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users can add or remove hosts
from this list and enable or disable access control using
the xhost command from the same machine as the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the X FireWall Proxy (xfwp)
is being used without a sitepolicy, host-based authorization
must be turned on for clients to be able to connect to the X
server via the xfwp. If <br>
xfwp is run without a configuration file and thus no
sitepolicy is defined, if xfwp is using an X server where
xhost + has been run to turn off host-based authorization
checks, <br>
when a client tries to connect to this X server via xfwp,
the X server will deny the connection. See xfwp(1) for more
information about this proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X protocol intrinsically
does not have any notion of window operation permissions or
place any restrictions on what a client can do; if a program
can connect to a display, it <br>
has full run of the screen. X servers that support the
SECURITY extension fare better because clients can be
designated untrusted via the authorization they use to
connect; see <br>
the xauth(1) manual page for details. Restrictions are
imposed on untrusted clients that curtail the mischief they
can do. See the SECURITY extension specification for a
com&acirc; <br>
plete list of these restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sites that have better
authentication and authorization systems might wish to make
use of the hooks in the libraries and the server to provide
additional security models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The X server attaches special meaning to the following
signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP This signal causes the
server to close all existing connections, free all
resources, and restore all defaults. It is sent by the
display manager whenever the main user&rsquo;s <br>
main application (usually an xterm or window manager) exits
to force the server to clean up and prepare for the next
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM This signal causes the
server to exit cleanly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 This signal is used
quite differently from either of the above. When the server
starts, it checks to see if it has inherited SIGUSR1 as
SIG_IGN instead of the usual <br>
SIG_DFL. In this case, the server sends a SIGUSR1 to its
parent process after it has set up the various connection
schemes. Xdm uses this feature to recognize when con&acirc;
<br>
necting to the server is possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONTS <br>
The X server can obtain fonts from directories and/or from
font servers. The list of directories and font servers the X
server uses when trying to open a font is controlled by <br>
the font path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default font path is
catalogue:/etc/X11/fontpath.d,built-ins .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special kind of directory can
be specified using the catalogue: prefix. Directories
specified this way can contain symlinks pointing to the real
font directories. See the FONT&acirc; <br>
PATH.D section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The font path can be set with
the -fp option or by xset(1) after the server has
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONTPATH.D <br>
You can specify a special kind of font path in the form
catalogue:&lt;dir&gt;. The directory specified after the
catalogue: prefix will be scanned for symlinks and each
symlink desti&acirc; <br>
nation will be added as a local fontfile FPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The symlink can be suffixed by
attributes such as &rsquo;unscaled&rsquo;, which will be
passed through to the underlying fontfile FPE. The only
exception is the newly introduced &rsquo;pri&rsquo; <br>
attribute, which will be used for ordering the font paths
specified by the symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">75dpi:unscaled:pri=20 -&gt;
/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi <br>
ghostscript:pri=60 -&gt;
/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript <br>
misc:unscaled:pri=10 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc <br>
type1:pri=40 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1 <br>
type1:pri=50 -&gt; /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will add
/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc as the first FPE with the
attribute &rsquo;unscaled&rsquo;, second FPE will be
/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi, also with the attribute
&rsquo;unscaled&rsquo; etc. <br>
This is functionally equivalent to setting the following
font path:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
<br>
/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled, <br>
/usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1, <br>
