<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster data in GRASS GIS <br>
3D raster maps in general <br>
GRASS GIS is one of the few GIS software packages with 3D
raster data support. Data are stored as a 3D raster with 3D
cells of a given volume. 3D rasters are designed to
sup&acirc; <br>
port representations of trivariate continuous fields. The
vertical dimension supports spatial and temporal units.
Hence space time 3D raster with different temporal
resolutions <br>
can be created and processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS 3D raster maps use the
same coordinate system as 2D raster maps (row count from
north to south) with an additional z dimension (depth)
counting from bottom to top. The <br>
upper left corner (NW) is the origin. 3D rasters are stored
using a tile cache based approach. This allows arbitrary
read and write operations in the created 3D raster. The size
<br>
of the tiles can be specified at import time with a given
import module such as r3.in.ascii or the data can be retiled
using r3.retile after import or creation. <br>
The 3D raster map coordinate system and the internal tile
layout of the RASTER3D library</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminology and naming <br>
In GRASS GIS terminology, continuous 3D data represented by
regular grid or lattice is called 3D raster map. 3D raster
map works in 3D in the same was as (2D) raster map in 2D,
<br>
so it is called the same except for the additional 3D. Some
literature or other software may use terms such as 3D grid,
3D lattice, 3D matrix, 3D array, volume, voxel, voxel <br>
model, or voxel cube. Note that terms volume and volumetric
often refer to measuring volume (amount) of some substance
which may or may not be related to 3D rasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that GRASS GIS uses the
term 3D raster map or just 3D raster for short, rather than
3D raster layer because term map emphasizes the mapping of
positions to values which is <br>
the purpose of 3D raster map (in mathematics, map or mapping
is close to a term function) On the other hand, the term
layer emphasizes overlaying or stacking up. The former is
<br>
not the only operation done with data and the latter could
be confusing in case of 3D raster data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster map is divided into
cells in the same way as the (2D) raster map. A cell is a
cube or a (rectangular) cuboid depending on the resolution.
The resolution influences <br>
volume of one cell. Some literature or other software may
use terms such as volume, volume unit, volumetric pixel,
volume pixel, or voxel. Note that voxel can be sometimes
used <br>
to refer to a whole 3D raster and that for example in 3D
computer graphics, voxel can denote object with some
complicated shape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type of map and element name in
GRASS GIS is called raster_3d. The module family prefix is
r3. Occasionally, 3D raster related things can be referred
differently, for example <br>
according to a programming language standards. This might be
the case of some functions or classes in Python.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In GRASS GIS 3D rasters as
stored in tiles which are hidden from user most of the time.
When analyzing or visualizing 3D rasters user can create
slices or cross sections. Slices <br>
can be horizontal, vertical, or general plains going through
a 3D raster. Slices, especially the horizontal ones, may be
called layers in some literature or some other software.
<br>
Cross sections are general functions, e.g. defined by 2D
raster, going through a 3D raster. Another often used term
is an isosuface which has the same relation to 3D raster as
<br>
contour (isoline) to a 2D raster. An isosurface is a surface
that represent places with a constant value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When 3D raster is used in the
way that vertical dimension represents time 3D raster can be
referred to as space time cubes (STC) or space time cube 3D
raster. Some literature may <br>
also use space time voxel cube, space time voxel model or
some other combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster import <br>
The modules r3.in.ascii and r3.in.bin supports generic x,y,z
ASCII and binary array import. Alternatively, 3D rasters can
be generated from 3D point vector data (v.to.rast3). <br>
Always the full map is imported. 3D raster can also be
created based on 2D elevation map(s) and value raster map(s)
(r.to.rast3elev). Alternatively, a 3D raster can be composed
<br>
of several 2D raster maps. 2D rasters are considered as
slices in this case and merged into one 3D raster map
(r.to.rast3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import of 3D points and their
statistics can be done using r3.in.lidar for LiDAR data and
r3.in.xyz for CSV and other ASCII text formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D region settings and 3D MASK
<br>
GRASS GIS 3D raster map processing is always performed in
the current 3D region settings (see g.region, -p3 flags),
i.e. the current region extent, vertical extent and current
<br>
3D resolution are used. If the 3D resolution differs from
that of the input raster map(s), on-the-fly resampling is
performed (nearest neighbor resampling). If this is not <br>
desired, the input map(s) has/have to be reinterpolated
beforehand with one of the dedicated modules. Masks can be
set (r3.mask).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster analyses and
operations <br>
Powerful 3D raster map algebra is implemented in r3.mapcalc.
A 3D groundwater flow model is implemented in r3.gwflow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster conversion to vector
or 2D raster maps <br>
Slices from a 3D raster map can be converted to a 2D raster
map (r3.to.rast). Cross sectional 2D raster map can be
extracted from 3D raster map based on a 2D elevation map
<br>
(r3.cross.rast).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster statistics <br>
3D raster statistics can be calculated with r3.stats and
r3.univar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster interpolation <br>
From 3D vector points, GRASS 3D raster maps can be
interpolated (v.vol.rst). Results are 3D raster maps,
however 2D raster maps can be also extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster export <br>
The modules r3.out.ascii and r3.out.bin support the export
of 3D raster maps as ASCII or binary files. The output of
these modules can be imported with the corresponding import
<br>
modules noted above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NetCDF export of 3D raster maps
can be performed using the module r3.out.netcdf. It supports
3D raster maps with spatial dimensions and temporal
(vertical) dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Working with 3D visualization
software <br>
GRASS GIS can be used for visualization of 3D rasters,
however it has also tools to easily export the data into
other visualization packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS 3D raster maps can be
exported to VTK using r3.out.vtk. VTK files can be
visualized with the VTK Toolkit, Paraview and MayaVi.
Moreover, GRASS GIS 2D raster maps can <br>
be exported to VTK with r.out.vtk and GRASS GIS vector maps
can be exported to VTK with v.out.vtk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, GRASS 3D raster
maps can be imported and exported from/to Vis5D (r3.in.v5d,
r3.out.v5d).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster data types <br>
3D raster&acirc;s single-precision data type is most often
called &quot;FCELL&quot; or &quot;float&quot;, and the
double-precision one &quot;DCELL&quot; or
&quot;double&quot;.</p>
