GRASS GIS is one of the few GIS software packages with 3D raster data support.
  Data are stored as a 3D raster with 3D cells of a given volume. 3D rasters are
  designed to support representations of trivariate continuous fields. The
  vertical dimension supports spatial and temporal units. Hence space time 3D
  raster with different temporal resolutions can be created and processed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GRASS GIS 3D raster maps use the same coordinate system as 2D raster maps (row
  count from north to south) with an additional z dimension (depth) counting
  from bottom to top. The upper left corner (NW) is the origin. 3D rasters are
  stored using a tile cache based approach. This allows arbitrary read and write
  operations in the created 3D raster. The size of the tiles can be specified at
  import time with a given import module such as r3.in.ascii or the data can be
  retiled using r3.retile after import or creation.

  and naming</a></h2>
In GRASS GIS terminology, continuous 3D data represented by regular grid or
  lattice is called <i>3D raster map</i>. 3D raster map works in 3D in the same
  was as (2D) raster map in 2D, so it is called the same except for the
  additional 3D. Some literature or other software may use terms such as 3D
  grid, 3D lattice, 3D matrix, 3D array, volume, voxel, voxel model, or voxel
  cube. Note that terms volume and volumetric often refer to measuring volume
  (amount) of some substance which may or may not be related to 3D rasters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that GRASS GIS uses the term 3D raster map or just 3D raster for short,
  rather than 3D raster layer because term map emphasizes the mapping of
  positions to values which is the purpose of 3D raster map (in mathematics, map
  or mapping is close to a term function) On the other hand, the term layer
  emphasizes overlaying or stacking up. The former is not the only operation
  done with data and the latter could be confusing in case of 3D raster data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3D raster map is divided into cells in the same way as the (2D) raster map. A
  cell is a cube or a (rectangular) cuboid depending on the resolution. The
  resolution influences volume of one cell. Some literature or other software
  may use terms such as volume, volume unit, volumetric pixel, volume pixel, or
  voxel. Note that voxel can be sometimes used to refer to a whole 3D raster and
  that for example in 3D computer graphics, voxel can denote object with some
  complicated shape.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Type of map and element name in GRASS GIS is called raster_3d. The module family
  prefix is r3. Occasionally, 3D raster related things can be referred
  differently, for example according to a programming language standards. This
  might be the case of some functions or classes in Python.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In GRASS GIS 3D rasters as stored in tiles which are hidden from user most of
  the time. When analyzing or visualizing 3D rasters user can create slices or
  cross sections. Slices can be horizontal, vertical, or general plains going
  through a 3D raster. Slices, especially the horizontal ones, may be called
  layers in some literature or some other software. Cross sections are general
  functions, e.g. defined by 2D raster, going through a 3D raster. Another often
  used term is an isosuface which has the same relation to 3D raster as contour
  (isoline) to a 2D raster. An isosurface is a surface that represent places
  with a constant value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When 3D raster is used in the way that vertical dimension represents time 3D
  raster can be referred to as space time cubes (STC) or space time cube 3D
  raster. Some literature may also use space time voxel cube, space time voxel
  model or some other combination.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="3D_raster_import"><a class="selflink" href="#3D_raster_import">3D
  raster import</a></h2>
The modules r3.in.ascii and r3.in.bin supports generic x,y,z ASCII and binary
  array import. Alternatively, 3D rasters can be generated from 3D point vector
  data (v.to.rast3). Always the full map is imported. 3D raster can also be
  created based on 2D elevation map(s) and value raster map(s) (r.to.rast3elev).
  Alternatively, a 3D raster can be composed of several 2D raster maps. 2D
  rasters are considered as slices in this case and merged into one 3D raster
  map (r.to.rast3).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Import of 3D points and their statistics can be done using r3.in.lidar for LiDAR
  data and r3.in.xyz for CSV and other ASCII text formats.

GRASS GIS 3D raster map processing is always performed in the current 3D region
  settings (see g.region, <i>-p3</i> flags), i.e. the current region extent,
  vertical extent and current 3D resolution are used. If the 3D resolution
  differs from that of the input raster map(s), on-the-fly resampling is
  performed (nearest neighbor resampling). If this is not desired, the input
  map(s) has/have to be reinterpolated beforehand with one of the dedicated
  modules. Masks can be set (r3.mask).

Powerful 3D raster map algebra is implemented in r3.mapcalc. A 3D groundwater
  flow model is implemented in r3.gwflow.

  raster conversion to vector or 2D raster maps</a></h2>
Slices from a 3D raster map can be converted to a 2D raster map (r3.to.rast).
  Cross sectional 2D raster map can be extracted from 3D raster map based on a
  2D elevation map (r3.cross.rast).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="3D_raster_statistics"><a class="selflink" href="#3D_raster_statistics">3D

3D raster statistics can be calculated with r3.stats and r3.univar.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="3D_raster_interpolation"><a class="selflink" href="#3D_raster_interpolation">3D
  raster interpolation</a></h2>
From 3D vector points, GRASS 3D raster maps can be interpolated (v.vol.rst).
  Results are 3D raster maps, however 2D raster maps can be also extracted.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="3D_raster_export"><a class="selflink" href="#3D_raster_export">3D
  raster export</a></h2>
The modules r3.out.ascii and r3.out.bin support the export of 3D raster maps as
  ASCII or binary files. The output of these modules can be imported with the
  corresponding import modules noted above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
NetCDF export of 3D raster maps can be performed using the module r3.out.netcdf.
  It supports 3D raster maps with spatial dimensions and temporal (vertical)
  dimension.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Working_with_3D_visualization_software"><a class="selflink" href="#Working_with_3D_visualization_software">Working

GRASS GIS can be used for visualization of 3D rasters, however it has also tools
  to easily export the data into other visualization packages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GRASS GIS 3D raster maps can be exported to VTK using r3.out.vtk. VTK files can
  be visualized with the <i>VTK Toolkit</i>, <i>Paraview</i> and <i>MayaVi</i>.
  Moreover, GRASS GIS 2D raster maps can be exported to VTK with r.out.vtk and
  GRASS GIS vector maps can be exported to VTK with v.out.vtk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, GRASS 3D raster maps can be imported and exported from/to
  <i>Vis5D</i> (r3.in.v5d, r3.out.v5d).

3D raster&#x2019;s single-precision data type is most often called
  &quot;FCELL&quot; or &quot;float&quot;, and the double-precision one
  &quot;DCELL&quot; or &quot;double&quot;.
