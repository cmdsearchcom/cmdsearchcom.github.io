<p>MAKEPATCH(1p) User Contributed Perl Documentation
MAKEPATCH(1p)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepatch - create script to update a source tree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
makepatch [ options ] old-src new-src</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Introduction <br>
Traditionally, source trees are updated with the patch
program, processing patch information that is generated by
the diff program. Although diff and patch do a very good job
at <br>
patching file contents, most versions do not handle creating
and deleting files and directories, and adjusting of file
modes and time stamps. Newer versions of diff and patch <br>
seem to be able to create files, and very new versions of
patch can remove files. But that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another typical problem is that
patch kits are typically downloaded from the Internet, or
transmitted via electronic mail. It is often desirable to
verify the correctness of a <br>
patch kit before even attempting to apply it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The makepatch package is
designed to overcome these limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The makepatch package contains two Perl programs: makepatch
and applypatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepatch will generate a patch
kit from two source trees. It traverses the source directory
and runs a diff on each pair of corresponding files,
accumulating the output into a <br>
patch kit. It knows about the conventions for patch kits: if
a file named &quot;patchlevel.h&quot; exists, it is handled
first, so patch can check the version of the source tree.
Also, to <br>
deal with the non-perfect versions of patch that are in use,
it supplies &quot;&quot;Index:&quot;&quot; and
&quot;&quot;Prereq:&quot;&quot; lines, so patch can
correctly locate the files to patch, and it relocates the
<br>
patch to the current directory to avoid problems with
creating new files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of files can be
specified in a so called MANIFEST file, but it can also be
generated by recursively traversing the source tree. Files
can be excluded using shell style <br>
wildcards and Perl regex patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But that is not it! makepatch
also inserts some additional information in the patch kit
for use by the applypatch program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to emphasize
that the generated patch kit is still valid input for patch.
When used with patch, there are no verifications and
problems may arise when new files <br>
need to be created. makepatch prepends a small shell script
in front of the patch kit that creates the necessary files
and directories for the patch process. If you can not run
<br>
applypatch for some reason, you can run the patch kit as a
shell script to prepare the source directory for the
patching process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The applypatch program will do
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It will
extensively verify that the patch kit is complete and not
corrupted during transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It will apply
some heuristics to verify that the directory in which the
patch will be applied does indeed contain the expected
sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It creates files
and directories as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It applies the
patch by running the patch program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Upon completion,
obsolete files, directories and &quot;.orig&quot; files are
removed, file modes of new files are set, and the timestamps
of all patched files are adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that applypatch only
requires the patch program. It does not rely on a shell or
shell tools. This makes it possible to apply patches on
non-Unix systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General usage <br>
Suppose you have an archive
&lsquo;&quot;pkg-1.6.tar.gz&quot;&rsquo; containing the
sources for package &lsquo;&quot;pkg&quot;&rsquo; version
1.6, and a directory tree &lsquo;&quot;pkg-1.7&quot;&rsquo;
containing the sources for version 1.7. <br>
The following command will generate a patch kit that updates
the 1.6 sources into their 1.7 versions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepatch pkg-1.6.tar.gz pkg-1.7
&gt; pkg-1.6-1.7.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To apply this script, go to the
directory containing the 1.6 sources and feed the script to
applypatch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd old/pkg-1.6 <br>
applypatch pkg-1.6-1.7.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">applypatch will verify that it
is executing in the right place and make all necessary
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, makepatch will
provide a few lines of progress information, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting pkg-1.6.tar.gz to
/tmp/mp21575.d/old... <br>
Manifest MANIFEST for pkg-1.6 contains 1083 files. <br>
Manifest MANIFEST for pkg-1.7 contains 1292 files. <br>
Processing the filelists ... <br>
Collecting patches ... <br>
266 files need to be patched. <br>
216 files and 8 directories need to be created. <br>
7 files need to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">applypatch will provide no
feedback information by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepatch arguments <br>
makepatch requires two arguments: old_src and new_src.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old-src <br>
This is the name of either a single file or a directory that
contains copies of the older version of the target files; in
other words, copies of the files prior to any <br>
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, it may be the
name of an archive that holds the files to be processed.
Allowable archive formats are gzipped tar (name ends in
&quot;&quot;.tar.gz&quot;&quot; or
&quot;&quot;.tgz&quot;&quot;), <br>
bzipped tar (name ends in &quot;&quot;.tar.bz2&quot;&quot;),
plain tar (name ends in &quot;&quot;.tar&quot;&quot; and zip
(name ends in &quot;&quot;.zip&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-src <br>
This is the name of either a single file or a directory that
contains copies of the newer version of the target files; in
other words, copies of the files after the <br>
modifications have been made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, it may be the
name of an archive that holds the files to be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The patch script generated by
makepatch will take care of creating new files and
directories, update existing files, and remove files and
directories that are no longer present <br>
in the new-src directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANIFEST files <br>
The purpose of a manifest file is to provide the list of
files that constitute a package. Manifest files are
traditionally called &quot;&quot;MANIFEST&quot;&quot; and
reside in the top level <br>
directory of the package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although there is no formal
standard for the contents of manifest files, makepatch uses
the following rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the second
line from the manifest file looks like a separator line
(e.g. it is empty, or contains only dashes), it is discarded
and so is the first line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Empty lines and
lines that start with a &quot;#&quot; are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If there are
multiple space-separated &quot;words&quot; on a line, the
first word is considered to be the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default treatment <br>
By default, makepatch looks for files named
&quot;&quot;MANIFEST&quot;&quot; in the top level
directories of the old and the new source trees. If these
files (or one of them) are found, they are <br>
used. If no manifest file could be found, the package is
assumed to consist of all files in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default name of the default
manifest file can be modified with the command line option
&quot;&quot;-automanifest&quot;&quot;, see Section
&quot;Command line options&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicitly naming of manifest
files <br>
Command line options &quot;&quot;-oldmanifest&quot;&quot;
and &quot;&quot;-newmanifest&quot;&quot; can be used to
explicitly designate old and new manifest files. Option
&quot;&quot;-manifest&quot;&quot; is a short way to set one
manifest <br>
file for both the old and new source trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress manifest file
processing <br>
Command line option &quot;&quot;-nomanifest&quot;&quot; can
be used to suppress all manifest file processing. The
package is assumed to consist of all files in the source
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepatch options <br>
makepatch takes several options to control its behaviour.
Options are usually specified on the command line, but
makepatch can take options from three sources in the
following <br>
order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environment
variable MAKEPATCHINIT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this environment variable
is set its contents are considered to be command line
options that are processed upon startup. All normal options
are allowed, plus one: <br>
-rcfile filename. Option -rcfile can be used to specify an
alternate option file, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Options
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepatch first tries to process
a file named /etc/makepatchrc. (This is a Unix-ism.) It is
okay if this file is missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, makepatch will process a
file named .makepatchrc in the user&rsquo;s home directory,
if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After processing this file,
makepatch will process a file named .makepatchrc in the
current directory, if it exists. An alternative name for
this file can be specified with <br>
option -rcfile in environment variable MAKEPATCHINIT. This
is the only way to specify an alternative options file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all option files, empty lines
and lines starting with &quot;;&quot; or &quot;#&quot; are
ignored. All other lines are considered to contain options
exactly as if they had been supplied on the <br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options <br>
Options are matched case insensitive, and may be abbreviated
to uniqueness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-description text <br>
Provide a descriptive text for this patch. Multiple
-description options may be supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no description is provided,
the program try to guess one. This is usually possible if
both directories are simple names, e.g.
&rsquo;&quot;pkg-1.16&quot;&rsquo;. If no description can be
<br>
determined, the program will ask for one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-diff cmd <br>
If specified, cmd is the command to be used to generate the
differences between the two versions of the files. If not
specified, this command defaults to &quot;&quot;diff
-c&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, only use
&quot;&quot;diff -c&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;diff
-u&quot;&quot;. In any case, it must produce either context
or unified diff output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-patchlevel pfile <br>
If specified, pfile indicates an alternate file that is to
be used in lieu of &quot;patchlevel.h&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-automanifest mfile <br>
makepatch will automatically use manifest files of the given
name if they appear in the directories. The default name is
&quot;MANIFEST&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomanifest <br>
Suppress using manifest files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-manifest mfile <br>
If specified, mfile indicates the name of the manifest file
which consists of a list of the files contained in both the
old and the new directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oldmanifest omfile <br>
If specified, omfile indicates the name of the manifest file
which consists of a list of the files contained in the old
directory. This option is designed to be used in <br>
conjunction with the -newmanifest option. Note that the old
and new directories must still be indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newmanifest nmfile <br>
If specified, nmfile indicates the name of the manifest file
which consists of a list of the files contained in the new
directory. This option is designed to be used in <br>
conjunction with the -oldmanifest option. Note that the old
and new directories must still be indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]recurse <br>
makepatch recurses through directories by default. Option
-norecurse prevents recursion beyond the initial
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]follow <br>
If set, symbolic links to directories are traversed as if
they were real directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-infocmd command <br>
If specified, the output of running command will be added
before each patch chunk. command will undergo the following
substitutions first: %oP will be replaced by the name of
<br>
the old file, %nP will be replaced by the name of the new
file. &quot;%%&quot; will be replaced by a single
&quot;%&quot;; other &quot;%&quot; sequences may be added in
future versions. When a new file is <br>
being created, the name of the new file will be supplied for
both %oP and %nP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that %oP and %nP are
modeled after the &quot;%&quot; sequences of find
-printf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exclude pattern <br>
If specified, files that match the shell pattern pattern
will be excluded. Only wildcard characters &quot;*&quot; and
&quot;?&quot;, and character classes &quot;[...]&quot; are
handled. Multiple -exclude <br>
options may be supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exclude-regex pattern <br>
If specified, files and directories that match the Perl
regular expression pattern pattern will be excluded.
Multiple -exclude-regex options may be supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]exclude-standard <br>
Set by default. If set, a common set of files and
directories are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also section &quot;Standard
Exclude Patterns&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]exclude-cvs <br>
If set, files and directories that are usually part of
version control system CVS are excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, &quot;.cvsignore&quot;
files are honoured just like CVS does it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also section &quot;Standard
Exclude Patterns&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]exclude-rcs <br>
If set, files and directories that are usually part of
version control system RCS are excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also section &quot;Standard
Exclude Patterns&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]exclude-sccs <br>
If set, files and directories that are usually part of
version control system SCCS are excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also section &quot;Standard
Exclude Patterns&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]exclude-vc <br>
Short for (re)setting -exclude-rcs, -exclude-cvs, and
-exclude-sccs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]ignore-cvs-keywords <br>
Differences in CVS keyword data (e.g. &quot;Id&quot;,
&quot;Header&quot;, &quot;Revision&quot;) are ignored,
provided there are no other differences in the same hunk.
This option passes a very hairy <br>
regex to the --ignore-matching-lines option of the diff
program, and hence requires GNU diff. This restriction may
be lifted in a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]ignore-rcs-keywords <br>
Same as -[no]ignore-cvs-keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extract pattern=command <br>
Define additional extraction rules for archives. If the name
of the source or destination matches the Perl pattern, the
command is executed with the archive on standard input <br>
and the current directory set to the location where the
files must be extracted. Multiple -extract options may be
supplied. User defined rules override built-in rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin rules are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.+.(tar.gz|tgz) =&gt; &quot;gzip
-d | tar xpf -&quot; <br>
.+.(tar.bz2) =&gt; &quot;bzip2 -d | tar xpf -&quot; <br>
.+.tar =&gt; &quot;tar xf -&quot; <br>
.+.zip =&gt; &quot;unzip -&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The patterns are implicitly
anchored to the begin and end of the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]ident <br>
If set, the program name and version is reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]verbose <br>
This is set by default, making makepatch display information
concerning its activity to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]quiet <br>
The opposite of -verbose. If set, this instructs makepatch
to suppress the display of activity information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[no]help <br>
If set, this causes a short help message to be displayed,
after which the program immediately exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard Exclude Patterns <br>
The following file patterns are always excluded:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*~ *.a *.bak *.BAK *.elc *.exe
*.gz *.ln *.o *.obj <br>
*.olb *.old *.orig *.rej *.so *.Z <br>
.del-* .make.state .nse_depinfo core <br>
tags TAGS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -exclude-sccs adds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p.* s.* SCCS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -exclude-rcs adds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">,* *,v RCS RCSLOG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -exclude-cvs adds
&quot;.cvsignore&quot; patterns, and:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.#* #* _$* *$ CVS CVS.adm
cvslog.*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please let me know if I missed
some.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment variables <br>
MAKEPATCHINIT <br>
When this environment variable is set its contents is
considered to be command line options that are processed
upon startup. All normal options are allowed, plus one:
-rcfile <br>
filename. If -rcfile is specified, the file is read and all
lines of it are considered to contain option settings as
described in section &quot;Makepatch options&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR <br>
&quot;TMPDIR&quot; can be used to designate the area where
temporary files are placed. It defaults to
&quot;/tmp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMP <br>
&quot;TEMP&quot; can be used as an alternative to
&quot;TMPDIR&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
Suppose you have a directory tree
&lsquo;&quot;pkg-1.6&quot;&rsquo; containing the sources for
package &lsquo;&quot;pkg&quot;&rsquo; version 1.6, and a
directory tree &lsquo;&quot;pkg-1.7&quot;&rsquo; containing
the sources for version 1.7. The <br>
following command will generate a patch kit that updates the
1.6 sources into their 1.7 versions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepatch pkg-1.6 pkg-1.7 &gt;
pkg-1.6-1.7.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To apply this script, go to the
pkg-1.6 directory and feed the script to applypatch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd old/pkg-1.6 <br>
applypatch pkg-1.6-1.7.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">applypatch will verify that it
is executing in the right place and make all necessary
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is one way to generate and
use manifest files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(cd pkg-1.6; find . -type f
-print &gt; OLDMANIFEST)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(cd pkg-1.7; find . -type f
-print &gt; NEWMANIFEST)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepatch -oldmanifest
pkg-1.6/OLDMANIFEST -newmanifest pkg-1.7/NEWMANIFEST pkg-1.6
pkg-1.7 &gt; pkg-1.6-1.7.diff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs and restrictions <br>
Much of the job of makepatch is processing file names.
makepatch has been tested extensively on Unix systems, but
it is not guaranteed to work on other systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">applypatch is repeatedly
reported to correctly process makepatch generated patch kits
on modern 32-bit Windows systems as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepatch does not know about
symbolic links. These will be treated like plain files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wrong results can be generated
if the file lists that are used or generated use different
path separators.</p>
