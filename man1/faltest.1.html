<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faltest - Falcon unit test interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
faltest [-d unit_test_dir] [options] [unit_list]
module_file.fam</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The faltest command line tool is a powerful interface to the
Falcon unit testing system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic working principle of
faltest is that of taking all the .fal script files
contained in a directory, compile and execute them,
eventually keeping track of errors, elapsed <br>
times and execution failures. After running all the scripts,
faltest may print a report on what happened if requested to
do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of one or more unit test
may be indicated in the faltest command line after the
options. Also, the executed tests can be limited to named
subsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unit test directory is added
to the module load path, so load directives will be resolved
searching the required scripts in the test path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIT TEST SCRIPTS <br>
Scripts being part of unit test have to start with a common
header indicating some information about them. The header is
actually a formatted Falcon comment which is read by the
<br>
faltest utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a typical header:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/**********************************************
<br>
* Falcon test suite <br>
* <br>
* ID: 10a <br>
* Category: cat-name <br>
* Subcategory: subcat-name <br>
* Short: The short name <br>
* Description: <br>
* Long description of this test <br>
* Spanning on many lines... <br>
* [/Description] <br>
**********************************************/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header has a free form;
faltest recognizes the following fields, being inside a
comment and eventually preceded by a &quot;*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID: <br>
The only mandatory field, it declares the ID under which
this unit test is known. It will be used in listing the
tests and in selecting them as argument of the faltest <br>
command line. The id must be an integer number, eventually
followed by a single lowercase letter. Similar tests should
be filed under the same ID with a different specifi&acirc;
<br>
cation letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts not having this field
will be ignored by faltest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Category: <br>
The name of the category under which this test is filed.
Faltest can select a subset of scripts to be executed to a
certain category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subcategory: <br>
The name of the subcategory under which this test is filed.
Faltest can select a subset of scripts to be executed to a
certain subcategory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short: <br>
Short description (or symbolic name) for this unit test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description: <br>
A longer description explaining what this test is supposed
to do. The description always spans on more lines, and is
closed by a [/Description] tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE TESTSUITE MODULE <br>
Falcon system provides a loadable module called
&quot;testsuite&quot;. The module is actually embedded in
faltest , and is provided to all the scripts it runs. The
module provides the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">success() <br>
The script is terminated and recorded as a success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failure( reason ) <br>
The script is terminated and recorded as a failure. An
optional parameter containing a description of the failure
condition may be optionally provided; it will be written
<br>
as part of the report and may be used to track which part of
the test wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testReflect( item ) <br>
Returns the passed item. This is used to test for engine
responsiveness to external calls and item copy through
external functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alive( percent ) <br>
In tests running for some human sensible time, this function
should be called periodically to inform the system and the
user that the test is proceeding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional &quot;percent&quot;
parameter can be provided. It will be interpreted as a value
between 1 and 100 representing the amount of test that has
been performed up to this <br>
moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timings( total_time,
performed_ops ) <br>
In case the execution time is relevant for the test, like in
benchmarks, this function can be used to communicate back to
faltest the time elapsed in the operations being <br>
tested and the number of operations performed. Those
parameters will be recorded and eventually saved in the
report file, to be used as benchmarks against falcon engine
<br>
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeFactor() <br>
Lengthy tests are often performed by looping over the
operation to be tested for a certain time. Benchmarks and
performance tests should be written so that they can
nor&acirc; <br>
mally complete in a reasonable time, between one and ten
seconds. In case the user wants the tests to perform longer,
in order to obtain better statistical data, it can <br>
pass the -f (time factor) option to faltest command line.
The time factor will be a number greater than 1, and should
be used by tests that may perform lengthy operation <br>
to customize the number of performed tests. This function
returns as an integer value of the -f option given to
faltest or 1 if the -f option was not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c &lt;cat&gt; <br>
Select this category and ignore the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;subcat&gt; <br>
Select this subcategory and ignore the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Directory from where to load
the unit tests. If not specified, it will be the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;n&gt; Set time factor to
N. Some scripts may use this information to perform more
loops or lengthy operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show version and a short
help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the selected tests and
exit. Combine with -v to have the path of the tests, as -l
only lists the script ID, its short name and the
category/subcategory pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Do not compile in memory. Use
disk temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Checks for memory leaks. This
option makes faltest to report unclaimed memory after each
script execution, and a final report at the end of the
tests. The check is <br>
extended to all the engine operations, so errors in the
engine are detected too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;file&gt; <br>
Write final report to the given output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Perform module serialization
test. Other than compiling the file, the module is also
saved and then restored before being executed. This allows
to check for errors in <br>
module serialization (that is, loading of .fam files). The
operation is performed in memory, unless the option -m is
also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Compile via assembly. This
test the correct behavior of the assembler generator and
compiler instead of the binary module generator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Records and display timings.
The statistics of compilation, linking and execution overall
times are recorded and written as part of the report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Records timings() calls from
scripts. This allows the scripts to declare their own
performance ratings, and collects the results in the final
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. Normally,
execution and failures are sparsely reported. This is
because the normal execution mode is meant for automated
runs. Tests can be executed by auto&acirc; <br>
mated utilities and errors can be reported to system
administrator by simple checks on the output data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A developer willing to fix a
broken test must run that test alone with the -v enabled. A
more complete error report (including compilation or
execution errors, if they <br>
were the cause for the failure) will be then visualized. The
-v options also allows to see the path of the original
script, which is otherwise hidden (masked by the test&acirc;
<br>
suite ID).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints version number and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAMPLE <br>
This is a simple and complete example from the Falcon
benchmark suite.</p>
