<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gdiffmk - mark differences between groff/nroff/troff
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gdiffmk [ -aaddmark ] [ -cchangemark ] [ -ddeletemark ] [ -D
[ -B ] [ -Mmark1 mark2 ] ] [ -xdiffcmd ] [ -- ] [ --help ] [
--version ] file1 file2 [ output ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gdiffmk compares two groff(1), nroff(1), or troff(1)
documents, file1 and file2, and creates an output which is
file2 with added &lsquo;margin character&rsquo; (.mc)
commands that indicate <br>
the differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output filename is
present, the output is written there. If it is - or absent
the output is written to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file1 or file2 argument
is - the standard input is read for that input. Clearly both
cannot be -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the output is not
necessarily compatible with all macro packages and all
preprocessors. See the BUGS section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-aaddmark <br>
Use the addmark for source lines not in file1 but present in
file2. Default: +.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B By default, the deleted texts
marked by the -D option end with an added troff break
command, .br, to ensure that the deletions are marked
properly. This is the only way <br>
to guarantee that deletions and small changes get flagged.
This option directs the program not to insert these breaks;
it makes no sense to use it without -D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cchangemark <br>
Use the changemark for changed source lines. Default: |.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ddeletemark <br>
Use the deletemark for deleted source lines. Default: *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Show the deleted portions
from changed and deleted text. Default delimiting marks: [[
.... ]].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mmark1 mark2 <br>
Change the delimiting marks for the -D option. It makes no
sense to use this option without -D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xdiffcmd <br>
Use the diffcmd command to perform the comparison of file1
and file2. In particular, diffcmd should accept the GNU diff
-Dname option. Default: diff(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- All the following arguments
are treated as file names, even if they begin with -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a usage message on
standard error output and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version information on the standard output and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The output is not necessarily compatible with all macro
packages and all preprocessors. A workaround that is often
successful against preprocessor problems is to run gdiffmk
on <br>
the output of all the preprocessors instead of the input
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdiffmk relies on the -Dname
option of GNU diff(1) to make a merged &lsquo;#ifdef&rsquo;
output format. It hasn&rsquo;t been tested whether other
versions of diff(1) do support this option. See <br>
also the -xdiffcmd option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Report bugs to
bug-groff@gnu.org. Include a complete, self-contained
example that will allow the bug to be reproduced, and say
which version of gdiffmk you are using.</p>
