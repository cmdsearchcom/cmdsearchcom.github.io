<p>rdfind(1) rdfind rdfind(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rdfind - finds duplicate files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rdfind [ options ] directory1 | file1 [ directory2 | file2 ]
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rdfind finds duplicate files across and/or within several
directories. It calculates checksum only if necessary.
rdfind runs in O(Nlog(N)) time with N being the number of
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If two (or more) equal files are
found, the program decides which of them is the original and
the rest are considered duplicates. This is done by ranking
the files to each other <br>
and deciding which has the highest rank. See section RANKING
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need better control over
the ranking than given, you can use some preprocessor which
sorts the file names in desired order and then run the
program using xargs. See exam&acirc; <br>
ples below for how to use find and xargs in conjunction with
rdfind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To include files or directories
that have names starting with -, use rdfind ./- to not
confuse them with options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANKING <br>
Given two or more equal files, the one with the highest rank
is selected to be the original and the rest are duplicates.
The rules of ranking are given below, where the rules are
<br>
executed from start until an original has been found. Given
two files A and B which have equal content, the ranking is
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If A was found while scanning an
input argument earlier than than B, A is higher ranked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If A was found at a depth lower
than B, A is higher ranked (A closer to the root)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If A was found earlier than B, A
is higher ranked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last rule is needed when two
files are found in the same directory (obviously not given
in separate arguments, otherwise the first rule applies) and
gives the same order <br>
between the files as the operating system delivers the files
while listing the directory. This is operating system
specific behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Searching options etc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignoreempty true|false <br>
Ignore empty files. (default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-followsymlinks true|false <br>
Follow symlinks. Default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-removeidentinode true|false
<br>
removes items found which have identical inode and device
ID. Default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-checksum md5|sha1 <br>
what type of checksum to be used: md5 or sha1. Default is
md5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Action options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-makesymlinks true|false <br>
Replace duplicate files with symbolic links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-makehardlinks true|false <br>
Replace duplicate files with hard links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-makeresultsfile true|false <br>
Make a results file results.txt (default) in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outputname name <br>
Make the results file name to be &quot;name&quot; instead of
the default results.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-deleteduplicates true|false
<br>
Delete (unlink) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sleep Xms <br>
sleeps X milliseconds between reading each file, to reduce
load. Default is 0 (no sleep). Note that only a few values
are supported at present: 0,1-5,10,25,50,100 mil&acirc; <br>
liseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, -dryrun true|(false) <br>
displays what should have been done, don&rsquo;t actually
delete or link anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -help, --help <br>
displays brief help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, -version, --version <br>
displays version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Search for duplicate files in home directory and a backup
directory: <br>
rdfind ~ /mnt/backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete duplicate in a backup
directory: <br>
rdfind -deleteduplicates true /mnt/backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search for duplicate files in
directories called foo: <br>
find . -type d -name foo -print0 |xargs -0 rdfind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
results.txt (the default name is results.txt and can be
changed with option outputname, see above) The results file
results.txt will contain one row per duplicate file found,
<br>
along with a header row explaining the columns. A text
describes why the file is considered a duplicate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPTYPE_UNKNOWN some internal
error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPTYPE_FIRST_OCCURRENCE the
file that is considered to be the original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPTYPE_WITHIN_SAME_TREE files
in the same tree (found when processing the directory in the
same input argument as the original)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPTYPE_OUTSIDE_TREE the file is
found during processing another input argument than the
original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT DIAGNOSTICS EXIT
VALUES <br>
0 on success, nonzero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS/FEATURES <br>
When specifying the same directory twice, it keeps the first
encountered as the most important (original), and the rest
as duplicates. This might not be what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The symlink creates absolute
links. This might not be what you want. To create relative
links instead, you may use the symlinks (2) command, which
is able to convert absolute <br>
links to relative links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Older versions unfortunately
contained a misspelling on the word occurrence. This is now
corrected (since 1.3), which might affect user scripts
parsing the output file written by <br>
rdfind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are lots of enhancements
left to do. Please contribute!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Avoid manipulating the directories while rdfind is reading.
rdfind is quite brittle in that case. Especially, when
deleting or making links, rdfind can be subject to a symlink
<br>
attack. Use with care!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do you find rdfind useful? Drop
me a line! It is always fun to hear from people who actually
use it and what data collections they run it on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THANKS <br>
Several persons have helped with suggestions and
improvements: Niels M&Atilde;&para;ller, Carl Payne and
Salvatore Ansani. Thanks also to you who tested the program
and sent me feedback.</p>
