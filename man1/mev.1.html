<p>MEV(1) General Commands Manual MEV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mev - a program to report mouse events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mev [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The &lsquo;mev&rsquo; program is part of the gpm package.
The information below is extracted from the texinfo file,
which is the preferred source of information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mev program is modeled after
xev. It prints to stdout the mouse console events it
gets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mev&rsquo;s default behaviour is
to get anything, but command line switches can be used to
set the various fields in the Gpm_Connect structure, in
order to customize the program&rsquo;s be&acirc; <br>
haviour. I&rsquo;m using mev to handle mouse events to
Emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line switches for mev
are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C number <br>
Select a virtual console to get events from. This is
intended to be used for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d number <br>
Choose a default mask. By default the server gets any events
not belonging to the event mask. The mask can be provided
either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e number <br>
Choose the event mask. By default any event is received. The
mask can be provided either as a decimal number, or as a
symbolic string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Enter emacs mode. In emacs
mode events are reported as lisp forms rather than numbers.
This is the format used by the t-mouse package within
emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fit events inside the screen
before reporting them. This options re-fits drag events,
which are allowed to exit the screen border,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Interactive. Accepts input
from stdin to change connection parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m number <br>
Choose the minimum modifier mask. Any event with fewer
modifiers will not be reported to mev. It defaults to 0. The
mask must be provided either as a decimal number, or <br>
as a symbolic string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M number <br>
Choose the maximum modifier mask. Any event with more
modifier than specified will not be reported to mev. It
defaults to ~0, i.e. all events are received. The mask <br>
must be provided either as a decimal number, or as a
symbolic string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Requests to draw the pointer
during drags. This option is used by emacs to avoid invoking
ioctl() from lisp code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the arguments are not
decimal integers, they are considered lists of alphanumeric
characters, separated by a single non-alphanumeric
character. I use the comma (,), but any <br>
will do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allowed names for events are
move, drag, down or press, up or release, motion (which is
both move and drag), and hard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allowed names for modifiers are
shift, leftAlt, rightAlt, anyAlt (one or the other),
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -i switch is specified,
mev looks at its standard input as command lines rather than
events. The input lines are parsed, and the commands push
and pop are recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The push command, then, accepts
the options -d, -e, -m and -M, with the same meaning
described above. Unspecified options retain the previous
value and the resulting masks are <br>
used to reopen the connection with the server. pop is used
to pop the connection stack. If an empty stack is popped the
program exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other commands recognized are
info, used to return the stack depth; quit to prematurely
terminate the program; and snapshot to get some
configuration information from the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Beginning with release 1.16, mev no longer works under
xterm. Please use the rmev program (provided in the sample
directory) to watch gpm events under xterm or rxvt. rmev
also <br>
displays keyboard events besides mouse events.</p>
