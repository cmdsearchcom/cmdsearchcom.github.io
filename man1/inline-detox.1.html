<p>DETOX(1) BSD General Commands Manual DETOX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
inline-detox &acirc; clean up filenames (stream-based)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
inline-detox [-hnLrv] [-s -sequence] [-f -configfile] file
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The inline-detox utility can remove spaces and other such
annoyances from streams. It&rsquo;ll also translate or
cleanup Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) characters encoded in 8-bit
ASCII, Unicode <br>
characters encoded in UTF-8, and CGI escaped characters.
Basically its detox, but does not operate on files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sequences <br>
inline-detox is driven by a configurable series of filters,
called a sequence. Sequences are covered in more detail in
detoxrc(5) and are discoverable with the -L option. Some
<br>
examples of default sequences are iso8859_1 and utf_8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The main options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f configfile <br>
Use configfile instead of the default configuration files
for loading translation sequences. No other config file will
be parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help Display helpful
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L List the currently available
sequences. When paired with -v this option shows what
filters are used in each sequence and any properties applied
to the filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Recurse into
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sequence <br>
Use sequence instead of default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose about which files
are being renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show the current version of
inline-detox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated Options <br>
Deprecated Options are options that were available in
earlier versions of inline-detox but have lost their meaning
and are being phased out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-trailing <br>
Removes _ and - after .&rsquo;s in filenames. This was first
provided in the 0.9 series of inline-detox. After the
introduction of sequences, it lost its meaning, as you <br>
could now determine the properties of wipeup through a
particular sequence&rsquo;s configuration. It presently
forces all instances of the wipeup filter to use remove
trail&acirc; <br>
ing, regardless of what&rsquo;s actually in the config
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
detoxrc The system-wide detoxrc file. <br>
~/.detoxrc A user&rsquo;s personal detoxrc. Normally it
extends the system-wide detoxrc, unless -f has been
specified, in which case, it is ignored. <br>
iso8859_1.tbl The default ISO 8859-1 translation table. <br>
unicode.tbl The default Unicode (UTF-8) translation
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
echo Foo Bar | inline-detox -s iso8859_1 -v <br>
Will run the sequence iso8859_1 listing any changes and
returning the result to STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
detox(1), detoxrc(5), detox.tbl(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
detox was originally designed to clean up files that I had
received from friends which had been created using other
operating systems. It&rsquo;s trivial to create a filename
with spa&acirc; <br>
ces, parenthesis, brackets, and ampersands under some
operating systems. These have special meaning within FreeBSD
and Linux, and cause problems when you go to access them. I
<br>
created inline-detox to clean up these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
inline-detox was written by Doug Harple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Long options don&rsquo;t work under Solaris or Darwin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An error in the config file will
cause a segfault as it&rsquo;s going to print the offending
word within the config file.</p>
