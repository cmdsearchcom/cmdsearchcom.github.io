<p>PERL5101DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5101DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5101delta - what is new for perl v5.10.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.10.0
release and the 5.10.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.8.8, first read the perl5100delta,
which describes differences between 5.8.8 and 5.10.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
Switch statement changes <br>
The handling of complex expressions by the
&quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; switch statement has been
enhanced. There are two new cases where &quot;when&quot; now
interprets its argument as a boolean, <br>
instead of an expression to be used in a smart match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flip-flop operators <br>
The &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; flip-flop operators
are now evaluated in boolean context, following their usual
semantics; see &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, as in perl 5.10.0,
&quot;when (1..10)&quot; will not work to test whether a
given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should use
&quot;when ([1..10])&quot; instead (note the <br>
array reference).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, contrary to 5.10.0,
evaluating the flip-flop operators in boolean context
ensures it can now be useful in a &quot;when()&quot;,
notably for implementing bistable conditions, <br>
like in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {
<br>
# do something <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defined-or operator <br>
A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as
in &quot;when (expr1 // expr2)&quot;, will be treated as
boolean if the first expression is boolean. (This just
extends the <br>
existing rule that applies to the regular or operator, as in
&quot;when (expr1 || expr2)&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next section details more
changes brought to the semantics to the smart match
operator, that naturally also modify the behaviour of the
switch statements where smart matching <br>
is implicitly used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart match changes <br>
Changes to type-based dispatch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The smart match operator
&quot;~~&quot; is no longer commutative. The behaviour of a
smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right
hand argument. Moreover, its semantics have <br>
been adjusted for greater consistency or usefulness in
several cases. While the general backwards compatibility is
maintained, several changes must be noted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Code references
with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially.
They are passed an argument like the other code references
(even if they choose to ignore it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;%hash ~~
sub {}&quot; and &quot;@array ~~ sub {}&quot; now test that
the subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash
(or element of the array), instead of passing the whole <br>
hash or array as a reference to the subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Due to the
commutativity breakage, code references are no longer
treated specially when appearing on the left of the
&quot;~~&quot; operator, but like any vulgar scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;undef ~~
%hash&quot; is always false (since &quot;undef&quot;
can&rsquo;t be a key in a hash). No implicit conversion to
&quot;&quot; is done (as was the case in perl 5.10.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;$scalar ~~
@array&quot; now always distributes the smart match across
the elements of the array. It&rsquo;s true if one element in
@array verifies &quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;. This is a
<br>
generalization of the old behaviour that tested whether the
array contained the scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full dispatch table for the
smart match operator is given in &quot;Smart matching in
detail&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart match and overloading</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">According to the rule of
dispatch based on the rightmost argument type, when an
object overloading &quot;~~&quot; appears on the right side
of the operator, the overload routine will <br>
always be called (with a 3rd argument set to a true value,
see overload.) However, when the object will appear on the
left, the overload routine will be called only when the <br>
rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way
distributivity of smart match across arrays is not broken,
as well as the other behaviours with complex types
(coderefs, hashes, <br>
regexes). Thus, writers of overloading routines for smart
match mostly need to worry only with comparing against a
scalar, and possibly with stringification overloading; the
<br>
other common cases will be automatically handled
consistently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;~~&quot; will now refuse
to work on objects that do not overload it (in order to
avoid relying on the object&rsquo;s underlying structure).
(However, if the object overloads the <br>
stringification or the numification operators, and if
overload fallback is active, it will be used instead, as
usual.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other incompatible changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The semantics of &quot;use feature
:5.10*&quot; have changed slightly. See &quot;Modules and
Pragmata&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is now a
run-time error to use the smart match operator
&quot;~~&quot; with an object that has no overload defined
for it. (This way &quot;~~&quot; will not break
encapsulation by matching <br>
against the object&rsquo;s internal representation as a
reference.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The version
control system used for the development of the perl
interpreter has been switched from Perforce to git. This is
mainly an internal issue that only affects people <br>
actively working on the perl core; but it may have minor
external visibility, for example in some of details of the
output of &quot;perl -V&quot;. See perlrepository for more
<br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The internal
structure of the &quot;ext/&quot; directory in the perl
source has been reorganised. In general, a module
&quot;Foo::Bar&quot; whose source was stored under
ext/Foo/Bar/ is now <br>
located under ext/Foo-Bar/. Also, some modules have been
moved from lib/ to ext/. This is purely a source tarball
change, and should make no difference to the compilation or
<br>
installation of perl, unless you have a very customised
build process that explicitly relies on this structure, or
which hard-codes the &quot;nonxs_ext&quot; Configure
parameter. <br>
Specifically, this change does not by default alter the
location of any files in the final installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As part of the
&quot;Test::Harness&quot; 2.x to 3.x upgrade, the
experimental &quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot; module has
been removed. See &quot;Updated Modules&quot; for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As part of the
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; upgrade, the
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes&quot; and
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish&quot; modules have been
removed from this distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::CoreList&quot; no longer contains the
%:patchlevel hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This one is
actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was missed
from that release&rsquo;s perldelta, so it is mentioned here
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bugfix related to the handling
of the &quot;/m&quot; modifier and &quot;qr&quot; resulted
in a change of behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># matches in 5.8.x,
doesn&rsquo;t match in 5.10.0 <br>
$re = qr/^bar/; &quot;foo0ar&quot; =~ /$re/m;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Unicode Character Database 5.1.0 <br>
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl
5.10.1 has been updated to 5.1.0 from 5.0.0. See
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#Notable_Changes&gt;
for <br>
the notable changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A proper interface for pluggable
Method Resolution Orders <br>
As of Perl 5.10.1 there is a new interface for plugging and
using method resolution orders other than the default
(linear depth first search). The C3 method resolution order
<br>
added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as a plugin, without
changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;overloading&quot;
pragma <br>
This pragma allows you to lexically disable or enable
overloading for some or all operations. (Yuval Kogman)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parallel tests <br>
The core distribution can now run its regression tests in
parallel on Unix-like platforms. Instead of running
&quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot; in your
environment to the number of <br>
tests to run in parallel, and run &quot;make
test_harness&quot;. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done
as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness #
Run 3 tests in parallel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An environment variable is used,
rather than parallel make itself, because TAP::Harness needs
to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test
scripts itself, and there is <br>
no standard interface to &quot;make&quot; utilities to
interact with their job schedulers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that currently some test
scripts may fail when run in parallel (most notably
&quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;). If necessary run just the
failing scripts again sequentially and see if <br>
the failures go away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DTrace support <br>
Some support for DTrace has been added. See &quot;DTrace
support&quot; in INSTALL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for
&quot;configure_requires&quot; in CPAN module metadata <br>
Both &quot;CPAN&quot; and &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; now support
the &quot;configure_requires&quot; keyword in the
&quot;META.yml&quot; metadata file included in most recent
CPAN distributions. This allows distribution <br>
authors to specify configuration prerequisites that must be
installed before running Makefile.PL or Build.PL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the documentation for
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; or &quot;Module::Build&quot;
for more on how to specify &quot;configure_requires&quot;
when creating a distribution for CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
New Modules and Pragmata <br>
&quot;autodie&quot; <br>
This is a new lexically-scoped alternative for the
&quot;Fatal&quot; module. The bundled version is 2.06_01.
Note that in this release, using a string eval when
&quot;autodie&quot; is in effect <br>
can cause the autodie behaviour to leak into the surrounding
scope. See &quot;BUGS&quot; in autodie for more details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Compress::Raw::Bzip2&quot;
<br>
This has been added to the core (version 2.020).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;parent&quot; <br>
This pragma establishes an ISA relationship with base
classes at compile time. It provides the key feature of
&quot;base&quot; without the feature creep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Parse::CPAN::Meta&quot;
<br>
This has been added to the core (version 1.39).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pragmata Changes <br>
&quot;attributes&quot; <br>
Upgraded from version 0.08 to 0.09.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;attrs&quot; <br>
Upgraded from version 1.02 to 1.03.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;base&quot; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;charnames&quot; <br>
Upgraded from version 1.06 to 1.07.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unicode NameAliases.txt
database file has been added. This has the effect of adding
some extra &quot;haracter names that formerly wouldn&rsquo;t
have been recognised; for <br>
example, &quot;ATIN CAPITAL LETTER GHA}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;constant&quot; <br>
Upgraded from version 1.13 to 1.17.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;feature&quot; <br>
The meaning of the &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot;
feature bundles has changed slightly. The last component, if
any (i.e. &quot;X&quot;) is simply ignored. This is
predicated on the assumption <br>
that new features will not, in general, be added to
maintenance releases. So &quot;:5.10&quot; and
&quot;:5.10.X&quot; have identical effect. This is a change
to the behaviour documented for <br>
5.10.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;fields&quot; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h2xs <br>
No longer incorrectly treats enum values like macros (Daniel
Burr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now handles C++ style constants
(&quot;//&quot;) properly in enums. (A patch from Rainer
Weikusat was used; Daniel Burr also proposed a similar
fix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl5db.pl <br>
&quot;LVALUE&quot; subroutines now work under the
debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debugger now correctly
handles proxy constant subroutines, and subroutine
stubs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlthanks <br>
Perl 5.10.1 adds a new utility perlthanks, which is a
variant of perlbug, but for sending non-bug-reports to the
authors and maintainers of Perl. Getting nothing but bug
<br>
reports can become a bit demoralising: we&rsquo;ll see if
this changes things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Documentation <br>
perlhaiku <br>
This contains instructions on how to build perl for the
Haiku platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlmroapi <br>
This describes the new interface for pluggable Method
Resolution Orders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlperf <br>
This document, by Richard Foley, provides an introduction to
the use of performance and optimization techniques which can
be used with particular reference to perl programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlrepository <br>
This describes how to access the perl source using the git
version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlthanks <br>
This describes the new perlthanks utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing
Documentation <br>
The various large &quot;Changes*&quot; files (which listed
every change made to perl over the last 18 years) have been
removed, and replaced by a small file, also called
&quot;Changes&quot;, which <br>
just explains how that same information may be extracted
from the git version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file Porting/patching.pod
has been deleted, as it mainly described interacting with
the old Perforce-based repository, which is now obsolete.
Information still relevant has <br>
been moved to perlrepository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlapi, perlintern, perlmodlib
and perltoc are now all generated at build time, rather than
being shipped as part of the release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Enhancements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A new internal cache means that
&quot;isa()&quot; will often be faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under &quot;use
locale&quot;, the locale-relevant information is now cached
on read-only values, such as the list returned by &quot;keys
%hash&quot;. This makes operations such as &quot;sort keys
<br>
%hash&quot; in the scope of &quot;use locale&quot; much
faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Empty
&quot;DESTROY&quot; methods are no longer called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
ext/ reorganisation <br>
The layout of directories in ext has been revised.
Specifically, all extensions are now flat, and at the top
level, with &quot;/&quot; in pathnames replaced by
&quot;-&quot;, so that <br>
ext/Data/Dumper/ is now ext/Data-Dumper/, etc. The names of
the extensions as specified to Configure, and as reported by
%Config::Config under the keys &quot;dynamic_ext&quot;, <br>
&quot;known_extensions&quot;, &quot;nonxs_ext&quot; and
&quot;static_ext&quot; have not changed, and still use
&quot;/&quot;. Hence this change will not have any affect
once perl is installed. However, <br>
&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot;, &quot;Safe&quot; and
&quot;mro&quot; have now become extensions in their own
right, so if you run Configure with options to specify an
exact list of extensions to build, you <br>
will need to change it to account for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 5.10.2, it is planned that
many dual-life modules will have been moved from lib to ext;
again this will have no effect on an installed perl, but
will matter if you invoke <br>
Configure with a pre-canned list of extensions to build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration improvements <br>
If &quot;vendorlib&quot; and &quot;vendorarch&quot; are the
same, then they are only added to @INC once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Config{usedevel} and the
C-level &quot;PERL_USE_DEVEL&quot; are now defined if perl
is built with &quot;-Dusedevel&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure will enable use of
&quot;-fstack-protector&quot;, to provide protection against
stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure will now determine the
correct prototypes for re-entrant functions, and for
&quot;gconvert&quot;, if you are using a C++ compiler rather
than a C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix, if you build from a
tree containing a git repository, the configuration process
will note the commit hash you have checked out, for display
in the output of &quot;perl -v&quot; <br>
and &quot;perl -V&quot;. Unpushed local commits are
automatically added to the list of local patches displayed
by &quot;perl -V&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilation improvements <br>
As part of the flattening of ext, all extensions on all
platforms are built by make_ext.pl. This replaces the
Unix-specific ext/util/make_ext, VMS-specific make_ext.com
and <br>
Win32-specific win32/buildext.pl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Changes <br>
AIX Removed libbsd for AIX 5L and 6.1. Only flock() was used
from libbsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed libgdbm for AIX 5L and
6.1. The libgdbm is delivered as an optional package with
the AIX Toolbox. Unfortunately the 64 bit version is
broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hints changes mean that AIX 4.2
should work again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cygwin <br>
On Cygwin we now strip the last number from the DLL. This
has been the behaviour in the cygwin.com build for years.
The hints files have been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FreeBSD <br>
The hints files now identify the correct threading libraries
on FreeBSD 7 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Irix <br>
We now work around a bizarre preprocessor bug in the Irix
6.5 compiler: &quot;cc -E -&quot; unfortunately goes into
K&amp;R mode, but &quot;cc -E file.c&quot;
doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Haiku <br>
Patches from the Haiku maintainers have been merged in. Perl
should now build on Haiku.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MirOS BSD <br>
Perl should now build on MirOS BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NetBSD <br>
Hints now supports versions 5.*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stratus VOS <br>
Various changes from Stratus have been merged in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbian <br>
There is now support for Symbian S60 3.2 SDK and S60 5.0
SDK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32 <br>
Improved message window handling means that
&quot;alarm&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; messages will no
longer be dropped under race conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS Reads from the in-memory
temporary files of &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; used to fail
if $/ was set to a numeric reference (to indicate
record-style reads). This is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS now supports
&quot;getgrgid&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many improvements and cleanups
have been made to the VMS file name handling and conversion
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling the
&quot;PERL_VMS_POSIX_EXIT&quot; logical name now encodes a
POSIX exit status in a VMS condition value for better
interaction with GNV&rsquo;s bash shell and other utilities
that <br>
depend on POSIX exit values. See &quot;$?&quot; in perlvms
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; 5.10.0 inadvertently disabled an
optimisation, which caused a measurable performance drop in
list assignment, such as is often used to assign function
parameters from @_. The <br>
optimisation has been re-instated, and the performance
regression fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed memory
leak on &quot;while (1) { map 1, 1 }&quot; [RT #53038].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some potential
coredumps in PerlIO fixed [RT #57322,54828].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The debugger now
works with lvalue subroutines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
debugger&rsquo;s &quot;m&quot; command was broken on modules
that defined constants [RT #61222].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;crypt()&quot; and string complement could return
tainted values for untainted arguments [RT #59998].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;-i.suffix&quot; command-line switch now recreates the
file using restricted permissions, before changing its mode
to match the original file. This eliminates a potential race
<br>
condition [RT #60904].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On some Unix
systems, the value in $? would not have the top bit set
(&quot;$? &amp; 128&quot;) even if the child core
dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under some
circumstances, $^R could incorrectly become undefined [RT
#57042].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; (XS) In various
hash functions, passing a pre-computed hash to when the key
is UTF-8 might result in an incorrect lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; (XS) Including
XSUB.h before perl.h gave a compile-time error [RT
#57176].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;$object-&gt;isa(&rsquo;Foo&rsquo;)&quot; would report
false if the package &quot;Foo&quot; didn&rsquo;t exist,
even if the object&rsquo;s @ISA contained
&quot;Foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various bugs in
the new-to 5.10.0 mro code, triggered by manipulating @ISA,
have been found and fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Bitwise
operations on references could crash the interpreter, e.g.
&quot;$x=; $x |= &quot;foo&quot;&quot; [RT #54956].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patterns
including alternation might be sensitive to the internal
UTF-8 representation, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $byte = chr(192); <br>
my $utf8 = chr(192); utf8::upgrade($utf8); <br>
$utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i; # failed in 5.10.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Within
UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e. where &quot;use
utf8&quot; is in effect), double-quoted literal strings
could be corrupted where a &quot;&quot;, &quot; NNN&quot; or
&quot;&quot; is followed by <br>
a literal character with ordinal value greater than 255 [RT
#59908].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;B::Deparse&quot; failed to correctly deparse various
constructs: &quot;readpipe STRING&quot; [RT #62428],
&quot;CORE::require(STRING)&quot; [RT #62488], &quot;sub
foo(_)&quot; [RT #62484].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using
&quot;setpgrp()&quot; with no arguments could corrupt the
perl stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The block form
of &quot;eval&quot; is now specifically trappable by
&quot;Safe&quot; and &quot;ops&quot;. Previously it was
erroneously treated like string &quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0, the
two characters &quot;[~&quot; were sometimes parsed as the
smart match operator (&quot;~~&quot;) [RT #63854].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0, the
&quot;*&quot; quantifier in patterns was sometimes treated
as &quot;{0,32767}&quot; [RT #60034, #60464]. For example,
this match would fail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(&quot;ab&quot; x 32768) =~
/^(ab)*$/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;shmget&quot; was limited to a 32 bit segment size on a
64 bit OS [RT #63924].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot; to exit a
&quot;given&quot; block no longer produces a spurious
warning like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting given via last at foo.pl
line 123</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Windows,
&rsquo;.o&rsquo; and &rsquo;..o&rsquo; were treated
differently than &rsquo;./foo&rsquo; and
&rsquo;../foo&rsquo; by &quot;do&quot; and
&quot;require&quot; [RT #63492].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assigning a
format to a glob could corrupt the format; e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*bar=*foo{FORMAT}; # foo format
now bad</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Attempting to
coerce a typeglob to a string or number could cause an
assertion failure. The correct error message is now
generated, &quot;Can&rsquo;t coerce GLOB to $type&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under &quot;use
filetest &rsquo;access&rsquo;&quot;, &quot;-x&quot; was
using the wrong access mode. This has been fixed [RT
#49003].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;length&quot; on a tied scalar that returned a Unicode
value would not be correct the first time. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using an array
&quot;tie&quot; inside in array &quot;tie&quot; could SEGV.
This has been fixed. [RT #51636]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A race condition
inside &quot;PerlIOStdio_close()&quot; has been identified
and fixed. This used to cause various threading issues,
including SEGVs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In
&quot;unpack&quot;, the use of &quot;()&quot; groups in
scalar context was internally placing a list on the
interpreter&rsquo;s stack, which manifested in various ways,
including SEGVs. This is <br>
now fixed [RT #50256].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Magic was called
twice in &quot;substr&quot;, &quot;$x&quot;, &quot;tie $x,
$m&quot; and &quot;chop&quot;. These have all been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A 5.10.0
optimisation to clear the temporary stack within the
implicit loop of &quot;s///ge&quot; has been reverted, as it
turned out to be the cause of obscure bugs in seemingly <br>
unrelated parts of the interpreter [commit
ef0d4e17921ee3de].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The line numbers
for warnings inside &quot;elsif&quot; are now correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;..&quot; operator now works correctly with ranges
whose ends are at or close to the values of the smallest and
largest integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;binmode
STDIN, &rsquo;:raw&rsquo;&quot; could lead to segmentation
faults on some platforms. This has been fixed [RT
#54828].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An off-by-one
error meant that &quot;index $str, ...&quot; was effectively
being executed as &quot;index &quot;$str &quot;, ...&quot;.
This has been fixed [RT #53746].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various leaks
associated with named captures in regexes have been fixed
[RT #57024].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A weak reference
to a hash would leak. This was affecting &quot;DBI&quot; [RT
#56908].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using (?|) in a
regex could cause a segfault [RT #59734].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use of a UTF-8
&quot;tr//&quot; within a closure could cause a segfault [RT
#61520].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calling
&quot;sv_chop()&quot; or otherwise upgrading an SV could
result in an unaligned 64-bit access on the SPARC
architecture [RT #60574].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the 5.10.0
release, &quot;inc_version_list&quot; would incorrectly list
&quot;5.10.*&quot; after &quot;5.8.*&quot;; this affected
the @INC search order [RT #67628].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0,
&quot;pack &quot;a*&quot;, $tainted_value&quot; returned a
non-tainted value [RT #52552].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0,
&quot;printf&quot; and &quot;sprintf&quot; could produce the
fatal error &quot;panic: utf8_mg_pos_cache_update&quot; when
printing UTF-8 strings [RT #62666].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the 5.10.0
release, a dynamically created &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; method
might be missed (method cache issue) [RT #60220,60232].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the 5.10.0
release, a combination of &quot;use feature&quot; and
&quot;//ee&quot; could cause a memory leak [RT #63110].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-C&quot;
on the shebang (&quot;#!&quot;) line is once more permitted
if it is also specified on the command line. &quot;-C&quot;
on the shebang line used to be a silent no-op if it was not
also on <br>
the command line, so perl 5.10.0 disallowed it, which broke
some scripts. Now perl checks whether it is also on the
command line and only dies if it is not [RT #67880].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0,
certain types of re-entrant regular expression could crash,
or cause the following assertion failure [RT #60508]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assertion rx-&gt;sublen &gt;= (s
- rx-&gt;subbeg) + i failed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New or Changed Diagnostics <br>
&quot;panic: sv_chop %s&quot; <br>
This new fatal error occurs when the C routine
&quot;Perl_sv_chop()&quot; was passed a position that is not
within the scalar&rsquo;s string buffer. This could be
caused by buggy XS code, <br>
and at this point recovery is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Can&rsquo;t locate package
%s for the parents of %s&quot; <br>
This warning has been removed. In general, it only got
produced in conjunction with other warnings, and removing it
allowed an ISA lookup optimisation to be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;v-string in use/require is
non-portable&quot; <br>
This warning has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Deep recursion on
subroutine &quot;%s&quot;&quot; <br>
It is now possible to change the depth threshold for this
warning from the default of 100, by recompiling the perl
binary, setting the C pre-processor macro <br>
&quot;PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN&quot; to the desired value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed Internals <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The J.R.R. Tolkien quotes at the head of C
source file have been checked and proper citations added,
thanks to a patch from Tom Christiansen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;vcroak()&quot; now accepts a null first argument. In
addition, a full audit was made of the &quot;not NULL&quot;
compiler annotations, and those for several other internal
functions were <br>
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New macros
&quot;dSAVEDERRNO&quot;, &quot;dSAVE_ERRNO&quot;,
&quot;SAVE_ERRNO&quot;, &quot;RESTORE_ERRNO&quot; have been
added to formalise the temporary saving of the
&quot;errno&quot; variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_sv_insert_flags&quot; has been added to augment
&quot;Perl_sv_insert&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_newSV_type(type)&quot; has been added, equivalent
to &quot;Perl_newSV()&quot; followed by
&quot;Perl_sv_upgrade(type)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_newSVpvn_flags()&quot; has been added, equivalent
to &quot;Perl_newSVpvn()&quot; and then performing the
action relevant to the flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two flag bits are currently
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot; <br>
This will call &quot;SvUTF8_on()&quot; for you. (Note that
this does not convert an sequence of ISO 8859-1 characters
to UTF-8). A wrapper, &quot;newSVpvn_utf8()&quot; is
available for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;SVs_TEMP&quot; <br>
Call &quot;sv_2mortal()&quot; on the new SV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a wrapper that
takes constant strings, &quot;newSVpvs_flags()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_croak_xs_usage&quot; has been added as a wrapper
to &quot;Perl_croak&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The functions
&quot;PerlIO_find_layer&quot; and
&quot;PerlIO_list_alloc&quot; are now exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;PL_na&quot; has been exterminated from the core code,
replaced by local STRLEN temporaries, or
&quot;*_nolen()&quot; calls. Either approach is faster than
&quot;PL_na&quot;, which is a pointer <br>
deference into the interpreter structure under ithreads, and
a global variable otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Perl_mg_free()&quot; used to leave freed memory
accessible via SvMAGIC() on the scalar. It now updates the
linked list to remove each piece of magic as it is
freed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under ithreads,
the regex in &quot;PL_reg_curpm&quot; is now reference
counted. This eliminates a lot of hackish workarounds to
cope with it not being reference counted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Perl_mg_magical()&quot; would sometimes incorrectly
turn on &quot;SvRMAGICAL()&quot;. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The public IV
and NV flags are now not set if the string value has
trailing &quot;garbage&quot;. This behaviour is consistent
with not setting the public IV or NV flags if the value is
<br>
out of range for the type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SV allocation
tracing has been added to the diagnostics enabled by
&quot;-Dm&quot;. The tracing can alternatively output via
the &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot; mechanism, if that was enabled
when the <br>
perl binary was compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Uses of
&quot;Nullav&quot;, &quot;Nullcv&quot;, &quot;Nullhv&quot;,
&quot;Nullop&quot;, &quot;Nullsv&quot; etc have been
replaced by &quot;NULL&quot; in the core code, and
non-dual-life modules, as &quot;NULL&quot; is clearer to
those <br>
unfamiliar with the core code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A macro
MUTABLE_PTR(p) has been added, which on (non-pedantic) gcc
will not cast away &quot;const&quot;, returning a &quot;void
*&quot;. Macros &quot;MUTABLE_SV(av)&quot;,
&quot;MUTABLE_SV(cv)&quot; etc build on <br>
this, casting to &quot;AV *&quot; etc without casting away
&quot;const&quot;. This allows proper compile-time auditing
of &quot;const&quot; correctness in the core, and helped
picked up some errors (now <br>
fixed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Macros
&quot;mPUSHs()&quot; and &quot;mXPUSHs()&quot; have been
added, for pushing SVs on the stack and mortalizing
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use of the
private structure &quot;mro_meta&quot; has changed slightly.
Nothing outside the core should be accessing this directly
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new tool,
&quot;Porting/expand-macro.pl&quot; has been added, that
allows you to view how a C preprocessor macro would be
expanded when compiled. This is handy when trying to decode
<br>
the macro hell that is the perl guts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Tests <br>
Many modules updated from CPAN incorporate new tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several tests that have the
potential to hang forever if they fail now incorporate a
&quot;watchdog&quot; functionality that will kill them after
a timeout, which helps ensure that &quot;make <br>
test&quot; and &quot;make test_harness&quot; run to
completion automatically. (Jerry Hedden).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some core-specific tests have
been added:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are
regressions from either 5.10.0 or 5.8.x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;List::Util::first&quot; misbehaves in the presence of
a lexical $_ (typically introduced by &quot;my $_&quot; or
implicitly by &quot;given&quot;). The variable which gets
set for each iteration is <br>
the package variable $_, not the lexical $_ [RT #67694].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar issue may occur in
other modules that provide functions which take a block as
their first argument, like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo { ... $_ ...} list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;charnames&quot; pragma may generate a run-time error
when a regex is interpolated [RT #56444]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use charnames
&rsquo;:full&rsquo;; <br>
my $r1 = qr/HAI CHARACTER SARA I}/; <br>
&quot;foo&quot; =~ $r1; # okay <br>
&quot;foo&quot; =~ /$r1+/; # runtime error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A workaround is to generate the
character outside of the regex:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $a = &quot;HAI CHARACTER SARA
I}&quot;; <br>
my $r1 = qr/$a/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some regexes may
run much more slowly when run in a child thread compared
with the thread the pattern was compiled into [RT
#55600].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
The following items are now deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Switch&quot; is buggy and should be avoided. From perl
5.11.0 onwards, it is intended that any use of the core
version of this module will emit a warning, and that the
module <br>
will eventually be removed from the core (probably in perl
5.14.0). See &quot;Switch statements&quot; in perlsyn for
its replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;suidperl&quot; will be removed in 5.12.0. This
provides a mechanism to emulate setuid permission bits on
systems that don&rsquo;t support it properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Some of the work in this release was funded by a TPF
grant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nicholas Clark officially
retired from maintenance pumpking duty at the end of 2008;
however in reality he has put much effort in since then to
help get 5.10.1 into a fit state <br>
to be released, including writing a considerable chunk of
this perldelta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Steffen Mueller and David Golden
in particular helped getting CPAN modules polished and
synchronised with their in-core equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Craig Berry was tireless in
getting maint to run under VMS, no matter how many times we
broke it for him.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other core committers
contributed most of the changes, and applied most of the
patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed in
AUTHORS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Sorry to all the people I
haven&rsquo;t mentioned by name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, thanks to Larry Wall,
without whom none of this would be necessary.</p>
