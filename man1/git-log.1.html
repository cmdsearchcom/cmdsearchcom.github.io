<p>GIT-LOG(1) Git Manual GIT-LOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-log - Show commit logs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git log [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;revision range&gt;] [[--]
&lt;path&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Shows the commit logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command takes options
applicable to the git rev-list command to control what is
shown and how, and options applicable to the git diff-*
commands to control how the changes <br>
each commit introduces are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--follow <br>
Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works
only for a single file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-decorate,
--decorate[=short|full|no] <br>
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown. If
short is specified, the ref name prefixes refs/heads/,
refs/tags/ and refs/remotes/ will not be printed. If full is
<br>
specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be
printed. The default option is short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source <br>
Print out the ref name given on the command line by which
each commit was reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-mailmap <br>
Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email
to canonical real names and email addresses. See
git-shortlog(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-diff <br>
Without this flag, &quot;git log -p &lt;path&gt;...&quot;
shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs
about the same specified paths. With this, the full diff is
shown for <br>
commits that touch the specified paths; this means that
&quot;&lt;path&gt;...&quot; limits only commits, and
doesn&acirc;t limit diff for those commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this affects all
diff-based output types, e.g. those produced by --stat
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-size <br>
Before the log message print out its size in bytes. Intended
mainly for porcelain tools consumption. If Git is unable to
produce a valid value size is set to zero. Note that <br>
only message is considered, if also a diff is shown its size
is not included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;revision range&gt; <br>
Show only commits in the specified revision range. When no
&lt;revision range&gt; is specified, it defaults to HEAD
(i.e. the whole history leading to the current commit). <br>
origin..HEAD specifies all the commits reachable from the
current commit (i.e. HEAD), but not from origin. For a
complete list of ways to spell &lt;revision range&gt;, see
the <br>
&quot;Specifying Ranges&quot; section of
gitrevisions(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--] &lt;path&gt;... <br>
Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files
that match the specified paths came to be. See &quot;History
Simplification&quot; below for details and other
simplification <br>
modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paths may need to be prefixed
with &quot;-- &quot; to separate them from options or the
revision range, when confusion arises.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commit Limiting <br>
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed
using the special notations explained in the description,
additional commit limiting may be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using more options generally
further limits the output (e.g. --since=&lt;date1&gt; limits
to commits newer than &lt;date1&gt;, and using it with
--grep=&lt;pattern&gt; further limits to commits <br>
whose log message has a line that matches &lt;pattern&gt;),
unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these are applied
before commit ordering and formatting options, such as
--reverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&lt;number&gt;, -n
&lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt; <br>
Limit the number of commits to output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip=&lt;number&gt; <br>
Skip number commits before starting to show the commit
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--since=&lt;date&gt;,
--after=&lt;date&gt; <br>
Show commits more recent than a specific date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--until=&lt;date&gt;,
--before=&lt;date&gt; <br>
Show commits older than a specific date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--author=&lt;pattern&gt;,
--committer=&lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer
header lines that match the specified pattern (regular
expression). With more than one --author=&lt;pattern&gt;,
commits <br>
whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen
(similarly for multiple --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;
<br>
Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that
match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more
than one --grep-reflog, commits whose reflog message <br>
matches any of the given patterns are chosen. It is an error
to use this option unless --walk-reflogs is in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grep=&lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that
matches the specified pattern (regular expression). With
more than one --grep=&lt;pattern&gt;, commits whose message
matches <br>
any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
--all-match).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --show-notes is in effect,
the message from the notes as if it is part of the log
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all-match <br>
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
--grep, instead of ones that match at least one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --regexp-ignore-case <br>
Match the regexp limiting patterns without regard to letters
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--basic-regexp <br>
Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular
expressions; this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --extended-regexp <br>
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular
expressions instead of the default basic regular
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fixed-strings <br>
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings
(don&acirc;t interpret pattern as a regular expression).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--perl-regexp <br>
Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regexp.
Requires libpcre to be compiled in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-empty <br>
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merges <br>
Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as
--min-parents=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-merges <br>
Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is
exactly the same as --max-parents=1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-parents=&lt;number&gt;,
--max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --no-min-parents,
--no-max-parents <br>
Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many
commits. In particular, --max-parents=1 is the same as
--no-merges, --min-parents=2 is the same as --merges. <br>
--max-parents=0 gives all root commits and --min-parents=3
all octopus merges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-min-parents and
--no-max-parents reset these limits (to no limit) again.
Equivalent forms are --min-parents=0 (any commit has 0 or
more parents) and --max-parents=-1 <br>
(negative numbers denote no upper limit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--first-parent <br>
Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge
commit. This option can give a better overview when viewing
the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges
<br>
into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to
updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows
you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your <br>
history by such a merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--not <br>
Reverses the meaning of the ^ prefix (or lack thereof) for
all following revision specifiers, up to the next --not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all <br>
Pretend as if all the refs in refs/ are listed on the
command line as &lt;commit&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
<br>
Pretend as if all the refs in refs/heads are listed on the
command line as &lt;commit&gt;. If &lt;pattern&gt; is given,
limit branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern
lacks <br>
?, *, or [, /* at the end is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;] <br>
Pretend as if all the refs in refs/tags are listed on the
command line as &lt;commit&gt;. If &lt;pattern&gt; is given,
limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern
lacks ?, <br>
*, or [, /* at the end is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;] <br>
Pretend as if all the refs in refs/remotes are listed on the
command line as &lt;commit&gt;. If &lt;pattern&gt; is given,
limit remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell
<br>
glob. If pattern lacks ?, *, or [, /* at the end is
implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt; <br>
Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
&lt;glob-pattern&gt; are listed on the command line as
&lt;commit&gt;. Leading refs/, is automatically prepended if
missing. If pattern <br>
lacks ?, *, or [, /* at the end is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing <br>
Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as
if the bad input was not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bisect <br>
Pretend as if the bad bisection ref refs/bisect/bad was
listed and as if it was followed by --not and the good
bisection refs refs/bisect/good-* on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
In addition to the &lt;commit&gt; listed on the command
line, read them from the standard input. If a -- separator
is seen, stop reading commits and start reading paths to
limit <br>
the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cherry-mark <br>
Like --cherry-pick (see below) but mark equivalent commits
with = rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
+.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cherry-pick <br>
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another
commit on the &quot;other side&quot; when the set of commits
are limited with symmetric difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you have two
branches, A and B, a usual way to list all commits on only
one side of them is with --left-right (see the example below
in the description of the <br>
--left-right option). It however shows the commits that were
cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, &quot;3rd
on b&quot; may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this
<br>
option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--left-only, --right-only <br>
List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric
range, i.e. only those which would be marked &lt; resp. &gt;
by --left-right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, --cherry-pick
--right-only A...B omits those commits from B which are in A
or are patch-equivalent to a commit in A. In other words,
this lists the + commits <br>
from git cherry A B. More precisely, --cherry-pick
--right-only --no-merges gives the exact list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cherry <br>
A synonym for --right-only --cherry-mark --no-merges; useful
to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark
those that have been applied to the other side of a <br>
forked history with git log --cherry upstream...mybranch,
similar to git cherry upstream mybranch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --walk-reflogs <br>
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog
entries from the most recent one to older ones. When this
option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that
<br>
is, ^commit, commit1..commit2, nor commit1...commit2
notations cannot be used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --pretty format other than
oneline (for obvious reasons), this causes the output to
have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog.
By default, commit@{Nth} <br>
notation is used in the output. When the starting commit is
specified as commit@{now}, output also uses
commit@{timestamp} notation instead. Under --pretty=oneline,
the <br>
commit message is prefixed with this information on the same
line. This option cannot be combined with --reverse. See
also git-reflog(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge <br>
After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a
conflict and don&acirc;t exist on all heads to merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--boundary <br>
Output uninteresting commits at the boundary, which are
usually not shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History Simplification <br>
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history,
for example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;.
But there are two parts of History Simplification, one part
is <br>
selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as
there are various strategies to simplify the history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options select the
commits to be shown:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;paths&gt; <br>
Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--simplify-by-decoration <br>
Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that extra commits can be
shown to give a meaningful history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect the
way the simplification is performed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default mode <br>
Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining
the final state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some
side branches if the end result is the same (i.e. <br>
merging branches with the same content)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-history <br>
Same as the default mode, but does not prune some
history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dense <br>
Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a
meaningful history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sparse <br>
All commits in the simplified history are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--simplify-merges <br>
Additional option to --full-history to remove some needless
merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected
commits contributing to this merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ancestry-path <br>
When given a range of commits to display (e.g.
commit1..commit2 or commit2 ^commit1), only display commits
that exist directly on the ancestry chain between the
commit1 and <br>
commit2, i.e. commits that are both descendants of commit1,
and ancestors of commit2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more detailed explanation
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose you specified foo as the
&lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits that modify foo
!TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for
foo, they look different and equal, <br>
respectively.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following, we will always
refer to the same example history to illustrate the
differences between simplification settings. We assume that
you are filtering for a file foo <br>
in this commit graph:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.-A---M---N---O---P <br>
/ / / / / <br>
I B C D E &nbsp; <br>
/ / / / <br>
&lsquo;-------------&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The horizontal line of history
A---P is taken to be the first parent of each merge. The
commits are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; I is the initial
commit, in which foo exists with contents &quot;asdf&quot;,
and a file quux exists with contents &quot;quux&quot;.
Initial commits are compared to an empty tree, so I is <br>
!TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In A, foo
contains just &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; B contains the
same change as A. Its merge M is trivial and hence TREESAME
to all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; C does not
change foo, but its merge N changes it to
&quot;foobar&quot;, so it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; D sets foo to
&quot;baz&quot;. Its merge O combines the strings from N and
D to &quot;foobarbaz&quot;; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; E changes quux
to &quot;xyzzy&quot;, and its merge P combines the strings
to &quot;quux xyzzy&quot;. Despite appearing interesting, P
is TREESAME to all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rev-list walks backwards through
history, including or excluding commits based on whether
--full-history and/or parent rewriting (via --parents or
--children) are used. The <br>
following settings are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default mode <br>
Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent
(though this can be changed, see --sparse below). If the
commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, <br>
follow only that parent. (Even if there are several TREESAME
parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise, follow all
parents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This results in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.-A---N---O <br>
/ / / <br>
I---------D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note how the rule to only follow
the TREESAME parent, if one is available, removed B from
consideration entirely. C was considered via N, but is
TREESAME. Root commits are <br>
compared to an empty tree, so I is !TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parent/child relations are only
visible with --parents, but that does not affect the commits
selected in default mode, so we have shown the parent
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-history without parent
rewriting <br>
This mode differs from the default in one point: always
follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one
of them. Even if more than one side of the merge has <br>
commits that are included, this does not imply that the
merge itself is! In the example, we get</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I A B N D O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P and M were excluded because
they are TREESAME to a parent. E, C and B were all walked,
but only B was !TREESAME, so the others do not appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that without parent
rewriting, it is not really possible to talk about the
parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
them disconnected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-history with parent
rewriting <br>
Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
(though this can be changed, see --sparse below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merges are always included.
However, their parent list is rewritten: Along each parent,
prune away commits that are not included themselves. This
results in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.-A---M---N---O---P <br>
/ / / / / <br>
I B / D / &nbsp; <br>
/ / / / <br>
&lsquo;-------------&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compare to --full-history
without rewriting above. Note that E was pruned away because
it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was rewritten to
contain E&rsquo;s parent I. The <br>
same happened for C and N. Note also that P was included
despite being TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the above
settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects
inclusion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dense <br>
Commits that are walked are included if they are not
TREESAME to any parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sparse <br>
All commits that are walked are included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that without
--full-history, this still simplifies merges: if one of the
parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other
sides of the merge are never walked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--simplify-merges <br>
First, build a history graph in the same way that
--full-history with parent rewriting does (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then simplify each commit C to
its replacement C&rsquo; in the final history according to
the following rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Set C&rsquo; to
C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Replace each
parent P of C&rsquo; with its simplification P&rsquo;. In
the process, drop parents that are ancestors of other
parents, and remove duplicates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If after this
parent rewriting, C&rsquo; is a root or merge commit (has
zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it
remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its <br>
only parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of this is best shown
by way of comparing to --full-history with parent rewriting.
The example turns into:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.-A---M---N---O <br>
/ / / <br>
I B D &nbsp; <br>
/ / <br>
&lsquo;---------&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the major differences in N
and P over --full-history:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; N&rsquo;s parent
list had I removed, because it is an ancestor of the other
parent M. Still, N remained because it is !TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; P&rsquo;s parent
list similarly had I removed. P was then removed completely,
because it had one parent and is TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there is a fifth
simplification mode available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ancestry-path <br>
Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the
ancestry chain between the &quot;from&quot; and
&quot;to&quot; commits in the given commit range. I.e. only
display commits that are ancestor <br>
of the &quot;to&quot; commit, and descendants of the
&quot;from&quot; commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example use case, consider
the following commit history:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D---E-------F <br>
/ &nbsp; B---C---G---H---I---J <br>
/ A-------K---------------L--M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A regular D..M computes the set
of commits that are ancestors of M, but excludes the ones
that are ancestors of D. This is useful to see what happened
to the history leading <br>
to M since D, in the sense that &quot;what does M have that
did not exist in D&quot;. The result in this example would
be all the commits, except A and B (and D itself, of
course).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When we want to find out what
commits in M are contaminated with the bug introduced by D
and need fixing, however, we might want to view only the
subset of D..M that are <br>
actually descendants of D, i.e. excluding C and K. This is
exactly what the --ancestry-path option does. Applied to the
D..M range, it results in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E-------F &nbsp; <br>
G---H---I---J <br>
L--M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --simplify-by-decoration
option allows you to view only the big picture of the
topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not
referenced by tags. Commits are <br>
marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept after history
simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the
paths <br>
given on the command line. All other commits are marked as
TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commit Ordering <br>
By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date-order <br>
Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
otherwise show commits in the commit timestamp order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--topo-order <br>
Show no parents before all of its children are shown, and
avoid showing commits on multiple lines of history
intermixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, in a commit history
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">---1----2----4----7 &nbsp; <br>
3----5----6----8---</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the numbers denote the
order of commit timestamps, git rev-list and friends with
--date-order show the commits in the timestamp order: 8 7 6
5 4 3 2 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --topo-order, they would
show 8 6 5 3 7 4 2 1 (or 8 7 4 2 6 5 3 1); some older
commits are shown before newer ones in order to avoid
showing the commits from two <br>
parallel development track mixed together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reverse <br>
Output the commits in reverse order. Cannot be combined with
--walk-reflogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object Traversal <br>
These options are mostly targeted for packing of Git
repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--objects <br>
Print the object IDs of any object referenced by the listed
commits. --objects foo ^bar thus means &quot;send me all
object IDs which I need to download if I have the commit
<br>
object bar, but not foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--objects-edge <br>
Similar to --objects, but also print the IDs of excluded
commits prefixed with a &quot;-&quot; character. This is
used by git-pack-objects(1) to build &quot;thin&quot; pack,
which records <br>
objects in deltified form based on objects contained in
these excluded commits to reduce network traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unpacked <br>
Only useful with --objects; print the object IDs that are
not in packs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]
<br>
Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their
ancestors. This has no effect if a range is specified. If
the argument &quot;unsorted&quot; is given, the commits are
show in the <br>
order they were given on the command line. Otherwise (if
&quot;sorted&quot; or no argument was given), the commits
are show in reverse chronological order by commit time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--do-walk <br>
Overrides a previous --no-walk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commit Formatting <br>
--pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt; <br>
Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given
format, where &lt;format&gt; can be one of oneline, short,
medium, full, fuller, email, raw and format:&lt;string&gt;.
See the <br>
&quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section for some additional
details for each format. When omitted, the format defaults
to medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: you can specify the
default pretty format in the repository configuration (see
git-config(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abbrev-commit <br>
Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit
object name, show only a partial prefix. Non default number
of digits can be specified with
&quot;--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&quot; (which also <br>
modifies diff output, if it is displayed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should make
&quot;--pretty=oneline&quot; a whole lot more readable for
people using 80-column terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-abbrev-commit <br>
Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This
negates --abbrev-commit and those options which imply it
such as &quot;--oneline&quot;. It also overrides the <br>
log.abbrevCommit variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oneline <br>
This is a shorthand for &quot;--pretty=oneline
--abbrev-commit&quot; used together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--encoding[=&lt;encoding&gt;]
<br>
The commit objects record the encoding used for the log
message in their encoding header; this option can be used to
tell the command to re-code the commit log message in the
<br>
encoding preferred by the user. For non plumbing commands
this defaults to UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notes[=&lt;ref&gt;] <br>
Show the notes (see git-notes(1)) that annotate the commit,
when showing the commit log message. This is the default for
git log, git show and git whatchanged commands when <br>
there is no --pretty, --format nor --oneline option given on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the notes shown are
from the notes refs listed in the core.notesRef and
notes.displayRef variables (or corresponding environment
overrides). See git-config(1) for <br>
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With an optional &lt;ref&gt;
argument, show this notes ref instead of the default notes
ref(s). The ref is taken to be in refs/notes/ if it is not
qualified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple --notes options can be
combined to control which notes are being displayed.
Examples: &quot;--notes=foo&quot; will show only notes from
&quot;refs/notes/foo&quot;; &quot;--notes=foo --notes&quot;
<br>
will show both notes from &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot; and
from the default notes ref(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-notes <br>
Do not show notes. This negates the above --notes option, by
resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
Options are parsed in the order given on the command <br>
line, so e.g. &quot;--notes --notes=foo --no-notes
--notes=bar&quot; will only show notes from
&quot;refs/notes/bar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;],
--[no-]standard-notes <br>
These options are deprecated. Use the above
--notes/--no-notes options instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-signature <br>
Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the
signature to gpg --verify and show the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relative-date <br>
Synonym for --date=relative.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=(relative|local|default|iso|rfc|short|raw)
<br>
Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format,
such as when using &quot;--pretty&quot;. log.date config
variable sets a default value for log command&acirc;s --date
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=relative shows dates
relative to the current time, e.g. &quot;2 hours
ago&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=local shows timestamps in
user&acirc;s local timezone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=iso (or --date=iso8601)
shows timestamps in ISO 8601 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=rfc (or --date=rfc2822)
shows timestamps in RFC 2822 format, often found in E-mail
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=short shows only date but
not time, in YYYY-MM-DD format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=raw shows the date in the
internal raw Git format %s %z format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date=default shows timestamps
in the original timezone (either committer&acirc;s or
author&acirc;s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parents <br>
Print also the parents of the commit (in the form
&quot;commit parent...&quot;). Also enables parent
rewriting, see History Simplification below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--children <br>
Print also the children of the commit (in the form
&quot;commit child...&quot;). Also enables parent rewriting,
see History Simplification below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--left-right <br>
Mark which side of a symmetric diff a commit is reachable
from. Commits from the left side are prefixed with &lt; and
those from the right with &gt;. If combined with --boundary,
<br>
those commits are prefixed with -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you have this
topology:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y---b---b branch B <br>
/ &nbsp;/ <br>
/ . <br>
/ / o---x---a---a branch A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you would get an output like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git rev-list --left-right
--boundary --pretty=oneline A...B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b <br>
&gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b <br>
&lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a <br>
&lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a <br>
-yyyyyyy... 1st on b <br>
-xxxxxxx... 1st on a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--graph <br>
Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit
history on the left hand side of the output. This may cause
extra lines to be printed in between commits, in order <br>
for the graph history to be drawn properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This enables parent rewriting,
see History Simplification below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This implies the --topo-order
option by default, but the --date-order option may also be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff Formatting <br>
Below are listed options that control the formatting of diff
output. Some of them are specific to git-rev-list(1),
however other diff options may be given. See
git-diff-files(1) <br>
for more options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
With this option, diff output for a merge commit shows the
differences from each of the parents to the merge result
simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff between a
<br>
parent and the result one at a time. Furthermore, it lists
only files which were modified from all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cc <br>
This flag implies the -c option and further compresses the
patch output by omitting uninteresting hunks whose contents
in the parents have only two variants and the merge <br>
result picks one of them without modification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
This flag makes the merge commits show the full diff like
regular commits; for each merge parent, a separate log entry
and diff is generated. An exception is that only diff <br>
against the first parent is shown when --first-parent option
is given; in that case, the output represents the changes
the merge brought into the then-current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
Show recursive diffs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
Show the tree objects in the diff output. This implies
-r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Suppress diff output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRETTY FORMATS <br>
If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not
oneline, email or raw, an additional line is inserted before
the Author: line. This line begins with &quot;Merge: &quot;
and the <br>
sha1s of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces.
Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list
of the direct parent commits if you have limited your <br>
view of history: for example, if you are only interested in
changes related to a certain directory or file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several built-in
formats, and you can define additional formats by setting a
pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another format
name, or a format: string, as <br>
described below (see git-config(1)). Here are the details of
the built-in formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; oneline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;sha1&gt; &lt;title
line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is designed to be as
compact as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; short</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit &lt;sha1&gt; <br>
Author: &lt;author&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; medium</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit &lt;sha1&gt; <br>
Author: &lt;author&gt; <br>
Date: &lt;author date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; full</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit &lt;sha1&gt; <br>
Author: &lt;author&gt; <br>
Commit: &lt;committer&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; fuller</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit &lt;sha1&gt; <br>
Author: &lt;author&gt; <br>
AuthorDate: &lt;author date&gt; <br>
Commit: &lt;committer&gt; <br>
CommitDate: &lt;committer date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; email</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;date&gt;
<br>
From: &lt;author&gt; <br>
Date: &lt;author date&gt; <br>
Subject: [PATCH] &lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The raw format shows the entire
commit exactly as stored in the commit object. Notably, the
SHA-1s are displayed in full, regardless of whether --abbrev
or --no-abbrev are <br>
used, and parents information show the true parent commits,
without taking grafts nor history simplification into
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
format:&lt;string&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format:&lt;string&gt; format
allows you to specify which information you want to show. It
works a little bit like printf format, with the notable
exception that you get a <br>
newline with %n instead of 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g, format:&quot;The author of
%h was %an, %ar%nThe title was &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n&quot;
would show something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The author of fe6e0ee was Junio
C Hamano, 23 hours ago <br>
The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %Creset: reset
color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %C(...): color
specification, as described in color.branch.* config option;
adding auto, at the beginning will emit color only when
colors are enabled for log output (by <br>
color.diff, color.ui, or --color, and respecting the auto
settings of the former if we are going to a terminal). auto
alone (i.e. %C(auto)) will turn on auto coloring <br>
on the next placeholders until the color is switched
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %m: left, right
or boundary mark</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %n: newline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
%w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]]): switch line
wrapping, like the -w option of git-shortlog(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc]): make the next
placeholder take at least N columns, padding spaces on the
right if necessary. Optionally truncate at the beginning
(ltrunc), <br>
the middle (mtrunc) or the end (trunc) if the output is
longer than N columns. Note that truncating only works
correctly with N &gt;= 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;): make the next placeholder take at least
until Nth columns, padding spaces on the right if
necessary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
%&gt;(&lt;N&gt;), %&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;): similar to
%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;), %&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;) respectively, but
padding spaces on the left</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
%&gt;&gt;(&lt;N&gt;), %&gt;&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;): similar to
%&gt;(&lt;N&gt;), %&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;) respectively, except
that if the next placeholder takes more spaces than given
and there are spaces on its left, use <br>
those spaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
%&gt;&lt;(&lt;N&gt;), %&gt;&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;): similar to %
&lt;(&lt;N&gt;), %&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;) respectively, but padding
both sides (i.e. the text is centered)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
revision traversal engine. For example, the %g* reflog
options will insert an empty string unless we are traversing
<br>
reflog entries (e.g., by git log -g). The %d placeholder
will use the &quot;short&quot; decoration format if
--decorate was not already provided on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add a + (plus sign) after
% of a placeholder, a line-feed is inserted immediately
before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands
to a non-empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add a - (minus sign)
after % of a placeholder, line-feeds that immediately
precede the expansion are deleted if and only if the
placeholder expands to an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add a &lsquo; &lsquo;
(space) after % of a placeholder, a space is inserted
immediately before the expansion if and only if the
placeholder expands to a non-empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tformat:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tformat: format works
exactly like format:, except that it provides
&quot;terminator&quot; semantics instead of
&quot;separator&quot; semantics. In other words, each commit
has the message <br>
terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather
than a separator placed between entries. This means that the
final entry of a single-line format will be properly <br>
terminated with a new line, just as the &quot;oneline&quot;
format does. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h
4da45bef | perl -pe &rsquo;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE0
unless /0&rsquo; <br>
4da45be <br>
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h
4da45bef | perl -pe &rsquo;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE0
unless /0&rsquo; <br>
4da45be <br>
7134973</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, any unrecognized
string that has a % in it is interpreted as if it has
tformat: in front of it. For example, these two are
equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h
4da45bef <br>
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON DIFF OPTIONS <br>
-p, -u, --patch <br>
Generate patch (see section on generating patches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;
<br>
Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
the usual three. Implies -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--raw <br>
Generate the raw format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patch-with-raw <br>
Synonym for -p --raw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minimal <br>
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patience <br>
Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot;
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--histogram <br>
Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot;
algorithm.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}
<br>
Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default, myers <br>
The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimal <br>
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patience <br>
Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histogram <br>
This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
&quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if you configured
diff.algorithm variable to a non-default value and want to
use the default one, then you have to use
--diff-algorithm=default option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]
<br>
Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary
will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the
graph part. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or
<br>
80 columns if not connected to a terminal, and can be
overridden by &lt;width&gt;. The width of the filename part
can be limited by giving another width &lt;name-width&gt;
after a comma. <br>
The width of the graph part can be limited by using
--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt; (affects all commands
generating a stat graph) or by setting
diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt; (does <br>
not affect git format-patch). By giving a third parameter
&lt;count&gt;, you can limit the output to the first
&lt;count&gt; lines, followed by ... if there are more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These parameters can also be set
individually with --stat-width=&lt;width&gt;,
--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt; and
--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numstat <br>
Similar to --stat, but shows number of added and deleted
lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation,
to make it more machine friendly. For binary files, <br>
outputs two - instead of saying 0 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shortstat <br>
Output only the last line of the --stat format containing
total number of modified files, as well as number of added
and deleted lines.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]
<br>
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for
each sub-directory. The behavior of --dirstat can be
customized by passing it a comma separated list of
parameters. <br>
The defaults are controlled by the diff.dirstat
configuration variable (see git-config(1)). The following
parameters are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changes <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have
been removed from the source, or added to the destination.
This ignores the amount of pure code movements <br>
within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in a file
is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lines <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based
diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts.
(For binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, <br>
since binary files have no natural concept of lines). This
is a more expensive --dirstat behavior than the changes
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a <br>
file as much as other changes. The resulting output is
consistent with what you get from the other --*stat
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files
changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat
analysis. This is the computationally cheapest <br>
--dirstat behavior, since it does not have to look at the
file contents at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cumulative <br>
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory
as well. Note that when using cumulative, the sum of the
percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default <br>
(non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
noncumulative parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;limit&gt; <br>
An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
default). Directories contributing less than this percentage
of the changes are not shown in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: The following will
count changed files, while ignoring directories with less
than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts <br>
in the parent directories:
--dirstat=files,10,cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary <br>
Output a condensed summary of extended header information
such as creations, renames and mode changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patch-with-stat <br>
Synonym for -p --stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z <br>
Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new
newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, when --raw or --numstat
has been given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as
output field terminators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, each
pathname output will have TAB, LF, double quotes, and
backslash characters replaced with , 0 <br>
enclosed in double quotes if any of those replacements
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name-only <br>
Show only names of changed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name-status <br>
Show only names and status of changed files. See the
description of the --diff-filter option on what the status
letters mean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]
<br>
Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When
--submodule or --submodule=log is given, the log format is
used. This format lists the commits in the range like git-
<br>
submodule(1)summary does. Omitting the --submodule option or
specifying --submodule=short, uses the short format. This
format just shows the names of the commits at the <br>
beginning and end of the range. Can be tweaked via the
diff.submodule configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color[=&lt;when&gt;] <br>
Show colored diff. --color (i.e. without =&lt;when&gt;) is
the same as --color=always. &lt;when&gt; can be one of
always, never, or auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-color <br>
Turn off colored diff. It is the same as --color=never.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;] <br>
Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit changed
words. By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
--word-diff-regex below. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to plain,
and <br>
must be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color <br>
Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies
--color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plain <br>
Show words as [-removed-] and {+added+}. Makes no attempts
to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the
output may be ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">porcelain <br>
Use a special line-based format intended for script
consumption. Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the
usual unified diff format, starting with a +/-/&lsquo;
&lsquo; <br>
character at the beginning of the line and extending to the
end of the line. Newlines in the input are represented by a
tilde ~ on a line of its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
Disable word diff again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that despite the name of
the first mode, color is used to highlight the changed parts
in all modes if enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;
<br>
Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of
considering runs of non-whitespace to be a word. Also
implies --word-diff unless it was already enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every non-overlapping match of
the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a word. Anything between
these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!) for
the purposes of finding <br>
differences. You may want to append |[^[:space:]] to your
regular expression to make sure that it matches all
non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a newline
is <br>
silently truncated(!) at the newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The regex can also be set via a
diff driver or configuration option, see gitattributes(1) or
git-config(1). Giving it explicitly overrides any diff
driver or configuration <br>
setting. Diff drivers override configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]
<br>
Equivalent to --word-diff=color plus (if a regex was
specified) --word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-renames <br>
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file
gives the default to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check <br>
Warn if changes introduce whitespace errors. What are
considered whitespace errors is controlled by
core.whitespace configuration. By default, trailing
whitespaces (including <br>
lines that solely consist of whitespaces) and a space
character that is immediately followed by a tab character
inside the initial indent of the line are considered <br>
whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if problems
are found. Not compatible with --exit-code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-index <br>
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
pre- and post-image blob object names on the
&quot;index&quot; line when generating patch format
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary <br>
In addition to --full-index, output a binary diff that can
be applied with git-apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name
in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show
only a partial prefix. This is independent of the <br>
--full-index option above, which controls the diff-patch
output format. Non default number of digits can be specified
with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
--break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]] <br>
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
create. This serves two purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It affects the way a change that
amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of
deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines
that happen to match <br>
textually as the context, but as a single deletion of
everything old followed by a single insertion of everything
new, and the number m controls this aspect of the -B option
<br>
(defaults to 60%). -B/70% specifies that less than 30% of
the original should remain in the result for Git to consider
it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch <br>
will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together
with context lines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with -M, a
totally-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a
rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
the source of a rename), and <br>
the number n controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults
to 50%). -B20% specifies that a change with addition and
deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&acirc;s size
are <br>
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a
rename to another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M[&lt;n&gt;],
--find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each
commit. For following files across renames while traversing
history, see --follow. If n is specified, it is a <br>
threshold on the similarity index (i.e. amount of
addition/deletions compared to the file&acirc;s size). For
example, -M90% means Git should consider a delete/add pair
to be a <br>
rename if more than 90% of the file hasn&acirc;t changed.
Without a % sign, the number is to be read as a fraction,
with a decimal point before it. I.e., -M5 becomes 0.5, and
is <br>
thus the same as -M50%. Similarly, -M05 is the same as -M5%.
To limit detection to exact renames, use -M100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C[&lt;n&gt;],
--find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Detect copies as well as renames. See also
--find-copies-harder. If n is specified, it has the same
meaning as for -M&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--find-copies-harder <br>
For performance reasons, by default, -C option finds copies
only if the original file of the copy was modified in the
same changeset. This flag makes the command inspect <br>
unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy. This
is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it
with caution. Giving more than one -C option has the <br>
same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --irreversible-delete <br>
Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header
but not the diff between the preimage and /dev/null. The
resulting patch is not meant to be applied with patch nor
<br>
git apply; this is solely for people who want to just
concentrate on reviewing the text after the change. In
addition, the output obviously lack enough information to
apply <br>
such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of
the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used together with -B, omit
also the preimage in the deletion part of a delete/create
pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l&lt;num&gt; <br>
The -M and -C options require O(n^2) processing time where n
is the number of potential rename/copy targets. This option
prevents rename/copy detection from running if the <br>
number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified
number.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]
<br>
Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted
(D), Modified (M), Renamed (R), have their type (i.e.
regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (T), are <br>
Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have had their pairing
Broken (B). Any combination of the filter characters
(including none) can be used. When * (All-or-none) is added
to <br>
the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is
no file that matches other criteria, nothing is <br>
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S&lt;string&gt; <br>
Look for differences that introduce or remove an instance of
&lt;string&gt;. Note that this is different than the string
simply appearing in diff output; see the pickaxe entry in
<br>
gitdiffcore(7) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G&lt;regex&gt; <br>
Look for differences whose added or removed line matches the
given &lt;regex&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pickaxe-all <br>
When -S or -G finds a change, show all the changes in that
changeset, not just the files that contain the change in
&lt;string&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pickaxe-regex <br>
Make the &lt;string&gt; not a plain string but an extended
POSIX regex to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O&lt;orderfile&gt; <br>
Output the patch in the order specified in the
&lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob pattern per
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R <br>
Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
on-disk file to tree contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relative[=&lt;path&gt;] <br>
When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told
to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames
relative to it with this option. When you are not in a <br>
subdirectory (e.g. in a bare repository), you can name which
subdirectory to make the output relative to by giving a
&lt;path&gt; as an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --text <br>
Treat all files as text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-space-at-eol <br>
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --ignore-space-change <br>
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of
one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --ignore-all-space <br>
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
differences even if one line has whitespace where the other
line has none.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;
<br>
Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --function-context <br>
Show whole surrounding functions of changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ext-diff <br>
Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an
external diff driver with gitattributes(5), you need to use
this option with git-log(1) and friends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ext-diff <br>
Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--textconv, --no-textconv <br>
Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be
run when comparing binary files. See gitattributes(5) for
details. Because textconv filters are typically a one-way
<br>
conversion, the resulting diff is suitable for human
consumption, but cannot be applied. For this reason,
textconv filters are enabled by default only for git-diff(1)
and <br>
git-log(1), but not for git-format-patch(1) or diff plumbing
commands.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]
<br>
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.
&lt;when&gt; can be either &quot;none&quot;,
&quot;untracked&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;,
which is the default. Using &quot;none&quot; will consider
the <br>
submodule modified when it either contains untracked or
modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded
in the superproject and can be used to override any <br>
settings of the ignore option in git-config(1) or
gitmodules(5). When &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules
are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked
content (but <br>
they are still scanned for modified content). Using
&quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree of
submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the
superproject are <br>
shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using
&quot;all&quot; hides all changes to submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
Show the given source prefix instead of &quot;a/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
Show the given destination prefix instead of
&quot;b/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-prefix <br>
Do not show any source or destination prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detailed explanation on
these common options, see also gitdiffcore(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P <br>
When &quot;git-diff-index&quot;, &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;,
or &quot;git-diff-files&quot; are run with a -p option,
&quot;git diff&quot; without the --raw option, or &quot;git
log&quot; with the &quot;-p&quot; option, they do not
produce <br>
the output described above; instead they produce a patch
file. You can customize the creation of such patches via the
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment <br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What the -p option produces is
slightly different from the traditional diff format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It is preceded with a
&quot;git diff&quot; header that looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --git a/file1 b/file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The a/ and b/ filenames are the
same unless rename/copy is involved. Especially, even for a
creation or a deletion, /dev/null is not used in place of
the a/ or b/ filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rename/copy is involved,
file1 and file2 show the name of the source file of the
rename/copy and the name of the file that rename/copy
produces, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. It is followed by one or more
extended header lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
new mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
new file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
copy from &lt;path&gt; <br>
copy to &lt;path&gt; <br>
rename from &lt;path&gt; <br>
rename to &lt;path&gt; <br>
similarity index &lt;number&gt; <br>
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt; <br>
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File modes are printed as
6-digit octal numbers including the file type and file
permission bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Path names in extended headers
do not include the a/ and b/ prefixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The similarity index is the
percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index
is the percentage of changed lines. It is a rounded down
integer, followed by a percent <br>
sign. The similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved
for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no
line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index line includes the
SHA-1 checksum before and after the change. The &lt;mode&gt;
is included if the file mode does not change; otherwise,
separate lines indicate the old <br>
and the new mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. TAB, LF, double quote and
backslash characters in pathnames are represented as , 0
<br>
is put in double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. All the file1 files in the
output refer to files before the commit, and all the file2
files refer to files after the commit. It is incorrect to
apply each change to each file <br>
sequentially. For example, this patch will swap a and b:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --git a/a b/b <br>
rename from a <br>
rename to b <br>
diff --git a/b b/a <br>
rename from b <br>
rename to a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMBINED DIFF FORMAT <br>
Any diff-generating command can take the &acirc;-c&lsquo; or
--cc option to produce a combined diff when showing a merge.
This is the default format when showing merges with
git-diff(1) or <br>
git-show(1). Note also that you can give the
&lsquo;-m&acirc; option to any of these commands to force
generation of diffs with individual parents of a merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A combined diff format looks
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --combined describe.c <br>
index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510 <br>
--- a/describe.c <br>
+++ b/describe.c <br>

initialized = 1; <br>
for_each_ref(get_name);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It is preceded with a
&quot;git diff&quot; header, that looks like this (when -c
option is used):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --combined file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or like this (when --cc option
is used):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --cc file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. It is followed by one or more
extended header lines (this example shows a merge with two
parents):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index
&lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; <br>
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; <br>
new file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode
&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; line appears only if
at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest.
Extended headers with information about detected contents
movement <br>
(renames and copying detection) are designed to work with
diff of two &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined
diff format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. It is followed by two-line
from-file/to-file header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--- a/file <br>
+++ b/file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to two-line header for
traditional unified diff format, /dev/null is used to signal
created or deleted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Chunk header format is
modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to
patch -p1. Combined diff format was created for review of
merge commit changes, and was not <br>
meant for apply. The change is similar to the change in the
extended index header:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt;
&lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are (number of parents +
1) @ characters in the chunk header for combined diff
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the traditional unified
diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single
column that has - (minus &acirc; appears in A but removed in
B), + (plus &acirc; missing in A but <br>
added to B), or &quot; &quot; (space &acirc; unchanged)
prefix, this format compares two or more files file1,
file2,... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each
of fileN. One column <br>
for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note
how X&acirc;s line is different from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A - character in the column N
means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear
in the result. A + character in the column N means that the
line appears in the result, <br>
and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line
was added, from the point of view of that parent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example output, the
function signature was changed from both files (hence two -
removals from both file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean one line
that was added does not <br>
appear in either file1 nor file2). Also eight other lines
are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence
prefixed with +).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When shown by git diff-tree -c,
it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge
result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents). When shown by
git diff-files -c, it compares <br>
the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file
(i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our version&quot;, file2 is
stage 3 aka &quot;their version&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
git log --no-merges <br>
Show the whole commit history, but skip any merges</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log v2.6.12.. include/scsi
drivers/scsi <br>
Show all commits since version v2.6.12 that changed any file
in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log --since=&quot;2 weeks
ago&quot; -- gitk <br>
Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk.
The &quot;--&quot; is necessary to avoid confusion with the
branch named gitk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log --name-status
release..test <br>
Show the commits that are in the &quot;test&quot; branch but
not yet in the &quot;release&quot; branch, along with the
list of paths each commit modifies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log --follow
builtin-rev-list.c <br>
Shows the commits that changed builtin-rev-list.c, including
those commits that occurred before the file was given its
present name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log --branches --not
--remotes=origin <br>
Shows all commits that are in any of local branches but not
in any of remote-tracking branches for origin (what you have
that origin doesn&acirc;t).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log master --not
--remotes=*/master <br>
Shows all commits that are in local master but not in any
remote repository master branches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log -p -m --first-parent
<br>
Shows the history including change diffs, but only from the
&quot;main branch&quot; perspective, skipping commits that
come from merged branches, and showing full diffs of changes
<br>
introduced by the merges. This makes sense only when
following a strict policy of merging all topic branches when
staying on a single integration branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log -3 <br>
Limits the number of commits to show to 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
At the core level, Git is character encoding agnostic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The pathnames
recorded in the index and in the tree objects are treated as
uninterpreted sequences of non-NUL bytes. What readdir(2)
returns are what are recorded and <br>
compared with the data Git keeps track of, which in turn are
expected to be what lstat(2) and creat(2) accepts. There is
no such thing as pathname encoding translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The contents of
the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There
is no encoding translation at the core level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The commit log
messages are uninterpreted sequences of non-NUL bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although we encourage that the
commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8, both the core and
Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on projects.
If all participants of a <br>
particular project find it more convenient to use legacy
encodings, Git does not forbid it. However, there are a few
things to keep in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. git commit and git
commit-tree issues a warning if the commit log message given
to it does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you
explicitly say your project uses a <br>
legacy encoding. The way to say this is to have
i18n.commitencoding in .git/config file, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[i18n] <br>
commitencoding = ISO-8859-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commit objects created with the
above setting record the value of i18n.commitencoding in its
encoding header. This is to help other people who look at
them later. Lack of <br>
this header implies that the commit log message is encoded
in UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. git log, git show, git blame
and friends look at the encoding header of a commit object,
and try to re-code the log message into UTF-8 unless
otherwise specified. You can <br>
specify the desired output encoding with
i18n.logoutputencoding in .git/config file, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[i18n] <br>
logoutputencoding = ISO-8859-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not have this
configuration variable, the value of i18n.commitencoding is
used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that we deliberately chose
not to re-code the commit log message when a commit is made
to force UTF-8 at the commit object level, because re-coding
to UTF-8 is not <br>
necessarily a reversible operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
See git-config(1) for core variables and git-diff(1) for
settings related to diff generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.pretty <br>
Default for the --format option. (See &quot;PRETTY
FORMATS&quot; above.) Defaults to &quot;medium&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i18n.logOutputEncoding <br>
Encoding to use when displaying logs. (See
&quot;Discussion&quot;, above.) Defaults to the value of
i18n.commitEncoding if set, UTF-8 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log.date <br>
Default format for human-readable dates. (Compare the --date
option.) Defaults to &quot;default&quot;, which means to
write dates like Sat May 8 19:35:34 2010 -0500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log.showroot <br>
If false, git log and related commands will not treat the
initial commit as a big creation event. Any root commits in
git log -p output would be shown without a diff <br>
attached. The default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailmap.* <br>
See git-shortlog(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.displayRef <br>
Which refs, in addition to the default set by core.notesRef
or GIT_NOTES_REF, to read notes from when showing commit
messages with the log family of commands. See git- <br>
notes(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">May be an unabbreviated ref name
or a glob and may be specified multiple times. A warning
will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that
does not match any refs <br>
is silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting can be disabled by
the --no-notes option, overridden by the
GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF environment variable, and overridden
by the --notes=&lt;ref&gt; option.</p>
