ARCHIVEMAIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
archivemail - archive and compress your old email</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
archivemail [options] {MAILBOX...}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
archivemail is a tool for archiving and compressing old
email in mailboxes. By default it will read the mailbox
MAILBOX, moving messages that are older than the specified
number <br>
of days (180 by default) to a mbox(5)-format mailbox in the
same directory that is compressed with gzip(1). It can also
just delete old email rather than archive it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, archivemail derives
the archive filename from the mailbox name by appending an
_archive suffix to the mailbox name. For example, if you run
archivemail on a mailbox <br>
called exsouthrock, the archive will be created with the
filename exsouthrock_archive.gz. This default behavior can
be overridden with command line options, choosing a custom
<br>
suffix, a prefix, or a completely custom name for the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archivemail supports reading
IMAP, Maildir, MH and mbox-format mailboxes, but always
writes mbox-format archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages that are flagged
important are not archived or deleted unless explicitly
requested with the --include-flagged option. Also,
archivemail can be configured not to archive <br>
unread mail, or to only archive messages larger than a
specified size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive an IMAP-format
mailbox, use the format
imap://username:password@server/mailbox to specify the
mailbox. archivemail will expand wildcards in IMAP mailbox
names <br>
according to [RFC 3501], which says: &acirc;The character
&quot;*&quot; is a wildcard, and matches zero or more
characters at this position. The character &quot;%&quot; is
similar to &quot;*&quot;, but it does not <br>
match a hierarchy delimiter.&acirc; You can omit the
password from the URL; use the --pwfile option to make
archivemail read the password from a file, or alternatively
just enter it <br>
upon request. If the --pwfile option is set, archivemail
does not look for a password in the URL, and the colon is
not considered a delimiter. Substitute imap with imaps, and
<br>
archivemail will establish a secure SSL connection. See
below for more IMAP peculiarities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d NUM, --days=NUM <br>
Archive messages older than NUM days. The default is 180.
This option is incompatible with the --date option
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D DATE, --date=DATE <br>
Archive messages older than DATE. DATE can be a date string
in ISO format (eg &acirc;2002-04-23&acirc;), Internet format
(eg&acirc;23 Apr 2002&acirc;) or Internet format with full
month names <br>
(eg&acirc;23 April 2002&acirc;). Two-digit years are not
supported. This option is incompatible with the --days
option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o PATH, --output-dir=PATH <br>
Use the directory name PATH to store the mailbox archives.
The default is the same directory as the mailbox to be
read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P FILE, --pwfile=FILE <br>
Read IMAP password from file FILE instead of from the
command line. Note that this will probably not work if you
are archiving folders from more than one IMAP account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F STRING,
--filter-append=STRING <br>
Append STRING to the IMAP filter string. For IMAP
wizards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p NAME, --prefix=NAME <br>
Prefix NAME to the archive name. NAME is expanded by the
python(1) function time.strftime(), which means that you can
specify special directives in NAME to make an archive <br>
named after the archive cut-off date. See the discussion of
the --suffix option for a list of valid strftime()
directives. The default is not to add a prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s NAME, --suffix=NAME <br>
Use the suffix NAME to create the filename used for
archives. The default is _archive, unless a prefix is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like a prefix, the suffix NAME
is expanded by the python(1) function time.strftime() with
the archive cut-off date. time.strftime() understands the
following directives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a Locale&rsquo;s abbreviated
weekday name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%A Locale&rsquo;s full weekday
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%b Locale&rsquo;s abbreviated
month name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%B Locale&rsquo;s full month
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c Locale&rsquo;s appropriate
date and time representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%d Day of the month as a decimal
number [01,31].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%H Hour (24-hour clock) as a
decimal number [00,23].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%I Hour (12-hour clock) as a
decimal number [01,12].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%j Day of the year as a decimal
number [001,366].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m Month as a decimal number
[01,12].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%M Minute as a decimal number
[00,59].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%p Locale&rsquo;s equivalent of
either AM or PM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%S Second as a decimal number
[00,61]. (1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%U Week number of the year
(Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number
[00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Sunday
are considered to be in <br>
week 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%w Weekday as a decimal number
[0(Sunday),6].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%W Week number of the year
(Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number
[00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Sunday
are considered to be in <br>
week 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%x Locale&rsquo;s appropriate
date representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%X Locale&rsquo;s appropriate
time representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%y Year without century as a
decimal number [00,99].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%Y Year with century as a
decimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%Z Time zone name (or by no
characters if no time zone exists).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A literal &acirc;%&acirc;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a NAME, --archive-name=NAME
<br>
Use NAME as the archive name, ignoring the name of the
mailbox that is archived. Like prefixes and suffixes, NAME
is expanded by time.strftime() with the archive cut-off <br>
date. Because it hard-codes the archive name, this option
cannot be used when archiving multiple mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S NUM, --size=NUM <br>
Only archive messages that are NUM bytes or greater.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Don&rsquo;t write to any files -- just show what would have
been done. This is useful for testing to see how many
messages would have been archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --preserve-unread <br>
Do not archive any messages that have not yet been read.
archivemail determines if a message in a mbox-format or
MH-format mailbox has been read by looking at the Status
<br>
header (if it exists). If the status header is equal to
&acirc;RO&acirc; or &acirc;OR&acirc; then archivemail
assumes the message has been read. archivemail determines if
a maildir message has been <br>
read by looking at the filename. If the filename contains an
&acirc;S&acirc; after :2, then it assumes the message has
been read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dont-mangle <br>
Do not mangle lines in message bodies beginning with
&acirc;From &acirc;. When archiving a message from a mailbox
not in mbox format, by default archivemail mangles such
lines by <br>
prepending a &acirc;&gt;&acirc; to them, since mail user
agents might otherwise interpret these lines as message
separators. Messages from mbox folders are never mangled.
See mbox(5) for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete <br>
Delete rather than archive old mail. Use this option with
caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--copy <br>
Copy rather than archive old mail. Creates an archive, but
the archived messages are not deleted from the originating
mailbox, which is left unchanged. This is a complement <br>
to the --delete option, and mainly useful for testing
purposes. Note that multiple passes will create duplicates,
since messages are blindly appended to an existing
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all <br>
Archive all messages, without distinction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-flagged <br>
Normally messages that are flagged important are not
archived or deleted. If you specify this option, these
messages can be archived or deleted just like any other
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-compress <br>
Do not compress any archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-duplicate <br>
Warn about duplicate Message-IDs that appear in the input
mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Reports lots of extra debugging information about what is
going on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-imap=NUM <br>
Set IMAP debugging level. This makes archivemail dump its
conversation with the IMAP server and some internal IMAP
processing to stdout. Higher values for NUM give more <br>
elaborate output. Set NUM to 4 to see all exchanged IMAP
commands. (Actually, NUM is just passed literally to
imaplib.Debug.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Turns on quiet mode. Do not print any statistics about how
many messages were archived. This should be used if you are
running archivemail from cron.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display the version of archivemail and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display brief summary information about how to run
archivemail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
archivemail requires python(1) version 2.3 or later. When
reading an mbox-format mailbox, archivemail will create a
lockfile with the extension .lock so that procmail(1) will
not <br>
deliver to the mailbox while it is being processed. It will
also create an advisory lock on the mailbox using lockf(2).
The archive is locked in the same way when it is updated.
<br>
archivemail will also complain and abort if a 3rd-party
modifies the mailbox while it is being read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archivemail will always attempt
to preserve the last-access and last-modify times of the
input mailbox. Archive mailboxes are always created with a
mode of 0600. If archivemail <br>
finds a pre-existing archive mailbox it will append rather
than overwrite that archive. archivemail will refuse to
operate on mailboxes that are symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archivemail attempts to find the
delivery date of a message by looking for valid dates in the
following headers, in order of precedence: Delivery-date,
Received, Resent-Date and <br>
Date. If it cannot find any valid date in these headers, it
will use the last-modified file timestamp on MH and Maildir
format mailboxes, or the date on the From_ line on <br>
mbox-format mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When archiving mailboxes with
leading dots in the name, archivemail will strip the dots
off the archive name, so that the resulting archive file is
not hidden. This is not done <br>
if the --prefix or --archive-name option is used. Should
there really be mailboxes distinguished only by leading dots
in the name, they will thus be archived to the same archive
<br>
file by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A conversion from other formats
to mbox(5) will silently overwrite existing Status and
X-Status message headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAP <br>
When archivemail processes an IMAP folder, all messages in
that folder will have their lag unset, and they will
probably not show up as &acirc;new&acirc; in your user agent
later <br>
on. There is no way around this, it&rsquo;s just how IMAP
works. This does not apply, however, if you run archivemail
with the options --dry-run or --copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archivemail relies on
server-side searches to determine the messages that should
be archived. When matching message dates, IMAP servers refer
to server internal message dates, <br>
and these may differ from both delivery time of a message
and its Date header. Also, there exist broken servers which
do not implement server side searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAP URLs <br>
archivemail&rsquo;s IMAPURL parser was written with the RFC
2882 (Internet Message Format) rules for the local-part of
email addresses in mind. So, rather than enforcing an <br>
URL-style encoding of non-ascii and reserved characters, it
allows you to double-quote the username and password. If
your username or password contains the delimiter <br>
characters &acirc;@&acirc; or &acirc;:&acirc;, just quote it
like this:
imap://&quot;username@bogus.com&quot;:&quot;password&quot;@imap.bogus.com/mailbox.
You can use a backslash to escape double-quotes that are
part <br>
of a quoted username or password. Note that quoting only a
substring will not work, and be aware that your shell will
probably remove unprotected quotes or backslashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, there is no need to
percent-encode non-ascii characters in IMAP mailbox names.
As long as your locale is configured properly, archivemail
should handle these <br>
without problems. Note, however, that due to limitations of
the IMAP protocol, non-ascii characters do not mix well with
wildcards in mailbox names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archivemail tries to be smart
when handling mailbox paths. In particular, it will
automatically add an IMAPNAMESPACE prefix to the mailbox
path if necessary; and if you are <br>
archiving a subfolder, you can use the slash as a path
separator instead of the IMAP server&rsquo;s internal
representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To archive all messages in the mailbox debian-user that are
older than 180 days to a compressed mailbox called
debian-user_archive.gz in the current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail
debian-user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive all messages in the
mailbox debian-user that are older than 180 days to a
compressed mailbox called debian-user_October_2001.gz (where
the current month and year is <br>
April, 2002) in the current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail --suffix
&rsquo;_%B_%Y&rsquo; debian-user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive all messages in the
mailbox cm-melb that are older than the first of January
2002 to a compressed mailbox called cm-melb_archive.gz in
the current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail
--date=&rsquo;1 Jan 2002&rsquo; cm-melb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exactly the same as the above
example, using an ISO date format instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail
--date=2002-01-01 cm-melb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To delete all messages in the
mailbox spam that are older than 30 days:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail --delete
--days=30 spam</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive all read messages in
the mailbox incoming that are older than 180 days to a
compressed mailbox called incoming_archive.gz in the current
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail
--preserve-unread incoming</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive all messages in the
mailbox received that are older than 180 days to an
uncompressed mailbox called received_archive in the current
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail --no-compress
received</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive all mailboxes in the
directory $HOME/Mail that are older than 90 days to
compressed mailboxes in the $HOME/Mail/Archive
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail -d90 -o
$HOME/Mail/Archive $HOME/Mail/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive all mails older than
180 days from the given IMAPINBOX to a compressed mailbox
INBOX_archive.gz in the $HOME/Mail/Archive directory,
quoting the password and reading <br>
it from the environment variable PASSWORD:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail -o
$HOME/Mail/Archive
imaps://user:&rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;$PASSWORD&rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;@example.org/INBOX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the protected quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive all mails older than
180 days in subfolders of foo on the given IMAP server to
corresponding archives in the current working directory,
reading the password from the <br>
file ~/imap-pass.txt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash$ archivemail
--pwfile=~/imap-pass.txt imaps://user@example.org/foo/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS <br>
Probably the best way to run archivemail is from your
crontab(5) file, using the --quiet option. Don&rsquo;t
forget to try the --dry-run and perhaps the --copy option
for <br>
non-destructive testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Normally the exit status is 0. Nonzero indicates an
unexpected error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If an IMAP mailbox path contains slashes, the archive
filename will be derived from the basename of the mailbox.
If the server&rsquo;s folder separator differs from the Unix
slash and <br>
is used in the IMAP URL, however, the whole path will be
considered the basename of the mailbox. E.g. the two URLs
imap://user@example.com/folder/subfolder and <br>
imap://user@example.com/folder.subfolder will be archived in
subfolder_archive.gz and folder.subfolder_archive.gz,
respectively, although they might refer to the same IMAP
<br>
mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archivemail does not support
reading MMDF or Babyl-format mailboxes. In fact, it will
probably think it is reading an mbox-format mailbox and
cause all sorts of problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archivemail is still too slow,
but if you are running from crontab(5) you won&rsquo;t care.
Archiving maildir-format mailboxes should be a lot quicker
than mbox-format mailboxes since <br>
it is less painful for the original mailbox to be
reconstructed after selective message removal.</p>
