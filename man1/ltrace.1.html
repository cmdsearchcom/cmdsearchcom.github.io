<b>ltrace</b> is a program that simply runs the specified <i>command</i> until
  it exits. It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are called
  by the executed process and the signals which are received by that process. It
  can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Its use is very similar to <b>strace(1)</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>ltrace</b> shows parameters of invoked functions and system calls. To
  determine what arguments each function has, it needs external declaration of
  function prototypes. Those are stored in files called <i>prototype</i>
  <i>libraries</i>--see ltrace.conf(5) for details on the syntax of these files.
  See the section <b>PROTOTYPE LIBRARY DISCOVERY</b> to learn how <b>ltrace</b>
  finds prototype libraries.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILTER_EXPRESSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILTER_EXPRESSIONS">FILTER
  EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
Filter expression is a chain of glob- or regexp-based rules that are used to
  pick symbols for tracing from libraries that the process uses. Most of it is
  intuitive, so as an example, the following would trace calls to malloc and
  free, except those done by libc:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
-e malloc+free-@libc.so*
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This reads: trace malloc and free, but don't trace anything that comes from
  libc. Semi-formally, the syntax of the above example looks approximately like
  this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
{[+-][ <i>symbol_pattern</i>][@<i>library_pattern</i>]}
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>Symbol_pattern</i> is used to match symbol names, <i>library_pattern</i> to
  match library SONAMEs. Both are implicitly globs, but can be regular
  expressions as well (see below). The glob syntax supports meta-characters
  <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> and character classes, similarly to what basic bash
  globs support. <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> are recognized to mean, respectively,
  start and end of given name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Both <i>symbol_pattern</i> and <i>library_pattern</i> have to match the whole
  name. If you want to match only part of the name, surround it with one or two
  *'s as appropriate. The exception is if the pattern is not mentioned at all,
  in which case it's as if the corresponding pattern were <b>*</b>. (So
  <b>malloc</b> is really <b>malloc@*</b> and <b>@libc.*</b> is really
  <b>*@libc.*</b>.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In libraries that don't have an explicit SONAME, basename is taken for SONAME.
  That holds for main binary as well: <b>/bin/echo</b> has an implicit SONAME of
  <b>echo</b>. In addition to that, special library pattern <b>MAIN</b> always
  matches symbols in the main binary and never a library with actual SONAME
  <b>MAIN</b> (use e.g. <b>^MAIN</b> or <b>[M]AIN</b> for that).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the symbol or library pattern is surrounded in slashes (/like this/), then it
  is considered a regular expression instead. As a shorthand, instead of writing
  <b>/x/@/y/</b>, you can write <b>/x@y/</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the library pattern starts with a slash, it is not a SONAME expression, but a
  path expression, and is matched against the library path name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first rule may lack a sign, in which case <b>+</b> is assumed. If, on the
  other hand, the first rule has a <b>-</b> sign, it is as if there was another
  rule <b>@</b> in front of it, which has the effect of tracing complement of
  given rule.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The above rules are used to construct the set of traced symbols. Each candidate
  symbol is passed through the chain of above rules. Initially, the symbol is
  <i>unmarked</i>. If it matches a <b>+</b> rule, it becomes <i>marked</i>, if
  it matches a <b>-</b> rule, it becomes <i>unmarked</i> again. If, after
  applying all rules, the symbol is <i>marked</i>, it will be traced.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROTOTYPE_LIBRARY_DISCOVERY"><a class="selflink" href="#PROTOTYPE_LIBRARY_DISCOVERY">PROTOTYPE
  LIBRARY DISCOVERY</a></h1>
When a library is mapped into the address space of a traced process, ltrace
  needs to know what the prototypes are of functions that this library
  implements. For purposes of ltrace, prototype really is a bit more than just
  type signature: it's also formatting of individual parameters and of return
  value. These prototypes are stored in files called prototype libraries.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After a library is mapped, ltrace finds out what its SONAME is. It then looks
  for a file named SONAME.conf--e.g. protolib for libc.so.6 would be in a file
  called libc.so.6.conf. When such file is found (more about where ltrace looks
  for these files is below), ltrace reads all prototypes stored therein. When a
  symbol table entry point (such as those traced by -x) is hit, the prototype is
  looked up in a prototype library corresponding to the library where the hit
  occured. When a library call (such as those traced by -e and -l) is hit, the
  prototype is looked up in all prototype libraries loaded for given process.
  That is necessary, because a library call is traced in a PLT table of a caller
  library, but the prototype is described at callee library.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a library has no SONAME, basename of library file is considered instead. For
  the main program binary, basename is considered as well (e.g. protolib for
  /bin/echo would be called echo.conf). If a name corresponding to soname (e.g.
  libc.so.6.conf) is not found, and the module under consideration is a shared
  library, ltrace also tries partial matches. Ltrace snips one period after
  another, retrying the search, until either a protolib is found, or X.so is all
  that's left. Thus libc.so.conf would be considered, but libc.conf not.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When looking for a prototype library, ltrace potentially looks into several
  directories. On Linux, those are $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ltrace, $HOME/.ltrace,
  <i>X</i>/ltrace for each <i>X</i> in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and /usr/share/ltrace.
  If the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not defined, ltrace looks into
  $HOME/.config/ltrace instead.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There's also a mechanism for loading legacy config files. If $HOME/.ltrace.conf
  exists it is imported to every loaded prototype library. Similarly for
  /etc/ltrace.conf. If both exist, both are imported, and $HOME/.ltrace.conf is
  consulted before /etc/ltrace.conf.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If -F contains any directories, those are searched in precedence to the above
  system directories, in the same order in which they are mentioned in -F. Any
  files passed in -F are imported similarly to above legacy config files, before
  them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See ltrace.conf(5) for details on the syntax of ltrace prototype library files.
