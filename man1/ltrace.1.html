<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltrace -V|--version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltrace -h|--help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ltrace is a program that simply runs the specified command
until it exits. It intercepts and records the dynamic
library calls which are called by the executed process and
the <br>
signals which are received by that process. It can also
intercept and print the system calls executed by the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Its use is very similar to
strace(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltrace shows parameters of
invoked functions and system calls. To determine what
arguments each function has, it needs external declaration
of function prototypes. Those are <br>
stored in files called prototype libraries--see
ltrace.conf(5) for details on the syntax of these files. See
the section PROTOTYPE LIBRARY DISCOVERY to learn how ltrace
finds <br>
prototype libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --align column <br>
Align return values in a specific column (default column is
5/8 of screen width).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A maxelts <br>
Maximum number of array elements to print before suppressing
the rest with an ellipsis (&quot;...&quot;). This also
limits number of recursive structure expansions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --no-signals <br>
Disable printing of signals recieved by the traced
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Count time and calls for each
library call and report a summary on program exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --demangle <br>
Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level
names. Besides removing any initial underscore prefix used
by the system, this makes C++ function names readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --debug mask <br>
Show debugging output of ltrace itself. mask is a number
describing which debug messages should be displayed. Use the
option -Dh to see what can be used, but note that <br>
currently the only reliable debugmask is 77, which shows all
debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e filter <br>
A qualifying expression which modifies which library calls
to trace. The format of the filter expression is described
in the section FILTER EXPRESSIONS. If more than one <br>
-e option appears on the command line, the library calls
that match any of them are traced. If no -e is given, @MAIN
is assumed as a default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Trace child processes as they
are created by currently traced processes as a result of the
fork(2) or clone(2) system calls. The new process is
attached immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F pathlist <br>
Contains a colon-separated list of paths. If a path refers
to a directory, that directory is considered when prototype
libraries are searched (see the section PROTOTYPE <br>
LIBRARY DISCOVERY). If it refers to a file, that file is
imported implicitly to all loaded prototype libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show a summary of the options to ltrace and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Print the instruction pointer
at the time of the library call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --library library_pattern
<br>
Display only calls to functions implemented by libraries
that match library_pattern. Multiple library patters can be
specified with several instances of this option. <br>
Syntax of library_pattern is described in section FILTER
EXPRESSIONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that while this option
selects calls that might be directed to the selected
libraries, there&rsquo;s no actual guarantee that the call
won&rsquo;t be directed elsewhere due to <br>
e.g. LD_PRELOAD or simply dependency ordering. If you want
to make sure that symbols in given library are actually
called, use -x @library_pattern instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L When no -e option is given,
don&rsquo;t assume the default action of @MAIN. In practice
this means that library calls will not be traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --indent nr <br>
Indent trace output by nr spaces for each level of call
nesting. Using this option makes the program flow
visualization easy to follow. This indents uselessly also
func&acirc; <br>
tions that never return, such as service functions for
throwing exceptions in the C++ runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output filename <br>
Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid Attach to the process
with the process ID pid and begin tracing. This option can
be used together with passing a command to execute. It is
possible to attach to several <br>
processes by passing more than one option -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Print a relative timestamp
with each line of the trace. This records the time
difference between the beginning of successive lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s strsize <br>
Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is
32).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Display system calls as well
as library calls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Prefix each line of the trace
with the time of day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tt If given twice, the time
printed will include the microseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ttt If given thrice, the time
printed will include the microseconds and the leading
portion will be printed as the number of seconds since the
epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Show the time spent inside
each call. This records the time difference between the
beginning and the end of each call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username <br>
Run command with the userid, groupid and supplementary
groups of username. This option is only useful when running
as root and enables the correct execution of setuid <br>
and/or setgid binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --where nr <br>
Show backtrace of nr stack frames for each traced function.
This option enabled only if libunwind support was enabled at
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x filter <br>
A qualifying expression which modifies which symbol table
entry points to trace. The format of the filter expression
is described in the section FILTER EXPRESSIONS. If <br>
more than one -x option appears on the command line, the
symbols that match any of them are traced. No entry points
are traced if no -x is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show the version number of ltrace and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTER EXPRESSIONS <br>
Filter expression is a chain of glob- or regexp-based rules
that are used to pick symbols for tracing from libraries
that the process uses. Most of it is intuitive, so as an
<br>
example, the following would trace calls to malloc and free,
except those done by libc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e malloc+free-@libc.so*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This reads: trace malloc and
free, but don&rsquo;t trace anything that comes from libc.
Semi-formally, the syntax of the above example looks
approximately like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">{[+-][symbol_pattern][@library_pattern]}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbol_pattern is used to match
symbol names, library_pattern to match library SONAMEs. Both
are implicitly globs, but can be regular expressions as well
(see below). The glob <br>
syntax supports meta-characters * and ? and character
classes, similarly to what basic bash globs support. ^ and $
are recognized to mean, respectively, start and end of given
<br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both symbol_pattern and
library_pattern have to match the whole name. If you want to
match only part of the name, surround it with one or two
*&rsquo;s as appropriate. The exception <br>
is if the pattern is not mentioned at all, in which case
it&rsquo;s as if the corresponding pattern were *. (So
malloc is really malloc@* and @libc.* is really
*@libc.*.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In libraries that don&rsquo;t
have an explicit SONAME, basename is taken for SONAME. That
holds for main binary as well: /bin/echo has an implicit
SONAME of echo. In addition to <br>
that, special library pattern MAIN always matches symbols in
the main binary and never a library with actual SONAME MAIN
(use e.g. ^MAIN or [M]AIN for that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the symbol or library pattern
is surrounded in slashes (/like this/), then it is
considered a regular expression instead. As a shorthand,
instead of writing /x/@/y/, you can <br>
write /x@y/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the library pattern starts
with a slash, it is not a SONAME expression, but a path
expression, and is matched against the library path
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first rule may lack a sign,
in which case + is assumed. If, on the other hand, the first
rule has a - sign, it is as if there was another rule @ in
front of it, which has <br>
the effect of tracing complement of given rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above rules are used to
construct the set of traced symbols. Each candidate symbol
is passed through the chain of above rules. Initially, the
symbol is unmarked. If it <br>
matches a + rule, it becomes marked, if it matches a - rule,
it becomes unmarked again. If, after applying all rules, the
symbol is marked, it will be traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOTYPE LIBRARY DISCOVERY <br>
When a library is mapped into the address space of a traced
process, ltrace needs to know what the prototypes are of
functions that this library implements. For purposes of <br>
ltrace, prototype really is a bit more than just type
signature: it&rsquo;s also formatting of individual
parameters and of return value. These prototypes are stored
in files called <br>
prototype libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a library is mapped,
ltrace finds out what its SONAME is. It then looks for a
file named SONAME.conf--e.g. protolib for libc.so.6 would be
in a file called libc.so.6.conf. <br>
When such file is found (more about where ltrace looks for
these files is below), ltrace reads all prototypes stored
therein. When a symbol table entry point (such as those <br>
traced by -x) is hit, the prototype is looked up in a
prototype library corresponding to the library where the hit
occured. When a library call (such as those traced by -e and
<br>
-l) is hit, the prototype is looked up in all prototype
libraries loaded for given process. That is necessary,
because a library call is traced in a PLT table of a caller
<br>
library, but the prototype is described at callee
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a library has no SONAME,
basename of library file is considered instead. For the main
program binary, basename is considered as well (e.g.
protolib for /bin/echo would be <br>
called echo.conf). If a name corresponding to soname (e.g.
libc.so.6.conf) is not found, and the module under
consideration is a shared library, ltrace also tries partial
<br>
matches. Ltrace snips one period after another, retrying the
search, until either a protolib is found, or X.so is all
that&rsquo;s left. Thus libc.so.conf would be considered,
but <br>
libc.conf not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When looking for a prototype
library, ltrace potentially looks into several directories.
On Linux, those are $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ltrace, $HOME/.ltrace,
X/ltrace for each X in <br>
$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and /usr/share/ltrace. If the environment
variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not defined, ltrace looks into
$HOME/.config/ltrace instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s also a mechanism
for loading legacy config files. If $HOME/.ltrace.conf
exists it is imported to every loaded prototype library.
Similarly for /etc/ltrace.conf. If <br>
both exist, both are imported, and $HOME/.ltrace.conf is
consulted before /etc/ltrace.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -F contains any directories,
those are searched in precedence to the above system
directories, in the same order in which they are mentioned
in -F. Any files passed in -F are <br>
imported similarly to above legacy config files, before
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See ltrace.conf(5) for details
on the syntax of ltrace prototype library files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It has most of the bugs stated in strace(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It only works on Linux and in a
small subset of architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to report a
bug, send a message to the mailing list
(ltrace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org), or use the
reportbug(1) program if you are under the Debian <br>
GNU/Linux distribution.</p>
