<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ods-ksmutil manages the operation of the KASP Enforcer,
which is the part of OpenDNSSEC that triggers key generation
and signing operations on domains based on policies with
<br>
user-defined timing and security requirements. Since
everything beyond this management utility is usually
automatic, ods-ksmutil is the primary tool for managing
OpenDNSSEC. <br>
Among the functions of ods-ksmutil are key management,
updates to the zone list and manually rolling keys to
recover from exceptional situations like key loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get started, a first
invocation of ods-ksmutil setup is needed; see SETUP AND
UPDATE COMMANDS below for details. After this is done, the
rest of the functionality of <br>
ods-ksmutil becomes available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections discuss
the subcommands in logical groups, detailing any options
that they support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERIC OPTIONS <br>
-c configfile, --config configfile <br>
Change the conf.xml file that is used from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help This can be used as a
subcommand to ods-ksmutil or it can be used after a partial
subcommand. In response, ods-ksmutil will give a synopsis of
how to continue the com&acirc; <br>
mand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP AND UPDATE SUBCOMMANDS
<br>
setup Import conf.xml, kasp.xml and zonelist.xml into a
database. This deletes any current management information
from the database with OpenDNSSEC management information,
<br>
including any references to keys. Updates to an existing
setup should therefore not normally run this subcommand, but
update instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update kasp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update zonelist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update all <br>
Update the database with the contents of the respective
configuration file, or all those files. The result is
comparable to the setup subcommand, except that management
<br>
information about OpenDNSSEC is not deleted.(Also note that
update kasp does not remove any policies from the database,
policy purge can be used to remove unused poli&acirc; <br>
cies).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZONE MANAGEMENT SUBCOMMANDS <br>
zone add --zone|-z zone [--policy|-p name] [--in-type|-j
type] [--out-type|-q type] [--input|-i input] [--output|-o
output] [--no-xml] <br>
Add a zone to both zonelist.xml and the database. This is
equivalent to manually editing zonelist.xml and then running
the update zonelist subcommand. The --zone option <br>
names the zone to add; the --policy option names the policy
to use instead of default; the --in-type and --out-type
specify the type of input and output adapters (should <br>
be DNS or File, default is File); the --input option
specifies a non-standard location for the unsigned zone
(default is /var/opendnssec/unsigned/ZONE) or the DNS input
<br>
file(default is /etc/opendnssec/addns.xml); the --output
option specifies a non-standard location for the signed zone
(default is /var/opendnssec/signed/ZONE) or the DNS <br>
output file(default is /etc/opendnssec/addns.xml). The
--no-xml flag stops the zonelist.xml file from being
updated. This is suitable for a batch mode where you will
add <br>
multiple zones and then just write zonelist once at the
end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zone delete --zone|-z name
[--no-xml]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zone delete --all|-a <br>
Delete one zone (or all zones, respectively) from both
zonelist.xml and the database. This is equivalent to
manually editing zonelist.xml and then running the update
<br>
zonelist subcommand. The --no-xml flag stops the
zonelist.xml file from being updated. This is suitable for a
batch mode where you will delete multiple zones and then
<br>
just write zonelist once at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zone list <br>
List zones from the zonelist.xml. TODO:Not from the
database?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonelist export <br>
Export list of zones from the database in the same format as
zonelist.xml</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonelist import <br>
Synchronise the database with the contents of zonelist.xml;
identical to &quot;update zonelist&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY MANAGEMENT SUBCOMMANDS <br>
key generate --policy|-p name --interval|-n interval
[--zonetotal|-Z zonetotal] <br>
Create enough keys for the named policy to last for the
period of time given by interval. See INTERVAL FORMAT for
the format of timing specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If configured to, OpenDNSSEC
will automatically create keys when the need arises. This
command can be used to pregenerate keys (maybe for the
expected lifetime of an HSM) <br>
to help with backup policies. It is also a convenient method
of pregenerating a set of keys to allow a disaster recovery
site to have a copy of the keys without needed to <br>
synchronise keys generated on the fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the command generates
keys for all the zones found on the specified policy. If the
optional parameter --zonetotal is specified then keys will
be generated for <br>
that total number of zones, regardless of how many are
actually currently on the policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key import --algorithm|-g
algname --bits|-b bits --repository|-r repo --cka_id|-k
ckaid --zone|-z zone --keytype|-t type --keystate|-e state
--time|-w time [--check-repository|-C <br>
checkrepository] [--retire|-y time] <br>
Add a key which was created outside of the OpenDNSSEC code
into the database. In doing so, the further details involved
in key management must be specified in options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --algorithm option names the
algorithm used with this key; the --bits specifies the
strength of this algorithm as a key size in bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --repository option names
the repository in which the key should be stored; the
--cka_id option specifies the name that will be used to
identify this key in that <br>
repository; the --zone option specifies the zone for which
this key is to be used; the --keytype option specifies
whether this key should serve as a KSK or a ZSK. See KEY
<br>
TYPES below for an introduction to these terms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --keystate option specifies
the state in which the key will be after import, and must be
one of the options defined in the KEY STATES section below.
the --time option <br>
specifies the time that this key was created; the
--check-repository option specified that the key import
should fail if no matching key with the specified cka_id
exists <br>
in the Repository. the --retire option specifies the time
that this key should be retired. These last two options take
the formats given in the TIME FORMATS section <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key export --zone|-z name
[--keystate|-e state] [--keytype|-t type] [--ds]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key export --all [--keystate|-e
state] [--keytype|-t type] [--ds] <br>
Export the keys for a particular zone, or for all zones
respectively, from the database. The --ds option can be used
to retrieve DS records for upload to a registry <br>
instead of the full key; the --keystate option can be used
to limit the output to keys in a given state; the --keytype
option can be used to limit the output to keys of a <br>
given type. See the KEY TYPES and KEY STATES sections below
for a specification of possible key types and states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key list [--zone name]
[--verbose] [--keystate|--all|-e state|-a] [--keytype
type|-t type] <br>
List information about keys in all zones, or in a particular
zone. By default keys in the GENERATE and DEAD state are not
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --verbose option is used to
list additional information about each key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --keystate option can be
used to limit the output to keys in a given state. If the
--all option is used then keys in all states (including
GENERATE and DEAD) are dis&acirc; <br>
played. The --keytype option can be used to limit the output
to keys of a given type. See the KEY TYPES and KEY STATES
sections below for a specification of possible key <br>
types and states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key purge --zone|-z name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key purge --policy|-p name <br>
Remove any keys in the Dead state from the repository and
from the database of the KASP Enforcer. The options --zone
and --policy are used to limit this operation to a <br>
single named zone or policy, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key rollover --zone|-z name
--keytype type|-t type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key rollover --zone|-z name
--all|-a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key rollover --policy|-p name
--keytype type|-t type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key rollover --policy|-p name
--all|-a <br>
Rollover active keys on the named zone or policy,
respectively. This command is used to intiate manual
rollovers; if it is not given, OpenDNSSEC will automatically
<br>
rollover keys when the need arises. (Or, in the case of KSKs
it will start the rollover process, to finish the KSK
rollover see ksk-roll below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --keytype option specifies
the type of key to roll. Alternatively the --all option can
be used which will roll both types of keys. After running,
the KASP Enforcer <br>
will be woken up so that the signer can be sent the new
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the policy that the zone is
on specifies that keys are shared then all zones on that
policy will be rolled. If appropriate, a backup of the
sqlite DB file is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are no keys ready to
take over from the current key then the rollover will not
occur immediately, but will be put off until the is a key in
the ready state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key ksk-retire --zone|-z
zone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key ksk-retire --keytag|-x
keytag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key ksk-retire --cka_id|-k ckaid
<br>
Indicate to OpenDNSSEC that a currently active key should be
retired. If key identifiers are not provided then the oldest
key in the zone will be retired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only one key is in the active
state then this command will exit with an error message, as
completing would leave no active keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key ds-seen --zone|-z zone
--keytag|-x keytag [--no-notify|-l] [--no-retire|-f]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key ds-seen --zone|-z zone
--cka_id|-k ckaid [--no-notify|-l] [--no-retire|-f] <br>
Indicate to OpenDNSSEC that a submitted DS record has
appeared in the parent zone, and thereby trigger the
completion of a KSK rollover. Note that this action is not
yet <br>
standardised, and can therefore not be solved in a generic,
automatic way. This command was designed for inclusion in
any personalised setup that may or may not be auto&acirc;
<br>
mated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways to
specify which DS is in DNS, and the options reflect these
alternatives. The --keytag option specifies the short
integer that serves as a DNSSEC <br>
handle to a key; the --cka_id option refers to a key by way
of its long hexadecimal identifier used to identify the key
in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional --no-notify flag can
also be passed in, which prevents the enforcer being
notified of this change. If this flag is used then the
enforcer must be manually <br>
notified with the &rsquo;ods-enforcerd notify&rsquo; command
or the changes will not take effect until the next scheduled
run of the enforcer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional --no-retire flag can
also be passed in, without this the existing key is moved
into the retired state at the same time as making the new
key active. If you <br>
wish to delay this step then pass in this flag and use the
ksk-retire command when needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key delete --cka_id|-k ckaid
[--no-hsm] <br>
Remove a named key from the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys in the GENERATE or DEAD
state can be safely removed from the system as they are not
in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --no-hsm flag can be
provided if you want to leave the key material on the
HSM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollover list <br>
List the expected dates and times of upcoming rollovers.
This can be used to get an idea of upcoming work, such as
the non-standardised submission of DS records to a
reg&acirc; <br>
istry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICY ADMINISTRATION
SUBCOMMANDS <br>
policy export [--policy|--all|-p|-a] <br>
Export a policy from the database in the same format as the
kasp.xml file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policy import <br>
Update the database with the contents of kasp.xml; identical
to &quot;update kasp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policy purge <br>
* Experimental *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove any policies which have
no zones associated with them. Note that this command has
only been tested in a lab environment and so caution is
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPOSITORY AND BACKUP
SUBCOMMANDS <br>
repository list <br>
List repositories from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup list --repository|-r name
<br>
List the backups that have been made on the given
repository. The --repository option specifies what
repository to list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup prepare --repository|-r
name <br>
Start a two-phase key backup procedure. Prepare the keys
generated up to here for backup. Any keys generated
automatically by OpenDNSSEC after this command are not
guar&acirc; <br>
anteed to be backed up, and will therefore not be taken into
account when committing the prepared keys for use by
OpenDNSSEC. The next command is usually either backup <br>
commit or, in case of failure of the key backup itself,
backup rollback. This sequence works reliably if the KASP
Enforcer is running. If it is not, the single-phase <br>
backup of backup done provides a one-phase backup
alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup commit --repository|-r
name <br>
Successfully end a two-phase key backup procedure. After a
key backup has succeeded, release all previously prepared
keys for service by OpenDNSSEC. Any keys that were <br>
generated since the last issued preparation will not be
released as it is uncertain whether these are actually
backed up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup rollback --repository|-r
name <br>
Safely end a failed two-phase key backup procedure. After a
key backup has failed, rollback all previously prepapared
keys to the state where they are generated, but not <br>
yet available for service by OpenDNSSEC. After fixing this
problem, a new attempt to backup the keys can be made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup done --repository|-r name
[--force] <br>
*DEPRECATED*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicate that a backup of the
given repository has been done, all non-backed up keys will
now be marked as backed up. The --repository option
specifies what repository to <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the KASP Enforcer may
take the initiative to generate keys after the backup has
started and before the backup is done. This single-phase
backup command waives <br>
that, which is safe when the KASP Enforcer is not running.
If you intend to keep the Enforcer running, you will instead
want to use the two-phase backup prepare followed <br>
by either backup commit or backup rollback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">database backup [--output|-o
output] <br>
Make a copy of the database of the KASP Enforcer (if using
sqlite). This command ensures that the database is in a
consistent state by taking a lock out first. The <br>
--output option specifies where the output should go; if not
specified, the output goes to the usual enforcer.db.backup
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROCESS CONTROL SUBCOMMANDS <br>
start|stop|notify <br>
Start, stop or send &quot;SIGHUP&quot; to the ods-enforcerd
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY STATES <br>
GENERATE <br>
The key has just been generated, but is not ready for
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PUBLISH <br>
The key has been published in the parent zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READY The key is ready for use.
E.g. according to settings in the policy the key has been
published for long enough to have propagated to all
resolvers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIVE The key is actively being
used to sign one or more zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETIRE The key has either
reached the end of its scheduled life, or it has been rolled
prematurely. However, records signed with it may still be
cached sp the key is still being <br>
published.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEAD The key has been retired
for long enough that its use is no longer cached, so it has
been removed from the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY TYPES <br>
Keys can be of two types: KSK or ZSK. These terms are
explained in more detail in opendnssec(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DNS records, the KSK can
usually be recognised by having its SEP (Secure Entry Point)
flag set. But please note that officially this is a mere
hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERVAL FORMAT <br>
When specifying an interval for a key generation run the ISO
8601 standard is used, e.g. P2Y6M for 2 years and 6 months;
or PT12H30M for 12 hours and 30 minutes. Note that a year
<br>
is assumed to be 365 days and a month is assumed to be 31
days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME FORMATS <br>
When specifying a generation/retire time for a key being
imported the following formats are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]] <br>
(all numeric)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D-MMM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DD-MMM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYY-MMM-DD[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]
<br>
(alphabetic month)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D-MM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DD-MM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYY-MM-DD[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]] <br>
(numeric month)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/opendnssec/conf.xml <br>
The main configuration file for OpenDNSSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/opendnssec/zonelist.xml
<br>
The list of zones, as defined in conf.xml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/opendnssec/kasp.xml <br>
The configuration of policies that define timing and
security, as defined in conf.xml.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/opendnssec/enforcer.db.backup
<br>
A backup file of the database used by the KASP Enforcer.Note
that this does not include the keys, which are to be
extracted from its own repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/opendnssec/unsigned/ <br>
The location that is usually configured in conf.xml to
contain unsigned zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/opendnssec/signed/ <br>
The location that is usually configured in conf.xml to
contain signed zones.</p>
