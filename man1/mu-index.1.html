<p>MU-INDEX(1) General Commands Manual MU-INDEX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mu_index - index e-mail messages stored in Maildirs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mu index [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mu index is the mu command for scanning the contents of
Maildir directories and storing the results in a Xapian
database. The data can then be queried using mu-find(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index understands Maildirs as
defined by Daniel Bernstein for qmail(7). In addition, it
understands recursive Maildirs (Maildirs within Maildirs),
Maildir++. It can also deal <br>
with VFAT-based Maildirs which use &rsquo;!&rsquo; as the
separators instead of &rsquo;:&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E-mail messages which are not
stored in something resembling a maildir leaf-directory (cur
and new) are ignored, as are the cache directories for
notmuch and gnus, and any dot- <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symlinks are not followed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a file called
.noindex in a directory, the contents of that directory and
all of its subdirectories will be ignored. This can be
useful to exclude certain directories <br>
from the indexing process, for example directories with
spam-messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a file called
.noupdate in a directory, the contents of that directory and
all of its subdirectories will be ignored, unless we do a
full rebuild (with --rebuild). <br>
This can be useful to speed up things you have some maildirs
that never change. Note that you can still search for these
messages, this only affects updating the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There also the --lazy-check
which can greatly speed up indexing; see below for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first run of mu index may
take a few minutes if you have a lot of mail (tens of
thousands of messages). Fortunately, such a full scan needs
to be done only once; after that <br>
it suffices to index the changes, which goes much faster.
See the &rsquo;Note on performance (i,ii,iii)&rsquo; below
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional &rsquo;phase
two&rsquo; of the indexing-process is the removal of
messages from the database for which there is no longer a
corresponding file in the Maildir. If you do not want <br>
this, you can use -n, --nocleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When mu index catches one of the
signals SIGINT, SIGHUP or SIGTERM (e.g., when you press
Ctrl-C during the indexing process), it tries to shutdown
gracefully; it tries to save <br>
and commit data, and close the database etc. If it receives
another signal (e.g., when pressing Ctrl-C once more), mu
index will terminate immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Note, some of the general options are described in the mu(1)
man-page and not here, as they apply to multiple mu
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --maildir=&lt;maildir&gt;
<br>
starts searching at &lt;maildir&gt;. By default, mu uses
whatever the MAILDIR environment variable is set to; if it
is not set, it tries ~/Maildir. See the note on mixing sub-
<br>
maildirs below.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--my-address=&lt;my-email-address&gt;
<br>
specifies that some e-mail address is
&rsquo;my-address&rsquo; (--my-address can be used multiple
times). This is used by mu cfind -- any e-mail address found
in the address fields of <br>
a message which also has &lt;my-email-address&gt; in one of
its address fields is considered a personal e-mail address.
This allows you, for example, to filter out (mu cfind <br>
--personal) addresses which were merely seen in mailing list
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lazy-check <br>
in lazy-check mode, mu does not consider messages for which
the time-stamp (ctime) of the directory they reside in has
not changed since the previous indexing run. This is <br>
much faster than the non-lazy check, but won&rsquo;t update
messages that have change (rather than having been added or
removed), since merely editing a message does not update
<br>
the directory time-stamp. Of course, you can run mu-index
occasionally without --lazy-check, to pick up such
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocleanup <br>
disables the database cleanup that mu does by default after
indexing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rebuild <br>
clear all messages from the database before indexing.
--rebuild guarantees that after the indexing has finished,
there are no &rsquo;old&rsquo; messages in the database
anymore, which <br>
is not true with --reindex when indexing only a part of
messages (using --maildir). For this reason, it is necessary
to run mu index --rebuild when there is an upgrade in <br>
the database format. mu index will issue a warning about
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autoupgrade <br>
automatically use -y, --empty when mu notices that the
database version is not up-to-date. This option is for use
in cron scripts and the like, so they won&rsquo;t require
any <br>
user interaction, even when mu introduces a new database
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xbatchsize=&lt;batch size&gt;
<br>
set the maximum number of messages to process in a single
Xapian transaction. In practice, this option is only useful
if you find that mu is running out of memory while <br>
indexing; in that case, you can set the batch size to (for
example) 1000, which will reduce memory consumption, but
also substantially reduce the indexing performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-msg-size=&lt;max msg
size&gt; <br>
set the maximum size (in bytes) for messages. The default
maximum (currently at 500Mb) should be enough in most cases,
but if you encounter warnings from mu about ignoring <br>
messsage because they are too big, you may want to increase
this. Note that the reason for having a maximum size is that
big messages require big memory allocations, which <br>
may lead to problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: It is not recommended to
mix maildirs and sub-maildirs within the hierarchy in the
same database; for example, it&rsquo;s better not to index
both with <br>
--maildir=~/MyMaildir and --maildir=~/MyMaildir/foo, as this
may lead to unexpected results when searching with the
&rsquo;maildir:&rsquo; search parameter (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A note on performance (i) <br>
As a non-scientific benchmark, a simple test on the
author&rsquo;s machine (a Thinkpad X61s laptop using Linux
2.6.35 and an ext3 file system) with no existing database,
and a maildir <br>
with 27273 messages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo sh -c &rsquo;sync
&amp;&amp; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches&rsquo; <br>
$ time mu index --quiet <br>
66,65s user 6,05s system 27% cpu 4:24,20 total <br>
(about 103 messages per second)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second run, which is the more
typical use case when there is a database already, goes much
faster:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo sh -c &rsquo;sync
&amp;&amp; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches&rsquo; <br>
$ time mu index --quiet <br>
0,48s user 0,76s system 10% cpu 11,796 total <br>
(more than 56818 messages per second)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that each test flushes the
caches first; a more common use case might be to run mu
index when new mail has arrived; the cache may stay quite
&rsquo;warm&rsquo; in that case:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ time mu index --quiet <br>
0,33s user 0,40s system 80% cpu 0,905 total <br>
which is more than 30000 messages per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A note on performance (ii) <br>
As per June 2012, we did the same non-scientific benchmark,
this time with an Intel i5-2500 CPU @ 3.30GHz, an ext4 file
system and a maildir with 22589 messages. We start without
<br>
an existing database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo sh -c &rsquo;sync
&amp;&amp; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches&rsquo; <br>
$ time mu index --quiet <br>
27,79s user 2,17s system 48% cpu 1:01,47 total <br>
(about 813 messages per second)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second run, which is the more
typical use case when there is a database already, goes much
faster:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo sh -c &rsquo;sync
&amp;&amp; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches&rsquo; <br>
$ time mu index --quiet <br>
0,13s user 0,30s system 19% cpu 2,162 total <br>
(more than 173000 messages per second)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A note on performance (iii) <br>
As per July 2016, we did the same non-scientific benchmark,
again with the Intel i5-2500 CPU @ 3.30GHz, an ext4 file
system. This time, the maildir contains 72525 messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo sh -c &rsquo;sync
&amp;&amp; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches&rsquo; <br>
$ time mu index --quiet <br>
40,34s user 2,56s system 64% cpu 1:06,17 total <br>
(about 1099 messages per second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As shown, mu has been getting
faster with each release, even with relatively expensive new
features such as text-normalization (for
case-insensitve/accent-insensitive matching). <br>
The profiles are dominated by operations in the Xapian
database now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
By default, mu index stores its message database in
~/.mu/xapian; the database has an embedded version number,
and mu will automatically update it when it notices a
different <br>
version. This allows for automatic updating of mu-versions,
without the need to clear out any old databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, note that versions of
mu before 0.7 used a different scheme, which puts the
database in ~/.mu/xapian-&lt;version&gt;. These older
databases can safely be deleted. Starting <br>
from version 0.7, this manual cleanup should no longer be
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mu stores logs of its operations
and queries in &lt;muhome&gt;/mu.log (by default, this is
~/.mu/mu.log). Upon startup, mu checks the size of this log
file. If it exceeds 1 MB, it will <br>
be moved to ~/.mu/mu.log.old, overwriting any existing file
of that name, and start with an empty log file. This scheme
allows for continued use of mu without the need for any <br>
manual maintenance of log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
mu index uses MAILDIR to find the user&rsquo;s Maildir if it
has not been specified explicitly with
--maildir=&lt;maildir&gt;. If MAILDIR is not set, mu index
will try ~/Maildir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
mu index return 0 upon successful completion, and any other
number greater than 0 signals an error.</p>
