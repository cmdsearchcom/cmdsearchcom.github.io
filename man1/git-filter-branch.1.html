<p>GIT-FILTER-BRANCH(1) Git Manual GIT-FILTER-BRANCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-filter-branch - Rewrite branches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git filter-branch [--env-filter &lt;command&gt;]
[--tree-filter &lt;command&gt;] <br>
[--index-filter &lt;command&gt;] [--parent-filter
&lt;command&gt;] <br>
[--msg-filter &lt;command&gt;] [--commit-filter
&lt;command&gt;] <br>
[--tag-name-filter &lt;command&gt;] [--subdirectory-filter
&lt;directory&gt;] <br>
[--prune-empty] <br>
[--original &lt;namespace&gt;] [-d &lt;directory&gt;] [-f |
--force] <br>
[--] [&lt;rev-list options&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the
branches mentioned in the &lt;rev-list options&gt;, applying
custom filters on each revision. Those filters can modify
each tree <br>
(e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite on all
files) or information about each commit. Otherwise, all
information (including original commit times or merge
information) <br>
will be preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command will only rewrite
the positive refs mentioned in the command line (e.g. if you
pass a..b, only b will be rewritten). If you specify no
filters, the commits will be <br>
recommitted without any changes, which would normally have
no effect. Nevertheless, this may be useful in the future
for compensating for some Git bugs or such, therefore such a
<br>
usage is permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This command honors
.git/info/grafts file and refs in the refs/replace/
namespace. If you have any grafts or replacement refs
defined, running this command will make them <br>
permanent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING! The rewritten history
will have different object names for all the objects and
will not converge with the original branch. You will not be
able to easily push and <br>
distribute the rewritten branch on top of the original
branch. Please do not use this command if you do not know
the full implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a
simple <br>
single commit would suffice to fix your problem. (See the
&quot;RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE&quot; section in
git-rebase(1) for further information about rewriting
published history.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always verify that the rewritten
version is correct: The original refs, if different from the
rewritten ones, will be stored in the namespace
refs/original/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since this operation
is very I/O expensive, it might be a good idea to redirect
the temporary directory off-disk with the -d option, e.g. on
tmpfs. Reportedly the <br>
speedup is very noticeable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filters <br>
The filters are applied in the order as listed below. The
&lt;command&gt; argument is always evaluated in the shell
context using the eval command (with the notable exception
of the <br>
commit filter, for technical reasons). Prior to that, the
$GIT_COMMIT environment variable will be set to contain the
id of the commit being rewritten. Also, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME,
<br>
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME,
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE are taken from
the current commit and exported to the environment, in order
to <br>
affect the author and committer identities of the
replacement commit created by git-commit-tree(1) after the
filters have run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any evaluation of
&lt;command&gt; returns a non-zero exit status, the whole
operation will be aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A map function is available that
takes an &quot;original sha1 id&quot; argument and outputs a
&quot;rewritten sha1 id&quot; if the commit has been already
rewritten, and &quot;original sha1 id&quot; <br>
otherwise; the map function can return several ids on
separate lines if your commit filter emitted multiple
commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--env-filter &lt;command&gt; <br>
This filter may be used if you only need to modify the
environment in which the commit will be performed.
Specifically, you might want to rewrite the author/committer
<br>
name/email/time environment variables (see
git-commit-tree(1) for details). Do not forget to re-export
the variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tree-filter &lt;command&gt;
<br>
This is the filter for rewriting the tree and its contents.
The argument is evaluated in shell with the working
directory set to the root of the checked out tree. The new
<br>
tree is then used as-is (new files are auto-added,
disappeared files are auto-removed - neither .gitignore
files nor any other ignore rules HAVE ANY EFFECT!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-filter &lt;command&gt;
<br>
This is the filter for rewriting the index. It is similar to
the tree filter but does not check out the tree, which makes
it much faster. Frequently used with git rm --cached <br>
--ignore-unmatch ..., see EXAMPLES below. For hairy cases,
see git-update-index(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parent-filter &lt;command&gt;
<br>
This is the filter for rewriting the commit&acirc;s parent
list. It will receive the parent string on stdin and shall
output the new parent string on stdout. The parent string is
<br>
in the format described in git-commit-tree(1): empty for the
initial commit, &quot;-p parent&quot; for a normal commit
and &quot;-p parent1 -p parent2 -p parent3 ...&quot; for a
merge commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--msg-filter &lt;command&gt;
<br>
This is the filter for rewriting the commit messages. The
argument is evaluated in the shell with the original commit
message on standard input; its standard output is used <br>
as the new commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--commit-filter &lt;command&gt;
<br>
This is the filter for performing the commit. If this filter
is specified, it will be called instead of the git
commit-tree command, with arguments of the form
&quot;&lt;TREE_ID&gt; <br>
[(-p &lt;PARENT_COMMIT_ID&gt;)...]&quot; and the log message
on stdin. The commit id is expected on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special extension, the
commit filter may emit multiple commit ids; in that case,
the rewritten children of the original commit will have all
of them as parents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the map convenience
function in this filter, and other convenience functions,
too. For example, calling skip_commit &quot;$@&quot; will
leave out the current commit (but <br>
not its changes! If you want that, use git rebase
instead).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use the
git_commit_non_empty_tree &quot;$@&quot; instead of git
commit-tree &quot;$@&quot; if you don&acirc;t wish to keep
commits with a single parent and that makes no change to the
<br>
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tag-name-filter
&lt;command&gt; <br>
This is the filter for rewriting tag names. When passed, it
will be called for every tag ref that points to a rewritten
object (or to a tag object which points to a rewritten <br>
object). The original tag name is passed via standard input,
and the new tag name is expected on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original tags are not
deleted, but can be overwritten; use &quot;--tag-name-filter
cat&quot; to simply update the tags. In this case, be very
careful and make sure you have the old <br>
tags backed up in case the conversion has run afoul.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nearly proper rewriting of tag
objects is supported. If the tag has a message attached, a
new tag object will be created with the same message,
author, and timestamp. If the <br>
tag has a signature attached, the signature will be
stripped. It is by definition impossible to preserve
signatures. The reason this is &quot;nearly&quot; proper, is
because ideally if <br>
the tag did not change (points to the same object, has the
same name, etc.) it should retain any signature. That is not
the case, signatures will always be removed, buyer <br>
beware. There is also no support for changing the author or
timestamp (or the tag message for that matter). Tags which
point to other tags will be rewritten to point to the <br>
underlying commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--subdirectory-filter
&lt;directory&gt; <br>
Only look at the history which touches the given
subdirectory. The result will contain that directory (and
only that) as its project root. Implies the section called
&acirc;Remap <br>
to ancestor&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prune-empty <br>
Some kind of filters will generate empty commits, that left
the tree untouched. This switch allow git-filter-branch to
ignore such commits. Though, this switch only applies <br>
for commits that have one and only one parent, it will hence
keep merges points. Also, this option is not compatible with
the use of --commit-filter. Though you just need to <br>
use the function git_commit_non_empty_tree &quot;$@&quot;
instead of the git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot; idiom in your
commit filter to make that happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--original &lt;namespace&gt;
<br>
Use this option to set the namespace where the original
commits will be stored. The default value is
refs/original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d &lt;directory&gt; <br>
Use this option to set the path to the temporary directory
used for rewriting. When applying a tree filter, the command
needs to temporarily check out the tree to some <br>
directory, which may consume considerable space in case of
large projects. By default it does this in the .git-rewrite/
directory but you can override that choice by this <br>
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
git filter-branch refuses to start with an existing
temporary directory or when there are already refs starting
with refs/original/, unless forced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;rev-list options&gt;... <br>
Arguments for git rev-list. All positive refs included by
these options are rewritten. You may also specify options
such as --all, but you must use -- to separate them from
<br>
the git filter-branch options. Implies the section called
&acirc;Remap to ancestor&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remap to ancestor <br>
By using rev-list(1) arguments, e.g., path limiters, you can
limit the set of revisions which get rewritten. However,
positive refs on the command line are distinguished: we <br>
don&acirc;t let them be excluded by such limiters. For this
purpose, they are instead rewritten to point at the nearest
ancestor that was not excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Suppose you want to remove a file (containing confidential
information or copyright violation) from all commits:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch --tree-filter
&rsquo;rm filename&rsquo; HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the file is absent
from the tree of some commit, a simple rm filename will fail
for that tree and commit. Thus you may instead want to use
rm -f filename as the <br>
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using --index-filter with git rm
yields a significantly faster version. Like with using rm
filename, git rm --cached filename will fail if the file is
absent from the tree of a <br>
commit. If you want to &quot;completely forget&quot; a file,
it does not matter when it entered history, so we also add
--ignore-unmatch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch --index-filter
&rsquo;git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename&rsquo;
HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, you will get the rewritten
history saved in HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To rewrite the repository to
look as if foodir/ had been its project root, and discard
all other history:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch
--subdirectory-filter foodir -- --all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus you can, e.g., turn a
library subdirectory into a repository of its own. Note the
-- that separates filter-branch options from revision
options, and the --all to rewrite all <br>
branches and tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set a commit (which typically
is at the tip of another history) to be the parent of the
current initial commit, in order to paste the other history
behind the current history:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch
--parent-filter &rsquo;sed &quot;s/^-p
&lt;graft-id&gt;/&quot;&rsquo; HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(if the parent string is empty -
which happens when we are dealing with the initial commit -
add graftcommit as a parent). Note that this assumes history
with a single root (that <br>
is, no merge without common ancestors happened). If this is
not the case, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch
--parent-filter &rsquo;test $GIT_COMMIT = &lt;commit-id&gt;
&amp;&amp; echo &quot;-p &lt;graft-id&gt;&quot; ||
cat&rsquo; HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or even simpler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;$commit-id
$graft-id&quot; &gt;&gt; .git/info/grafts <br>
git filter-branch $graft-id..HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove commits authored by
&quot;Darl McBribe&quot; from the history:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch
--commit-filter &rsquo; <br>
if [ &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME&quot; = &quot;Darl McBribe&quot;
]; <br>
then <br>
skip_commit &quot;$@&quot;; <br>
else <br>
git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;; <br>
fi&rsquo; HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function skip_commit is
defined as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip_commit() <br>
{ <br>
shift; <br>
while [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ]; <br>
do <br>
shift; <br>
map &quot;$1&quot;; <br>
shift; <br>
done; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shift magic first throws
away the tree id and then the -p parameters. Note that this
handles merges properly! In case Darl committed a merge
between P1 and P2, it will be <br>
propagated properly and all children of the merge will
become merge commits with P1,P2 as their parents instead of
the merge commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE the changes introduced by
the commits, and which are not reverted by subsequent
commits, will still be in the rewritten branch. If you want
to throw out changes together <br>
with the commits, you should use the interactive mode of git
rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can rewrite the commit log
messages using --msg-filter. For example, git svn-id strings
in a repository created by git svn can be removed this
way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch --msg-filter
&rsquo; <br>
sed -e &quot;/^git-svn-id:/d&quot; <br>
&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to add Acked-by
lines to, say, the last 10 commits (none of which is a
merge), use this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch --msg-filter
&rsquo; <br>
cat &amp;&amp; <br>
echo &quot;Acked-by: Bugs Bunny
&lt;bunny@bugzilla.org&gt;&quot; <br>
&rsquo; HEAD~10..HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --env-filter option can be
used to modify committer and/or author identity. For
example, if you found out that your commits have the wrong
identity due to a misconfigured <br>
user.email, you can make a correction, before publishing the
project, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch --env-filter
&rsquo; <br>
if test &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&quot; =
&quot;root@localhost&quot; <br>
then <br>
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=john@example.com <br>
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL <br>
fi <br>
if test &quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&quot; =
&quot;root@localhost&quot; <br>
then <br>
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=john@example.com <br>
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL <br>
fi <br>
&rsquo; -- --all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restrict rewriting to only
part of the history, specify a revision range in addition to
the new branch name. The new branch name will point to the
top-most revision that a git <br>
rev-list of this range will print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider this history:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D--E--F--G--H <br>
/ / <br>
A--B-----C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To rewrite only commits
D,E,F,G,H, but leave A, B and C alone, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch ... C..H</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To rewrite commits E,F,G,H, use
one of these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch ... C..H --not
D <br>
git filter-branch ... D..H --not C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To move the whole tree into a
subdirectory, or remove it from there:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git filter-branch --index-filter
&rsquo;git ls-files -s | sed &quot;s- <br>
GIT_INDEX_FILE=$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new git update-index
--index-info &amp;&amp; <br>
mv &quot;$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new&quot;
&quot;$GIT_INDEX_FILE&quot;&rsquo; HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECKLIST FOR SHRINKING A
REPOSITORY <br>
git-filter-branch is often used to get rid of a subset of
files, usually with some combination of --index-filter and
--subdirectory-filter. People expect the resulting
repository <br>
to be smaller than the original, but you need a few more
steps to actually make it smaller, because Git tries hard
not to lose your objects until you tell it to. First make
sure <br>
that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You really
removed all variants of a filename, if a blob was moved over
its lifetime. git log --name-only --follow --all -- filename
can help you find renames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You really
filtered all refs: use --tag-name-filter cat -- --all when
calling git-filter-branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then there are two ways to get a
smaller repository. A safer way is to clone, that keeps your
original intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Clone it with
git clone file:///path/to/repo. The clone will not have the
removed objects. See git-clone(1). (Note that cloning with a
plain path just hardlinks everything!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you really don&acirc;t want
to clone it, for whatever reasons, check the following
points instead (in this order). This is a very destructive
approach, so make a backup or go back <br>
to cloning it. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Remove the
original refs backed up by git-filter-branch: say git
for-each-ref --format=&quot;%(refname)&quot; refs/original/
| xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Expire all
reflogs with git reflog expire --expire=now --all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Garbage collect
all unreferenced objects with git gc --prune=now (or if your
git-gc is not new enough to support arguments to --prune,
use git repack -ad; git prune instead).</p>
