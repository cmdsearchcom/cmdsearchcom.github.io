pg_basebackup - take a base backup of a PostgreSQL cluster
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 14.00ex; text-indent: -14.00ex;"><b>pg_basebackup</b>
  [ <i>option</i>...]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
pg_basebackup is used to take base backups of a running PostgreSQL database
  cluster. These are taken without affecting other clients to the database, and
  can be used both for point-in-time recovery (see Section 24.3,
  &#x201C;Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)&#x201D;, in the
  documentation) and as the starting point for a log shipping or streaming
  replication standby servers (see Section 25.2, &#x201C;Log-Shipping Standby
  Servers&#x201D;, in the documentation).
<div class="Pp"></div>
pg_basebackup makes a binary copy of the database cluster files, while making
  sure the system is put in and out of backup mode automatically. Backups are
  always taken of the entire database cluster; it is not possible to back up
  individual databases or database objects. For individual database backups, a
  tool such as <b>pg_dump</b>(1) must be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The backup is made over a regular PostgreSQL connection, and uses the
  replication protocol. The connection must be made with a superuser or a user
  having REPLICATION permissions (see Section 20.2, &#x201C;Role
  Attributes&#x201D;, in the documentation), and pg_hba.conf must explicitly
  permit the replication connection. The server must also be configured with
  max_wal_senders set high enough to leave at least one session available for
  the backup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There can be multiple <b>pg_basebackup</b>s running at the same time, but it is
  better from a performance point of view to take only one backup, and copy the
  result.
<div class="Pp"></div>
pg_basebackup can make a base backup from not only the master but also the
  standby. To take a backup from the standby, set up the standby so that it can
  accept replication connections (that is, set <i>max_wal_senders</i> and
  hot_standby, and configure host-based authentication). You will also need to
  enable full_page_writes on the master.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there are some limitations in an online backup from the standby:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;The backup history file is not created
  in the database cluster backed up.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;There is no guarantee that all WAL
  files required for the backup are archived at the end of backup. If you are
  planning to use the backup for an archive recovery and want to ensure that all
  required files are available at that moment, you need to include them into the
  backup by using -x option.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;If the standby is promoted to the
  master during online backup, the backup fails.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;All WAL records required for the
  backup must contain sufficient full-page writes, which requires you to enable
  <i>full_page_writes</i> on the master and not to use a tool like
  pg_compresslog as <i>archive_command</i> to remove full-page writes from WAL
  files.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following command-line options control the location and format of the
  output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-D </b><b></b><i>directory</i>, <b>--pgdata=</b><b></b><i>directory</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Directory to write the output to.
  pg_basebackup will create the directory and any parent directories if
  necessary. The directory may already exist, but it is an error if the
  directory already exists and is not empty.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the backup is in tar mode, and the directory is specified as - (dash), the
  tar file will be written to stdout.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is required.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-F </b><b></b><i>format</i>, <b>--format=</b><b></b><i>format</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Selects the format for the output.
  <i>format</i> can be one of the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
p, plain
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write the output as plain files, with the same
  layout as the current data directory and tablespaces. When the cluster has no
  additional tablespaces, the whole database will be placed in the target
  directory. If the cluster contains additional tablespaces, the main data
  directory will be placed in the target directory, but all other tablespaces
  will be placed in the same absolute path as they have on the server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is the default format.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
t, tar
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write the output as tar files in the target
  directory. The main data directory will be written to a file named base.tar,
  and all other tablespaces will be named after the tablespace OID.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the value - (dash) is specified as target directory, the tar contents will be
  written to standard output, suitable for piping to for example gzip. This is
  only possible if the cluster has no additional tablespaces.</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x</b>, <b>--xlog</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Using this option is equivalent of using -X
  with method fetch.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-X </b><b></b><i>method</i>, <b>--xlog-method=</b><b></b><i>method</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Includes the required transaction log files
  (WAL files) in the backup. This will include all transaction logs generated
  during the backup. If this option is specified, it is possible to start a
  postmaster directly in the extracted directory without the need to consult the
  log archive, thus making this a completely standalone backup.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following methods for collecting the transaction logs are supported:
<div class="Pp"></div>
f, fetch
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The transaction log files are collected at the
  end of the backup. Therefore, it is necessary for the wal_keep_segments
  parameter to be set high enough that the log is not removed before the end of
  the backup. If the log has been rotated when it's time to transfer it, the
  backup will fail and be unusable.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
s, stream
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Stream the transaction log while the backup is
  created. This will open a second connection to the server and start streaming
  the transaction log in parallel while running the backup. Therefore, it will
  use up two slots configured by the max_wal_senders parameter. As long as the
  client can keep up with transaction log received, using this mode requires no
  extra transaction logs to be saved on the master.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-z</b>, <b>--gzip</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enables gzip compression of tar file output,
  with the default compression level. Compression is only available when using
  the tar format.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-Z </b><b></b><i>level</i>, <b>--compress=</b><b></b><i>level</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enables gzip compression of tar file output,
  and specifies the compression level (0 through 9, 0 being no compression and 9
  being best compression). Compression is only available when using the tar
  format.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following command-line options control the generation of the backup and the
  running of the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-c </b><b></b><i>fast|spread</i>,
  <b>--checkpoint=</b><b></b><i>fast|spread</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets checkpoint mode to fast or spread
  (default).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-l </b><b></b><i>label</i>, <b>--label=</b><b></b><i>label</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the label for the backup. If none is
  specified, a default value of &#x201C;pg_basebackup base backup&#x201D; will
  be used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-P</b>, <b>--progress</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enables progress reporting. Turning this on
  will deliver an approximate progress report during the backup. Since the
  database may change during the backup, this is only an approximation and may
  not end at exactly 100%. In particular, when WAL log is included in the
  backup, the total amount of data cannot be estimated in advance, and in this
  case the estimated target size will increase once it passes the total estimate
  without WAL.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When this is enabled, the backup will start by enumerating the size of the
  entire database, and then go back and send the actual contents. This may make
  the backup take slightly longer, and in particular it will take longer before
  the first data is sent.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enables verbose mode. Will output some extra
  steps during startup and shutdown, as well as show the exact file name that is
  currently being processed if progress reporting is also enabled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following command-line options control the database connection parameters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-h </b><b></b><i>host</i>, <b>--host=</b><b></b><i>host</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the host name of the machine on
  which the server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as
  the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default is taken from the
  <b>PGHOST</b> environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket
  connection is attempted.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p </b><b></b><i>port</i>, <b>--port=</b><b></b><i>port</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
  socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections.
  Defaults to the <b>PGPORT</b> environment variable, if set, or a compiled-in
  default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-s </b><b></b><i>interval</i>,
  <b>--status-interval=</b><b></b><i>interval</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the number of seconds between status
  packets sent back to the server. This is required when streaming the
  transaction log (using --xlog=stream) if replication timeout is configured on
  the server, and allows for easier monitoring. A value of zero disables the
  status updates completely. The default value is 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-U </b><b></b><i>username</i>, <b>--username=</b><b></b><i>username</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">User name to connect as.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-w</b>, <b>--no-password</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Never issue a password prompt. If the server
  requires password authentication and a password is not available by other
  means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option
  can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
  password.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-W</b>, <b>--password</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force pg_basebackup to prompt for a password
  before connecting to a database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is never essential, since pg_basebackup will automatically prompt
  for a password if the server demands password authentication. However,
  pg_basebackup will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server
  wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing <b>-W</b> to avoid the
  extra connection attempt.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other options are also available:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print the pg_basebackup version and
  exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show help about pg_basebackup command line
  arguments, and exit.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, uses the environment
  variables supported by libpq (see Section 31.14, &#x201C;Environment
  Variables&#x201D;, in the documentation).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
The backup will include all files in the data directory and tablespaces,
  including the configuration files and any additional files placed in the
  directory by third parties. Only regular files and directories are allowed in
  the data directory, no symbolic links or special device files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way PostgreSQL manages tablespaces, the path for all additional tablespaces
  must be identical whenever a backup is restored. The main data directory,
  however, is relocatable to any location.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
To create a base backup of the server at mydbserver and store it in the local
  directory /usr/local/pgsql/data:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
$  <b>pg_basebackup -h mydbserver -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create a backup of the local server with one compressed tar file for each
  tablespace, and store it in the directory backup, showing a progress report
  while running:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
$  <b>pg_basebackup -D backup -Ft -z -P</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create a backup of a single-tablespace local database and compress this with
  bzip2:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
$  <b>pg_basebackup -D - -Ft | bzip2 &gt; backup.tar.bz2</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(This command will fail if there are multiple tablespaces in the database.)
