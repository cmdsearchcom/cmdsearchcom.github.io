<p>PG_BASEBACKUP(1) PostgreSQL 9.2.18 Documentation
PG_BASEBACKUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_basebackup - take a base backup of a PostgreSQL
cluster</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_basebackup [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_basebackup is used to take base backups of a running
PostgreSQL database cluster. These are taken without
affecting other clients to the database, and can be used
both for <br>
point-in-time recovery (see Section 24.3, &acirc;Continuous
Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)&acirc;, in the
documentation) and as the starting point for a log shipping
or <br>
streaming replication standby servers (see Section 25.2,
&acirc;Log-Shipping Standby Servers&acirc;, in the
documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup makes a binary
copy of the database cluster files, while making sure the
system is put in and out of backup mode automatically.
Backups are always taken of the <br>
entire database cluster; it is not possible to back up
individual databases or database objects. For individual
database backups, a tool such as pg_dump(1) must be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The backup is made over a
regular PostgreSQL connection, and uses the replication
protocol. The connection must be made with a superuser or a
user having REPLICATION permissions <br>
(see Section 20.2, &acirc;Role Attributes&acirc;, in the
documentation), and pg_hba.conf must explicitly permit the
replication connection. The server must also be configured
with <br>
max_wal_senders set high enough to leave at least one
session available for the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There can be multiple
pg_basebackups running at the same time, but it is better
from a performance point of view to take only one backup,
and copy the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup can make a base
backup from not only the master but also the standby. To
take a backup from the standby, set up the standby so that
it can accept replication <br>
connections (that is, set max_wal_senders and hot_standby,
and configure host-based authentication). You will also need
to enable full_page_writes on the master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there are some
limitations in an online backup from the standby:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The backup
history file is not created in the database cluster backed
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There is no
guarantee that all WAL files required for the backup are
archived at the end of backup. If you are planning to use
the backup for an archive recovery and want to <br>
ensure that all required files are available at that moment,
you need to include them into the backup by using -x
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the standby
is promoted to the master during online backup, the backup
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All WAL records
required for the backup must contain sufficient full-page
writes, which requires you to enable full_page_writes on the
master and not to use a tool like <br>
pg_compresslog as archive_command to remove full-page writes
from WAL files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options control the location and
format of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D directory, --pgdata=directory
<br>
Directory to write the output to. pg_basebackup will create
the directory and any parent directories if necessary. The
directory may already exist, but it is an error if the <br>
directory already exists and is not empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the backup is in tar mode,
and the directory is specified as - (dash), the tar file
will be written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F format, --format=format <br>
Selects the format for the output. format can be one of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p, plain <br>
Write the output as plain files, with the same layout as the
current data directory and tablespaces. When the cluster has
no additional tablespaces, the whole database <br>
will be placed in the target directory. If the cluster
contains additional tablespaces, the main data directory
will be placed in the target directory, but all other <br>
tablespaces will be placed in the same absolute path as they
have on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t, tar <br>
Write the output as tar files in the target directory. The
main data directory will be written to a file named
base.tar, and all other tablespaces will be named after the
<br>
tablespace OID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value - (dash) is
specified as target directory, the tar contents will be
written to standard output, suitable for piping to for
example gzip. This is only <br>
possible if the cluster has no additional tablespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --xlog <br>
Using this option is equivalent of using -X with method
fetch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X method, --xlog-method=method
<br>
Includes the required transaction log files (WAL files) in
the backup. This will include all transaction logs generated
during the backup. If this option is specified, it is <br>
possible to start a postmaster directly in the extracted
directory without the need to consult the log archive, thus
making this a completely standalone backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following methods for
collecting the transaction logs are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f, fetch <br>
The transaction log files are collected at the end of the
backup. Therefore, it is necessary for the wal_keep_segments
parameter to be set high enough that the log is not <br>
removed before the end of the backup. If the log has been
rotated when it&rsquo;s time to transfer it, the backup will
fail and be unusable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s, stream <br>
Stream the transaction log while the backup is created. This
will open a second connection to the server and start
streaming the transaction log in parallel while running <br>
the backup. Therefore, it will use up two slots configured
by the max_wal_senders parameter. As long as the client can
keep up with transaction log received, using this <br>
mode requires no extra transaction logs to be saved on the
master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --gzip <br>
Enables gzip compression of tar file output, with the
default compression level. Compression is only available
when using the tar format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z level, --compress=level <br>
Enables gzip compression of tar file output, and specifies
the compression level (0 through 9, 0 being no compression
and 9 being best compression). Compression is only <br>
available when using the tar format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command-line
options control the generation of the backup and the running
of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c fast|spread,
--checkpoint=fast|spread <br>
Sets checkpoint mode to fast or spread (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l label, --label=label <br>
Sets the label for the backup. If none is specified, a
default value of &acirc;pg_basebackup base backup&acirc;
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --progress <br>
Enables progress reporting. Turning this on will deliver an
approximate progress report during the backup. Since the
database may change during the backup, this is only an <br>
approximation and may not end at exactly 100%. In
particular, when WAL log is included in the backup, the
total amount of data cannot be estimated in advance, and in
this <br>
case the estimated target size will increase once it passes
the total estimate without WAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this is enabled, the backup
will start by enumerating the size of the entire database,
and then go back and send the actual contents. This may make
the backup take <br>
slightly longer, and in particular it will take longer
before the first data is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Enables verbose mode. Will output some extra steps during
startup and shutdown, as well as show the exact file name
that is currently being processed if progress reporting is
<br>
also enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command-line
options control the database connection parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host, --host=host <br>
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server
is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as
the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default <br>
is taken from the PGHOST environment variable, if set, else
a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a
<br>
compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s interval,
--status-interval=interval <br>
Specifies the number of seconds between status packets sent
back to the server. This is required when streaming the
transaction log (using --xlog=stream) if replication <br>
timeout is configured on the server, and allows for easier
monitoring. A value of zero disables the status updates
completely. The default value is 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username, --username=username
<br>
User name to connect as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --no-password <br>
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt
<br>
will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and
scripts where no user is present to enter a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --password <br>
Force pg_basebackup to prompt for a password before
connecting to a database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is never essential,
since pg_basebackup will automatically prompt for a password
if the server demands password authentication. However,
pg_basebackup will waste <br>
a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options are also
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pg_basebackup version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pg_basebackup command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, uses the
environment variables supported by libpq (see Section 31.14,
&acirc;Environment Variables&acirc;, in the
documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The backup will include all files in the data directory and
tablespaces, including the configuration files and any
additional files placed in the directory by third parties.
Only <br>
regular files and directories are allowed in the data
directory, no symbolic links or special device files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way PostgreSQL manages
tablespaces, the path for all additional tablespaces must be
identical whenever a backup is restored. The main data
directory, however, is relocatable <br>
to any location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To create a base backup of the server at mydbserver and
store it in the local directory /usr/local/pgsql/data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_basebackup -h mydbserver -D
/usr/local/pgsql/data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a backup of the local
server with one compressed tar file for each tablespace, and
store it in the directory backup, showing a progress report
while running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_basebackup -D backup -Ft -z
-P</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a backup of a
single-tablespace local database and compress this with
bzip2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_basebackup -D - -Ft | bzip2
&gt; backup.tar.bz2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This command will fail if there
are multiple tablespaces in the database.)</p>
