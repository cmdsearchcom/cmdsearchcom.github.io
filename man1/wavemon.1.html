<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wavemon - a wireless network monitor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wavemon [-h] [-i ifname ] [-l] [-r] [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wavemon is a ncurses-based monitoring application for
wireless network devices. It plots levels in real-time as
well as showing wireless and network related device
information. <br>
Currently, wavemon is still based on the wireless extensions
by Jean Tourrilhes &lt;jt@hpl.hp.com&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wavemon interface splits
into different &quot;screens&quot;. Each screen presents
information in a specific manner. For example, the
&quot;info&quot; screen shows current levels as bargraphs,
<br>
whereas the &quot;level&quot; screen represents the same
levels as a moving histogram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup, you&rsquo;ll see
(depending on configuration) one of the different monitor
screens. At the bottom, you&rsquo;ll find a menu-bar listing
the screens and their activating keys. <br>
Each screen is activated by either the corresponding
function key or the key corresponding to the first character
of the screen name. The following screens can be
selected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info (F1 or &rsquo;i&rsquo;)
<br>
This is the most comprehensive screen. It displays a
condensed overview of wireless-specific parameters and
network statistics, as well as bar graphs. The layout is
<br>
arranged into several sub-sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Interface section at the top
shows information about the monitoring interface, including
interface name, type, ESSID, and available encryption
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below, in the Levels section,
you can see up to four bargraphs showing (1) relative signal
quality and (2) signal level in dBm. If the wireless driver
also supports noise <br>
level information, additionally (3) noise level in dBm and
(4) Signal-Noise-Ratio (SNR) in dB are shown. The colour of
the signal level bargraph changes from red to yel&acirc;
<br>
low and green at fixed levels. If thresholds have been set,
two arrows on the signal level graph will show the positions
of the current thresholds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Statistics section displays
packet and byte counters and a few other packet-related
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The subsequent Info subsection
lists the current operational mode and configuration of the
wireless interface. What parameters are actually shown
depends on the capabili&acirc; <br>
ties and selected mode of your network device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lastly, the Network section
shows network-level parameters. The MAC-address is resolved
from ethers(5). The IPv4 address is shown in CIDR notation
(RFC 4632 address/pre&acirc; <br>
fix_len format). Since often those two values also determine
the broadcast address (last 32 - prefix_len bits set to 1),
that address is shown only if it does not derive <br>
from the interface address and prefix length. Likewise, the
interface MTU is shown only if it differs from the default
Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level histogram (F2 or
&rsquo;l&rsquo;) <br>
This is a full-screen histogram plot showing the evolution
of levels with time. The screen is partitioned into a grid,
with dBm levels shown in green at the right hand <br>
side (depending on configuration). At the very minimum, the
evolution of the signal-level is shown. If the wireless
driver also supports noise-level information, addi&acirc;
<br>
tionally a noise graph and associated SNR graph appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan window (F3 or
&rsquo;s&rsquo;) <br>
A periodically updated network scan, showing access points
and other wireless clients. It is sorted depending on
sort_order and sort_ascending, see wavemonrc(5). Each <br>
entry starts with the ESSID, followed by the colour-coded
MAC address and the signal/channel information. A green/red
MAC address indicates an (un-)encrypted access point, <br>
the colour changes to yellow for non-access points (in this
case the mode is shown at the end of the line). The
uncoloured information following the MAC address lists
rel&acirc; <br>
ative and absolute signal strengths, channel, frequency, and
the mode if the node is not an access point. A status line
at the bottom informs about the current sort order <br>
and a few statistics, such as most (least) crowded channels
(least crowded channels are listed when sorting by
descending channel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sort_order can also directly
be changed via these keyboard shortcuts: ascending,
descending; by essid, signal, channel (C also with signal),
or by open access (O also <br>
with signal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that gathering
meaningful scan data can take several seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preferences (F7 or
&rsquo;p&rsquo;) <br>
This screen allows you to change all program options such as
interface and level scale parameters, and to save the new
settings to the configuration file. Select a parame&acirc;
<br>
ter with &lt;up&gt; and &lt;down&gt;, then change the value
with &lt;left&gt; and &lt;right&gt;. Please refer to
wavemonrc(5) for an in-depth description of applicable
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help (F8 or &rsquo;h&rsquo;)

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit (F10 or &rsquo;q&rsquo;)
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: some operations, such as
displaying encryption information or performing scans,
require CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges (see capabilities(7)). For
non-root users, these can be <br>
enabled by installing wavemon setuid-root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i interface <br>
override autodetection and use the specified interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dump interface parameters to
stdout and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g check screen geometry: a
minimum size is required for proper display; this flag adds
a check to ensure it is sufficiently large. Enable this if
window does not display <br>
properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r generate random levels (for
testing purposes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h print help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
LC_NUMERIC <br>
Influences the grouping of numbers if set. See also
locale(1).</p>
