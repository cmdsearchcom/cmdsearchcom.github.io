<b>AutoClass</b> solves the problem of automatic discovery of classes in data
  (sometimes called clustering, or unsupervised learning), as distinct from the
  generation of class descriptions from labeled examples (called supervised
  learning). It aims to discover the &quot;natural&quot; classes in the data.
  <b>AutoClass</b> is applicable to observations of things that can be described
  by a set of attributes, without referring to other things. The data values
  corresponding to each attribute are limited to be either numbers or the
  elements of a fixed set of symbols. With numeric data, a measurement error
  must be provided.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>AutoClass</b> is looking for the best classification(s) of the data it can
  find. A classification is composed of:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A set of classes, each of which is described by a set of
      class parameters, which specify how the class is distributed along the
      various attributes. For example, &quot;height normally distributed with
      mean 4.67 ft and standard deviation .32 ft&quot;,</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A set of class weights, describing what percentage of cases
      are likely to be in each class.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A probabilistic assignment of cases in the data to these
      classes. I.e. for each case, the relative probability that it is a member
      of each class.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a strictly Bayesian system (accept no substitutes!), the quality measure
  <b>AutoClass</b> uses is the total probability that, had you known nothing
  about your data or its domain, you would have found this set of data generated
  by this underlying model. This includes the prior probability that the
  &quot;world&quot; would have chosen this number of classes, this set of
  relative class weights, and this set of parameters for each class, and the
  likelihood that such a set of classes would have generated this set of values
  for the attributes in the data cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These probabilities are typically very small, in the range of e^-30000, and so
  are usually expressed in exponential notation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When run with the <b>-search</b> command, <b>AutoClass</b> searches for a
  classification. The required arguments are the paths to the four input files,
  which supply the data, the data format, the desired classification model, and
  the search parameters, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>AutoClass</b> writes intermediate results in a binary file. With
  the <b>-report</b> command, <b>AutoClass</b> generates an ASCII report. The
  arguments are the full path names of the .results, .search, and .r-params
  files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When run with the <b>-predict</b> command, <b>AutoClass</b> predicts the class
  membership of a &quot;test&quot; data set based on classes found in a
  &quot;training&quot; data set (see &quot;PREDICTIONS&quot; below).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INPUT_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#INPUT_FILES">INPUT
  FILES</a></h1>
An AutoClass data set resides in two files. There is a header file (file type
  &quot;hd2&quot;) that describes the specific data format and attribute
  definitions. The actual data values are in a data file (file type
  &quot;db2&quot;). We use two files to allow editing of data descriptions
  without having to deal with the entire data set. This makes it easy to
  experiment with different descriptions of the database without having to
  reproduce the data set. Internally, an AutoClass database structure is
  identified by its header and data files, and the number of data loaded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more detailed information on the formats of these files, see
  <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/preparation-c.text</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DATA_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#DATA_FILE">DATA
  FILE</a></h2>
The data file contains a sequence of data objects (datum or case) terminated by
  the end of the file. The number of values for each data object must be equal
  to the number of attributes defined in the header file. Data objects must be
  groups of tokens delimited by &quot;new-line&quot;. Attributes are typed as
  REAL, DISCRETE, or DUMMY. Real attribute values are numbers, either integer or
  floating point. Discrete attribute values can be strings, symbols, or
  integers. A dummy attribute value can be any of these types. Dummys are read
  in but otherwise ignored -- they will be set to zeros in the the internal
  database. Thus the actual values will not be available for use in report
  output. To have these attribute values available, use either type REAL or type
  DISCRETE, and define their model type as IGNORE in the .model file. Missing
  values for any attribute type may be represented by either &quot;?&quot;, or
  other token specified in the header file. All are translated to a special
  unique value after being read, so this symbol is effectively reserved for
  unknown/missing values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example:
<pre>
      white       38.991306 0.54248405  2 2 1
      red         25.254923 0.5010235   9 2 1
      yellow      32.407973 ?           8 2 1
      all_white   28.953982 0.5267696   0 1 1
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="HEADER_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#HEADER_FILE">HEADER
  FILE</a></h2>
The header file specifies the data file format, and the definitions of the data
  attributes. The header file functional specifications consists of two parts --
  the data set format definition specifications, and the attribute descriptors.
  &quot;;&quot; in column 1 identifies a comment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A header file follows this general format:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
    ;; num_db2_format_defs value (number of format def lines
    ;; that follow), range of n is 1 -&gt; 5
    num_db2_format_defs n
    ;; number_of_attributes token and value required
    number_of_attributes &lt;as required&gt;
    ;; following are optional - default values are specified
    separator_char  ' '
    comment_char    ';'
    unknown_token   '?'
    separator_char  ','
    
    ;; attribute descriptors
    ;; &lt;zero-based att#&gt;  &lt;att_type&gt;  &lt;att_sub_type&gt;  &lt;att_description&gt;
    ;; &lt;att_param_pairs&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Each attribute descriptor is a line of:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
      Attribute index (zero based, beginning in column 1)
      Attribute type.  See below.
      Attribute subtype.  See below
      Attribute description: symbol (no embedded blanks) or
            string; &lt;= 40 characters
      Specific property and value pairs.
            Currently available combinations:
<div class="Pp"></div>
         type           subtype         property type(s)
         ----           --------        ---------------
         dummy          none/nil        --
         discrete       nominal         range
         real           location        error
         real           scalar          zero_point rel_error
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
The ERROR property should represent your best estimate of the average error
  expected in the measurement and recording of that real attribute. Lacking
  better information, the error can be taken as 1/2 the minimum possible
  difference between measured values. It can be argued that real values are
  often truncated, so that smaller errors may be justified, particularly for
  generated data. But AutoClass only sees the recorded values. So it needs the
  error in the recorded values, rather than the actual measurement error.
  Setting this error much smaller than the minimum expressible difference
  implies the possibility of values that cannot be expressed in the data. Worse,
  it implies that two identical values must represent measurements that were
  much closer than they might actually have been. This leads to over-fitting of
  the classification.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The REL_ERROR property is used for SCALAR reals when the error is proportional
  to the measured value. The ERROR property is not supported.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
AutoClass uses the error as a lower bound on the width of the normal
  distribution. So small error estimates tend to give narrower peaks and to
  increase both the number of classes and the classification probability. Broad
  error estimates tend to limit the number of classes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The scalar ZERO_POINT property is the smallest value that the measurement
  process could have produced. This is often 0.0, or less by some error range.
  Similarly, the bounded real's min and max properties are exclusive bounds on
  the attributes generating process. For a calculated percentage these would be
  0-e and 100+e, where e is an error value. The discrete attribute's range is
  the number of possible values the attribute can take on. This range must
  include unknown as a value when such values occur.

A classification of a data set is made with respect to a model which specifies
  the form of the probability distribution function for classes in that data
  set. Normally the model structure is defined in a model file (file type
  &quot;model&quot;), containing one or more models. Internally, a model is
  defined relative to a particular database. Thus it is identified by the
  corresponding database, the model's model file and its sequential position in
  the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each model is specified by one or more model group definition lines. Each model
  group line associates attribute indices with a model term type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is an example model file:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
# AutoClass C model file -- extension .model
model_index 0 7
ignore 0
single_normal_cn 3
single_normal_cn 17 18 21
multi_normal_cn 1 2
multi_normal_cn 8 9 10
multi_normal_cn 11 12 13
single_multinomial default
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here, the first line is a comment. The following characters in column 1 make the
  line a comment: `!', `#', ` ', `;', and `\n' (empty line).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tokens &quot;model_index <i>n m</i>&quot; must appear on the first
  non-comment line, and precede the model term definition lines. <i>n</i> is the
  zero-based model index, typically 0 where there is only one model -- the
  majority of search situations. <i>m</i> is the number of model term definition
  lines that follow.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The last seven lines are model group lines. Each model group line consists of:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 4.00ex; text-indent: -4.00ex;">A model term
  type (one of <b>single_multinomial</b>, <b>single_normal_cm</b>,
  <b>single_normal_cn</b>, <b>multi_normal_cn</b>, or <b>ignore</b>).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 4.00ex; text-indent: -4.00ex;">A list of
  attribute indices (the attribute set list), or the symbol <b>default</b>.
  Attribute indices are zero-based. Single model terms may have one or more
  attribute indices on each line, while multi model terms require two or more
  attribute indices per line. An attribute index must not appear more than once
  in a model list.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEARCHING"><a class="selflink" href="#SEARCHING">SEARCHING</a></h1>
AutoClass, when invoked in the &quot;search&quot; mode will check the validity
  of the set of data, header, model, and search parameter files. Errors will
  stop the search from starting, and warnings will ask the user whether to
  continue. A history of the error and warning messages is saved, by default, in
  the log file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you have succeeded in describing your data with a header file and model
  file that passes the AUTOCLASS -SEARCH &lt;...&gt; input checks, you will have
  entered the search domain where <b>AutoClass</b> classifies your data. (At
  last!)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main function to use in finding a good classification of your data is
  AUTOCLASS -SEARCH, and using it will take most of the computation time.
  Searches are invoked with:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
autoclass -search &lt;.db2 file path&gt; &lt;.hd2 file path&gt; 
	&lt;.model file path&gt; &lt;.s-params file path&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
All files must be specified as fully qualified relative or absolute pathnames.
  File name extensions (file types) for all files are forced to canonical values
  required by the AutoClass program:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
        data file   (&quot;ascii&quot;)   db2
        data file   (&quot;binary&quot;)  db2-bin
        header file             hd2
        model file              model
        search params file      s-params
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sample-run ( <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/examples/</i>) that comes with
  <b>AutoClass</b> shows some sample searches, and browsing these is probably
  the fastest way to get familiar with how to do searches. The test data sets
  located under <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/examples/</i> will show you some
  other header (.hd2), model (.model), and search params (.s-params) file
  setups. The remainder of this section describes how to do searches in somewhat
  more detail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>bold faced</b> tokens below are generally search params file parameters.
  For more information on the s-params file, see <b>SEARCH</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
  below, or <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/search-c.text.gz</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="WHAT_RESULTS_ARE"><a class="selflink" href="#WHAT_RESULTS_ARE">WHAT
  RESULTS ARE</a></h2>
<b>AutoClass</b> is looking for the best classification(s) of the data it can
  find. A classification is composed of:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a set of classes, each of which is described by a set of
      class parameters, which specify how the class is distributed along the
      various attributes. For example, &quot;height normally distributed with
      mean 4.67 ft and standard deviation .32 ft&quot;,</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a set of class weights, describing what percentage of cases
      are likely to be in each class.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a probabilistic assignment of cases in the data to these
      classes. I.e. for each case, the relative probability that it is a member
      of each class.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a strictly Bayesian system (accept no substitutes!), the quality measure
  <b>AutoClass</b> uses is the total probability that, had you known nothing
  about your data or its domain, you would have found this set of data generated
  by this underlying model. This includes the prior probability that the
  &quot;world&quot; would have chosen this number of classes, this set of
  relative class weights, and this set of parameters for each class, and the
  likelihood that such a set of classes would have generated this set of values
  for the attributes in the data cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These probabilities are typically very small, in the range of e^-30000, and so
  are usually expressed in exponential notation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="WHAT_RESULTS_MEAN"><a class="selflink" href="#WHAT_RESULTS_MEAN">WHAT
  RESULTS MEAN</a></h2>
It is important to remember that all of these probabilities are GIVEN that the
  real model is in the model family that <b>AutoClass</b> has restricted its
  attention to. If <b>AutoClass</b> is looking for Gaussian classes and the real
  classes are Poisson, then the fact that <b>AutoClass</b> found 5 Gaussian
  classes may not say much about how many Poisson classes there really are.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The relative probability between different classifications found can be very
  large, like e^1000, so the very best classification found is usually
  overwhelmingly more probable than the rest (and overwhelmingly less probable
  than any better classifications as yet undiscovered). If <b>AutoClass</b>
  should manage to find two classifications that are within about exp(5-10) of
  each other (i.e. within 100 to 10,000 times more probable) then you should
  consider them to be about equally probable, as our computation is usually not
  more accurate than this (and sometimes much less).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="HOW_IT_WORKS"><a class="selflink" href="#HOW_IT_WORKS">HOW
  IT WORKS</a></h2>
<b>AutoClass</b> repeatedly creates a random classification and then tries to
  massage this into a high probability classification though local changes,
  until it converges to some &quot;local maximum&quot;. It then remembers what
  it found and starts over again, continuing until you tell it to stop. Each
  effort is called a &quot;try&quot;, and the computed probability is intended
  to cover the whole volume in parameter space around this maximum, rather than
  just the peak.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard approach to massaging is to
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Compute the probabilistic class memberships of cases using
      the class parameters and the implied relative likelihoods.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Using the new class members, compute class statistics (like
      mean) and revise the class parameters.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and repeat till they stop changing. There are three available convergence
  algorithms: &quot;converge_search_3&quot; (the default),
  &quot;converge_search_4&quot; and &quot;converge&quot;. Their specification is
  controlled by search params file parameter <b>try_fn_type</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="WHEN_TO_STOP"><a class="selflink" href="#WHEN_TO_STOP">WHEN
  TO STOP</a></h2>
You can tell AUTOCLASS -SEARCH to stop by: 1) giving a <b>max_duration</b> (in
  seconds) argument at the beginning; 2) giving a <b>max_n_tries</b> (an
  integer) argument at the beginning; or 3) by typing a &quot;q&quot; and
  &lt;return&gt; after you have seen enough tries. The <b>max_duration</b> and
  <b>max_n_tries</b> arguments are useful if you desire to run AUTOCLASS -SEARCH
  in batch mode. If you are restarting AUTOCLASS -SEARCH from a previous search,
  the value of <b>max_n_tries</b> you provide, for instance 3, will tell the
  program to compute 3 more tries in addition to however many it has already
  done. The same incremental behavior is exhibited by <b>max_duration</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deciding when to stop is a judgment call and it's up to you. Since the search
  includes a random component, there's always the chance that if you let it keep
  going it will find something better. So you need to trade off how much better
  it might be with how long it might take to find it. The search status reports
  that are printed when a new best classification is found are intended to
  provide you information to help you make this tradeoff.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One clear sign that you should probably stop is if most of the classifications
  found are duplicates of previous ones (flagged by &quot;dup&quot; as they are
  found). This should only happen for very small sets of data or when fixing a
  very small number of classes, like two.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Our experience is that for moderately large to extremely large data sets (~200
  to ~10,000 datum), it is necessary to run <b>AutoClass</b> for at least 50
  trials.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="WHAT_GETS_RETURNED"><a class="selflink" href="#WHAT_GETS_RETURNED">WHAT
  GETS RETURNED</a></h2>
Just before returning, AUTOCLASS -SEARCH will give short descriptions of the
  best classifications found. How many will be described can be controlled with
  <b>n_final_summary</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default AUTOCLASS -SEARCH will write out a number of files, both at the end
  and periodically during the search (in case your system crashes before it
  finishes). These files will all have the same name (taken from the search
  params pathname [&lt;name&gt;.s-params]), and differ only in their file
  extensions. If your search runs are very long and there is a possibility that
  your machine may crash, you can have intermediate &quot;results&quot; files
  written out. These can be used to restart your search run with minimum loss of
  search effort. See the documentation file
  <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/checkpoint-c.text</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;.log&quot; file will hold a listing of most of what was printed to the
  screen during the run, unless you set <b>log_file_p</b> to false to say you
  want no such foolishness. Unless <b>results_file_p</b> is false, a binary
  &quot;.results-bin&quot; file (the default) or an ASCII &quot;.results&quot;
  text file, will hold the best classifications that were returned, and unless
  <b>search_file_p</b> is false, a &quot;.search&quot; file will hold the record
  of the search tries. <b>save_compact_p</b> controls whether the
  &quot;results&quot; files are saved as binary or ASCII text.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the C global variable &quot;G_safe_file_writing_p&quot; is defined as TRUE in
  &quot;autoclass-c/prog/globals.c&quot;, the names of &quot;results&quot; files
  (those that contain the saved classifications) are modified internally to
  account for redundant file writing. If the search params file name is
  &quot;my_saved_clsfs&quot; you will see the following &quot;results&quot; file
  names (ignoring directories and pathnames for this example)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
   <b>save_compact_p</b> = true --
  &quot;my_saved_clsfs.results-bin&quot;	- completely written file

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="HOW_TO_GET_STARTED"><a class="selflink" href="#HOW_TO_GET_STARTED">HOW

The way to invoke AUTOCLASS -SEARCH is:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
autoclass -search &lt;.db2 file path&gt; &lt;.hd2 file path&gt; 
	&lt;.model file path&gt; &lt;.s-params file path&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
To restart a previous search, specify that <b>force_new_search_p</b> has the
  value false in the search params file, since its default is true. Specifying
  false tells AUTOCLASS -SEARCH to try to find a previous compatible search
  (&lt;...&gt;.results[-bin] &amp; &lt;...&gt;.search) to continue from, and
  will restart using it if found. To force a new search instead of restarting an
  old one, give the parameter <b>force_new_search_p</b> the value of true, or
  use the default. If there is an existing search (&lt;...&gt;.results[-bin]
  &amp; &lt;...&gt;.search), the user will be asked to confirm continuation
  since continuation will discard the existing search.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a previous search is continued, the message &quot;RESTARTING SEARCH&quot;
  will be given instead of the usual &quot;BEGINNING SEARCH&quot;. It is
  generally better to continue a previous search than to start a new one, unless
  you are trying a significantly different search method, in which case
  statistics from the previous search may mislead the current one.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="STATUS_REPORTS"><a class="selflink" href="#STATUS_REPORTS">STATUS
  REPORTS</a></h2>
A running commentary on the search will be printed to the screen and to the log
  file (unless <b>log_file_p</b> is false). Note that the &quot;.log&quot; file
  will contain a listing of all default search params values, and the values of
  all params that are overridden.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After each try a very short report (only a few characters long) is given. After
  each new best classification, a longer report is given, but no more often than
  <b>min_report_period</b> (default is 30 seconds).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SEARCH_VARIATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SEARCH_VARIATIONS">SEARCH
  VARIATIONS</a></h2>
AUTOCLASS -SEARCH by default uses a certain standard search method or &quot;try
  function&quot; ( <b>try_fn_type</b> = &quot;converge_search_3&quot;). Two
  others are also available: &quot;converge_search_4&quot; and
  &quot;converge&quot;). They are provided in case your problem is one that may
  happen to benefit from them. In general the default method will result in
  finding better classifications at the expense of a longer search time. The
  default was chosen so as to be robust, giving even performance across many
  problems. The alternatives to the default may do better on some problems, but
  may do substantially worse on others.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;converge_search_3&quot; uses an absolute stopping criterion (
  <b>rel_delta_range</b>, default value of 0.0025) which tests the variation of
  each class of the delta of the log approximate-marginal-likelihood of the
  class statistics with-respect-to the class hypothesis
  (class-&gt;log_a_w_s_h_j) divided by the class weight (class-&gt;w_j) between
  successive convergence cycles. Increasing this value loosens the convergence
  and reduces the number of cycles. Decreasing this value tightens the
  convergence and increases the number of cycles. <b>n_average</b> (default
  value of 3) specifies how many successive cycles must meet the stopping
  criterion before the trial terminates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;converge_search_4&quot; uses an absolute stopping criterion (
  <b>cs4_delta_range</b>, default value of 0.0025) which tests the variation of
  each class of the slope for each class of log approximate-marginal-likelihood
  of the class statistics with-respect-to the class hypothesis
  (class-&gt;log_a_w_s_h_j) divided by the class weight (class-&gt;w_j) over
  <b>sigma_beta_n_values</b> (default value 6) convergence cycles. Increasing
  the value of <b>cs4_delta_range</b> loosens the convergence and reduces the
  number of cycles. Decreasing this value tightens the convergence and increases
  the number of cycles. Computationally, this try function is more expensive
  than &quot;converge_search_3&quot;, but may prove useful if the computational
  &quot;noise&quot; is significant compared to the variations in the computed
  values. Key calculations are done in double precision floating point, and for
  the largest data base we have tested so far ( 5,420 cases of 93 attributes),
  computational noise has not been a problem, although the value of
  <b>max_cycles</b> needed to be increased to 400.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;converge&quot; uses one of two absolute stopping criterion which test the
  variation of the classification (clsf) log_marginal (clsf-&gt;log_a_x_h) delta
  between successive convergence cycles. The largest of <b>halt_range</b>
  (default value 0.5) and <b>halt_factor</b> * <b>current_clsf_log_marginal</b>)
  is used (default value of <b>halt_factor</b> is 0.0001). Increasing these
  values loosens the convergence and reduces the number of cycles. Decreasing
  these values tightens the convergence and increases the number of cycles.
  <b>n_average</b> (default value of 3) specifies how many cycles must meet the
  stopping criteria before the trial terminates. This is a very approximate
  stopping criterion, but will give you some feel for the kind of
  classifications to expect. It would be useful for &quot;exploratory&quot;
  searches of a data base.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The purpose of <b>reconverge_type</b> = &quot;chkpt&quot; is to complete an
  interrupted classification by continuing from its last checkpoint. The purpose
  of <b>reconverge_type</b> = &quot;results&quot; is to attempt further
  refinement of the best completed classification using a different value of
  <b>try_fn_type</b> (&quot;converge_search_3&quot;,
  &quot;converge_search_4&quot;, &quot;converge&quot;). If <b>max_n_tries</b> is
  greater than 1, then in each case, after the reconvergence has completed,
  <b>AutoClass</b> will perform further search trials based on the parameter
  values in the &lt;...&gt;.s-params file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the use of <b>reconverge_type</b> ( default value &quot;&quot;), you may
  apply more than one try function to a classification. Say you generate several
  exploratory trials using <b>try_fn_type</b> = &quot;converge&quot;, and quit
  the search saving .search and .results[-bin] files. Then you can begin another
  search with <b>try_fn_type</b> = &quot;converge_search_3&quot;,
  <b>reconverge_type</b> = &quot;results&quot;, and <b>max_n_tries</b> = 1. This
  will result in the further convergence of the best classification generated
  with <b>try_fn_type</b> = &quot;converge&quot;, with <b>try_fn_type</b> =
  &quot;converge_search_3&quot;. When <b>AutoClass</b> completes this search
  try, you will have an additional refined classification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A good way to verify that any of the alternate <b>try_fun_type</b> are
  generating a well converged classification is to run <b>AutoClass</b> in
  prediction mode on the same data used for generating the classification. Then
  generate and compare the corresponding case or class cross reference files for
  the original classification and the prediction. Small differences between
  these files are to be expected, while large differences indicate incomplete
  convergence. Differences between such file pairs should, on average and modulo
  class deletions, decrease monotonically with further convergence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard way to create a random classification to begin a try is with the
  default value of &quot;random&quot; for <b>start_fn_type</b>. At this point
  there are no alternatives. Specifying &quot;block&quot; for
  <b>start_fn_type</b> produces repeatable non-random searches. That is how the
  &lt;..&gt;.s-params files in the autoclass-c/data/.. sub-directories are
  specified. This is how development testing is done.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>max_cycles</b> controls the maximum number of convergence cycles that will be
  performed in any one trial by the convergence functions. Its default value is
  200. The screen output shows a period (&quot;.&quot;) for each cycle
  completed. If your search trials run for 200 cycles, then either your data
  base is very complex (increase the value), or the <b>try_fn_type</b> is not
  adequate for situation (try another of the available ones, and use
  <b>converge_print_p</b> to get more information on what is going on).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specifying <b>converge_print_p</b> to be true will generate a brief print-out
  for each cycle which will provide information so that you can modify the
  default values of <b>rel_delta_range</b> &amp; <b>n_average</b> for
  &quot;converge_search_3&quot;; <b>cs4_delta_range</b> &amp;
  <b>sigma_beta_n_values</b> for &quot;converge_search_4&quot;; and
  <b>halt_range</b>, <b>halt_factor</b>, and <b>n_average</b> for
  &quot;converge&quot;. Their default values are given in the
  &lt;..&gt;.s-params files in the autoclass-c/data/.. sub-directories.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="HOW_MANY_CLASSES?"><a class="selflink" href="#HOW_MANY_CLASSES?">HOW
  MANY CLASSES?</a></h2>
Each new try begins with a certain number of classes and may end up with a
  smaller number, as some classes may drop out of the convergence. In general,
  you want to begin the try with some number of classes that previous tries have
  indicated look promising, and you want to be sure you are fishing around
  elsewhere in case you missed something before.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>n_classes_fn_type</b> = &quot;random_ln_normal&quot; is the default way to
  make this choice. It fits a log normal to the number of classes (usually
  called &quot;j&quot; for short) of the 10 best classifications found so far,
  and randomly selects from that. There is currently no alternative.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start the game off, the default is to go down <b>start_j_list</b> for the
  first few tries, and then switch to <b>n_classes_fn_type</b>. If you believe
  that the probable number of classes in your data base is say 75, then instead
  of using the default value of <b>start_j_list</b> (2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 25),
  specify something like 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If one wants to always look for, say, three classes, one can use <b>fixed_j</b>
  and override the above. Search status reports will describe what the current
  method for choosing j is.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DO_I_HAVE_ENOUGH_MEMORY_AND_DISK_SPACE?"><a class="selflink" href="#DO_I_HAVE_ENOUGH_MEMORY_AND_DISK_SPACE?">DO
  I HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY AND DISK SPACE?</a></h2>
Internally, the storage requirements in the current system are of order
  n_classes_per_clsf * (n_data + n_stored_clsfs * n_attributes *
  n_attribute_values). This depends on the number of cases, the number of
  attributes, the values per attribute (use 2 if a real value), and the number
  of classifications stored away for comparison to see if others are duplicates
  -- controlled by <b>max_n_store</b> (default value = 10). The search process
  does not itself consume significant memory, but storage of the results may do
  so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>AutoClass C</b> is configured to handle a maximum of 999 attributes. If you
  attempt to run with more than that you will get array bound violations. In
  that case, change these configuration parameters in prog/autoclass.h and
  recompile <b>AutoClass C</b>:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
#define ALL_ATTRIBUTES                  999   
#define VERY_LONG_STRING_LENGTH         20000 
#define VERY_LONG_TOKEN_LENGTH          500 
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
For example, these values will handle several thousand attributes:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
#define ALL_ATTRIBUTES                  9999
#define VERY_LONG_STRING_LENGTH         50000
#define VERY_LONG_TOKEN_LENGTH          50000
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Disk space taken up by the &quot;log&quot; file will of course depend on the
  duration of the search. <b>n_save</b> (default value = 2) determines how many
  best classifications are saved into the &quot;.results[-bin]&quot; file.
  <b>save_compact_p</b> controls whether the &quot;results&quot; and
  &quot;checkpoint&quot; files are saved as binary. Binary files are faster and
  more compact, but are not portable. The default value of <b>save_compact_p</b>
  is true, which causes binary files to be written.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the time taken to save the &quot;results&quot; files is a problem, consider
  increasing <b>min_save_period</b> (default value = 1800 seconds or 30
  minutes). Files are saved to disk this often if there is anything different to
  report.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="JUST_HOW_SLOW_IS_IT?"><a class="selflink" href="#JUST_HOW_SLOW_IS_IT?">JUST
  HOW SLOW IS IT?</a></h2>
Compute time is of order n_data * n_attributes * n_classes * n_tries *
  converge_cycles_per_try. The major uncertainties in this are the number of
  basic back and forth cycles till convergence in each try, and of course the
  number of tries. The number of cycles per trial is typically 10-100 for
  <b>try_fn_type</b> &quot;converge&quot;, and 10-200+ for
  &quot;converge_search_3&quot; and &quot;converge_search-4&quot;. The maximum
  number is specified by <b>max_n_tries</b> (default value = 200). The number of
  trials is up to you and your available computing resources.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The running time of very large data sets will be quite uncertain. We advise that
  a few small scale test runs be made on your system to determine a baseline.
  Specify <b>n_data</b> to limit how many data vectors are read. Given a very
  large quantity of data, <b>AutoClass</b> may find its most probable
  classifications at upwards of a hundred classes, and this will require that
  <b>start_j_list</b> be specified appropriately (See above section <b>HOW MANY
  CLASSES?</b>). If you are quite certain that you only want a few classes, you
  can force <b>AutoClass</b> to search with a fixed number of classes specified
  by <b>fixed_j</b>. You will then need to run separate searches with each
  different fixed number of classes.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CHANGING_FILENAMES_IN_A_SAVED_CLASSIFICATION_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#CHANGING_FILENAMES_IN_A_SAVED_CLASSIFICATION_FILE">CHANGING
  FILENAMES IN A SAVED CLASSIFICATION FILE</a></h2>
<b>AutoClass</b> caches the data, header, and model file pathnames in the saved
  classification structure of the binary (&quot;.results-bin&quot;) or ASCII
  (&quot;.results&quot;) &quot;results&quot; files. If the &quot;results&quot;
  and &quot;search&quot; files are moved to a different directory location, the
  search cannot be successfully restarted if you have used absolute pathnames.
  Thus it is advantageous to run invoke <b>AutoClass</b> in a parent directory
  of the data, header, and model files, so that relative pathnames can be used.
  Since the pathnames cached will then be relative, the files can be moved to a
  different host or file system and restarted -- providing the same relative
  pathname hierarchy exists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, since the &quot;.results&quot; file is ASCII text, those pathnames
  could be changed with a text editor ( <b>save_compact_p</b> must be specified
  as false).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SEARCH_PARAMETERS"><a class="selflink" href="#SEARCH_PARAMETERS">SEARCH
  PARAMETERS</a></h2>
The search is controlled by the &quot;.s-params&quot; file. In this file, an
  empty line or a line starting with one of these characters is treated as a
  comment: &quot;#&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, or &quot;;&quot;. The parameter name
  and its value can be separated by an equal sign, a space, or a tab:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
	n_clsfs 1
	n_clsfs = 1
	n_clsfs&lt;tab&gt;1
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Spaces are ignored if &quot;=&quot; or &quot;&lt;tab&gt;&quot; are used as
  separators. Note there are no trailing semicolons.

  TO GET AUTOCLASS C TO PRODUCE REPEATABLE RESULTS</a></h2>
In some situations, repeatable classifications are required: comparing basic
  <b>AutoClass C</b> integrity on different platforms, porting <b>AutoClass
  C</b> to a new platform, etc. In order to accomplish this two things are
  necessary: 1) the same random number generator must be used, and 2) the search
  parameters must be specified properly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Random Number Generator. This implementation of <b>AutoClass C</b> uses the Unix
  srand48/lrand48 random number generator which generates pseudo-random numbers
  using the well-known linear congruential algorithm and 48-bit integer
  arithmetic. lrand48() returns non- negative long integers uniformly
  distributed over the interval [0, 2**31].
<div class="Pp"></div>
Search Parameters. The following .s-params file parameters should be specified:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
force_new_search_p = true
start_fn_type   &quot;block&quot;
randomize_random_p = false
;; specify the number of trials you wish to run
max_n_tries = 50
;; specify a time greater than duration of run
min_report_period = 30000
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Note that no current best classification reports will be produced. Only a final
  classification summary will be output.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHECKPOINTING"><a class="selflink" href="#CHECKPOINTING">CHECKPOINTING</a></h1>
With very large databases there is a significant probability of a system crash
  during any one classification try. Under such circumstances it is advisable to
  take the time to checkpoint the calculations for possible restart.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Checkpointing is initiated by specifying &quot; <b>checkpoint_p</b> = true&quot;
  in the &quot;.s-params&quot; file. This causes the inner convergence step, to
  save a copy of the classification onto the checkpoint file each time the
  classification is updated, providing a certain period of time has elapsed. The
  file extension is &quot;.chkpt[-bin]&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each time a AutoClass completes a cycle, a &quot;.&quot; is output to the screen
  to provide you with information to be used in setting the
  <b>min_checkpoint_period</b> value (default 10800 seconds or 3 hours). There
  is obviously a trade-off between frequency of checkpointing and the
  probability that your machine may crash, since the repetitive writing of the
  checkpoint file will slow the search process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Restarting AutoClass Search:
<div class="Pp"></div>
To recover the classification and continue the search after rebooting and
  reloading AutoClass, specify <b>reconverge_type</b> = &quot;chkpt&quot; in the
  &quot;.s-params&quot; file (specify <b>force_new_search_p</b> as false).
<div class="Pp"></div>
AutoClass will reload the appropriate database and models, provided there has
  been no change in their filenames since the time they were loaded for the
  checkpointed classification run. The &quot;.s-params&quot; file contains any
  non-default arguments that were provided to the original call.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the beginning of a search, before <b>start_j_list</b> has been emptied, it
  will be necessary to trim the original list to what would have remained in the
  crashed search. This can be determined by looking at the &quot;.log&quot; file
  to determine what values were already used. If the <b>start_j_list</b> has
  been emptied, then an empty <b>start_j_list</b> should be specified in the
  &quot;.s-params&quot; file. This is done either by
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>start_j_list</b> =
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
or
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>start_j_list</b> = -9999
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here is an a set of scripts to demonstrate check-pointing:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>

     data/glass/glass-mnc.model data/glass/glassc-chkpt.s-params

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The attribute influence values report attempts to provide relative measures of
  the &quot;influence&quot; of the data attributes on the classes found by the
  classification. The normalized class strengths, the normalized attribute
  influence values summed over all classes, and the individual influence values
  (I[jkl]) are all only relative measures and should be interpreted with more
  meaning than rank ordering, but not like anything approaching absolute values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reports are output to files whose names and pathnames are taken from the

<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>n</i> is the classification number from the &quot;results&quot; file.
  The first or best classification is numbered 1, the next best 2, etc. The
  default is to generate reports only for the best classification in the
  &quot;results&quot; file. You can produce reports for other saved
  classifications by using report params keywords <b>n_clsfs</b> and
  <b>clsf_n_list</b>. The &quot;influ-o-text- <i>n</i>&quot; file type is the
  default ( <b>order_attributes_by_influence_p</b> = true), and lists each
  class's attributes in descending order of attribute influence value. If the
  value of <b>order_attributes_by_influence_p</b> is overridden to be false in
  the &lt;...&gt;.r-params file, then each class's attributes will be listed in
  ascending order by attribute number. The extension of the file generated will
  be &quot;influ-no-text- <i>n</i>&quot;. This method of listing facilitates the
  visual comparison of attribute values between classes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, this command:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>

	xref_class_report_att_list = 2, 5, 6

<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>AutoClass C</b> reports provide the capability to compute sigma class
  contour values for specified pairs of real valued attributes, when generating
  the influence values report with the data option (report_mode =
  &quot;data&quot;). Note that sigma class contours are not generated from
  discrete type attributes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sigma contours are the two dimensional equivalent of n-sigma error bars in
  one dimension. Specifically, for two independent attributes the n-sigma
  contour is defined as the ellipse where
<div class="Pp"></div>
((x - xMean) / xSigma)^2 + ((y - yMean) / ySigma)^2 == n
<div class="Pp"></div>
With covariant attributes, the n-sigma contours are defined identically, in the
  rotated coordinate system of the distribution's principle axes. Thus
  independent attributes give ellipses oriented parallel with the attribute
  axes, while the axes of sigma contours of covariant attributes are rotated
  about the center determined by the means. In either case the sigma contour
  represents a line where the class probability is constant, irrespective of any
  other class probabilities.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With three or more attributes the n-sigma contours become k-dimensional
  ellipsoidal surfaces. This code takes advantage of the fact that the parallel
  projection of an n-dimensional ellipsoid, onto any 2-dim plane, is bounded by
  an ellipse. In this simplified case of projecting the single sigma ellipsoid
  onto the coordinate planes, it is also true that the 2-dim covariances of this
  ellipse are equal to the corresponding elements of the n-dim ellipsoid's
  covariances. The Eigen-system of the 2-dim covariance then gives the variances
  w.r.t. the principal components of the eclipse, and the rotation that aligns
  it with the data. This represents the best way to display a distribution in
  the marginal plane.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get contour values, set the keyword <b>sigma_contours_att_list</b> to a list
  of real valued attribute indices (from .hd2 file), and request an influence
  values report with the data option. For example,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
	report_mode = &quot;data&quot;
	sigma_contours_att_list = 3, 4, 5, 8, 15
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OUTPUT_REPORT_PARAMETERS"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_REPORT_PARAMETERS">OUTPUT
  REPORT PARAMETERS</a></h2>
The contents of the output report are controlled by the &quot;.r-params&quot;
  file. In this file, an empty line or a line starting with one of these
  characters is treated as a comment: &quot;#&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, or
  &quot;;&quot;. The parameter name and its value can be separated by an equal
  sign, a space, or a tab:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
	n_clsfs 1
	n_clsfs = 1
	n_clsfs&lt;tab&gt;1
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  HAVE YOU GOT?</a></h2>
Now you have run <b>AutoClass</b> on your data set -- what have you got?
  Typically, the <b>AutoClass</b> search procedure finds many classifications,
  but only saves the few best. These are now available for inspection and
  interpretation. The most important indicator of the relative merits of these
  alternative classifications is Log total posterior probability value. Note
  that since the probability lies between 1 and 0, the corresponding Log
  probability is negative and ranges from 0 to negative infinity. The difference
  between these Log probability values raised to the power e gives the relative
  probability of the alternatives classifications. So a difference of, say 100,
  implies one classification is e^100 ~= 10^43 more likely than the other.
  However, these numbers can be very misleading, since they give the relative
  probability of alternative classifications under the <b>AutoClass</b>
  <i>assumptions</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ASSUMPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#ASSUMPTIONS">ASSUMPTIONS</a></h2>
Specifically, the most important <b>AutoClass</b> assumptions are the use of
  normal models for real variables, and the assumption of independence of
  attributes within a class. Since these assumptions are often violated in
  practice, the difference in posterior probability of alternative
  classifications can be partly due to one classification being closer to
  satisfying the assumptions than another, rather than to a real difference in
  classification quality. Another source of uncertainty about the utility of Log
  probability values is that they do not take into account any specific prior
  knowledge the user may have about the domain. This means that it is often
  worth looking at alternative classifications to see if you can interpret them,
  but it is worth starting from the most probable first. Note that if the Log
  probability value is much greater than that for the one class case, it is
  saying that there is overwhelming evidence for <i>some</i> structure in the
  data, and part of this structure has been captured by the <b>AutoClass</b>
  classification.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INFLUENCE_REPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#INFLUENCE_REPORT">INFLUENCE
  REPORT </a></h2>
So you have now picked a classification you want to examine, based on its Log
  probability value; how do you examine it? The first thing to do is to generate
  an &quot;influence&quot; report on the classification using the report
  generation facilities documented in
  <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/reports-c.text</i>. An influence report is
  designed to summarize the important information buried in the <b>AutoClass</b>
  data structures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first part of this report gives the heuristic class &quot;strengths&quot;.
  Class &quot;strength&quot; is here defined as the geometric mean probability
  that any instance &quot;belonging to&quot; class, would have been generated
  from the class probability model. It thus provides a heuristic measure of how
  strongly each class predicts &quot;its&quot; instances.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second part is a listing of the overall &quot;influence&quot; of each of the
  attributes used in the classification. These give a rough heuristic measure of
  the relative importance of each attribute in the classification. Attribute
  &quot;influence values&quot; are a class probability weighted average of the
  &quot;influence&quot; of each attribute in the classes, as described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next part of the report is a summary description of each of the classes. The
  classes are arbitrarily numbered from 0 up to n, in order of descending class
  weight. A class weight of say 34.1 means that the weighted sum of membership
  probabilities for class is 34.1. Note that a class weight of 34 does not
  necessarily mean that 34 cases belong to that class, since many cases may have
  only partial membership in that class. Within each class, attributes or
  attribute sets are ordered by the &quot;influence&quot; of their model term.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CROSS_ENTROPY"><a class="selflink" href="#CROSS_ENTROPY">CROSS
  ENTROPY </a></h2>
A commonly used measure of the divergence between two probability distributions
  is the cross entropy: the sum over all possible values x, of
  P(x|c...)*log[P(x|c...)/P(x|g...)], where c... and g... define the
  distributions. It ranges from zero, for identical distributions, to infinite
  for distributions placing probability 1 on differing values of an attribute.
  With conditionally independent terms in the probability distributions, the
  cross entropy can be factored to a sum over these terms. These factors provide
  a measure of the corresponding modeled attribute's influence in
  differentiating the two distributions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We define the modeled term's &quot;influence&quot; on a class to be the cross
  entropy term for the class distribution w.r.t. the global class distribution
  of the single class classification. &quot;Influence&quot; is thus a measure of
  how strongly the model term helps differentiate the class from the whole data
  set. With independently modeled attributes, the influence can legitimately be
  ascribed to the attribute itself. With correlated or covariant attributes
  sets, the cross entropy factor is a function of the entire set, and we
  distribute the influence value equally over the modeled attributes.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ATTRIBUTE_INFLUENCE_VALUES"><a class="selflink" href="#ATTRIBUTE_INFLUENCE_VALUES">ATTRIBUTE
  INFLUENCE VALUES</a></h2>
In the &quot;influence&quot; report on each class, the attribute parameters for
  that class are given in order of highest influence value for the model term
  attribute sets. Only the first few attribute sets usually have significant
  influence values. If an influence value drops below about 20% of the highest
  value, then it is probably not significant, but all attribute sets are listed
  for completeness. In addition to the influence value for each attribute set,
  the values of the attribute set parameters in that class are given along with
  the corresponding &quot;global&quot; values. The global values are computed
  directly from the data independent of the classification. For example, if the
  class mean of attribute &quot;temperature&quot; is 90 with standard deviation
  of 2.5, but the global mean is 68 with a standard deviation of 16.3, then this
  class has selected out cases with much higher than average temperature, and a
  rather small spread in this high range. Similarly, for discrete attribute
  sets, the probability of each outcome in that class is given, along with the
  corresponding global probability -- ordered by its significance: the absolute
  value of (log {&lt;local-probability&gt; / &lt;global-probability&gt;}). The
  sign of the significance value shows the direction of change from the global
  class. This information gives an overview of how each class differs from the
  average for all the data, in order of the most significant differences.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CLASS_AND_CASE_REPORTS"><a class="selflink" href="#CLASS_AND_CASE_REPORTS">CLASS
  AND CASE REPORTS</a></h2>
Having gained a description of the classes from the &quot;influence&quot;
  report, you may want to follow-up to see which classes your favorite cases
  ended up in. Conversely, you may want to see which cases belong to a
  particular class. For this kind of cross-reference information two
  complementary reports can be generated. These are more fully documented in
  <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/reports-c.text</i>. The &quot;class&quot; report,
  lists all the cases which have significant membership in each class and the
  degree to which each such case belongs to that class. Cases whose class
  membership is less than 90% in the current class have their other class
  membership listed as well. The cases within a class are ordered in increasing
  case number. The alternative &quot;cases&quot; report states which class (or
  classes) a case belongs to, and the membership probability in the most
  probable class. These two reports allow you to find which cases belong to
  which classes or the other way around. If nearly every case has close to 99%
  membership in a single class, then it means that the classes are well
  separated, while a high degree of cross-membership indicates that the classes
  are heavily overlapped. Highly overlapped classes are an indication that the
  idea of classification is breaking down and that groups of mutually highly
  overlapped classes, a kind of meta class, is probably a better way of
  understanding the data.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="COMPARING_CLASS_WEIGHTS_AND_CLASS/CASE_REPORT_ASSIGNMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMPARING_CLASS_WEIGHTS_AND_CLASS/CASE_REPORT_ASSIGNMENTS">COMPARING
  CLASS WEIGHTS AND CLASS/CASE REPORT ASSIGNMENTS</a></h2>
The class weight given as the class probability parameter, is essentially the
  sum over all data instances, of the normalized probability that the instance
  is a member of the class. It is probably an error on our part that we format
  this number as an integer in the report, rather than emphasizing its real
  nature. You will find the actual real value recorded as the w_j parameter in
  the class_DS structures on any .results[-bin] file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .case and .class reports give probabilities that cases are members of
  classes. Any assignment of cases to classes requires some decision rule. The
  maximum probability assignment rule is often implicitly assumed, but it cannot
  be expected that the resulting partition sizes will equal the class weights
  unless nearly all class membership probabilities are effectively one or zero.
  With non-1/0 membership probabilities, matching the class weights requires
  summing the probabilities.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, there is the question of completeness of the EM (expectation
  maximization) convergence. EM alternates between estimating class parameters
  and estimating class membership probabilities. These estimates converge on
  each other, but never actually meet. <b>AutoClass</b> implements several
  convergence algorithms with alternate stopping criteria using appropriate
  parameters in the .s-params file. Proper setting of these parameters, to get
  reasonably complete and efficient convergence may require experimentation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ALTERNATIVE_CLASSIFICATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#ALTERNATIVE_CLASSIFICATIONS">ALTERNATIVE
  CLASSIFICATIONS </a></h2>
In summary, the various reports that can be generated give you a way of viewing
  the current classification. It is usually a good idea to look at alternative
  classifications even though they do not have the minimum Log probability
  values. These other classifications usually have classes that correspond
  closely to strong classes in other classifications, but can differ in the weak
  classes. The &quot;strength&quot; of a class within a classification can
  usually be judged by how dramatically the highest influence value attributes
  in the class differ from the corresponding global attributes. If none of the
  classifications seem quite satisfactory, it is always possible to run
  <b>AutoClass</b> again to generate new classifications.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="WHAT_NEXT?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHAT_NEXT?">WHAT
  NEXT?</a></h2>
Finally, the question of what to do after you have found an insightful
  classification arises. Usually, classification is a preliminary data analysis
  step for examining a set of cases (things, examples, etc.) to see if they can
  be grouped so that members of the group are &quot;similar&quot; to each other.
  <b>AutoClass</b> gives such a grouping without the user having to define a
  similarity measure. The built-in &quot;similarity&quot; measure is the mutual
  predictiveness of the cases. The next step is to try to &quot;explain&quot;
  why some objects are more like others than those in a different group.
  Usually, domain knowledge suggests an answer. For example, a classification of
  people based on income, buying habits, location, age, etc., may reveal
  particular social classes that were not obvious before the classification
  analysis. To obtain further information about such classes, further
  information, such as number of cars, what TV shows are watched, etc., would
  reveal even more information. Longitudinal studies would give information
  about how social classes arise and what influences their attitudes -- all of
  which is going way beyond the initial classification.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREDICTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#PREDICTIONS">PREDICTIONS</a></h1>
Classifications can be used to predict class membership for new cases. So in
  addition to possibly giving you some insight into the structure behind your
  data, you can now use <b>AutoClass</b> directly to make predictions, and
  compare <b>AutoClass</b> to other learning systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This technique for predicting class probabilities is applicable to all
  attributes, regardless of data type/sub_type or likelihood model term type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the event that the class membership of a data case does not exceed 0.0099999
  for any of the &quot;training&quot; classes, the following message will appear
  in the screen output for each case:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 xref_get_data: case_num xxx =&gt; class 9999
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Class 9999 members will appear in the &quot;case&quot; and &quot;class&quot;
  cross-reference reports with a class membership of 1.0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cautionary Points:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The usual way of using <b>AutoClass</b> is to put all of your data in a
  data_file, describe that data with model and header files, and run
  &quot;autoclass -search&quot;. Now, instead of one data_file you will have
  two, a training_data_file and a test_data_file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is most important that both databases have the same <b>AutoClass</b> internal
  representation. Should this not be true, <b>AutoClass</b> will exit, or
  possibly in in some situations, crash. The prediction mode is designed to
  hopefully direct the user into conforming to this requirement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Preparation:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prediction requires having a training classification and a test database. The
  training classification is generated by the running of &quot;autoclass
  -search&quot; on the training data_file (&quot;data/soybean/soyc.db2&quot;),
  for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    autoclass -search data/soybean/soyc.db2 data/soybean/soyc.hd2 
        data/soybean/soyc.model data/soybean/soyc.s-params
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This will produce &quot;soyc.results-bin&quot; and &quot;soyc.search&quot;. Then
  create a &quot;reports&quot; parameter file, such as &quot;soyc.r-params&quot;
  (see <i>/usr/share/doc/autoclass/reports-c.text</i>), and run <b>AutoClass</b>
  in &quot;reports&quot; mode, such as:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    autoclass -reports data/soybean/soyc.results-bin 
        data/soybean/soyc.search data/soybean/soyc.r-params
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This will generate class and case cross-reference files, and an influence values
  file. The file names are based on the &quot;.r-params&quot; file name:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        data/soybean/soyc.class-text-1
        data/soybean/soyc.case-text-1
        data/soybean/soyc.influ-text-1
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These will describe the classes found in the training_data_file. Now this
  classification can be used to predict the probabilistic class membership of
  the test_data_file cases (&quot;data/soybean/soyc-predict.db2&quot;) in the
  training_data_file classes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    autoclass -predict data/soybean/soyc-predict.db2
        data/soybean/soyc.results-bin data/soybean/soyc.search
        data/soybean/soyc.r-params
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This will generate class and case cross-reference files for the test_data_file
  cases predicting their probabilistic class memberships in the
  training_data_file classes. The file names are based on the &quot;.db2&quot;
  file name:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        data/soybean/soyc-predict.class-text-1
        data/soybean/soyc-predict.case-text-1
</pre>
