<p>tcptrack(1) General Commands Manual tcptrack(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcptrack - Monitor TCP connections on the network</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcptrack [ -dfhvp ] [ -r seconds ] -i interface <br>
[ filter expression ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tcptrack displays the status of TCP connections that it sees
on a given network interface. tcptrack monitors their state
and displays information such as state,
source/destina&acirc; <br>
tion addresses and bandwidth usage in a sorted, updated list
very much like the top(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter expression is a
standard pcap filter expression (identical to the
expressions used by tcpdump(8)) which can be used to filter
down the characteristics of TCP connec&acirc; <br>
tions that tcptrack will see. See tcpdump(8) for more
information about the syntax of this expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Only track connections that were started after tcptrack
was started. Do not try to detect existing connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Enable fast average
recalculation. TCPTrack will calculate the average speeds of
connections by using a running average. TCPTrack will use
more memory and CPU time, but <br>
averages will seem closer to real time and will be updated
more than once per second and may be more accurate under
heavy load. The number of times per second that aver&acirc;
<br>
ages will be recalculated in fast mode is a compile-time
setting that defaults to 10 times per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display command line help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i [interface] <br>
Sniff packets from the specified network interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T [pcap file] <br>
Read packets from the specified file instead of sniffing
from the network. Useful for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Do not put the interface
being sniffed into promiscuous mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r [seconds] <br>
Wait this many seconds before removing a closed connection
from the display. Defaults to 2 seconds. See also the pause
interactive command (below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display tcptrack version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS <br>
The following keys may be pressed while tcptrack is running
to change runtime options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p - Pause/unpause display. No
new connections will be added to the display, and all
currently displayed connections will remain in the
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q - Quit tcptrack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s - Cycle through the sorting
options: unsorted, sorted by rate, sorted by total
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options for pausing and
toggling sorting are useful if you&rsquo;re watching a very
busy network and want to look at the display without
connections jumping around (due to sorting <br>
and new connections being added) and disappearing (due to
being closed for a certain time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When paused (via the p command)
no new connections will be displayed, however tcptrack will
still monitor and track all connections it sees as usual.
This option affects the dis&acirc; <br>
play only, not internals. When you unpause, the display will
be updated with all current information that tcptrack has
been gathering all along.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
tcptrack requires only one parameter to run: the -i flag
followed by an interface name that you want tcptrack to
monitor. This is the most basic way to run tcptrack:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcptrack -i eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcptrack can also take a pcap
filter expression as an argument. The format of this filter
expression is the same as that of tcpdump(8) and other
libpcap-based sniffers. The fol&acirc; <br>
lowing example will only show connections from host
10.45.165.2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcptrack -i eth0 src or dst
10.45.165.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next example will only show
web traffic (ie, traffic on port 80):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcptrack -i eth0 port 80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
tcpdump(8), pcap(3),

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When picking up a connection that was already running before
tcptrack was started, there is no way tcptrack can know for
sure which end of the connection is the client (ie, which
<br>
peer started the connection) and which is the server (ie,
which peer was listening). tcptrack makes a crude guess at
which is which by looking at the port numbers; whichever end
<br>
has the lower port number is considered the server side.
This isn&rsquo;t always accurate of course, but future
versions may have better heuristics to figure out which end
is which.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently the interface is not
very flexible. Display timing settings (such as the refresh
interval) can only be changed by editing the source code
(defs.h in particular). See <br>
the TODO file included with the source distribution for
further bugs.</p>
