tcptrack - Monitor TCP connections on the network
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>tcptrack</b> [ <b>-dfhvp</b> ] [ <b>-r</b> <i>seconds</i> ] <b>-i</b>
  <i>interface</i>
<br/>
 [ <i>filter expression</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
tcptrack displays the status of TCP connections that it sees on a given network
  interface. tcptrack monitors their state and displays information such as
  state, source/destination addresses and bandwidth usage in a sorted, updated
  list very much like the top(1) command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The filter expression is a standard pcap filter expression (identical to the
  expressions used by tcpdump(8)) which can be used to filter down the
  characteristics of TCP connections that tcptrack will see. See tcpdump(8) for
  more information about the syntax of this expression.

      accurate under heavy load. The number of times per second that averages
      will be recalculated in fast mode is a compile-time setting that defaults
      to 10 times per second.</dd>

  COMMANDS</a></h1>
The following keys may be pressed while tcptrack is running to change runtime
  options:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>p</b> - Pause/unpause display. No new connections will be added to the
  display, and all currently displayed connections will remain in the display.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>q</b> - Quit tcptrack.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>s</b> - Cycle through the sorting options: unsorted, sorted by rate, sorted
  by total bytes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The options for pausing and toggling sorting are useful if you're watching a
  very busy network and want to look at the display without connections jumping
  around (due to sorting and new connections being added) and disappearing (due
  to being closed for a certain time).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When paused (via the p command) no new connections will be displayed, however
  tcptrack will still monitor and track all connections it sees as usual. This
  option affects the display only, not internals. When you unpause, the display
  will be updated with all current information that tcptrack has been gathering
  all along.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
tcptrack requires only one parameter to run: the -i flag followed by an
  interface name that you want tcptrack to monitor. This is the most basic way
  to run tcptrack:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b># tcptrack -i eth0</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
tcptrack can also take a pcap filter expression as an argument. The format of
  this filter expression is the same as that of tcpdump(8) and other
  libpcap-based sniffers. The following example will only show connections from
  host 10.45.165.2:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b># tcptrack -i eth0 src or dst 10.45.165.2</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The next example will only show web traffic (ie, traffic on port 80):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b># tcptrack -i eth0 port 80</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
When picking up a connection that was already running before tcptrack was
  started, there is no way tcptrack can know for sure which end of the
  connection is the client (ie, which peer started the connection) and which is
  the server (ie, which peer was listening). tcptrack makes a crude guess at
  which is which by looking at the port numbers; whichever end has the lower
  port number is considered the server side. This isn't always accurate of
  course, but future versions may have better heuristics to figure out which end
  is which.

Currently the interface is not very flexible. Display timing settings (such as
  the refresh interval) can only be changed by editing the source code (defs.h
  in particular). See the TODO file included with the source distribution for
  further bugs.</div>
