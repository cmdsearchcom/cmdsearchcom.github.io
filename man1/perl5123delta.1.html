<p>PERL5123DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5123DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5123delta - what is new for perl v5.12.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.2
release and the 5.12.3 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.12.1, first read perl5122delta,
which describes differences between 5.12.1 and 5.12.2. The
major changes made in 5.12.0 <br>
are described in perl5120delta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.2.
If any <br>
exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
&quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot; work on arrays <br>
You can now use the &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot;,
&quot;each&quot; builtin functions on arrays (previously you
could only use them on hashes). See perlfunc for details.
This is actually a change <br>
introduced in perl 5.12.0, but it was missed from that
release&rsquo;s perldelta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bug Fixes <br>
&quot;no VERSION&quot; will now correctly deparse with
B::Deparse, as will certain constant expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module::Build should be more
reliably pass its tests under cygwin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lvalue subroutines are again
able to return copy-on-write scalars. This had been broken
since version 5.10.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Notes <br>
Solaris <br>
A separate DTrace is now build for miniperl, which means
that perl can be compiled with -Dusedtrace on Solaris
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS A number of regressions on
VMS have been fixed. In addition to minor cleanup of
questionable expressions in vms.c, file permissions should
no longer be garbled by the PerlIO <br>
layer, and spurious record boundaries should no longer be
introduced by the PerlIO layer during output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details and discussion
on the latter, see:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.vmsperl/2010/11/msg15419.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOS A few very small changes
were made to the build process on VOS to better support the
platform. Longer-than-32-character filenames are now
supported on OpenVOS, and build <br>
properly without IPv6 support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.12.3 represents approximately four months of
development since Perl 5.12.2 and contains approximately
2500 lines of changes across 54 files from 16 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.12.3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Craig A. Berry, David Golden,
David Leadbeater, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz,
Jesse Vincent, Karl Williamson, Nick Johnston, Nicolas
Kaiser, Paul Green, Rafael Garcia- <br>
Suarez, Rainer Tammer, Ricardo Signes, Steffen Mueller,
Zsban Ambrus, var Arnfjoer&lsquo; Bjarmason</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
