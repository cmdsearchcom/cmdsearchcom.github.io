<p>PMDASHPING(1) General Commands Manual PMDASHPING(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmdashping - &quot;shell-ping&quot; performance metrics
domain agent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/pmdashping [-C] [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-I interval] [-t timeout] [-U username]
configfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmdashping is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
which exports quality of service and response time
measurements for arbitrary commands as might be run from a
shell such <br>
as sh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These measurements are intended
to be used to quantify service quality and service
availability for those services that are either mission
critical or act as early indicators of <br>
adverse system performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sample configuration
monitors simple shell commands (exit and date(1)), a short
computationally intensive task using sum(1), a short C
compilation, DNS lookup via <br>
nslookup(1), YP lookup via ypcat(1), bind/portmapper service
using rpcbind(1), SMTP by connecting to telnet port 25 and
sending an &lsquo;&lsquo;expn root&rsquo;&rsquo; request,
and NNTP by connecting <br>
to telnet port 119 and running a
&lsquo;&lsquo;listgroup&rsquo;&rsquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is expected that other
commands would follow the examples in the sample
configuration file, and most deployments of the pmdashping
PMDA are expected to use a customized con&acirc; <br>
figuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief description of the
pmdashping command line options follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Parse configfile, reporting
any errors and exiting with non-zero status if the file
contains syntactical errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named shping.log is written in the
current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdashping is started,
i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If <br>
the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Amount of time (in seconds)
between subsequent executions of the list of commands
provided via the configuration file configfile. The default
is 2 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Amount of time (in seconds)
to wait before timing out awaiting a response for a command
from configfile. The default is 20 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent and all commands. The default is the
unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in current versions of
PCP, but in older versions the superuser <br>
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The required configfile
specifies &lsquo;&lsquo;tag&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;command&rsquo;&rsquo; pairs, each on a
separate line. All of the commands are run one after
another, with the whole group rescheduled to be <br>
run once per interval. For each command that is run,
pmdashping records information related to the success (or
timeout), exit status, elapsed time and CPU time (system and
<br>
user), and this information is exported by the PMDA. The
tags are used to identify the individual commands amongst
the values exported by the PMDA, and form the external <br>
instance domain identifiers for the pmdashping metrics which
relate to each command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
In order for a host to export the names, help text and
values for the shping performance metrics, do the following
as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping <br>
# ./Install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set of
&lsquo;&lsquo;tag&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;command&rsquo;&rsquo; pairs may be specified
from a default (sample) configuration file, a customized
file or entered interactively as part of the Install
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to undo the
installation, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping <br>
# ./Remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmdashping is launched by
pmcd(1) and should never be executed directly. The Install
and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the agent is
installed or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH <br>
command line options used to launch pmdashping <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/help <br>
default help text file for the shping metrics <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/sample.conf <br>
example configuration file with a number of common commands
<br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/Install <br>
installation script for the pmdashping agent <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/Remove <br>
undo installation script for pmdashping <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/shping.log <br>
default log file for error messages and other information
from pmdashping</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
