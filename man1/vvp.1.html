<p>vvp(1) Version 10.1 (stable) vvp(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vvp - Icarus Verilog vvp runtime engine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vvp [-inNsvV] [-Mpath] [-mmodule] [-llogfile] inputfile
[extended-args...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
vvp is the run time engine that executes the default
compiled form generated by Icarus Verilog. The output from
the iverilog command is not by itself executable on any
platform. <br>
Instead, the vvp program is invoked to execute the generated
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
vvp accepts the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This flag causes all output
to &lt;stdout&gt; to be unbuffered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-llogfile <br>
This flag specifies a logfile where all MCI &lt;stdlog&gt;
output goes. Specify logfile as &rsquo;-&rsquo; to send log
output to &lt;stderr&gt;. $display and friends send their
output both to <br>
&lt;stdout&gt; and &lt;stdlog&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mpath This flag adds a
directory to the path list used to locate VPI modules. The
default path includes only the install directory for the
system.vpi module, but this flag can <br>
add other directories. Multiple paths are allowed, and
modules will be searched in order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodule <br>
Tell the vvp run time to load the named module before
executing the simulation. The system.vpi module is loaded by
default, but additional modules, including modules that <br>
you compiled locally, can be specified with this flag. Any
number of modules can be loaded, and they will be linked in
the order they are listed on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, you only need to
specify the name of the module, without any directory path
or .vpi suffix and the search path is scanned to find the
module. However, if the <br>
name includes at least one directory character, then the
search path is not scanned and the name is assumed to be a
complete file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n This flag makes $stop or a
&lt;Control-C&gt; a synonym for $finish. It can be used to
give the program a more meaningful interface when running in
a non-interactive environ&acirc; <br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N This flag does the same thing
as -n, but results in an exit code of 1 if the stimulation
calls $stop. It can be used to indicate a simulation failure
when running a <br>
testbench.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Stop. This will cause the
simulation to stop in the beginning, before any events are
scheduled. This allows the interactive user to get hold of
the simulation just before <br>
it starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Turn on verbose messages.
This will cause information about run time progress to be
printed to standard out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version of the
runtime, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED ARGUMENTS <br>
The vvp options described above must come before the design
file name. After the design file name, however, there may be
any number of unspecified arguments. These arguments are
<br>
not interpreted by vvp but are instead passed on to the
executed design, and are available via the $test$plusargs
and $value$plusargs system functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments that do not start with
the plus(+) character are not available to the $plusargs
system tasks, but can still be accessed via PLI code via the
vpi_get_vlog_info function. <br>
This means that vpi modules may use arguments that do not
start with + and be assured that they do not interfere with
user defined plus-args.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a few extended
arguments that are interpreted by the standard system.vpi
module, which implements the standard system tasks and are
always included. These arguments are <br>
described here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vcd This extended argument sets
the wave dump format to VCD. This is the default in the
absence of any IVERILOG_DUMPER environment variable. The VCD
dump files are large and <br>
ponderous, but are also maximally compatible with third
party tools that read waveform dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lxt|-lxt-speed|-lxt-space <br>
These extended arguments set the wave dump format to lxt,
possibly with format optimizations. The -lxt-space flag sets
the output format to lxt with full compression <br>
enabled. The resulting files are quite small. The -lxt-speed
chooses the lxt compression mode that leads to the best
execution time and the fastest read time, at the <br>
expense of some file size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lxt2|-lxt2-speed|-lxt2-space
<br>
-lx2|-lx2-speed|-lx2-space <br>
The LXT2 format is slower than LXT but usually takes less
space, and is written out incrementally. Thus, you can view
lxt2 files while a simulation is still running (or <br>
paused) or if your simulation crashes or is killed, you
still have a useful dump. The -lxt2-speed or -lx2-speed
arguments are the same as -lxt2 or -lx2. The -lxt2-space
<br>
or -lx2-space arguments enable better compression and turn
off incremental writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fst|-fst-speed|-fst-space <br>
-fst-space-speed|-fst-speed-space <br>
This is a modern dumping format that is both faster and more
compact than the other dumping formats. It supports
incremental dumping just like -lxt2. The -fst-speed
argu&acirc; <br>
ment uses a faster compression methods that creates a
noticeably larger output file. The -fst-space argument
performs a repack of the file on close to produce the
small&acirc; <br>
est possible dump file. The -fst-space-speed or
-fst-speed-space arguments use the faster compression method
and repack the file on close.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-none This flag can be used by
itself or appended to the end of the above dumpers
(vcd/lxt/lxt2/lx2/fst) to suppress all waveform output. This
can make long simulations run <br>
faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sdf-warn <br>
When loading an SDF annotation file, this option causes the
annotator to print warnings for questionable but non-fatal
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sdf-info <br>
When loading an SDF annotation file, this option causes the
annotator to print information about the annotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sdf-verbose <br>
This is shorthand for -sdf-info -sdf-warn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compatible <br>
This extended argument enables improved compatibility with
other simulators. At present this only affects the display
format for real numbers when no format string is <br>
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The vvp command also accepts some environment variables that
control its behavior. These can be used to make
semi-permanent changes.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">IVERILOG_DUMPER=fst|lxt|lxt2|lx2|vcd|none
<br>
This selects the output format for the waveform output.
Normally, waveforms are dumped in vcd format, but this
variable can be used to select lxt format, which is far <br>
more compact, though limited to GTKWave or compatible
viewers. It can also be used to suppress VCD output, a
time-saver for regression tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE MODE <br>
The simulation engine supports an interactive mode. The user
may interrupt the simulation (typically by typing
&lt;Control-C&gt;) to get to the interactive prompt. From
that prompt, <br>
the help command prints a brief summary of the available
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interactive mode may also be
entered by a call to the $stop system task from within the
simulation, or by a call to the vpi_control VPI function
with the vpiStop control <br>
argument. These means of entering interactive mode are
equivalent.</p>
