<p>PERL584DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL584DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl584delta - what is new for perl v5.8.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.3
release and the 5.8.4 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
Many minor bugs have been fixed. Scripts which happen to
rely on previously erroneous behaviour will consider these
fixes as incompatible changes :-) You are advised to perform
<br>
sufficient acceptance testing on this release to satisfy
yourself that this does not affect you, before putting this
release into production.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The diagnostic output of Carp
has been changed slightly, to add a space after the comma
between arguments. This makes it much easier for tools such
as web browsers to wrap it, <br>
but might confuse any automatic tools which perform detailed
parsing of Carp output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The internal dump output has
been improved, so that non-printable characters such as
newline and backspace are output in &quot;otation, rather
than octal. This might just confuse <br>
non-robust tools which parse the output of modules such as
Devel::Peek.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Malloc wrapping <br>
Perl can now be built to detect attempts to assign
pathologically large chunks of memory. Previously such
assignments would suffer from integer wrap-around during
size <br>
calculations causing a misallocation, which would crash
perl, and could theoretically be used for &quot;stack
smashing&quot; attacks. The wrapping defaults to enabled on
platforms where <br>
we know it works (most AIX configurations, BSDi, Darwin, DEC
OSF/1, FreeBSD, HP/UX, GNU Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris, VMS and
most Win32 compilers) and defaults to disabled on other <br>
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode Character Database 4.0.1
<br>
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl
5.8 has been updated to 4.0.1 from 4.0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suidperl less insecure <br>
Paul Szabo has analysed and patched &quot;suidperl&quot; to
remove existing known insecurities. Currently there are no
known holes in &quot;suidperl&quot;, but previous experience
shows that we <br>
cannot be confident that these were the last. You may no
longer invoke the set uid perl directly, so to preserve
backwards compatibility with scripts that invoke <br>
#!/usr/bin/suidperl the only set uid binary is now
&quot;sperl5.8.&quot;n (&quot;sperl5.8.4&quot; for this
release). &quot;suidperl&quot; is installed as a hard link
to &quot;perl&quot;; both &quot;suidperl&quot; and
&quot;perl&quot; will <br>
invoke &quot;sperl5.8.4&quot; automatically the set uid
binary, so this change should be completely transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For new projects the core perl
team would strongly recommend that you use dedicated, single
purpose security tools such as &quot;sudo&quot; in
preference to &quot;suidperl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format <br>
In addition to bug fixes, &quot;format&quot;&rsquo;s
features have been enhanced. See perlform</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
The (mis)use of &quot;/tmp&quot; in core modules and
documentation has been tidied up. Some modules available
both within the perl core and independently from CPAN
(&quot;dual-life modules&quot;) <br>
have not yet had these changes applied; the changes will be
integrated into future stable perl releases as the modules
are updated on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated modules <br>
Attribute::Handlers <br>
B <br>
Benchmark <br>
CGI <br>
Carp <br>
Cwd <br>
Exporter <br>
File::Find <br>
IO <br>
IPC::Open3 <br>
Local::Maketext <br>
Math::BigFloat <br>
Math::BigInt <br>
Math::BigRat <br>
MIME::Base64 <br>
ODBM_File <br>
POSIX <br>
Shell <br>
Socket <br>
There is experimental support for Linux abstract Unix domain
sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Storable <br>
Switch <br>
Synced with its CPAN version 2.10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sys::Syslog <br>
&quot;syslog()&quot; can now use numeric constants for
facility names and priorities, in addition to strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Term::ANSIColor <br>
Time::HiRes <br>
Unicode::UCD <br>
Win32 <br>
Win32.pm/Win32.xs has moved from the libwin32 module to core
Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base <br>
open <br>
threads <br>
Detached threads are now also supported on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Enhancements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Accelerated Unicode case mappings
(&quot;/i&quot;, &quot;lc&quot;, &quot;uc&quot;, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In place sort
optimised (eg &quot;@a = sort @a&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unnecessary
assignment optimised away in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $s = undef; <br>
my @a = (); <br>
my %h = ();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Optimised
&quot;map&quot; in scalar context</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
The Perl debugger (lib/perl5db.pl) can now save all debugger
commands for sourcing later, and can display the parent
inheritance tree of a given class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
The build process on both VMS and Windows has had several
minor improvements made. On Windows Borland&rsquo;s C
compiler can now compile perl with PerlIO and/or
USE_LARGE_FILES <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perl.exe&quot; on Windows
now has a &quot;Camel&quot; logo icon. The use of a camel
with the topic of Perl is a trademark of O&rsquo;Reilly and
Associates Inc., and is used with their permission (ie <br>
distribution of the source, compiling a Windows executable
from it, and using that executable locally). Use of the
supplied camel for anything other than a perl
executable&rsquo;s icon <br>
is specifically not covered, and anyone wishing to
redistribute perl binaries with the icon should check
directly with O&rsquo;Reilly beforehand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl should build cleanly on
Stratus VOS once more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
More utf8 bugs fixed, notably in how &quot;chomp&quot;,
&quot;chop&quot;, &quot;send&quot;, and &quot;syswrite&quot;
and interact with utf8 data. Concatenation now works
correctly when &quot;use bytes;&quot; is in scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pragmata are now correctly
propagated into (?{...}) constructions in regexps. Code such
as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x = qr{ ... (??{ $x }) ...
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will now (correctly) fail under
use strict. (As the inner $x is and has always referred to
$::x)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;const in void
context&quot; warning has been suppressed for a constant in
an optimised-away boolean expression such as &quot;5 ||
print;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perl -i&quot; could
&quot;fchmod(stdin)&quot; by mistake. This is serious if
stdin is attached to a terminal, and perl is running as
root. Now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New or Changed Diagnostics <br>
&quot;Carp&quot; and the internal diagnostic routines used
by &quot;Devel::Peek&quot; have been made clearer, as
described in &quot;Incompatible Changes&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed Internals <br>
Some bugs have been fixed in the hash internals. Restricted
hashes and their place holders are now allocated and deleted
at slightly different times, but this should not be <br>
visible to user code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Future Directions <br>
Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.5) will be
on 30th June 2004, with release by mid July.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Problems <br>
This release is known not to build on Windows 95.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org.
There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org, the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
<br>
http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
