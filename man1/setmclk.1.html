<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
setmclk - adjust the memory timing of certain Cirrus
cards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
setmclk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program sets the memory clock of Cirrus 5424/26/28
cards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first three values could be
set by utility programs that came with my card (AVGA3), but
somewhat higher values seem to work (on my card at least).
It may be that better and <br>
more recent Cirrus cards use a higher value as boot-up
default. It should depend on DRAM speed, but it seems to be
more dependant on the card logic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I have the impression that many
Cirrus 542x cards suffer from horrible BIOS version/DRAM
timing misconfigurations. Perhaps even some versions of
MS-Windows drivers change the <br>
MCLK register. In any case, the boot-up BIOS default (0x1c)
may be inappropriately low for the type of DRAM timing most
cards use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a higher memory clock
gives a very significant performance improvement; with high
dot clock modes (like 640x480x16M or 1150x900x256)
performance can be more than twice that <br>
of the standard 50 MHz clock. This goes for both (VLB)
framebuffer access and accelerated features (bitblt). This
also helps XFree86 server performance, but only if the
XFree86 <br>
Cirrus driver doesn&rsquo;t set the memory clock register
(it should work for XFree86 1.3 and 2.0). Use at your own
risk!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the dot clock is
something entirely different. There does not seem to be much
correlation between the two (i.e. if a high dot clock gives
screen problems, using a high <br>
memory clock is not likely to fix it, other than improving
speed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual memory clock is hard
compiled into the program. It defaults to 0x1c. You can
change this value and some suggestiong come in th source of
the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is part of svgalib
and can be found in the utils/ subdirectory of the original
svgalib distribution. However, it is not installed by
default, s.t. it is unclear <br>
where you can find it if your svgalib was install linux
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of any such problem,
simply get an svgalib distribution from the net. You
don&rsquo;t need to install it. Just make in the utils/
subdirecty. As of this writing, <br>
svgalib-1.2.12.tar.gz is the latest version and can be
retrieved by ftp from sunsite.unc.edu at
/pub/Linux/libs/graphics and tsx-11.mit.edu at
/pub/linux/sources/libs which will <br>
most probably be mirrored by a site close to you.</p>

This manual page was edited by Michael Weller

the referenced utility as well as of the original
documentation is unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is very likely that both are
at least to some extent are due to Harm Hanemaayer
&lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Occasionally this might be
wrong. I hereby asked to be excused by the original author
and will happily accept any additions or corrections to this
first version of the svgalib <br>
manual.</p>
