This program sets the <b>memory clock</b> of Cirrus 5424/26/28 cards.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first three values could be set by utility programs that came with my card
  (AVGA3), but somewhat higher values seem to work (on my card at least). It may
  be that better and more recent Cirrus cards use a higher value as boot-up
  default. It should depend on DRAM speed, but it seems to be more dependant on
  the card logic.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
I have the impression that many Cirrus 542x cards suffer from horrible BIOS
  version/DRAM timing misconfigurations. Perhaps even some versions of
  MS-Windows drivers change the MCLK register. In any case, the boot-up BIOS
  default (0x1c) may be inappropriately low for the type of DRAM timing most
  cards use.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Using a higher memory clock gives a very significant performance improvement;
  with high dot clock modes (like 640x480x16M or 1150x900x256) performance can
  be more than twice that of the standard 50 MHz clock. This goes for both (VLB)
  framebuffer access and accelerated features (bitblt). This also helps XFree86
  server performance, but only if the XFree86 Cirrus driver doesn't set the
  memory clock register (it should work for XFree86 1.3 and 2.0). Use at your
  own risk!
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the <b>dot clock</b> is something entirely different. There does not
  seem to be much correlation between the two (i.e. if a high dot clock gives
  screen problems, using a high memory clock is not likely to fix it, other than
  improving speed).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The actual <b>memory clock</b> is hard compiled into the program. It defaults to
  0x1c. You can change this value and some suggestiong come in th source of the
  utility.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This utility is part of svgalib and can be found in the <i>utils/</i>
  subdirectory of the original svgalib distribution. However, it is not
  installed by default, s.t. it is unclear where you can find it if your svgalib
  was install linux distribution.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In case of any such problem, simply get an svgalib distribution from the net.
  You don't need to install it. Just <b>make</b> in the <i>utils/</i>
  subdirecty. As of this writing, <i>svgalib-1.2.12.tar.gz</i> is the latest
  version and can be retrieved by ftp from <i>sunsite.unc.edu</i> at
  <i>/pub/Linux/libs/graphics</i> and <i>tsx-11.mit.edu</i> at
  <i>/pub/linux/sources/libs</i> which will most probably be mirrored by a site
  close to you.

This manual page was edited by Michael Weller

  utility as well as of the original documentation is unknown.

It is very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm

Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to be excused by the original
