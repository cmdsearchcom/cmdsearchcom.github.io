By default, the <i>du</i> utility shall write to standard output the size of the
  file space allocated to, and the size of the file space allocated to each
  subdirectory of, the file hierarchy rooted in each of the specified files. By
  default, when a symbolic link is encountered on the command line or in the
  file hierarchy, <i>du</i> shall count the size of the symbolic link (rather
  than the file referenced by the link), and shall not follow the link to
  another portion of the file hierarchy. The size of the file space allocated to
  a file of type directory shall be defined as the sum total of space allocated
  to all files in the file hierarchy rooted in the directory plus the space
  allocated to the directory itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <i>du</i> cannot <i>stat</i>() files or <i>stat</i>() or read directories,
  it shall report an error condition and the final exit status is affected.
  Files with multiple links shall be counted and written for only one entry. The
  directory entry that is selected in the report is unspecified. By default,
  file sizes shall be written in 512-byte units, rounded up to the next 512-byte
  unit.

The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and maintains compatibility
  with <i>ls</i> and other utilities in this volume of POSIX.1&#x2010;2008. This
  does not mandate that the file system itself be based on 512-byte blocks. The
  <b>&#x2212;k</b> option was added as a compromise measure. It was agreed by
  the standard developers that 512 bytes was the best default unit because of
  its complete historical consistency on System V ( <i>versus</i> the mixed
  512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a <b>&#x2212;k</b> option to
  switch to 1024-byte units was a good compromise. Users who prefer the
  1024-byte quantity can easily alias <i>du</i> to <i>du</i> <b>&#x2212;k</b>
  without breaking the many historical scripts relying on the 512-byte units.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>&#x2212;b</b> option was added to an early proposal to provide a
  resolution to the situation where System V and BSD systems give figures for
  file sizes in <i>blocks</i>, which is an implementation-defined concept. (In
  common usage, the block size is 512 bytes for System V and 1024 bytes for BSD
  systems.) However, <b>&#x2212;b</b> was later deleted, since the default was
  eventually decided as 512-byte units.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Historical file systems provided no way to obtain exact figures for the space
  allocation given to files. There are two known areas of inaccuracies in
  historical file systems: cases of <i>indirect blocks</i> being used by the
  file system or <i>sparse</i> files yielding incorrectly high values. An
  indirect block is space used by the file system in the storage of the file,
  but that need not be counted in the space allocated to the file. A
  <i>sparse</i> file is one in which an <i>lseek</i>() call has been made to a
  position beyond the end of the file and data has subsequently been written at
  that point. A file system need not allocate all the intervening zero-filled
  blocks to such a file. It is up to the implementation to define exactly how
  accurate its methods are.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>&#x2212;a</b> and <b>&#x2212;s</b> options were mutually-exclusive in the
  original version of <i>du</i>. The POSIX Shell and Utilities description is
  implied by the language in the SVID where <b>&#x2212;s</b> is described as
  causing ``only the grand total'' to be reported. Some systems may produce
  output for <b>&#x2212;sa</b>, but a Strictly Conforming POSIX Shell and
  Utilities Application cannot use that combination.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>&#x2212;a</b> and <b>&#x2212;s</b> options were adopted from the SVID
  except that the System V behavior of not listing non-directories explicitly
  given as operands, unless the <b>&#x2212;a</b> option is specified, was
  considered a bug; the BSD-based behavior (report for all operands) is
  mandated. The default behavior of <i>du</i> in the SVID with regard to
  reporting the failure to read files (it produces no messages) was considered
  counter-intuitive, and thus it was specified that the POSIX Shell and
  Utilities default behavior shall be to produce such messages. These messages
  can be turned off with shell redirection to achieve the System V behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>&#x2212;x</b> option is historical practice on recent BSD systems. It has
  been adopted by this volume of POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 because there was no other
  historical method of limiting the <i>du</i> search to a single file hierarchy.
  This limitation of the search is necessary to make it possible to obtain file
  space usage information about a file system on which other file systems are
  mounted, without having to resort to a lengthy <i>find</i> and <i>awk</i>
  script.
