<p>XKBEVD(1) General Commands Manual XKBEVD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xkbevd - XKB event daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xkbevd [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This command is very raw and is therefore only partially
implemented; we present it here as a rough prototype for
developers, not as a general purpose tool for end users.
Some&acirc; <br>
thing like this might make a suitable replacement for xev;
I&rsquo;m not signing up, mind you, but it&rsquo;s an
interesting idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xkbevd event daemon listens
for specified XKB events and executes requested commands if
they occur. The configuration file consists of a list of
event specification/action <br>
pairs and/or variable definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An event specification consists
of a short XKB event name followed by a string or identifier
which serves as a qualifier in parentheses; empty
parenthesis indicate no qualifica&acirc; <br>
tion and serve to specify the default command which is
applied to events which do not match any of the other
specifications. The interpretation of the qualifier depends
on the <br>
type of the event: Bell events match using the name of the
bell, message events match on the contents of the message
string and slow key events accept any of press, release,
<br>
accept, or reject. No other events are currently
recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An action consists of an
optional keyword followed by an optional string argument.
Currently, xkbev recognizes the actions: none, ignore, echo,
printEvent, sound, and shell. If <br>
the action is not specified, the string is taken as the name
of a sound file to be played unless it begins with an
exclamation point, in which case it is taken as a shell
com&acirc; <br>
mand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable definitions in the
argument string are expanded with fields from the event in
question before the argument string is passed to the action
processor. The general syntax <br>
for a variable is either $cP or $(str), where c is a single
character and str is a string of arbitrary length. All
parameters have both single-character and long names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of recognized
parameters varies from event to event and is too long to
list here right now. This is a developer release anyway, so
you can be expected to look at the <br>
source code (evargs.c is of particular interest).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ignore, echo, printEvent,
sound,and shell actions do what you would expect commands
named ignore, echo, printEvent, sound, and shell to do,
except that the sound command has <br>
only been implemented and tested for SGI machines. It
launches an external program right now, so it should be
pretty easy to adapt, especially if you like audio cues that
<br>
arrive about a half-second after you expect them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only currently recognized
variables are soundDirectory and soundCmd. I&rsquo;m sure
you can figure out what they do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help Prints a usage message that is far more up-to-date
than anything in this man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cfg file <br>
Specifies the configuration file to read. If no
configuration file is specified, xkbevd looks for
~/.xkb/xkbevd.cf and $(LIBDIR)/xkb/xkbevd.cf in that
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sc cmd Specifies the command
used to play sounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sd directory <br>
Specifies a top-level directory for sound files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display <br>
Specifies the display to use. If not present, xkbevd uses
$DISPLAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bg Tells xkbevd to fork itself
(and run in the background).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-synch Forces synchronization of
all X requests. Slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print more information,
including debugging messages. Multiple specifications of -v
cause more output, to a point.</p>
