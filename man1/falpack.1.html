<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
falpack - The falcon application packaging tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
falpak [options] main_script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The falpack command line tool is meant to copy all the
modules and other dependencies needed for a standalone
falcon application to run into a target directory. Falpack
can copy <br>
also the system files needed to run the application, making
the final application totally stand-alone, or just store the
needed modules so that a local falcon installation can be
<br>
used to run the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">falpack searches for special
attributes in the parsed modules to store resources data
files that an application may require. It copies also needed
internationalization transla&acirc; <br>
tion tables, and eventually compiles sources into binary
.fam modules. It can also remove sources from the final
installation, so that pre-compiled applications only can be
<br>
shipped. Finally, it creates a script that can be used to
run the application with a &quot;single click&quot;
operation on the host platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System relevant modules (as i.e.
feathers or system-wide installed modules) are also stored
together with the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anyhow, installation of falcon
system files (which include feather modules) is
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System files are copied into a
fake root subdirectory (normally called _system ). All the
modules not lying under the same directory of the
application &quot;main script&quot; or in deeper <br>
trees, are considered &quot;system-wide&quot; installed, and
it is supposed that the script access them via -L option or
via FALCON_LOAD_PATH environment variable. They are then
stored in <br>
the system directory and a directory tree is re-created so
that the simple addition of the fake root to the load path
(i.e. &quot;falcon -L _system&quot;) is enough to access all
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method allows the
application to access modules by logical name and by
filename, as the filename is made relative to the load path.
However, modules loaded with absolute <br>
filenames must be separately installed on the target system
so that their position matches the required absolute
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b &lt;module&gt; <br>
Blacklists this module (by module name). Using this option
it is possible to prevent default action on the given module
(copy into the application tree or the fake root <br>
tree). It is possible to specify more blacklisted modules
repeating this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bin &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Specify directory where falcon binary resides. Useful if
falpack is required to read an interpreter from a
non-default installation, or if it can&rsquo;t find it.
NOTE: falpack <br>
uses falcon build environment settings. If used under the
build environment, it will copy files from the active build
tree ignoring system wide installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;enc&gt; <br>
Source files encoding. In case the source file text encoding
is different from the system default encoding, the module
loader may detect syntax errors or fail to load the <br>
sources; also, if .fam generation is required, the strings
in the pre-compiled modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Usage help. A short in-line
summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lib &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Specify directory where falcon engine dynamic link library
resides. Useful if falpack is required to read an
interpreter from a non-default installation, or if it
can&rsquo;t <br>
find it. NOTE: falpack uses falcon build environment
settings. If used under the build environment, it will copy
files from the active build tree ignoring system wide <br>
installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Redefine FALCON_LOAD_PATH. In case the main module needs a
special load path which is not the system default or the one
stored in the FALCON_LOAD_PATH environment vari&acirc; <br>
able. Notice that this setting overwrites system and
environment variable settings. Also, notice that this load
path is intended for local loading and compiling of the <br>
modules in the application; the modules are then arranged so
that this setting is not needed in the final
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Pack also pre-compiled
modules. If given, this option will cause .fam modules to be
stored beside their source files (.fal or .ftd). It is
incompatible with the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Save the package in this directory. By default, the package
is stored in a directory with the same name of the main
module (its extension stripped), under the current work <br>
directory. This option overrides the default and allows to
store the package at an arbitrary location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;name&gt; <br>
Install &lt;name&gt; instead of &quot;falcon&quot; as
interpreter. Useful in case only pre-compiled modules are
packaged, where falrun may be employed, or in case of
special system-spe&acirc; <br>
cific interpreter build, as with sdl_falcon MacOSX framework
compatible interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Change fake root for system data into &lt;dir&gt;. If the
default name for storage of system specific apparels (as
binary modules, falcon engine library etc.), which is
&quot;_sys&acirc; <br>
tem&quot;, is not satisfactory, it can be overridden through
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Strip sources. Using this
option, source falcon files are not copied in the package;
only the pre-compiled bytecode .fam modules are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Do not store system files.
Prevent copying of the falcon interpreter, falcon engine
dynamic library and feather modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Verbose mode. Prints verbose
messages of what falpack is doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES <br>
falpack automatically packages needed ancillary files
required by modules, as the translation table files (.ftr).
However, the modules may specify other files to be included
<br>
through a set of special attributes which are interpreted by
falpack as it loads and analyzes them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resources <br>
This attribute can indicate a list of resources that should
be copied together with the module. The attribute needs to
be a string, and different resources can be sepa&acirc; <br>
rated through a semi comma (;). It is possible also to
specify file masks using the &quot;*.ext&quot; pattern;
whole subdirectories can be stored using the
&quot;dir/*&quot; pattern. Please, <br>
notice that this attribute doesn&rsquo;t work recursively;
to include sub-directories in resource directories, specify
all of them. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resources: &quot;images/*;
images/icons/*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plugins <br>
Similar to the resources attribute, the plugins attribute
indicates a single module or a directory containing more
modules that may be used by the applications as dynamic <br>
plugins. Differently from the data considered in the
resources attribute, the files indicated in the plugins
attribute are loaded by the loader, and their dependencies,
if <br>
any, are further resolved and become part of the installed
application. Also, they are treated as any other module in
any respect; for example associated translation files <br>
are copied, and in case falpack is required to strip
sources, only the pre-compiled fam modules will be
saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to store all the
modules found in a certain directory using the &quot;*&quot;
wildcard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly to the resources
attribute, the plugin attribute doesn&rsquo;t descend
recursively in sub-directories; to include other modules
laying below the required directory, <br>
that subdirectory must be explicitly specified, as in this
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plugins: &quot;output/*;
output/helpers/*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dynlib <br>
This attribute stores one or more system dynamic library
needed for the falcon module to run. Depending on the host
system, the target location may be in the fake root <br>
directory or besides the module (depending on how the system
module loader tries to find the modules). More dependencies
may be separated with a semi comma (;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Relative paths are not jailed; if the resource attribute or
the relative path of a loaded module indicates a position
above the main script directory or above any position in the
<br>
FALCON_LOAD_PATH specification, the files may be copied
outside the target package location. Be careful when writing
the application you want to package so that all the needed
<br>
files can be reached at the same level or below the main
script, or at the same level or below directories in the
load path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the moment, it&rsquo;s quite
complex to create cross platform packages (except for
script-only applications which use local falcon installation
to run). It is planned to provide <br>
this support in future via the ability to download
pre-compiled modules from a central repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this version, dynlib
attribute is not working for MacOSX style framework
libraries. However, it will work for MacOSX dylib that can
be found via the ldd command.</p>
