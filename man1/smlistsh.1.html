<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smlistsh - shared-memory linked list test shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
smlistsh partition_size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
smlistsh attaches to a region of system memory (allocating
it if necessary, and placing it under PSM management as
necessary) and offers the user an interactive
&quot;shell&quot; for <br>
testing various shared-memory linked list management
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smlistsh prints a prompt string
(&quot;: &quot;) to stdout, accepts a command from stdin,
executes the command (possibly printing a diagnostic
message), then prints another prompt string <br>
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h The help command. Causes
smlistsh to print a summary of available commands. Same
effect as the ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Another help command. Causes
smlistsh to print a summary of available commands. Same
effect as the h command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k The key command. Computes and
prints an unused shared-memory key, for possible use in
attaching to a shared-memory region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ key_value size <br>
The attach command. Attaches smlistsh to a region of shared
memory. key_value identifies an existing shared-memory
region, in the event that you want to attach to an <br>
existing shared-memory region (possibly created by another
smlistsh process running on the same computer). To create
and attach to a new shared-memory region that other <br>
processes can attach to, use a key_value as returned by the
key command and supply the size of the new region. If you
want to create and attach to a new shared-memory region <br>
that is for strictly private use, use -1 as key and supply
the size of the new region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The detach command. Detaches
smlistsh from the region of shared memory it is currently
using, but does not free any memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n The new command. Creates a new
shared-memory list to operate on, within the currently
attached shared-memory region. Prints the address of the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s list_address <br>
The share command. Selects an existing shared-memory list to
operate on, within the currently attached shared-memory
region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a element_value <br>
The append command. Appends a new list element, containing
element_value, to the list on which smlistsh is currently
operating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p element_value <br>
The prepend command. Prepends a new list element, containing
element_value, to the list on which smlistsh is currently
operating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w The walk command. Prints the
addresses and contents of all elements of the list on which
smlistsh is currently operating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f element_value <br>
The find command. Finds the list element that contains
element_value, within the list on which smlistsh is
currently operating, and prints the address of that list
element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d element_address <br>
The delete command. Deletes the list element located at
element_address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r The report command. Prints a
partition usage report, as per psm_report(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q The quit command. Detaches
smlistsh from the region of shared memory it is currently
using (without freeing any memory) and terminates
smlistsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; smlistsh has terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
No configuration files are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
No diagnostics apply.</p>
