<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
clirr - Check source and binary compatibility of Java
libraries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
clirr -o oldjar -n newjar [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Clirr is a tool that checks Java libraries for binary and
source compatibility with older releases. Basically you give
it two sets of jar files and Clirr dumps out a list of <br>
changes in the public API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MESSAGES <br>
When clirr generates an ERROR, WARNING or INFO message about
a change in the jars being compared, there is an associated
message reference code. This manual contains an
explana&acirc; <br>
tion of the meaning of that message which may contain
information which could not be fitted into the brief message
summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages are separated into
three severity levels: ERROR, WARNING and INFO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errors come in two flavours:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link-time failures, where an
exception will be thrown as soon as code compiled against an
old version of a class and the new version of the class are
loaded into the same <br>
classloader hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run-time failures, where an
exception is thrown when code compiled against the old
version of a class attempts to call a method on a new
version of the class, or vice <br>
versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clirr reports &quot;errors&quot;
for cases where it is possible to get a run-time failure.
Whether one actually occurs can depend upon the way the
library is called, i.e. changes reported <br>
as an error may in fact work when used as long as the
patterns of use of the library do not trigger the failure
situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings are issued for
situations where no link or runtime exception will occur,
but where the application may behave unexpectedly due to the
changes that have occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information messages provide
users with information about new features which have been
added without breaking backward compatibility in any
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using clirr to report on
changes to items which have private or package scope, these
changes are always reported as INFO level changes, never
WARNING or ERROR level. This <br>
allows users of clirr to generate &quot;change reports&quot;
at a level suitable for developers without having some of
those changes marked (irrelevantly) as binary
incompatibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There can never be binary
incompatibilities for changes to private classes, methods or
fields as that access can only occur from within the same
class (i.e. the same compilation <br>
unit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clirr does not report binary
incompatibility WARNINGs or ERRORs for package-scoped items
either, because Java packages are intended to be
&quot;release units&quot;, i.e. all classes within <br>
a package are compiled together (ensuring compatibility)
then released as a unit. The only time that package-scope
incompatibilities could possibly be an issue is when users
of a <br>
library write their own classes using a package declaration
belonging to some external library, or when a subset of
updated classes (e.g. a single class) from a package is used
<br>
to override certain classes from a previous release of the
library. Both of these situations are considered very poor
practice by Java programming convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following sections, the
term &quot;old&quot; is used to refer to a class, interface,
method or field from the set of jars which represent the
old/previous/original/baseline version <br>
of the library being inspected. The term &quot;new&quot; is
used to refer to a class, interface, method or field from
the set of jars which represent the new/current/latest
version of the <br>
library being inspected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following sections, the
term &quot;type&quot; is used to refer to something which
may be either a class or interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1000 - Increased visibility of
class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified type exists in
both versions, but its declared access specifier has changed
to relax restrictions on what other code can access it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Top-level types (ie those which
are not nested within another class) may only have
&quot;package&quot; or &quot;public&quot; accessibility.
Nested types can take on any of the four available <br>
accessibility values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of whether the object
is top-level or nested, a change in accessibility from
left-to-right of the sequence
private-&gt;package-&gt;protected-&gt;public always ensures
<br>
that all code which could previously access that type can
still access that type. Therefore such a change is always
binary and source-code compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the declaration
&quot;protected&quot; provides access to both code derived
from the type and to code within the same package, ie
&quot;protected&quot; accessibility also implies <br>
package accessibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1001 - Decreased visibility of
class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified type exists in
both versions, but its declared access specifier has changed
to tighten the restrictions on what other code may access
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Top-level types (ie those which
are not nested within another class) may only have
&quot;package&quot; or &quot;public&quot; accessibility.
Nested types can take on any of the four available <br>
accessibility values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of whether the type
is top-level or nested, a change in accessibility from
left-to-right of the sequence
public-&gt;protected-&gt;package-&gt;private may cause
existing <br>
code which could previously access the type to no longer be
able to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section 13.4.3 of the Java
Language Specification states explicitly that an
IllegalAccessError should occur if a pre-existing binary
tries to access a type when the type <br>
accessibility has been changed to something that would cause
a compile-time error. However this does not appear to be
enforced in practice, at least in current JVMs. Nev&acirc;
<br>
ertheless this should be an error, and so clirr reports this
change as a binary-compatibility ERROR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2000 - Changed from class to
interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified class has become
an interface in the new version. This change is always a
binary and source-code incompatibility, for obvious
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2001 - Changed from interface to
class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified interface has
become an class in the new version. This change is always a
binary and source-code incompatibility, for obvious
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3001 - Removed final modifier
from class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified class was declared
final in the old version, but is no longer final in the new
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3002 - Added final modifier to
effectively final class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified class was not
declared final in the old version, but is now declared
final. Normally, this would be an incompatibility because
pre-existing derived classes <br>
would no longer be valid when used with the new version of
this class. However in this case the old class version had
no public or protected constructors, so it was not <br>
possible for any derived classes to exist even for the old
version of the library. Changing such a class to final
therefore can not break any existing code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3003 - Added final modifier to
class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified class was not
declared final in the old version, but is now declared
final. Any pre-existing classes which were declared as
subclasses of this class will <br>
therefore not be valid with the new version of the
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A VerifyError is thrown by the
classloader when an attempt is made to load a subclass of a
final class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a class Y is loaded by
the standard classloader only when the first attempt is made
to create an instance of Y, or to directly reference the
Class object for <br>
class Y. If some other class X has class Y as a declared
member, or as a parameter to some method, then loading class
X does not cause class Y to be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3004 - Removed abstract modifier
from class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old version of this class
was declared to be an abstract class. The new version is not
abstract, allowing users to create instances of the
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3005 - Added abstract modifier
to class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old version of this class
was not declared to be abstract. The new version is
abstract. Pre-existing code which creates instances of this
class is no longer valid with <br>
the new version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4000 - Added interface to the
set of implemented interfaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new version of the type now
implements an additional interface. This does not invalidate
any existing code (source or binary), and is a completely
backward-compatible <br>
change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this message can be
reported without any change occurring in the specified type;
a change to the set of interfaces supported by a type will
cause this message to <br>
be reported for every descendant of that type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4001 - Removed interface from
the set of implemented interfaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old version of this type
declared that it implemented an interface which the new
class or interface does not. Existing code which explicitly
or implicitly casts <br>
objects of this type to the now missing interface is no
longer valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this message can be
reported without any change occurring in the specified type;
a change to the set of interfaces supported by a type will
cause this message to <br>
be reported for every descendant of that type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5000 - Added class to the set of
superclasses</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO or WARNING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new version of the class has
a class in its inheritance hierarchy which the old version
did not, either because its direct parent is now a different
class, or because <br>
one of its parent classes has changed its inheritance
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the specified class has
java.lang.Throwable as an ancestor, then this change is
reported as a WARNING, because this class change may change
the exception-catching be&acirc; <br>
haviour of programs that use this class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this message can be
reported without any change occurring in the specified
class; a change to the set of superclasses of an ancestor
class will cause this mes&acirc; <br>
sage to be reported for every descendant class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5001 - Removed class from the
set of superclasses</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old version of this class
has a class in its inheritance hierarchy which the new
version does not, either because its direct parent is now a
different class, or <br>
because one of its parent classes has changed its
inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Existing code which explicitly
or implicitly casts objects of this type to the now missing
class type is no longer valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this message can be
reported without any change occurring in the specified
class; a change to the set of superclasses of an ancestor
class will cause this mes&acirc; <br>
sage to be reported for every descendent class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that if this class has
Throwable in its ancestry, then the class hierarchy change
can also cause changes in the exception-catching behaviour
of programs using <br>
this class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6000 - Added field</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new class has an additional
static or instance member. This change is completely
backwards-compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6001 - Removed field</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new class has removed a
field present in the old version. Pre-existing code which
directly accesses that field will no longer be valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6002 - Value of field no longer
a compile-time constant</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: WARNING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code compiled against the old
version of the class was permitted to &quot;inline&quot; the
value of this field because it was a compile-time constant.
Therefore, existing binary <br>
code will continue to use the old value of this field,
instead of the new value (which cannot be inlined).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6003 - Value of compile-time
constant has changed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: WARNING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code compiled against the old
version of the class was permitted to &quot;inline&quot; the
value of this field because it was a compile-time constant.
Therefore, existing binary <br>
code will continue to use the old value of this field,
instead of the new value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6004 - Field type changed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type associated with the
specified static or instance member of the specified class
has changed. Pre-existing code which directly accesses that
field may no longer be <br>
valid, and therefore this is an incompatible change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6005 - Field now non-final</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field was previously final,
and is no longer final. This means that the field value can
now be modified during the lifetime of the class or
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether a value in a field could
previously be &quot;inlined&quot; into other classes is an
issue addressed by messages 6002 and 6003, not this
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6006 - Field now final</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field can no longer be
modified during the lifetime of the class or instance. Code
which previously modified this field is therefore no longer
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6007 - Field now non-static</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field is now an instance
variable rather than a class variable. Code which previously
accessed this field via the Class rather than an instance of
the class is no <br>
longer valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6008 - Field now static</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field is now a class
variable rather than an instance variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some reason (presumably
internal implementation issues), the Java standard declares
that this change is not binary-compatible, and that an
IncompatibleClassChangeError <br>
will be thrown if code compiled against the &quot;old&quot;
version of a class is used together with a &quot;new&quot;
version for which a field is now static.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because source code is permitted
to access class variables via instances of that class, this
is expected to be a source-code compatible change. However
currently CLIRR <br>
reports this as an ERROR for source-code compatibility
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6009 - Field More Accessible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the new version, the
specified field is accessible to more code than it was
previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6010 - Field Less Accessible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the new version, the
specified field is accessible to less code than it was
previously. Therefore existing code may no longer be
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6011 - Removed Constant
Field</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary Severity: WARNING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new class has removed a
field present in the old version. Pre-existing source code
which directly accesses that field will no longer be
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previously, however, the field
was final and was initialised with a constant value.
Therefore code compiled against the previous version of the
class will have inlined <br>
this constant and will continue to work, using the previous
value of this field. A warning is issued as this is often
not desirable behaviour. However it is not a binary <br>
incompatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7000 - Method now in
Superclass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old class had a method named
X. The new class no longer has this method, but a parent
class does define this method, so no binary or source
incompatibility has <br>
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this change may have
the effect of forcing the new class to become
&rsquo;abstract&rsquo;. If this is the case, then this
change is reported separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7001 - Method now in
Interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old class or interface
previously had a method named X. The new class or interface
no longer has this method, but a parent interface does
define this method, so no <br>
binary or source incompatibility has occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this change may have
the effect of forcing the new class to become
&rsquo;abstract&rsquo;. If this is the case, then this
change is reported separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7002 - Method Removed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old class or interface had a
method named X. The new class or interface no longer has
this method, and this method is not defined on any parent
class or interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether an error actually occurs
at runtime for this change depends on usage patterns. The
modified class can be used with existing code as long as
that existing code does <br>
not attempt to call the removed method. If a call to the
missing method is made, then a NoSuchMethodError exception
is generated when the method invocation occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7003 - Method Overide
Removed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified method on the old
class or interface was overriding an inherited definition.
The new class or interface no longer has this method
explicitly declared on it, <br>
but it still inherits a definition so there is no binary
incompatibility. 7004 - Method Argument Count Changed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified method has had
arguments added or removed. This means that code which
previously invoked it will no longer invoke the same
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is an inherited method
definition with the old prototype, then there is no binary
incompatibility; code which was compiled against the old
version of this class <br>
will now invoke the inherited implementation. In this
situation, clirr should output an INFO message rather than
an error. However at the current date, clirr does not <br>
check for this situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no inherited method
definition with the old prototype, then the change is a
binary incompatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7005 - Method Argument Type
changed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary Severity: INFO or
ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified method has had the
type of one or more of its arguments modified. This means
that code compiled against the old version of the class will
no longer invoke <br>
the same method. However exactly the same old source code,
when compiled against the new class version may invoke this
method if the argument types are assignment-compati&acirc;
<br>
ble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is an inherited method
definition with the old prototype, then there is no binary
incompatibility; code which was compiled against the old
version of this class <br>
will now invoke the inherited implementation. At the current
date, clirr does not check for this situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no inherited method
definition with the old prototype, then the change is a
binary incompatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the parameter types changed
were all changed to supertypes of their previous declared
types, or for primitive parameter types if they were changed
to &quot;larger&quot; types in <br>
every case, then the new code is source-code-compatible with
the previous release even if it is not binary-compatible.
Note that in this situation, recompiling code which <br>
uses the library may change its behaviour from calling an
inherited method to calling a method on the class which has
a slightly different prototype. At the current date, <br>
clirr does not check for this situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7006 - Method Return Type
changed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source Severity: INFO or
ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified method has had its
declared return type changed. Whether a problem actually
occurs at runtime when using code compiled against the old
version of this <br>
library depends upon usage patterns. Old code may call other
methods on this class. However any attempt to call the
method whose return type has changed will result in a <br>
NoSuchMethodError being thrown when the method is invoked,
because the return type is part of the &quot;method
signature&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The change is
source-code-compatible if and only if the new return type is
assignable to the old return type. This means that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the old return type was a
primitive type, then the new return type must be narrower
than the old type. <br>
if the old return type was an interface, then the new return
type must be a class or interface which implements the old
return type. <br>
if the old return type was a class, then the new return type
must be a subclass of the previously returned type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clirr does not currently check
for source-code compatibility for changes in method return
types; currently these are simply reported as an ERROR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7007 - Method has been
Deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified method has been
declared as &quot;deprecated&quot;. This is always a
binary-compatible change as well as a source-code-compatible
change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7008 - Method has been
Undeprecated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified method was
declared &quot;deprecated&quot; in the previous version, but
is no longer deprecated in the current release. While
slightly unusual, this is permitted. This <br>
change is always a binary-compatible change as well as a
source-code-compatible change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7009 - Method is now Less
Accessible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access permissions
associated with the specified method have been tightened to
permit less user code to access the method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether this change is a
source-code compatibility issue or not depends upon patterns
of usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This change should be a binary
incompatibility. Note, however, that current JVMs do not
validate this. Code compiled against a previous version of a
class can successfully <br>
invoke methods for which they no longer have access rights.
Nevertheless, the Java Language Specification states that
this is an error, so clirr reports this change as a <br>
binary incompatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7010 - Method is now More
Accessible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access permissions
associated with the specified method have been loosened to
permit more user code to access the method. This is always a
binary and source-code com&acirc; <br>
patible change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7011 - Method Added</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A non-abstract method has been
added to the specified class. This is always a
binary-compatible change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also a source-code
compatible change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: if the new method overrides
an inherited one, then which version does code compiled
against the old library invoke?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7012 - Method Added to
Interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A method declaration has been
added to the specified interface. This is always reported as
a binary-compatibility error, but in practice the changed
class might be used <br>
successfully with code compiled against the old interface
depending upon usage patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old code which invokes methods
upon code compiled against the new (expanded) interface will
continue to work without issues. And old code which
implements the old version <br>
of the interface will also continue to work correctly as
long as no code attempts to invoke any of the newly-added
methods against that instance. But code which (validly) <br>
invokes one of the new methods in the interface against an
object which implements only the old version of the
interface will cause an AbstractMethodError to be thrown at
<br>
the time the method invocation is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding a method to an interface
is always reported as an ERROR, because classes that
implement that interface must now be modified to implement
the declared method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7013 - Abstract Method Added to
Class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An abstract method declaration
has been added to the specified class. This is always
reported as a binary-compatibility error, but in practice
the changed class might be <br>
used successfully with code compiled against the old class
depending upon usage patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If instances of objects compiled
against the old class are created, then their methods can be
invoked without problems. But if the newly-added abstract
method is ever <br>
invoked, then an AbstractMethodError is thrown at the time
the method invocation is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7014 - Method now final</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method was previously
non-final, and is now final. Subclasses of this class will
no longer compile or run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the old class containig
this method was final (explicitly or by only providing
private constructors) then subclasses cannot exist. Clirr
currently does not check for <br>
this situation, so this will raise a false alarm in some
corner cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7015 - Method now non-final</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method was previously final,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severity: INFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new version of the library
