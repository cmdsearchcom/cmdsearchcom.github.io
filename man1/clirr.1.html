Clirr is a tool that checks Java libraries for binary and source compatibility
  with older releases. Basically you give it two sets of jar files and Clirr
  dumps out a list of changes in the public API.

When clirr generates an ERROR, WARNING or INFO message about a change in the
  jars being compared, there is an associated message reference code. This
  manual contains an explanation of the meaning of that message which may
  contain information which could not be fitted into the brief message summary.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Messages are separated into three severity levels: ERROR, WARNING and INFO.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Errors come in two flavours:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Link-time failures, where an exception will be thrown as
      soon as code compiled against an old version of a class and the new
      version of the class are loaded into the same classloader hierarchy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Run-time failures, where an exception is thrown when code
      compiled against the old version of a class attempts to call a method on a
      new version of the class, or vice versa.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Clirr reports &quot;errors&quot; for cases where it is possible to get a
  run-time failure. Whether one actually occurs can depend upon the way the
  library is called, i.e. changes reported as an error may in fact work when
  used as long as the patterns of use of the library do not trigger the failure
  situation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Warnings are issued for situations where no link or runtime exception will
  occur, but where the application may behave unexpectedly due to the changes
  that have occurred.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Information messages provide users with information about new features which
  have been added without breaking backward compatibility in any way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When using clirr to report on changes to items which have private or package
  scope, these changes are always reported as INFO level changes, never WARNING
  or ERROR level. This allows users of clirr to generate &quot;change
  reports&quot; at a level suitable for developers without having some of those
  changes marked (irrelevantly) as binary incompatibilities.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There can never be binary incompatibilities for changes to private classes,
  methods or fields as that access can only occur from within the same class
  (i.e. the same compilation unit).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Clirr does not report binary incompatibility WARNINGs or ERRORs for
  package-scoped items either, because Java packages are intended to be
  &quot;release units&quot;, i.e. all classes within a package are compiled
  together (ensuring compatibility) then released as a unit. The only time that
  package-scope incompatibilities could possibly be an issue is when users of a
  library write their own classes using a package declaration belonging to some
  external library, or when a subset of updated classes (e.g. a single class)
  from a package is used to override certain classes from a previous release of
  the library. Both of these situations are considered very poor practice by
  Java programming convention.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the following sections, the term &quot;old&quot; is used to refer to a class,
  interface, method or field from the set of jars which represent the
  old/previous/original/baseline version of the library being inspected. The
  term &quot;new&quot; is used to refer to a class, interface, method or field
  from the set of jars which represent the new/current/latest version of the
  library being inspected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the following sections, the term &quot;type&quot; is used to refer to
  something which may be either a class or interface.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="1000_-_Increased_visibility_of_class"><a class="selflink" href="#1000_-_Increased_visibility_of_class">1000
  - Increased visibility of class</a></h1>
Severity: INFO
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified type exists in both versions, but its declared access specifier
  has changed to relax restrictions on what other code can access it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Top-level types (ie those which are not nested within another class) may only
  have &quot;package&quot; or &quot;public&quot; accessibility. Nested types can
  take on any of the four available accessibility values.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Regardless of whether the object is top-level or nested, a change in
  accessibility from left-to-right of the sequence
  private-&gt;package-&gt;protected-&gt;public always ensures that all code
  which could previously access that type can still access that type. Therefore
  such a change is always binary and source-code compatible.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the declaration &quot;protected&quot; provides access to both code
  derived from the type and to code within the same package, ie
  &quot;protected&quot; accessibility also implies package accessibility.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="1001_-_Decreased_visibility_of_class"><a class="selflink" href="#1001_-_Decreased_visibility_of_class">1001
  - Decreased visibility of class</a></h1>
Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified type exists in both versions, but its declared access specifier
  has changed to tighten the restrictions on what other code may access it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Top-level types (ie those which are not nested within another class) may only
  have &quot;package&quot; or &quot;public&quot; accessibility. Nested types can
  take on any of the four available accessibility values.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Regardless of whether the type is top-level or nested, a change in accessibility
  from left-to-right of the sequence
  public-&gt;protected-&gt;package-&gt;private may cause existing code which
  could previously access the type to no longer be able to do so.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Section 13.4.3 of the Java Language Specification states explicitly that an
  IllegalAccessError should occur if a pre-existing binary tries to access a
  type when the type accessibility has been changed to something that would
  cause a compile-time error. However this does not appear to be enforced in
  practice, at least in current JVMs. Nevertheless this should be an error, and
  so clirr reports this change as a binary-compatibility ERROR.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="2000_-_Changed_from_class_to_interface"><a class="selflink" href="#2000_-_Changed_from_class_to_interface">2000
  - Changed from class to interface</a></h1>
Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified class has become an interface in the new version. This change is
  always a binary and source-code incompatibility, for obvious reasons.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="2001_-_Changed_from_interface_to_class"><a class="selflink" href="#2001_-_Changed_from_interface_to_class">2001
  - Changed from interface to class</a></h1>
Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified interface has become an class in the new version. This change is
  always a binary and source-code incompatibility, for obvious reasons.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="3001_-_Removed_final_modifier_from_class"><a class="selflink" href="#3001_-_Removed_final_modifier_from_class">3001
  - Removed final modifier from class</a></h1>
Severity: INFO
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified class was declared final in the old version, but is no longer
  final in the new version.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="3002_-_Added_final_modifier_to_effectively_final_class"><a class="selflink" href="#3002_-_Added_final_modifier_to_effectively_final_class">3002
  - Added final modifier to effectively final class</a></h1>
Severity: INFO
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified class was not declared final in the old version, but is now
  declared final. Normally, this would be an incompatibility because
  pre-existing derived classes would no longer be valid when used with the new
  version of this class. However in this case the old class version had no
  public or protected constructors, so it was not possible for any derived
  classes to exist even for the old version of the library. Changing such a
  class to final therefore can not break any existing code.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="3003_-_Added_final_modifier_to_class"><a class="selflink" href="#3003_-_Added_final_modifier_to_class">3003
  - Added final modifier to class</a></h1>
Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified class was not declared final in the old version, but is now
  declared final. Any pre-existing classes which were declared as subclasses of
  this class will therefore not be valid with the new version of the library.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A VerifyError is thrown by the classloader when an attempt is made to load a
  subclass of a final class.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that a class Y is loaded by the standard classloader only when the first
  attempt is made to create an instance of Y, or to directly reference the Class
  object for class Y. If some other class X has class Y as a declared member, or
  as a parameter to some method, then loading class X does not cause class Y to
  be loaded.

Severity: INFO
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The old version of this class was declared to be an abstract class. The new
  version is not abstract, allowing users to create instances of the class.

Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The old version of this class was not declared to be abstract. The new version
  is abstract. Pre-existing code which creates instances of this class is no
  longer valid with the new version.

Severity: INFO
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The new version of the type now implements an additional interface. This does
  not invalidate any existing code (source or binary), and is a completely
  backward-compatible change.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this message can be reported without any change occurring in the
  specified type; a change to the set of interfaces supported by a type will
  cause this message to be reported for every descendant of that type.

Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The old version of this type declared that it implemented an interface which the
  new class or interface does not. Existing code which explicitly or implicitly
  casts objects of this type to the now missing interface is no longer valid.

Severity: INFO or WARNING
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The new version of the class has a class in its inheritance hierarchy which the
  old version did not, either because its direct parent is now a different
  class, or because one of its parent classes has changed its inheritance
  hierarchy.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the specified class has java.lang.Throwable as an ancestor, then this change
  is reported as a WARNING, because this class change may change the
  exception-catching behaviour of programs that use this class.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this message can be reported without any change occurring in the
  specified class; a change to the set of superclasses of an ancestor class will
  cause this message to be reported for every descendant class.

The old version of this class has a class in its inheritance hierarchy which the
  new version does not, either because its direct parent is now a different
  class, or because one of its parent classes has changed its inheritance
  hierarchy.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Existing code which explicitly or implicitly casts objects of this type to the

Code compiled against the old version of the class was permitted to

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Whether a value in a field could previously be &quot;inlined&quot; into other

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The field is now a class variable rather than an instance variable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For some reason (presumably internal implementation issues), the Java standard
  declares that this change is not binary-compatible, and that an
  IncompatibleClassChangeError will be thrown if code compiled against the
  &quot;old&quot; version of a class is used together with a &quot;new&quot;
  version for which a field is now static.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because source code is permitted to access class variables via instances of that
  class, this is expected to be a source-code compatible change. However
  currently CLIRR reports this as an ERROR for source-code compatibility too.

Binary Severity: WARNING
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Source Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The new class has removed a field present in the old version. Pre-existing
  source code which directly accesses that field will no longer be valid.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Previously, however, the field was final and was initialised with a constant
  value. Therefore code compiled against the previous version of the class will
  have inlined this constant and will continue to work, using the previous value
  of this field. A warning is issued as this is often not desirable behaviour.
  However it is not a binary incompatibility.

The old class had a method named X. The new class no longer has this method, but
  a parent class does define this method, so no binary or source incompatibility
  has occurred.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this change may have the effect of forcing the new class to become

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Whether an error actually occurs at runtime for this change depends on usage
  patterns. The modified class can be used with existing code as long as that
  existing code does not attempt to call the removed method. If a call to the
  missing method is made, then a NoSuchMethodError exception is generated when
  the method invocation occurs.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Severity: ERROR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified method has had arguments added or removed. This means that code
  which previously invoked it will no longer invoke the same method.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If there is an inherited method definition with the old prototype, then there is
  no binary incompatibility; code which was compiled against the old version of
  this class will now invoke the inherited implementation. In this situation,
  clirr should output an INFO message rather than an error. However at the
  current date, clirr does not check for this situation.

The specified method has had the type of one or more of its arguments modified.
  This means that code compiled against the old version of the class will no
  longer invoke the same method. However exactly the same old source code, when
  compiled against the new class version may invoke this method if the argument
  types are assignment-compatible.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If there is an inherited method definition with the old prototype, then there is

If there is no inherited method definition with the old prototype, then the
  change is a binary incompatibility.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the parameter types changed were all changed to supertypes of their previous
  declared types, or for primitive parameter types if they were changed to
  &quot;larger&quot; types in every case, then the new code is
  source-code-compatible with the previous release even if it is not
  binary-compatible. Note that in this situation, recompiling code which uses
  the library may change its behaviour from calling an inherited method to
  calling a method on the class which has a slightly different prototype. At the
  current date, clirr does not check for this situation.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The specified method has had its declared return type changed. Whether a problem
  actually occurs at runtime when using code compiled against the old version of
  this library depends upon usage patterns. Old code may call other methods on
  this class. However any attempt to call the method whose return type has
  changed will result in a NoSuchMethodError being thrown when the method is
  invoked, because the return type is part of the &quot;method signature&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The change is source-code-compatible if and only if the new return type is
  assignable to the old return type. This means that:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 if the old return type was a primitive type, then the new return type must be
  narrower than the old type.
<br/>
 if the old return type was an interface, then the new return type must be a
  class or interface which implements the old return type.
<br/>
 if the old return type was a class, then the new return type must be a subclass
  of the previously returned type.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Clirr does not currently check for source-code compatibility for changes in
  method return types; currently these are simply reported as an ERROR.

The access permissions associated with the specified method have been tightened

Whether this change is a source-code compatibility issue or not depends upon
  patterns of usage.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This change should be a binary incompatibility. Note, however, that current JVMs
  do not validate this. Code compiled against a previous version of a class can
  successfully invoke methods for which they no longer have access rights.
  Nevertheless, the Java Language Specification states that this is an error, so
  clirr reports this change as a binary incompatibility.

A method declaration has been added to the specified interface. This is always
  reported as a binary-compatibility error, but in practice the changed class
  might be used successfully with code compiled against the old interface
  depending upon usage patterns.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Old code which invokes methods upon code compiled against the new (expanded)
  interface will continue to work without issues. And old code which implements
  the old version of the interface will also continue to work correctly as long
  as no code attempts to invoke any of the newly-added methods against that
  instance. But code which (validly) invokes one of the new methods in the
  interface against an object which implements only the old version of the
  interface will cause an AbstractMethodError to be thrown at the time the
  method invocation is attempted.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Adding a method to an interface is always reported as an ERROR, because classes
  that implement that interface must now be modified to implement the declared
  method.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If instances of objects compiled against the old class are created, then their
  methods can be invoked without problems. But if the newly-added abstract

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the old class containig this method was final (explicitly or by only
