<p>PMDAPROC(1) General Commands Manual PMDAPROC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmdaproc - process performance metrics domain agent
(PMDA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/pmdaproc [-AL] [-d domain] [-l logfile]
[-r cgroup] [-U username]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmdaproc is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
extracts performance metrics describing the state of the
individual processes running on a Linux system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The proc PMDA exports metrics
that measure the memory, processor and other resource use of
each process, as well as summary information collated across
all of the running pro&acirc; <br>
cesses. The PMDA uses credentials passed from the PMAPI(3)
monitoring tool identifying the user requesting the
information, to ensure that only values the user is allowed
to <br>
access are returned by the PMDA. This involves the PMDA
temporarily changing its effective user and group
identifiers for the duration of requests for instances and
values. In <br>
other words, system calls to extract information are
performed as the user originating the request and not as a
privileged user. The mechanisms available for transfer of
user <br>
credentials are described further in the PCPIntro(1)
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief description of the
pmdaproc command line options follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Disables use of the
credentials provided by PMAPI client tools, and simply runs
everything under the &quot;root&quot; account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Changes the per-process
instance domain used by most pmdaproc metrics to include
threads as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named proc.log is written in the current
directory of pmcd(1) when pmdaproc is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the <br>
log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Restrict the set of processes
exported in the per-process instance domain to only those
processes that are contained by the specified cgroup
resource container. This option <br>
provides an optional finer granularity to the monitoring,
and can also be used to reduce the resources consumed by
pmdaproc during requests for instances and values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent. The default is the privileged
&quot;root&quot; account, with seteuid (2) and setegid (2)
switching for accessing most information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOTPROC OVERVIEW <br>
The pmdaproc Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
includes an additional set of per-process metrics with an
instance domain of processes restricted to an
&quot;interesting&quot; or <br>
&quot;hot&quot; set. Unlike the stock metrics exported by
the proc PMDA, which have an instance domain equal to the
current processes, hot metrics have an instance domain which
is a sub&acirc; <br>
set of this. This hotproc instance domain is determined by a
configurable predicate evaluated over some refresh
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As well as the equivalent
per-process proc metrics, hotproc provides a cpuburn metric
which specifies the CPU utilization of the process over the
refresh interval, total metrics <br>
which indicate how much of the available CPU time the
&quot;interesting&quot; processes account for, predicate
metrics which show the values of the reserved variables (see
below) that are <br>
being used in the hotproc predicate, and control metrics for
controlling the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOTPROC CONFIGURATION <br>
The configuration file consists of one predicate used to
determine if a process should be in the interesting set or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example configuration file
may be found at $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/samplehotproc.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file with any modifications
can be copied to $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/hotproc.conf in order
to configure the hot metrics. The pmstore(1) and pmStore(3)
interfaces can be used as <br>
well (described below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The predicate is described using
the language specified below. The symbols are based on those
used by the C(1) and awk(1) languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean Connectives <br>
&amp;&amp; (and), || (or), ! (not), () (precedence
overriding)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number comparators <br>
&lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= , == , !=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String comparators <br>
== , !=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String/Pattern comparators <br>
~ (string matches pattern) , !~ (string does not match
pattern)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reserved variables <br>
uid (user id; type integer) uname (user name; type string),
gid (group id; type integer) gname (group name; type
string), fname (process file name; type string), psargs <br>
(process file name with args; type string), cpuburn (cpu
utilization; type float), iodemand (I/O demand - Kbytes
read/written per second; type float), ctxswitch (number of
<br>
context switches per second; type float), syscalls (number
of system calls per second; type float), virtualsize
(virtual size in Kbytes; type float), residentsize
(resi&acirc; <br>
dent size in Kbytes; type float), iowait (blocked and raw io
wait in secs/sec; type float), schedwait (time waiting in
run queue in secs/sec; type float).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Literal values <br>
1234 (positive integer), 0.35 (positive float),
&quot;foobar&quot; (string; delimited by &quot;),
/[fF](o)+bar/ (pattern; delimited by /), true (boolean),
false (boolean)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments <br>
#this is a comment (from # to the end of the line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
cpuburn &gt; 0.2 # cpu utilization of more than 20% <br>
cpuburn &gt; 0.2 &amp;&amp; uname == &quot;root&quot; <br>
cpuburn &gt; 0.2 &amp;&amp; (uname == &quot;root&quot; ||
uname == &quot;hot&quot;) <br>
psargs ~ /pmda/ &amp;&amp; cpuburn &gt; 0.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hotproc.predicate metrics
may be used to see what the values of the reserved variables
are that were used by the predicate at the last refresh.
They do not cover the <br>
reserved variables which are already exported elsewhere. A
hotproc.predicate metric may not have a value if it is not
referenced in the configuration predicate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION <br>
The hot metrics can also be configured at runtime through
the pmstore(1) interface (and, implicitly, the pmStore(3)
API)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
pmstore hotproc.control.config &rsquo;fname ==
&quot;mingetty&quot;&rsquo; <br>
pmstore hotproc.control.config &rsquo;uid == 0&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To force the config file to be
reloaded: <br>
pmstore hotproc.control.reload_config &quot;1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
The proc PMDA is installed and available by default. If you
want to undo the installation, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc <br>
# ./Remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to establish access
to the names, help text and values for the proc performance
metrics once more, after removal, do the following as
root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc <br>
# ./Install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmdaproc is launched by pmcd(1)
and should never be executed directly. The Install and
Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
