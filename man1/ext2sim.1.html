<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ext2sim - convert hierarchical ext(5) extracted-circuit
files to flat sim(5) files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ext2sim [ -a aliasfile ] [ -l labelsfile ] [ -o simfile ] [
-A ] [ -B ] [ -F ] [ -L ] [ -t ] [ extcheck-options ] [ -y

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ext2sim will convert an extracted circuit from the
hierarchical ext(5) representation produced by Magic to the
flat sim(5) representation required by many simulation
tools. The <br>
root of the tree to be extracted is the file root.ext; it
and all the files it references are recursively flattened.
The result is a single, flat representation of the circuit
<br>
that is written to the file root.sim, a list of node aliases
written to the file root.al, and a list of the locations of
all nodenames in CIF format, suitable for plotting, to <br>
the file root.nodes. The file root.sim is suitable for use
with programs such as crystal(1), esim(1), or
sim2spice(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a aliasfile <br>
Instead of leaving node aliases in the file root.al, leave
it in aliasfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l labelfile <br>
Instead of leaving a CIF file with the locations of all node
names in the file root.nodes, leave it in labelfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Instead of leaving output in the file root.sim, leave it in
outfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Don&rsquo;t produce the
aliases file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Don&rsquo;t output transistor
or node attributes in the .sim file. This option will also
disable the output of information such as the area and
perimeter of source and drain <br>
diffusion and the fet substrate. For compatibitlity reasons
the latest version of ext2sim outputs this information as
node attibutes. This option is necessary when <br>
preparing input for programs that don&rsquo;t know about
attributes, such as sim2spice(1) (which is actually made
obsolete by ext2spice(1), anyway), or rsim(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Don&rsquo;t output nodes that
aren&rsquo;t connected to fets (floating nodes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Don&rsquo;t produce the label
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tchar Trim characters from node
names when writing the output file. Char should be either
&quot;#&quot; or &quot;!&quot;. The option may be used twice
if both characters are desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f MIT|LBL|SU <br>
Select the output format. MIT is the traditional sim(5)
format. LBL is a variant of it understood by gemini(1) which
includes the substrate connection as a fourth ter&acirc;
<br>
minal before length and width. SU is the internal Stanford
format which is described also in sim(5) and includes areas
and perimeters of fet sources, drains and sub&acirc; <br>
strates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y num Select the precision for
outputing capacitors. The default is 1 which means that the
capacitors will be printed to a precision of .1 fF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J hier|flat <br>
Select the source/drain area and perimeter extraction
algorithm. If hier is selected then the areas and perimeters
are extracted only within each subcell. For each fet <br>
in a subcell the area and perimeter of its source and drain
within this subcell are output. If two or more fets share a
source/drain node then the total area and <br>
perimeter will be output in only one of them and the other
will have 0. If flat is selected the same rules apply only
that the scope of search for area and perimeter <br>
is the whole netlist. In general flat (which is the default)
will give accurate results (it will take into account shared
sources/drains) but hier is provided for back&acirc; <br>
wards compatibility with version 6.4.5. On top of this
selection you can individually control how a terminal of a
specific fet will be extracted if you put a <br>
source/drain attribute. ext:aph makes the extraction for
that specific terminal hierarchical and ext:apf makes the
extraction flat (see the magic tutorial about attach&acirc;
<br>
ing attribute labels). Additionaly to ease extraction of
bipolar transistors the gate attribute ext:aps forces the
output of the substrate area and perimeter for a <br>
specific fet (in flat mode only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j
device:sdRclass[/subRclass]/defaultSubstrate <br>
Gives ext2sim information about the source/drain resistance
class of the fet type device. Makes device to have sdRclass
source drain resistance class, subRclass sub&acirc; <br>
strate (well) resistance class and the node named
defaultSubstrate as its default substrate. The defaults are
nfet:0/Gnd and pfet:1/6/Vdd which correspond to the MOSIS
<br>
technology file but things might vary in your site. Ask your
local cad administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way the extraction of node
area and perimeter works in magic the total area and
perimeter of the source/drain junction is summed up on a
single node. That is why all the <br>
junction areas and perimeters are summed up on a single node
(this should not affect simulation results however).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special care must be taken when
the substrate of a fet is tied to a node other than the
default substrate (eg in a bootstraping charge pump). To get
the correct substrate info <br>
in these cases the fet(s) with separate wells should be in
their own separate subcell with ext:aph attributes attached
to their sensitive terminals (also all the transistors <br>
which share sensistive terminals with these should be in
another subcell with the same attributes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, all of the options
of extcheck(1) are accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALING AND UNITS <br>
If all of the .ext files in the tree read by ext2sim have
the same geometrical scale (specified in the scale line in
each .ext file), this scale is reflected through to the
out&acirc; <br>
put, resulting in substantially smaller .sim files.
Otherwise, the geometrical unit in the output .sim file is a
centimicron.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resistance and capacitance are
always output in ohms and femptofarads, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Transistor gate capacitance is typically not included in
node capacitances, as most analysis tools compute the gate
capacitance directly from the gate area. The -c flag
there&acirc; <br>
fore provides a limit only on non-gate capacitance. The
areas and perimeters of fet sources and drains work only
with the simple extraction algorith and not with the
extresis <br>
flow. So you have to model them as linear capacitors (create
a special extraction style) if you want to extract parasitic
resistances with extresis.</p>
