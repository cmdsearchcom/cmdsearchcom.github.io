<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
alien - Convert or install an alien binary package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
alien [--to-deb] [--to-rpm] [--to-tgz] [--to-slp] [options]
file [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
alien is a program that converts between Red Hat rpm, Debian
deb, Stampede slp, Slackware tgz, and Solaris pkg file
formats. If you want to use a package from another linux
<br>
distribution than the one you have installed on your system,
you can use alien to convert it to your preferred package
format and install it. It also supports LSB packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
alien should not be used to replace important system
packages, like init, libc, or other things that are
essential for the functioning of your system. Many of these
packages are <br>
set up differently by the different distributions, and
packages from the different distributions cannot be used
interchangeably. In general, if you can&rsquo;t remove a
package without <br>
breaking your system, don&rsquo;t try to replace it with an
alien version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGE FORMAT NOTES <br>
rpm For converting to and from rpm format the Red Hat
Package Manager must be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsb Unlike the other package
formats, alien can handle the depenendencies of lsb packages
if the destination package format supports dependencies.
Note that this means that the <br>
package generated from a lsb package will depend on a
package named &quot;lsb&quot; -- your distribution should
provide a package by that name, if it is lsb compliant. The
scripts in <br>
the lsb package will be converted by default as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To generate lsb packages, the
Red Hat Package Manager must be installed, and alien will
use by preference a program named lsb-rpm, if it exists. No
guarantees are made that <br>
the generated lsb packages will be fully LSB compliant, and
it&rsquo;s rather unlikely they will unless you build them
in the lsbdev environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that unlike other package
formats, converting an LSB package to another format will
not cause its minor version number to be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deb For converting to (but not
from) deb format, the gcc, make, debhelper, dpkg-dev, and
dpkg packages must be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tgz Note that when converting
from the tgz format, alien will simply generate an output
package that has the same files in it as are in the tgz
file. This only works well if the <br>
tgz file has precompiled binaries in it in a standard linux
directory tree. Do NOT run alien on tar files with source
code in them, unless you want this source code to be <br>
installed in your root directory when you install the
package!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using alien to convert a
tgz package, all files in /etc in are assumed to be
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkg To manipulate packages in
the Solaris pkg format (which is really the SV datastream
package format), you will need the Solaris pkginfo and
pkgtrans tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
alien will convert all the files you pass into it into all
the output types you specify. If no output type is
specified, it defaults to converting to deb format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file [...] <br>
The list of package files to convert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --to-deb <br>
Make debian packages. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --to-rpm <br>
Make rpm packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --to-tgz <br>
Make tgz packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--to-slp <br>
Make slp packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --to-pkg <br>
Make Solaris pkg packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --install <br>
Automatically install each generated package, and remove the
package file after it has been installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --generate <br>
Generate a temporary directory suitable for building a
package from, but do not actually create the package. This
is useful if you want to move files around in the package
<br>
before building it. The package can be built from this
temporary directory by running &quot;debian/rules
binary&quot;, if you were creating a Debian package, or by
running &quot;rpmbuild <br>
-bb &lt;packagename&gt;.spec&quot; if you were creating a
Red Hat package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --single <br>
Like -g, but do not generate the packagename.orig directory.
This is only useful when you are very low on disk space and
are generating a debian package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --scripts <br>
Try to convert the scripts that are meant to be run when the
package is installed and removed. Use this with caution,
because these scripts might be designed to work on a <br>
system unlike your own, and could cause problems. It is
recommended that you examine the scripts by hand and check
to see what they do before using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is enabled by default when
converting from lsb packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patch=patch <br>
Specify the patch to be used instead of automatically
looking the patch up in /var/lib/alien. This has no effect
unless a debian package is being built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--anypatch <br>
Be less strict about which patch file is used, perhaps
attempting to use a patch file for an older version of the
package. This is not guaranteed to always work; older <br>
patches may not necessarily work with newer packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nopatch <br>
Do not use any patch files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--description=desc <br>
Specifiy a description for the package. This only has an
effect when converting from the tgz package format, which
lacks descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version=version <br>
Specifiy a version for the package. This only has an effect
when converting from the tgz package format, which may lack
version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that without an argument,
this displays the version of alien instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --test <br>
Test the generated packages. Currently this is only
supported for debian packages, which, if lintian is
installed, will be tested with lintian and lintian&rsquo;s
output displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-version <br>
By default, alien adds one to the minor version number of
each package it converts. If this option is given, alien
will not do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bump=number <br>
Instead of incrementing the version number of the converted
package by 1, increment it by the given number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fixperms <br>
Sanitize all file owners and permissions when building a
deb. This may be useful if the original package is a mess.
On the other hand, it may break some things to mess with
<br>
their permissions and owners to the degree this does, so it
defaults to off. This can only be used when converting to
debian packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target=architecture <br>
Force the architecture of the generated package to the given
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be verbose: Display each command alien runs in the process
of converting a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--veryverbose <br>
Be verbose as with --verbose, but also display the output of
each command run. Some commands may generate a lot of
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a short usage summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display the version of alien.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are some examples of the use of alien:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alien --to-deb package.rpm <br>
Convert the package.rpm into a package.deb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alien --to-rpm package.deb <br>
Convert the package.deb into a package.rpm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alien -i package.rpm <br>
Convert the package.rpm into a package.deb (converting to a
.deb package is default, so you need not specify --to-deb),
and install the generated package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alien --to-deb --to-rpm --to-tgz
--to-slp foo.deb bar.rpm baz.tgz <br>
Creates 9 new packages. When it is done, foo bar and baz are
available in all 4 package formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
alien recognizes the following environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPMBUILDOPT <br>
Options to pass to rpm when it is building a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPMINSTALLOPT <br>
Options to pass to rpm when it is installing a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMAIL <br>
If set, alien assumes this is your email address. Email
addresses are included in generated debian packages.</p>
