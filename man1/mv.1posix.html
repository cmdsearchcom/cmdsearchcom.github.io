<p>MV(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
MV(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mv &acirc; move files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mv [&acirc;if] source_file target_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv [&acirc;if] source_file...
target_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In the first synopsis form, the mv utility shall move the
file named by the source_file operand to the destination
specified by the target_file. This first synopsis form is
<br>
assumed when the final operand does not name an existing
directory and is not a symbolic link referring to an
existing directory. In this case, if source_file names a
non-direc&acirc; <br>
tory file and target_file ends with a trailing &lt;slash&gt;
character, mv shall treat this as an error and no
source_file operands will be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second synopsis form, mv
shall move each file named by a source_file operand to a
destination file in the existing directory named by the
target_dir operand, or referenced <br>
if target_dir is a symbolic link referring to an existing
directory. The destination path for each source_file shall
be the concatenation of the target directory, a single <br>
&lt;slash&gt; character if the target did not end in a
&lt;slash&gt;, and the last pathname component of the
source_file. This second form is assumed when the final
operand names an exist&acirc; <br>
ing directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any operand specifies an
existing file of a type not specified by the System
Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, the behavior is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each source_file the
following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the destination path
exists, the &acirc;f option is not specified, and either of
the following conditions is true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The permissions of the
destination path do not permit writing and the standard
input is a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. The &acirc;i option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the mv utility shall write a
prompt to standard error and read a line from standard
input. If the response is not affirmative, mv shall do
nothing more with the current <br>
source_file and go on to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the source_file operand
and destination path name the same existing file, then the
destination path shall not be removed, and one of the
following shall occur:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. No change is made to
source_file, no error occurs, and no diagnostic is
issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. No change is made to
source_file, a diagnostic is issued to standard error
identifying the two names, and the exit status is
affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. If the source_file operand
and destination path name distinct directory entries, then
the source_file operand is removed, no error occurs, and no
diagnostic is issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mv utility shall do nothing
more with the current source_file, and go on to any
remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The mv utility shall perform
actions equivalent to the rename() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, called with
the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The source_file operand is
used as the old argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. The destination path is used
as the new argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this succeeds, mv shall do
nothing more with the current source_file and go on to any
remaining source_files. If this fails for any reasons other
than those described for <br>
the errno [EXDEV] in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, mv shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error, do nothing more with the current
source_file, and go <br>
on to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the destination path
exists, and it is a file of type directory and source_file
is not a file of type directory, or it is a file not of type
directory and source_file is a <br>
file of type directory, mv shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with the current
source_file, and go on to any remaining source_files. If the
<br>
destination path exists and was created by a previous step,
it is unspecified whether this will treated as an error or
the destination path will be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If the destination path
exists, mv shall attempt to remove it. If this fails for any
reason, mv shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with the <br>
current source_file, and go on to any remaining
source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The file hierarchy rooted in
source_file shall be duplicated as a file hierarchy rooted
in the destination path. If source_file or any of the files
below it in the hierarchy <br>
are symbolic links, the links themselves shall be
duplicated, including their contents, rather than any files
to which they refer. The following characteristics of each
file <br>
in the file hierarchy shall be duplicated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The time of last data
modification and time of last access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The user ID and group ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The file mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user ID, group ID, or
file mode of a regular file cannot be duplicated, the file
mode bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID shall not be duplicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When files are duplicated to
another file system, the implementation may require that the
process invoking mv has read access to each file being
duplicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If files being duplicated to
another file system have hard links to other files, it is
unspecified whether the files copied to the new file system
have the hard links pre&acirc; <br>
served or separate copies are created for the linked
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the duplication of the file
hierarchy fails for any reason, mv shall write a diagnostic
message to standard error, do nothing more with the current
source_file, and go on <br>
to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the duplication of the file
characteristics fails for any reason, mv shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error, but this failure shall
not cause mv to modify its <br>
exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. The file hierarchy rooted in
source_file shall be removed. If this fails for any reason,
mv shall write a diagnostic message to the standard error,
do nothing more with the <br>
current source_file, and go on to any remaining
source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The mv utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f Do not prompt for
confirmation if the destination path exists. Any previous
occurrence of the &acirc;i option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i Prompt for confirmation
if the destination path exists. Any previous occurrence of
the &acirc;f option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
&acirc;f or &acirc;i options shall not be considered an
error. The last option specified shall determine the
behavior of mv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_file <br>
A pathname of a file or directory to be moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_file <br>
A new pathname for the file or directory being moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_dir <br>
A pathname of an existing directory into which to move the
input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used to read an input line in
response to each prompt specified in the STDERR section.
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files specified by each source_file operand can be
of any file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of mv:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence
classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the
extended regular expression defined for the <br>
yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files), the behavior of character classes used in
the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale used to process affirmative responses,
and the locale used to affect the format and contents of
diagnostic messages and prompts written to standard <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
Prompts shall be written to the standard error under the
conditions specified in the DESCRIPTION section. The prompts
shall contain the destination pathname, but their format is
<br>
otherwise unspecified. Otherwise, the standard error shall
be used only for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
The output files may be of any file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were moved
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If the copying or removal of source_file is prematurely
terminated by a signal or error, mv may leave a partial copy
of source_file at the source or destination. The mv utility
<br>
shall not modify both source_file and the destination path
simultaneously; termination at any point shall leave either
source_file or the destination path complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Some implementations mark for update the last file status
change timestamp of renamed files and some do not.
Applications which make use of the last file status change
timestamp <br>
may behave differently with respect to renamed files unless
they are designed to allow for either behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specification ensures that
mv a a will not alter the contents of file a, and allows the
implementation to issue an error that a file cannot be moved
onto itself. Likewise, <br>
when a and b are hard links to the same file, mv a b will
not alter b, but if a diagnostic is not issued, then it is
unspecified whether a is left untouched (as it would be by
<br>
the rename() function) or unlinked (reducing the link count
of b).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If the current directory contains only files a (of any type
defined by the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008), b (also of any type), and a directory
c:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv a b c <br>
mv c d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">results with the original files
a and b residing in the directory d in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Early proposals diverged from the SVID and BSD historical
practice in that they required that when the destination
path exists, the &acirc;f option is not specified, and input
is not a <br>
terminal, mv fails. This was done for compatibility with cp.
The current text returns to historical practice. It should
be noted that this is consistent with the rename()
func&acirc; <br>
tion defined in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, which does not require write permission
on the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For absolute clarity, paragraph
(1), describing the behavior of mv when prompting for
confirmation, should be interpreted in the following
manner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (exists AND (NOT f_option)
AND <br>
((not_writable AND input_is_terminal) OR i_option))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;i option exists on
BSD systems, giving applications and users a way to avoid
accidentally unlinking files when moving others. When the
standard input is not a terminal, the <br>
4.3 BSD mv deletes all existing destination paths without
prompting, even when &acirc;i is specified; this is
inconsistent with the behavior of the 4.3 BSD cp utility,
which always <br>
generates an error when the file is unwritable and the
standard input is not a terminal. The standard developers
decided that use of &acirc;i is a request for interaction,
so when the <br>
destination path exists, the utility takes instructions from
whatever responds to standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rename() function is able to
move directories within the same file system. Some
historical versions of mv have been able to move
directories, but not to a different file sys&acirc; <br>
tem. The standard developers considered that this was an
annoying inconsistency, so this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008
requires directories to be able to be moved even across file
sys&acirc; <br>
tems. There is no &acirc;R option to confirm that moving a
directory is actually intended, since such an option was not
required for moving directories in historical practice.
Requir&acirc; <br>
ing the application to specify it sometimes, depending on
the destination, seemed just as inconsistent. The semantics
of the rename() function were preserved as much as possible.
<br>
For example, mv is not permitted to
&lsquo;&lsquo;rename&rsquo;&rsquo; files to or from
directories, even though they might be empty and
removable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historic implementations of mv
did not exit with a non-zero exit status if they were unable
to duplicate any file characteristics when moving a file
across file systems, nor did <br>
they write a diagnostic message for the user. The former
behavior has been preserved to prevent scripts from
breaking; a diagnostic message is now required, however, so
that <br>
users are alerted that the file characteristics have
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact format of the
interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature
of the contents of prompts are specified because
implementations may desire more descriptive <br>
prompts than those used on historical implementations.
Therefore, an application not using the &acirc;f option or
using the &acirc;i option relies on the system to provide
the most suitable <br>
dialog directly with the user, based on the behavior
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When mv is dealing with a single
file system and source_file is a symbolic link, the link
itself is moved as a consequence of the dependence on the
rename() functionality, per <br>
the DESCRIPTION. Across file systems, this has to be made
explicit.</p>
