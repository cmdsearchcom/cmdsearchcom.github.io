<p>ROFFPP(1) General Commands Manual ROFFPP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
roffpp - replace .so requests within *roff sources</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
roffpp [ option... ][ infile [ outfile ]] <br>
roffpp -Help <br>
roffpp -VERSion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The roffpp command may be used to copies the input file to
the output file, including files named using .so directives
along the way, and removing the .so directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when processing
large multi-file documents with filters such as tbl(1) or
eqn(1) which do not understand the .so directive. The .nx
directive is not understood. <br>
The roffpp program is not a general *roff interpreter, so
many constructs will be beyond it, fortunately, most of them
have nothing to do with include files. Include files which
<br>
cannot be found, probably from uninterpreted *roff
constructs, if the files really does exist, will simply be
passed through unchanged, for *roff to interpret at a later
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The roffpp program also allows
the user to specify an include search path. This allows, for
example, common files to be kept in a central location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only directives of the form <br>
.so filename <br>
are processed. If the directive is introduced using the
single quote form, or the dot is not the first character of
the line, the directive will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any extra arguments on the line
are ignored, and quoting is not understood. All characters
are interpreted literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of directives which
will be ignored include <br>
&rsquo;so /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.an <br>
.if n .so yuck <br>
This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special file name
&lsquo;-&rsquo; on the command line means the standard input
or standard output, as appropriate. Files which are omitted
are also assumed to be the standard input or <br>
standard output, as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output attempts to keep file
names and line numbers in sync by using the .lf directive.
The .lf directive is also understood as input. This is
compatible with groff(1) and <br>
the other GNU text utilities included in the groff
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ipath <br>
Specify include path, a la cc(1). Include paths are searched
in the order specified. The include search path defaults to
the current directory if and only if the user <br>
does not specify any include search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Help <br>
Give information on how to use roffpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-VERSion <br>
Tell what version of roffpp is being run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other option will generate a
diagnostic error.</p>
