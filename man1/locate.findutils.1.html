<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents the GNU version of locate. For
each given pattern, locate searches one or more databases of
file names and displays the file names that contain the <br>
pattern. Patterns can contain shell-style metacharacters:
&lsquo;*&rsquo;, &lsquo;?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;[]&rsquo;. The
metacharacters do not treat &lsquo;/&rsquo; or
&lsquo;.&rsquo; specially. Therefore, a pattern
&lsquo;foo*bar&rsquo; can match a <br>
file name that contains &lsquo;foo3/bar&rsquo;, and a
pattern &lsquo;*duck*&rsquo; can match a file name that
contains &lsquo;lake/.ducky&rsquo;. Patterns that contain
metacharacters should be quoted to protect <br>
them from expansion by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a pattern is a plain string
&acirc; it contains no metacharacters &acirc; locate
displays all file names in the database that contain that
string anywhere. If a pattern does contain <br>
metacharacters, locate only displays file names that match
the pattern exactly. As a result, patterns that contain
metacharacters should usually begin with a &lsquo;*&rsquo;,
and will most <br>
often end with one as well. The exceptions are patterns that
are intended to explicitly match the beginning or end of a
file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file name databases contain
lists of files that were on the system when the databases
were last updated. The system administrator can choose the
file name of the default <br>
database, the frequency with which the databases are
updated, and the directories for which they contain entries;
see updatedb(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If locate&rsquo;s output is
going to a terminal, unusual characters in the output are
escaped in the same way as for the -print action of the find
command. If the output is not going <br>
to a terminal, file names are printed exactly as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-0, --null <br>
Use ASCII NUL as a separator, instead of newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --all <br>
Print only names which match all non-option arguments, not
those matching one or more non-option arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --basename <br>
Results are considered to match if the pattern specified
matches the final component of the name of a file as listed
in the database. This final component is usually <br>
referred to as the &lsquo;base name&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --count <br>
Instead of printing the matched filenames, just print the
total number of matches we found, unless --print (-p) is
also present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d path, --database=path <br>
Instead of searching the default file name database, search
the file name databases in path, which is a colon-separated
list of database file names. You can also use the <br>
environment variable LOCATE_PATH to set the list of database
files to search. The option overrides the environment
variable if both are used. Empty elements in the path <br>
are taken to be synonyms for the file name of the default
database. A database can be supplied on stdin, using
&lsquo;-&rsquo; as an element of path. If more than one
element of path <br>
is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, later instances are ignored (and a
warning message is printed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file name database format
changed starting with GNU find and locate version 4.0 to
allow machines with different byte orderings to share the
databases. This version <br>
of locate can automatically recognize and read databases
produced for older versions of GNU locate or Unix versions
of locate or find. Support for the old locate database <br>
format will be discontinued in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --existing <br>
Only print out such names that currently exist (instead of
such names that existed when the database was created). Note
that this may slow down the program a lot, if <br>
there are many matches in the database. If you are using
this option within a program, please note that it is
possible for the file to be deleted after locate has checked
<br>
that it exists, but before you use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --non-existing <br>
Only print out such names that currently do not exist
(instead of such names that existed when the database was
created). Note that this may slow down the program a lot,
<br>
if there are many matches in the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a summary of the
options to locate and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-case <br>
Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the file
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l N, --limit=N <br>
Limit the number of matches to N. If a limit is set via this
option, the number of results printed for the -c option will
never be larger than this number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --follow <br>
If testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E
options), consider broken symbolic links to be non-existing.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-database-age D <br>
Normally, locate will issue a warning message when it
searches a database which is more than 8 days old. This
option changes that value to something other than 8. The
<br>
effect of specifying a negative value is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mmap <br>
Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD
locate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, -H, --nofollow <br>
If testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E
options), treat broken symbolic links as if they were
existing files. The -H form of this option is provided <br>
purely for similarity with find; the use of -P is
recommended over -H.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --print <br>
Print search results when they normally would not, because
of the presence of --statistics (-S) or --count (-c).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --regex <br>
The pattern specified on the command line is understood to
be a regular expression, as opposed to a glob pattern. The
Regular expressions work in the same was as in emacs <br>
and find, except for the fact that &quot;.&quot; will match
a newline. Filenames whose full paths match the specified
regular expression are printed (or, in the case of the -c
<br>
option, counted). If you wish to anchor your regular
expression at the ends of the full path name, then as is
usual with regular expressions, you should use the
charac&acirc; <br>
ters ^ and $ to signify this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --stdio <br>
Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD
locate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --statistics <br>
Print various statistics about each locate database and then
exit without performing a search, unless non-option
arguments are given. For compatibility with BSD, -S is <br>
accepted as a synonym for --statistics. However, the output
of locate -S is different for the GNU and BSD
implementations of locate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number of locate and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wholename <br>
Match against the whole name of the file as listed in the
database. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LOCATE_PATH <br>
Colon-separated list of databases to search. If the value
has a leading or trailing colon, or has two colons in a row,
you may get results that vary between different <br>
versions of locate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
find(1), locatedb(5), updatedb(1), xargs(1), glob(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for
locate is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info and
locate programs are properly installed at your site, the
command info locate should give you <br>
access to the complete manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The locate program started life as the BSD fast find
program, contributed to BSD by James A. Woods. This was
described by his paper Finding Files Fast which was
published in <br>
Usenix ;login:, Vol 8, No 1, February/March, 1983, pp. 8-10.
When the find program began to assume a default -print
action if no action was specified, this changed the
inter&acirc; <br>
pretation of find pattern. The BSD developers therefore
moved the fast find functionality into locate. The GNU
implementation of locate appears to be derived from the same
<br>
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Significant changes to locate in
reverse order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4.3.7 Byte-order independent
support for old database format <br>
4.3.3 locate -i supports multi-byte characters correctly
<br>
Introduced --max_db_age <br>
4.3.2 Support for the slocate database format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4.2.22 Introduced the --all
option <br>
4.2.15 Introduced the --regex option <br>
4.2.14 Introduced options -L, -P, -H <br>
4.2.12 Empty items in LOCATE_PATH now indicate the default
database <br>
4.2.11 Introduced the --statistics option <br>
4.2.4 Introduced --count and --limit <br>
4.2.0 Glob characters cause matching against the whole file
name <br>
4.0 Introduced the LOCATE02 database format <br>
3.7 Locate can search multiple databases</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The locate database correctly handles filenames containing
newlines, but only if the system&rsquo;s sort command has a
working -z option. If you suspect that locate may need to
return <br>
filenames containing newlines, consider using its --null
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best way to report a bug is
to use the form at
http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils. The reason
for this is that you will then be able to track progress in
fixing <br>
the problem. Other comments about locate(1) and about the
findutils package in general can be sent to the
bug-findutils mailing list. To join the list, send email to
bug-find&acirc; <br>
utils-request@gnu.org.</p>
