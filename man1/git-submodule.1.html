<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Submodules allow foreign repositories to be embedded within
a dedicated subdirectory of the source tree, always pointed
at a particular commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They are not to be confused with
remotes, which are meant mainly for branches of the same
project; submodules are meant for different projects you
would like to make part of your <br>
source tree, while the history of the two projects still
stays completely independent and you cannot modify the
contents of the submodule from within the main project. If
you <br>
want to merge the project histories and want to treat the
aggregated whole as a single project from then on, you may
want to add a remote for the other project and use the <br>
subtree merge strategy, instead of treating the other
project as a submodule. Directories that come from both
projects can be cloned and checked out as a whole if you
choose to <br>
go that route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submodules are composed from a
so-called gitlink tree entry in the main repository that
refers to a particular commit object within the inner
repository that is completely <br>
separate. A record in the .gitmodules (see gitmodules(5))
file at the root of the source tree assigns a logical name
to the submodule and describes the default URL the submodule
<br>
shall be cloned from. The logical name can be used for
overriding this URL within your local repository
configuration (see submodule init).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will manage the
tree entries and contents of the gitmodules file for you, as
well as inspect the status of your submodules and update
them. When adding a new <br>
submodule to the tree, the add subcommand is to be used.
However, when pulling a tree containing submodules, these
will not be checked out by default; the init and update <br>
subcommands will maintain submodules checked out and at
appropriate revision in your working tree. You can briefly
inspect the up-to-date status of your submodules using the
<br>
status subcommand and get a detailed overview of the
difference between the index and checkouts using the summary
subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
add <br>
Add the given repository as a submodule at the given path to
the changeset to be committed next to the current project:
the current project is termed the
&quot;superproject&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This requires at least one
argument: &lt;repository&gt;. The optional argument
&lt;path&gt; is the relative location for the cloned
submodule to exist in the superproject. If &lt;path&gt; is
<br>
not given, the &quot;humanish&quot; part of the source
repository is used (&quot;repo&quot; for
&quot;/path/to/repo.git&quot; and &quot;foo&quot; for
&quot;host.xz:foo/.git&quot;). The &lt;path&gt; is also used
as the submodule&acirc;s <br>
logical name in its configuration entries unless --name is
used to specify a logical name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;repository&gt; is the URL of
the new submodule&acirc;s origin repository. This may be
either an absolute URL, or (if it begins with ./ or ../),
the location relative to the <br>
superproject&acirc;s origin repository (Please note that to
specify a repository foo.git which is located right next to
a superproject bar.git, you&acirc;ll have to use ../foo.git
<br>
instead of ./foo.git - as one might expect when following
the rules for relative URLs - because the evaluation of
relative URLs in Git is identical to that of relative <br>
directories). If the superproject doesn&acirc;t have an
origin configured the superproject is its own authoritative
upstream and the current working directory is used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;path&gt; is the relative
location for the cloned submodule to exist in the
superproject. If &lt;path&gt; does not exist, then the
submodule is created by cloning from the named URL. <br>
If &lt;path&gt; does exist and is already a valid Git
repository, then this is added to the changeset without
cloning. This second form is provided to ease creating a new
submodule <br>
from scratch, and presumes the user will later push the
submodule to the given URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In either case, the given URL is
recorded into .gitmodules for use by subsequent users
cloning the superproject. If the URL is given relative to
the superproject&acirc;s <br>
repository, the presumption is the superproject and
submodule repositories will be kept together in the same
relative location, and only the superproject&acirc;s URL
needs to be <br>
provided: git-submodule will correctly locate the submodule
using the relative URL in .gitmodules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
Show the status of the submodules. This will print the SHA-1
of the currently checked out commit for each submodule,
along with the submodule path and the output of git <br>
describe for the SHA-1. Each SHA-1 will be prefixed with -
if the submodule is not initialized, + if the currently
checked out submodule commit does not match the SHA-1 found
<br>
in the index of the containing repository and U if the
submodule has merge conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --recursive is specified,
this command will recurse into nested submodules, and show
their status as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are only interested in
changes of the currently initialized submodules with respect
to the commit recorded in the index or the HEAD,
git-status(1) and git-diff(1) will <br>
provide that information too (and can also report changes to
a submodule&acirc;s work tree).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init <br>
Initialize the submodules recorded in the index (which were
added and committed elsewhere) by copying submodule names
and urls from .gitmodules to .git/config. Optional <br>
&lt;path&gt; arguments limit which submodules will be
initialized. It will also copy the value of
submodule.$name.update into .git/config. The key used in
.git/config is <br>
submodule.$name.url. This command does not alter existing
information in .git/config. You can then customize the
submodule clone URLs in .git/config for your local setup and
<br>
proceed to git submodule update; you can also just use git
submodule update --init without the explicit init step if
you do not intend to customize any submodule locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deinit <br>
Unregister the given submodules, i.e. remove the whole
submodule.$name section from .git/config together with their
work tree. Further calls to git submodule update, git <br>
submodule foreach and git submodule sync will skip any
unregistered submodules until they are initialized again, so
use this command if you don&acirc;t want to have a local
<br>
checkout of the submodule in your work tree anymore. If you
really want to remove a submodule from the repository and
commit that use git-rm(1) instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --force is specified, the
submodule&acirc;s work tree will be removed even if it
contains local modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update <br>
Update the registered submodules, i.e. clone missing
submodules and checkout the commit specified in the index of
the containing repository. This will make the submodules
<br>
HEAD be detached unless --rebase or --merge is specified or
the key submodule.$name.update is set to rebase, merge or
none. none can be overridden by specifying --checkout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the submodule is not yet
initialized, and you just want to use the setting as stored
in .gitmodules, you can automatically initialize the
submodule with the --init option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --recursive is specified,
this command will recurse into the registered submodules,
and update any nested submodules within.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --force is specified, the
submodule will be checked out (using git checkout --force if
appropriate), even if the commit specified in the index of
the containing repository <br>
already matches the commit checked out in the submodule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summary <br>
Show commit summary between the given commit (defaults to
HEAD) and working tree/index. For a submodule in question, a
series of commits in the submodule between the given <br>
super project commit and the index or working tree (switched
by --cached) are shown. If the option --files is given, show
the series of commits in the submodule between the <br>
index of the super project and the working tree of the
submodule (this option doesn&acirc;t allow to use the
--cached option or to provide an explicit commit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the --submodule=log option
with git-diff(1) will provide that information too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach <br>
Evaluates an arbitrary shell command in each checked out
submodule. The command has access to the variables $name,
$path, $sha1 and $toplevel: $name is the name of the <br>
relevant submodule section in .gitmodules, $path is the name
of the submodule directory relative to the superproject,
$sha1 is the commit as recorded in the superproject, and
<br>
$toplevel is the absolute path to the top-level of the
superproject. Any submodules defined in the superproject but
not checked out are ignored by this command. Unless given
<br>
--quiet, foreach prints the name of each submodule before
evaluating the command. If --recursive is given, submodules
are traversed recursively (i.e. the given shell command <br>
is evaluated in nested submodules as well). A non-zero
return from the command in any submodule causes the
processing to terminate. This can be overridden by adding ||
: to <br>
the end of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, git submodule
foreach &rsquo;echo $path &lsquo;git rev-parse
HEAD&lsquo;&rsquo; will show the path and currently checked
out commit for each submodule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync <br>
Synchronizes submodules&rsquo; remote URL configuration
setting to the value specified in .gitmodules. It will only
affect those submodules which already have a URL entry in
<br>
.git/config (that is the case when they are initialized or
freshly added). This is useful when submodule URLs change
upstream and you need to update your local repositories <br>
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;git submodule sync&quot;
synchronizes all submodules while &quot;git submodule sync
-- A&quot; synchronizes submodule &quot;A&quot; only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
Only print error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --branch <br>
Branch of repository to add as submodule. The name of the
branch is recorded as submodule.&lt;path&gt;.branch in
.gitmodules for update --remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
This option is only valid for add, deinit and update
commands. When running add, allow adding an otherwise
ignored submodule path. When running deinit the submodule
work <br>
trees will be removed even if they contain local changes.
When running update, throw away local changes in submodules
when switching to a different commit; and always run a <br>
checkout operation in the submodule, even if the commit
listed in the index of the containing repository matches the
commit checked out in the submodule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cached <br>
This option is only valid for status and summary commands.
These commands typically use the commit found in the
submodule HEAD, but with this option, the commit stored in
the <br>
index is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--files <br>
This option is only valid for the summary command. This
command compares the commit in the index with that in the
submodule HEAD when this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --summary-limit <br>
This option is only valid for the summary command. Limit the
summary size (number of commits shown in total). Giving 0
will disable the summary; a negative number means <br>
unlimited (the default). This limit only applies to modified
submodules. The size is always limited to 1 for
added/deleted/typechanged submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote <br>
This option is only valid for the update command. Instead of
using the superproject&acirc;s recorded SHA-1 to update the
submodule, use the status of the submodule&acirc;s remote
<br>
tracking branch. The remote used is branch&acirc;s remote
(branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote), defaulting to origin. The
remote branch used defaults to master, but the branch name
may be <br>
overridden by setting the submodule.&lt;name&gt;.branch
option in either .gitmodules or .git/config (with
.git/config taking precedence).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This works for any of the
supported update procedures (--checkout, --rebase, etc.).
The only change is the source of the target SHA-1. For
example, submodule update --remote <br>
--merge will merge upstream submodule changes into the
submodules, while submodule update --merge will merge
superproject gitlink changes into the submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to ensure a current
tracking branch state, update --remote fetches the
submodule&acirc;s remote repository before calculating the
SHA-1. If you don&acirc;t want to fetch, you <br>
should use submodule update --remote --no-fetch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-fetch <br>
This option is only valid for the update command.
Don&acirc;t fetch new objects from the remote site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge <br>
This option is only valid for the update command. Merge the
commit recorded in the superproject into the current branch
of the submodule. If this option is given, the <br>
submodule&acirc;s HEAD will not be detached. If a merge
failure prevents this process, you will have to resolve the
resulting conflicts within the submodule with the usual
conflict <br>
resolution tools. If the key submodule.$name.update is set
to merge, this option is implicit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rebase <br>
This option is only valid for the update command. Rebase the
current branch onto the commit recorded in the superproject.
If this option is given, the submodule&acirc;s HEAD will
<br>
not be detached. If a merge failure prevents this process,
you will have to resolve these failures with git-rebase(1).
If the key submodule.$name.update is set to rebase, <br>
this option is implicit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--init <br>
This option is only valid for the update command. Initialize
all submodules for which &quot;git submodule init&quot; has
not been called so far before updating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name <br>
This option is only valid for the add command. It sets the
submodule&acirc;s name to the given string instead of
defaulting to its path. The name must be valid as a
directory name <br>
and may not end with a /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reference &lt;repository&gt;
<br>
This option is only valid for add and update commands. These
commands sometimes need to clone a remote repository. In
this case, this option will be passed to the git- <br>
clone(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Do not use this option
unless you have read the note for git-clone(1)&rsquo;s
--reference and --shared options carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recursive <br>
This option is only valid for foreach, update and status
commands. Traverse submodules recursively. The operation is
performed not only in the submodules of the current repo,
<br>
but also in any nested submodules inside those submodules
(and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;path&gt;... <br>
Paths to submodule(s). When specified this will restrict the
command to only operate on the submodules found at the
specified paths. (This argument is required with add).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
When initializing submodules, a .gitmodules file in the
top-level directory of the containing repository is used to
find the url of each submodule. This file should be
formatted <br>
in the same way as $GIT_DIR/config. The key to each
submodule url is &quot;submodule.$name.url&quot;. See
gitmodules(5) for details.</p>
