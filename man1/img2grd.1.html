<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
img2grd - Extract subset of img file in Mercator or
Geographic format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
img2grd imgfile -Ggrdfile <br>
-Rregion <br>
-Ttype [ -C ] [ -D[minlat/maxlat] ] [ -E ] [ -Iminutes ] [
-M ] [ -Nnavg ] [ -S[scale] ] [ -V[level] ] [ -Wmaxlon ] [
-nflags ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
img2grd reads an img format file, extracts a subset, and
writes it to a grid file. The -M option dictates whether or
not the Spherical Mercator projection of the img file is
pre&acirc; <br>
served or if a Geographic grid should be written by undoing
the Mercator projection. If geographic grid is selected you
can also request a resampling onto the exact -R given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
imgfile <br>
A Mercator img format file such as the marine gravity or
seafloor topography fields estimated from satellite
altimeter data by Sandwell and Smith. If the user has set an
<br>
environment variable $GMT_DATADIR, then img2grd will try to
find imgfile in $GMT_DATADIR; else it will try to open
imgfile directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ggrdfile <br>
grdfile is the name of the output grid file.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rwest/east/south/north[/zmin/zmax][+r][+uunit]
<br>
west, east, south, and north specify the region of interest,
and you may specify them in decimal degrees or in
[&Acirc;&plusmn;]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format Append +r if
lower left <br>
and upper right map coordinates are given instead of
w/e/s/n. The two shorthands -Rg and -Rd stand for global
domain (0/360 and -180/+180 in longitude respectively, with
<br>
-90/+90 in latitude). Alternatively for grid creation, give
Rcodelon/lat/nx/ny, where code is a 2-character combination
of L, C, R (for left, center, or right) and T, M, <br>
B for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., BL for lower left. This
indicates which point on a rectangular region the lon/lat
coordinate refers to, and the grid dimensions nx and <br>
ny with grid spacings via -I is used to create the
corresponding region. Alternatively, specify the name of an
existing grid file and the -R settings (and grid spacing,
<br>
if applicable) are copied from the grid. Appending +uunit
expects projected (Cartesian) coordinates compatible with
chosen -J and we inversely project to determine actual <br>
rectangular geographic region. For perspective view (-p),
optionally append /zmin/zmax. In case of perspective view
(-p), a z-range (zmin, zmax) can be appended to indi&acirc;
<br>
cate the third dimension. This needs to be done only when
using the -Jz option, not when using only the -p option. In
the latter case a perspective view of the plane is <br>
plotted, with no third dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
-C Set the x and y Mercator coordinates relative to
projection center [Default is relative to lower left corner
of grid]. Requires -M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D[minlat/maxlat] <br>
Use the extended latitude range -80.738/+80.738.
Alternatively, append minlat/maxlat as the latitude extent
of the input img file. [Default is -72.006/72.006]. Not
usu&acirc; <br>
ally required since we can determine the extent from
inspection of the file size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Can be used when -M is not
set to force the final grid to have the exact same region as
requested with -R. By default, the final region is a direct
projection of the orig&acirc; <br>
inal Mercator region and will typically extend slightly
beyond the requested latitude range, and furthermore the
grid increment in latitude does not match the longitude <br>
increment. However, the extra resampling introduces small
interpolation errors and should only be used if the output
grid must match the requested region and have x_inc = <br>
y_inc. In this case the region set by -R must be given in
multiples of the increment (.e.g, -R0/45/45/72).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Indicate minutes as the width
of an input img pixel in minutes of longitude. [Default is
2.0]. Not usually required since we can determine the pixel
size from inspection <br>
of the size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Output a Spherical Mercator
grid [Default is a geographic lon/lat grid]. The Spherical
Mercator projection of the img file is preserved, so that
the region -R set by the <br>
user is modified slightly; the modified region corresponds
to the edges of pixels [or groups of navg pixels]. The grid
file header is set so that the x and y axis lengths <br>
represent distance from the west and south edges of the
image, measured in user default units, with -Jm1 and the
adjusted -R. By setting the default PROJ_ ELLIPSOID = <br>
Sphere, the user can make overlays with the adjusted -R so
that they match. See EXAMPLES below. The adjusted -R is also
written in the grid header remark, so it can be <br>
found later. See -C to set coordinates relative to
projection center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nnavg Average the values in the
input img pixels into navg by navg squares, and create one
output pixel for each such square. If used with -T3 it will
report an average con&acirc; <br>
straint between 0 and 1. If used with -T2 the output will be
average data value or NaN according to whether average
constraint is &gt; 0.5. navg must evenly divide into the
<br>
dimensions of the imgfile in pixels. [Default 1 does no
averaging].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S[scale] <br>
Multiply the img file values by scale before storing in grid
file. [Default is 1.0]. For recent img files: img topo files
are stored in (corrected) meters [-S1]; free-air <br>
gravity files in mGal*10 [-S0.1 to get mGal]; vertical
deflection files in micro-radians*10 [-S0.1 to get
micro-radians], vertical gravity gradient files in Eotvos*50
<br>
[-S0.02 to get Eotvos, or -S0.002 to get mGal/km]). If no
scale is given we try to determine the scale by examining
the file name for clues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ttype type handles the encoding
of constraint information. type = 0 indicates that no such
information is encoded in the img file (used for pre-1995
versions of the gravity <br>
data) and gets all data. type &gt; 0 indicates that
constraint information is encoded (1995 and later (current)
versions of the img files) so that one may produce a grid
file <br>
as follows: -T1 gets data values at all points, -T2 gets
data values at constrained points and NaN at interpolated
points; -T3 gets 1 at constrained points and 0 at
inter&acirc; <br>
polated points [Default is 1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c]. Particularly recommended here,
as it is helpful to see how the coordinates are
adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmaxlon <br>
Indicate maxlon as the maximum longitude extent of the input
img file. Versions since 1995 have had maxlon = 360.0, while
some earlier files had maxlon = 390.0. [Default <br>
is 360.0].</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+bBC][+c][+tthreshold]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select interpolation mode for grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GEOGRAPHIC EXAMPLES <br>
The -M option should be excluded if you need the output grid
to be in geographic coordinates. To extract data in the
region -R-40/40/-70/-30 from world_grav.img.7.2 and
reproject <br>
to yield geographic coordinates, you can try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">img2grd world_grav.img.16.1
-Gmerc_grav.nc -R-40/40/-70/-30 -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the latitude spacing in
the img file is equidistant in Mercator units, the resulting
grid will not match the specified -R exactly, and the
latitude spacing will not equal <br>
the longitude spacing. If you need an exact match with your
-R and the same spacing in longitude and latitude, use the
-E option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">img2grd world_grav.img.16.1
-Gmerc_grav.nc -R-40/40/-70/-30 -E -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERCATOR EXAMPLES <br>
Since the img files are in a Mercator projection, you should
NOT extract a geographic grid if your plan is to make a
Mercator map. If you did that you end of projecting and <br>
reprojection the grid, losing short-wavelength detail.
Better to use -M and plot the grid using a linear projection
with the same scale as the desired Mercator projection (see
<br>
GMT Example 29). To extract data in the region
-R-40/40/-70/-30 from world_grav.img.7.2, run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt img2grd -M
world_grav.img.7.2 -Gmerc_grav.nc -R-40/40/-70/-30 -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -V option tells us
that the range was adjusted to
-R-40/40/-70.0004681551/-29.9945810754. For scripting
purposes we can extract this original region string using
<br>
grdinfo -Ii. Furthermore, we can also use grdinfo to find
that the grid file header shows its region to be
-R0/80/0/67.9666667. This is the range of x,y we will get
from a <br>
Spherical Mercator projection using
-R-40/40/-70.0004681551/-29.9945810754 and -Jm1. Thus, to
take ship.lonlatgrav and use it to sample the merc_grav.nc,
we can do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt set PROJ_ELLIPSOID
Sphere</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt mapproject
-R-40/40/-70.0004681551/-29.9945810754 -Jm1i ship.lonlatgrav
| gmt grdtrack -Gmerc_grav.nc | gmt mapproject
-R-40/40/-70.0004681551/-29.9945810754 -Jm1i -I &gt;
ship.lonlatgravsat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended to use the
above method of projecting and unprojecting the data in such
an application, because then there is only one interpolation
step (in grdtrack). If one <br>
first tries to convert the grid file to lon,lat and then
sample it, there are two interpolation steps (in conversion
and in sampling).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a lon,lat grid from the
above grid we can use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdproject merc_grav.nc
-R-40/40/-70.0004681551/-29.9945810754 -Jm1i -I -D2m
-Ggrav.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases this will not be
easy as the -R in the two coordinate systems may not align
well. When this happens, we can also use (in fact, it may be
always better to use)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grd2xyz merc_grav.nc | gmt
mapproject -R-40/40/-70.0004681551/-29.994581075 -Jm1i -I |
gmt surface -R-40/40/-70/70 -I2m -Ggrav.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a Mercator map of the
above region, suppose our gmt.conf value for
PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT is inch. Then since the above merc_grav.nc
file is projected with -Jm1i it is 80 <br>
inches wide. We can make a map 8 inches wide by using
-Jx0.1i on any map programs applied to this grid (e.g.,
grdcontour, grdimage, grdview), and then for overlays which
work in <br>
lon,lat (e.g., psxy, pscoast) we can use the above adjusted
-R and -Jm0.1 to get the two systems to match up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, we can be smarter than
this. Realizing that the input img file had pixels 2.0
minutes wide (or checking the nx and ny with grdinfo
merc_grav.nc) we realize that <br>
merc_grav.nc used the full resolution of the img file and it
has 2400 by 2039 pixels, and at 8 inches wide this is 300
pixels per inch. We decide we do not need that many and we
<br>
will be satisfied with 100 pixels per inch, so we want to
average the data into 3 by 3 squares. (If we want a contour
plot we will probably choose to average the data much more
<br>
(e.g., 6 by 6) to get smooth contours.) Since 2039
isn&acirc;t divisible by 3 we will get a different adjusted
-R this time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt img2grd -M
world_grav.img.7.2 -Gmerc_grav_2.nc -R-40/40/-70/-30 -N3
-V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This time we find the adjusted
region is -R-40/40/-70.023256525/-29.9368261101 and the
output is 800 by 601 pixels, a better size for us. Now we
can create an artificial illumi&acirc; <br>
nation file for this using grdgradient:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdgradient merc_grav_2.nc
-Gillum.nc -A0/270 -Ne0.6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and if we also have a CPT called
&acirc;grav.cpt&acirc; we can create a color shaded relief
map like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdimage merc_grav_2.nc
-Iillum.nc -Cgrav.cpt -Jx0.1i -K &gt; map.ps <br>
gmt psbasemap -R-40/40/-70.023256525/-29.9368261101 -Jm0.1i
-Ba10 -O &gt;&gt; map.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose you want to obtain only
the constrained data values from an img file, in lat/lon
coordinates. Then run img2grd with the -T2 option, use
grd2xyz to dump the values, pipe <br>
through grep -v NaN to eliminate NaNs, and pipe through
mapproject with the inverse projection as above.</p>
