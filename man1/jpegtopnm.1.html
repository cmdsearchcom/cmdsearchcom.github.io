<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jpegtopnm - convert JPEG/JFIF file to PPM or PGM image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jpegtopnm [-dct {int|fast|float}] [-nosmooth] [-maxmemory N]
[{-adobe|-notadobe}] [-comments] [-dumpexif]
[-exif=filespec] [-multiple] [-repair] [-verbose]
[-tracelevel N] [file&acirc; <br>
name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtopnm converts JFIF images
to PPM or PGM images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, jpegtopnm expects
the input stream to contain one JFIF image and produces one
PGM or PPM image as output. It fails if the input stream is
empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But with the -multiple option,
jpegtopnm reads JFIF images sequentially from the input
stream and writes one PPM or PGM image to the output stream
for each JFIF input. If the <br>
input stream is empty, so is the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input stream is the filename
you specify or, if you don&rsquo;t specify filename,
Standard Input. The output stream is Standard Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a JFIF input image is of the
grayscale variety, jpegtopnm generates a PGM image.
Otherwise, it generates a PPM image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.11 (October
2002), jpegtopnm did not have the multiple image stream
capability. From 10.11 through 10.22, Netpbm always behaved
as if you specified -multiple. <br>
Starting with Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), Netpbm&rsquo;s
default behavior went back to the pre-10.11 behavior and the
new -multiple option selected the 10.12 behavior. The reason
for <br>
the reversion was that there were discovered in the world
files that contain JFIF images followed by something other
than another JFIF image. The producers of these files expect
<br>
them to work with any JFIF interpreter because most JFIF
interpreters just stop reading the file after the first JFIF
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtopnm uses the Independent
JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library to interpret the input file.
See http://www.ijg.org
&acirc;&uml;http://www.ijg.org&acirc;&copy; for information
on the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;JFIF&rsquo; is the
correct name for the image format commonly known as
&rsquo;JPEG.&rsquo; Strictly speaking, JPEG is a method of
compression. The image format using JPEG compression that is
by <br>
far the most common is JFIF. There is also a subformat of
TIFF that uses JPEG compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIF is an image format that is
a subformat of JFIF (to wit, a JFIF file that contains an
EXIF header as an APP1 marker). jpegtopnm handles EXIF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JFIF files can have either 8
bits per sample or 12 bits per sample. The 8 bit variety is
by far the most common. There are two versions of the IJG
JPEG library. One reads only <br>
8 bit files and the other reads only 12 bit files. You must
link the appropriate one of these libraries with jpegtopnm.
Ordinarily, this means the library is in your shared <br>
library search path when you run jpegtopnm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtopnm generates output with
either one byte or two bytes per sample depending on whether
the JFIF input has either 8 bits or 12 bits per sample. You
can use pamdepth to <br>
reduce a two-byte-per-sample file to a one-byte-per-sample
file if you need to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the JFIF file uses the CMYK
or YCCK color space, the input does not actually contain
enough information to know what color each pixel is. To know
what color a pixel is, one <br>
would have to know the properties of the inks to which the
color space refers. jpegtopnm interprets the colors using
the common transformation which assumes all the inks are
<br>
simply subtractive and linear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the jpegtopnmmanual(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for information on how images
lose quality when you convert to and from JFIF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options are only for advanced users:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct int <br>
Use integer DCT method (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct fast <br>
Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct float <br>
Use floating-point DCT method. The float method is very
slightly more accurate than the int method, but is much
slower unless your machine has very fast floating-point <br>
hardware. Also note that results of the floating-point
method may vary slightly across machines, while the integer
methods should give the same results everywhere. The <br>
fast integer method is much less accurate than the other
two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosmooth <br>
Use a faster, lower-quality upsampling routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxmemory N <br>
Set limit on the amount of memory jpegtopnm uses in
processing large images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or
millions of bytes if &rsquo;M&rsquo; is suffixed to the
number. For <br>
example, -maxmemory 4m selects 4000000 bytes. If jpegtopnm
needs more space, it uses temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notadobe <br>
There are two variations on the CMYK (and likewise YCCK)
color space that may be used in the JFIF input. In the
normal one, a zero value for a color components indicates
<br>
absence of ink. In the other, a zero value means the maximum
ink coverage. The latter is used by Adobe Photoshop when it
creates a bare JFIF output file (but not when it <br>
creates JFIF output as part of Encapsulated Postscript
output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options tell jpegtopnm
which version of the CMYK or YCCK color space the image
uses. If you specify neither, jpegtopnm tries to figure it
out on its own. In the <br>
present version, it doesn&rsquo;t try very hard at all: It
just assumes the Photoshop version, since Photoshop and its
emulators seem to be the main source of CMYK and YCCK <br>
images. But with experience of use, future versions might be
more sophisticated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the JFIF image does not
indicate that it is CMYK or YCCK, these options have no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t use the right
one of these options, the symptom is output that looks like
a negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpexif <br>
Print the interpreted contents of any Exif header in the
input file to the Standard Error file. Similar to the
program jhead (not part of the Netpbm package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was added in Netpbm
9.19 (September 2001).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exif=filespec <br>
Extract the contents of the EXIF header from the input image
and write it to the file filespec. filespec=- means write it
to Standard Output. When you write the EXIF <br>
header to Standard Output, jpegtopnm does not output the
converted image (which is what normally would go to Standard
Output) at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtopnm writes the contents of
the EXIF header byte-for-byte, starting with the two byte
length field (which length includes those two bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this file as input
to pnmtojpeg to insert an identical EXIF header into a new
JFIF image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no EXIF header,
jpegtopnm writes two bytes of binary zero and nothing
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An EXIF header takes the form of
a JFIF APP1 marker. Only the first such marker within the
JFIF header counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was added in Netpbm
9.19 (September 2001).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multiple <br>
Read multiple JFIF images sequentially from the input
stream. See Description section
&acirc;&uml;#description&acirc;&copy; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.23 (July 2004).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-repair <br>
If the JFIF input is invalid, try to salvage whatever
information is there and produce a valid PNM image as
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, some
invalid input causes jpegtopnm to fail, and what output it
produces is undefined. With -repair such invalid input
causes jpegtopnm to succeed <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But note that there are some
forms of invalid input that always cause jpegtopnm to fail
and other than always cause it to salvage image information
and succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One particular case where
-repair makes a difference is the common case that the file
is truncated somewhere after the JFIF header. Without
-repair, that always causes a <br>
failure; with -repair it always causes success. Because the
image information is laid out generally top to bottom in the
JFIF stream, the image jpegtopnm produces in this <br>
case has the proper image contents at the top, but the
bottom is padded with gray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.38.0 (March 2007). Before that, jpegtopnm always fails in
the cases in question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comments <br>
Print any comments in the input file to the Standard Error
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print details about the conversion to the Standard Error
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tracelevel n <br>
Turn on the JPEG library&rsquo;s trace messages to the
Standard Error file. A higher value of n gets more trace
information. -verbose implies a trace level of at least
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example converts the color JFIF file foo.jpg to a PPM
file named foo.ppm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtopnm foo.jpg
&gt;foo.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
You can use pnmquant to color quantize the result, i.e. to
reduce the number of distinct colors in the image. In fact,
you may have to if you want to convert the PPM file to <br>
certain other formats. ppmdither Does a more sophisticated
quantization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use pamscale to change the
dimensions of the resulting image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use ppmtopgm to convert a color
JFIF file to a grayscale PGM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can easily use these
converters together. E.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtopnm foo.jpg | ppmtopgm |
pamscale .25 &gt;foo.pgm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct fast and/or -nosmooth gain
speed at a small sacrifice in quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are fortunate enough to
have very fast floating point hardware, -dct float may be
even faster than -dct fast. But on most machines -dct float
is slower than -dct int; in <br>
this case it is not worth using, because its theoretical
accuracy advantage is too small to be significant in
practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another program, djpeg, is
similar. djpeg is maintained by the Independent JPEG Group
and packaged with the JPEG library which jpegtopnm uses for
all its JPEG work. Because of <br>
that, you may expect it to exploit more current JPEG
features. Also, since you have to have the library to run
jpegtopnm, but not vice versa, cjpeg may be more commonly
avail&acirc; <br>
able.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, djpeg does
not use the NetPBM libraries to generate its output, as all
the NetPBM tools such as jpegtopnm do. This means it is less
likely to be consistent <br>
with all the other programs that deal with the NetPBM
formats. Also, the command syntax of jpegtopnm is consistent
with that of the other Netpbm tools, unlike djpeg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
JPEGMEM <br>
If this environment variable is set, its value is the
default memory limit. The value is specified as described
for the -maxmemory option. An explicit -maxmemory option
<br>
overrides any JPEGMEM.</p>
