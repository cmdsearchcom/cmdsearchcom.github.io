The spreadsheet calculator <i>sc</i> is based on rectangular tables much like a
  financial spreadsheet. When invoked, it first looks for a file in the user's
  home directory called .scrc and if found, reads that file into memory. If that
  file contains the command ``<i>set&#x00A0;scrc</i>'', <i>sc</i> looks for a
  file called .scrc in the current directory, and if found, reads that file into
  memory, too. Next, it reads the options from the command line, and finally, it
  reads in the file or files specified on the command line and presents the data
  in a table organized as rows and columns of cells. If invoked without a
  <i>file</i> argument, the table is initially empty, unless it is running in a
  pipeline, in which case it will read its data from the standard input. If more
  than one file is specified, all files except the first one will be merged. The
  default filename for saving a file with the <i>Put</i> command will be the
  same as the first file specified, and the other files will be treated as
  macros. If you want to use advanced macros from the command line, the ``|''
  must be quoted to prevent it from being expanded by the shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options begin with -. However, an argument of a single - will be interpreted to
  mean that spreadsheet data will be taken from the standard input. This is
  useful for including <i>sc</i> in a pipeline if the system supports pipes.
  However, if standard input is not a terminal, the - is only necessary if there
  are multiple files and standard input is not the last to be read, since
  standard input is automatically read in after all other files in such cases if
  it is not specified explicitly, or if there are no other filenames on the
  command line. If <i>sc</i> is included in a pipeline, and a filename of ``-''
  is not specified, the standard input will be merged in after all of the other
  named files have been processed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first argument not beginning with a -, or a single - by itself, and any
  subsequent arguments will all be interpreted as filenames (a filename of -
  meaning standard input as noted above). In addition, an argument of -- may be
  used to signify that all subsequent arguments should be treated as filenames
  even if they begin with a -, but unlike -, -- won't be treated as a filename
  itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each cell may have associated with it a numeric value, a label string, and/or an
  expression (formula) which evaluates to a numeric value or label string, often
  based on other cell values.

  Initialization File</a></h2>
When <i>sc</i> first starts, it looks for a file in the user's home directory
  called .scrc and if found, loads it into memory. The format of this file is
  the same as any other <i>sc</i> file, but should be reserved for setting
  certain defaults. Any options set which have equivalent command line options
  may be overridden by the command line. If that file contains the command
  ``<i>set&#x00A0;scrc</i>'', <i>sc</i> will then look for a file called .scrc
  in the current directory, and if found, load that file into memory, too (this
  is analogous to the ``set exrc'' command used by vi/ex). These ``dotfiles''
  may be created by any text editor. Several commands exist specifically for
  setting default file name extensions in the .scrc file, although they may also
  be used from macros, ordinary spreadsheet files, or from within <i>sc</i> at
  the command line. They will not, however, be saved along with the file. The
  extensions should be quoted, and should not include the preceding `.' (e.g.,
  <i>scext&#x00A0;&quot;sc&quot;</i> will add the extension <i>.sc</i> ). These
  commands are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>scext</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the default extension for normal <i>sc</i> files
      (those created with the <i>Put</i> command). If this command is not used,
      all <i>sc</i> files will be saved without an extension, and any existing
      extension will not be removed. Setting this option causes all <i>sc</i>
      files to be saved with the specified extension added, unless it is already
      present. If the file name already has an extension of <i>.sc,</i> it will

The screen is divided into four regions. The top line is for entering commands
  and displaying cell values. The second line is for messages from <i>sc</i>.
  The third line and the first four columns show the column and row numbers,
  from which are derived cell addresses, e.g. <i>A0</i> for the cell in column
  A, row 0. Note that column names are case-insensitive: you can enter <i>A0</i>
  or <i>a0</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The rest of the screen forms a window looking at a portion of the table. The
  total number of display rows and columns available, hence the number of table
  rows and columns displayed, is set by <i>curses</i>(3) and may be overridden
  by setting the <small>LINES</small> and <small>COLUMNS</small> environment
  variables, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The screen has two cursors: a cell cursor, indicated by either a highlighted
  cell or a ``&lt;'' on the screen, and a character cursor, indicated by the
  terminal's hardware cursor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a cell's numeric value is wider than the column width (see the <i>f</i>
  command), the cell is filled with asterisks. If a cell's label string is wider
  than the column width, it is truncated at the start of the next non-blank cell
  in the row, if any.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cursor control commands and row and column commands can be prefixed by a numeric
  argument which indicates how many times the command is to be executed. You can
  type <i>^U</i> before a repeat count if quick numeric entry mode is enabled.

      expressions of some sort, such as totals). If autowrap is also enabled, it

      insert mode and append a `+' or `-' to the existing contents of the cell,
      allowing the user to easily add to or subtract from the current numeric
      contents of the cell. The cursor controls (<i>^P</i>, <i>^N</i>, or any of

      command to set the value of craction. After selecting this option, you
      will be prompted for the direction you want to move. Valid directions are
      down (craction=1) and to the right (craction=2). Pressing j, ^N, or the

The quick numeric entry, newline action and set newline action limits options
  can be combined to allow very quick entry of large amounts of data. If all the
  data to be entered is in a single row or column then setting the quick numeric
  entry and the appropriate newline action will allow the numbers to be entered
  without any explicit commands to position the current cell or enter a number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the data entry involves several entries in each row for many rows, then
  setting the quick numeric entry option, setting the newline action to move
  right after each entry and setting the newline action limits on the last
  column on which data should be entered will allow the data to entered quickly.
  An alternative to setting newline action limits is to enclose the range for
  entry in a frame (see &quot;Framed Ranges&quot; below), and setting the
  autowrap option. Setting autoinsert will insert new rows as needed if the
  frame includes data at the bottom. If necessary, columns which do not need
  data to be entered can be hidden with the <b>z</b> command. Similar
  arrangements can be made for entering several rows of data in each

<div class="Pp"></div>
The following <i>Set</i> options are considered personal preferences, or are
  terminal dependent, and are therefore not saved when saving a file, but are
  instead intended for use in a user's .scrc file.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>braille</b>/<b>!braille</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set/clear braille enhancement mode. When braille
      enhancement mode is set, the cursor behaves in a manner that makes the use
      of <i>sc</i> much easier when using a braille display. In spite of its
      name, this mode also works well with screen readers such as SpeakUp, and
      can even be used by sighted users to make cutting and pasting using the
      <i>screen</i> program much easier.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are actually two different braille modes. When the braille option is
      set, the <i>C</i> command, which is normally used to set colors, will
      instead change from one braille mode to the other. If it is desired to
      set/change colors so you can share files with others not using a braille
      display, braille mode will have to be switched off temporarily, and then
      switched back on after the color operation is done.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When the braille option is set, the default braille mode will cause the
      cursor to be positioned at the left edge of the current cell, while the
      alternate braille mode will cause the cursor to be placed at the beginning
      of the top line, which will contain information such as the current cell
      address, contents of the cell, and column formatting information. The
      column names will also be moved to the left edge of their respective
      columns in order to remain aligned with the cursor as it moves up and down
      the column.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In either mode, the cursor will be placed in the top line when editing a
      line, except when switching to navigate mode, in which case the cursor
      will be placed in either the current cell (default braille mode) or the
      second line, where the cell address or default range will be displayed
      (alternate braille mode).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Whenever a message is displayed on the second line, such as an error message
      or prompt for further information, both modes will cause the cursor to be
      placed at the beginning of that message. After this message goes away, the
      cursor will revert to its former behavior. The easiest way to make this
      message go away without effecting anything, except in the cases where it
      is asking the user for more information, is to press <i>CC</i>, which
      effectively changes modes twice, with a net effect of leaving <i>sc</i> in
      the original mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>locale</b>/<b>!locale</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If locale support is compiled into <i>sc</i>, this option
      will cause certain locale-dependent behaviors, such as the display of
      numbers and the determination of word boundaries for some operations in
      edit mode. Note that if this option is set and the environment variable
      LC_ALL is unrecognized, unset, or set to either ``POSIX'' or ``C'', commas
      in format commands will be ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>cellcur</b>/<b>!cellcur</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set/clear current cell highlighting mode. This option is

      preference, and therefore is not saved when saving a file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>scrc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It tells <i>sc</i> to also read the file .scrc in the
      current directory when starting. Settings in this file will override those
      in $HOME/.scrc but may themselves be overridden by command line options.
      Setting this could be a potential security risk, since starting <i>sc</i>
      with an unknown .scrc could potentially execute arbitrary commands. This
      risk is probably very slight, since a spreadsheet program is not likely to
      be run in just any directory, and should <b>never</b> be run as root.</dd>

      cursor goes directly to that cell. If a quoted regular expression such as
      &quot; <i>Tax Table</i> &quot; or &quot; <i>^Jan [0-9]*$</i> &quot; is

  Entry and Editing Commands</a></h2>
Cells can contain both a numeric value and a string value. Either value can be
  the result of an expression, but not both at once, i.e. each cell can have
  only one expression associated with it. Entering a valid numeric expression
  alters the cell's previous numeric value, if any, and replaces the cell's
  previous string expression, if any, leaving only the previously computed
  constant label string. Likewise, entering a valid string expression alters the
  cell's the previous label string, if any, and replaces the cell's previous
  numeric expression, if any, leaving only the previously computed constant
  numeric value.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>=</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enter a numeric constant or expression into the current
      cell. <i>sc</i> prompts for the expression on the top line. The usual way
      to enter a number into a cell is to type ``='', then enter the number in
      response to the prompt on the top line. The quick numeric entry option,
      enabled through the <b>-n</b> option or <i>^T</i> command, shows the
      prompt when you enter the first digit of a number (you can skip typing
      ``=''). If you want to begin entering an expression in the current cell,
      but you want to start out in navigate mode (e.g. to enter cell addresses,
      or sums of ranges using ``@sum''), use the ``+'' command instead (see

      format strings allowed: standard numeric and date. (Note: these format
      strings may also be used with the <i>f</i> command to create user-defined
      format types.) The following characters can be used to build a standard

  <dd class="It-tag">Digit placeholder. If the number has fewer digits on either
      side of the decimal point than there are `#' characters in the format, the
      extra `#' characters are ignored. The number is rounded to the number of
      digit placeholders as there are to the right of the decimal point. If

      is set, the decimal point for the user's current locale will be used when
      formatting a number. Note that numbers smaller than 1 will begin with a
      decimal point if the left side of the decimal point contains only a `#'
      digit placeholder. Use a `0' placeholder to get a leading zero in decimal
      formats.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Percentage. For each `%' character in the format, the

      the same position as it is in the format.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>,</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Thousands separator. The presence of a `,' in the format
      (multiple commas are treated as one) will cause the number to be formatted
      with a `,' separating each set of three digits in the integer part of the
      number with numbering beginning from the right end of the integer. If
      <i>locale</i> is set, the thousands separator for the user's current
      locale will be used in place of the comma. If the environment variable
      LC_ALL is unset, unrecognized, or is set to ``POSIX'' or ``C'', any commas

  <dd class="It-tag">Scientific format. Causes the number to be formatted in
      scientific notation. The case of the `E' or `e' given is preserved. If the
      format uses a `+', then the sign is always given for the exponent value.
      If the format uses a `-', then the sign is only given when the exponent
      value is negative. Note that if there is no digit placeholder following
      the `+' or `-', then that part of the formatted number is left out. In
      general, there should be one or more digit placeholders after the `+' or
      `-'.</dd>

      and the range is highlighted, starting at the cell where you typed
      <small>TAB,</small> and continuing through the current cell. Pressing
      <small>TAB</small> again causes the highlighted range to be inserted into
      the command line, the highlighting to be turned off, and the previous mode

      as <i>@sum</i>(). Pressing ``)'' acts just like typing the

  <dd class="It-tag">Run macros. There are two different kinds of macros that
      can be used with <i>sc</i>: simple macros, which are stored in plain text
      files, and advanced macros, which are executable files, and which can be
      written in the language of your choice. Advanced macros are only available
      on systems that support pipes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Simple macros are interpreted by <i>sc</i>'s internal parser, and use the
      same commands used to enter data and perform other operations (the single
      key commands are shortcuts which switch to input mode after first entering
      the beginning of the full command for you). These are also the same
      commands found in <i>sc</i> files created with the Put command. Since
      <i>sc</i> files are saved as ASCII files, it is possible to use them as
      primitive macro definition files. The <i>Run</i> command makes this
      easier. It's like the <i>Merge</i> command, but prints a saved path name
      as the start of the filename to merge in. The string to use is set with
      the <i>Define</i> command. To write macros, you must be familiar with the
      file format written by the <i>Put</i> command.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Advanced macros use executable files that are started by <i>sc</i> as a
      child process with stdin and stdout redirected back to <i>sc</i> for
      bidirectional communication. Special commands are available for requesting
      information such as cell contents, formatting information, or the current
      location of the cell cursor. Commands are written to stdout, and responses
      are read from stdin. To use advanced macros, the filename must be preceded
      by a | (the pipe symbol), and the file must be executable. If the pathname
      set with the <i>Define</i> command begins with a |, all files in that path
      will be executed as advanced macros. It is also possible to include a
      filename as part of the path when using advanced macros, which allows you
      to put multiple macros in a single file, and use the <i>Run</i> command to
      add command line arguments or options to determine which macro should be
      run. Advanced macros are relatively new, and documentation is still
      incomplete. This feature will probably be enhanced in future
    releases.</dd>

All file operations take a filename as the first argument to the prompt on the
  top line. The prompt supplies a &quot; to aid in typing in the filename. The
  filename can also be obtained from a cell's label string or string expression.
  In this case, delete the leading &quot; with the backspace key and enter a
  cell name such as <i>a22</i> instead. If the resulting string starts with
  ``|'', the rest of the string is interpreted as a <small>UNIX</small> command,
  as above.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Row_and_Column_Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Row_and_Column_Commands">Row
  and Column Commands</a></h2>
These are two-letter commands which can be used on either rows or columns. The
  exceptions are the <i>f</i> command, which only works on columns, and
  therefore doesn't require a second letter, and the <i>p</i> command which, in
  addition to operating on rows or columns, has several other options for
  merging the data in directly, without opening up a new row or column. There
  are also a few special cases where pressing the same letter twice will affect
  only the current cell instead of a row or column (except for <i>ZZ</i>, which
  is a special case all its own).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In all of the remaining cases, the second letter of the command will be either
  <i>r</i> or <i>c</i>, depending on whether the operation should be performed
  on rows or columns, respectively (additional options for the <i>p</i> command
  and the double letter cases are listed below). A small menu lists the choices
  for the second letter when you type the first letter of one of these commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, you may define a range of rows or columns by moving the cell
  cursor, either a cell at a time, or by pages (roughly 1/2 screen, unless the
  <i>pagesize</i> option has been set), but this only works for the <i>d</i>,
  <i>y</i>, and <i>Z</i> commands. Vertical cursor movement will begin
  highlighting rows, and horizontal movement will highlight columns. Pressing
  the <small>RETURN</small> key will then perform the chosen operation on the
  specified rows/columns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Commands which copy cells also modify the row and column references in affected
  cell expressions. The references may be frozen by using the <i>@fixed</i>
  operator or using the <i>$</i> character in the reference to the cell (see
  below). Commands which create new rows or columns will include all newly
  created cells in the same ranges (named, framed, color, or those used in
  expressions) as their counterparts in the current row or column. This can
  sometimes be a significant factor when deciding whether to use
  <i>ir</i>/<i>ic</i> or <i>or</i>/<i>oc</i>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">Insert a new row (column) by moving the row (column)

      copy the portion of each row contained in that range, while ignoring
      everything outside the range.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>pr, pc, pp, pm, px, pt, pC, p.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pull deleted rows/columns/cells back into the spreadsheet.
      The last set of cells that was deleted or yanked is put back into the
      spreadsheet at the current location. <i>pr</i> inserts enough rows to hold
      the data. <i>pc</i> inserts enough columns to hold the data. <i>pp</i>
      (paste) does not insert rows or columns; it overwrites the cells beginning
      at the current cell cursor location. <i>pm</i> (merge) merges the cells in
      at the current cell cursor location, but does not erase the destination
      range first like <i>pp</i>. The difference between <i>pp</i> and <i>pm</i>
      is similar to the difference between the <i>Get</i> and <i>Merge</i>
      commands. <i>pf</i> (format) works like <i>pm</i> except that only cell
      formatting information is merged in, leaving the actual data untouched.
      This makes it easy to copy cell formats from one part of the spreadsheet
      to another, such as when expanding an existing spreadsheet file. <i>px</i>
      (exchange) copies the contents of the delete buffer into the range
      beginning at the current cell cursor location, while simultaneously
      copying the contents of this range back into the delete buffer, replacing
      its current contents. <i>pt</i> (transpose) overwrites the cells beginning
      at the current cell cursor location like <i>pp,</i> but transposes rows
      for columns and vice versa. <i>pC</i> (copy) works like <i>pp,</i> except
      that all cell references are adjusted in the same way that they are for
      the <i>copy</i> command. <i>p.</i> is the same as <i>pC,</i> except that
      it switches to navigate mode and allows you to define the destination
      range to be used. This works like the <i>copy</i> command in that if the
      source range (the contents of the delete buffer) is a single row, column,
      or cell, multiple copies may be made.</dd>

      or columns are not printed by the <i>W</i> command. The <i>ZZ</i> command
      is a special case. It does not hide anything. Instead, the file will be

  Commands</a></h2>
Range operations affect a rectangular region on the screen defined by the upper
  left and lower right cells in the region. All of the commands in this class
  begin with ``r''; the second letter of the command indicates which command. A
  small menu lists the choices for the second letter when you type ``r''.
  <i>sc</i> prompts for needed parameters for each command. Phrases surrounded
  by square brackets in the prompt are informational only and may be erased with
  the backspace key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prompts requesting variable names may be satisfied with either an explicit
  variable name, such as <i>A10</i>, or with a variable name previously defined
  in a <i>rd</i> command (see below). Range name prompts require either an
  explicit range such as <i>A10:B20</i>, or a range name previously defined with
  a <i>rd</i> command. A default range shown in the second line is used if you
  omit the range from the command or press the <small>TAB</small> key (see
  below). The default range can be changed by moving the cell cursor via the
  control commands (<i>^P</i> or <i>^N</i>) or the arrow keys. The cells in the
  default range are highlighted (using the terminal's standout mode, if
  available).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>rx</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clear a range. Cells cleared with this command will be

      of the <i>pull</i> commands. This command differs from <i>rx</i>, however,
      in that the original cells will not be cleared. Although this command may
      be used to copy a range of cells, it treats all references as fixed. Use
      <i>rc</i> if you want references to be relative to the cell which contains
      them unless specified otherwise, either with the <i>@fixed</i> operator or
      using the <i>$</i> character in the reference to the cell.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>rc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Copy a source range to a destination range. The source and
      destination may be different sizes. The result is always one or more full
      copies of the source. Copying a row to a row yields a row. Copying a
      column to a column yields a column. Copying a range to anything yields a
      range. Copying a row to a column or a column to a row yields a range with
      as many copies of the source as there are cells in the destination. This
      command can be used to duplicate a cell through an arbitrary range by
      making the source a single cell range such as <i>b20:b20</i>.

    If the source range is omitted (second argument), the source range from the

      If both the source range and destination range are omitted, the current
      cell will be used as the destination, unless a range is currently

      three parts, all of which are mandatory. The first part is a single

      whether the sort should be done in ascending or descending order,
      respectively. The second part, which is also a single character, must be
      either <i>#</i> or <i>$</i>, and is used to specify whether the sort
      should be based on the numeric portion or the string portion,
      respectively, of the cells being used for the comparison. The third part
      may be either one or two characters, and must be alphabetic (case
      insensitive), and specifies the column to be used when making the
      comparisons. This column must be in the range being sorted. Any number of
      criteria may be concatenated, and will be used in the order specified. If
      no criteria are specified, the default behavior is to sort in ascending
      order, first by string and then by number, using the leftmost column of
      the range being sorted. This is equivalent to specifying the sort criteria
      to be &quot; +$a+#a &quot;<i>,</i> where both <i>a</i>'s are replaced by

      must remain onscreen whenever the cell cursor is within that range. In
      other words, a frame consists of an outer range and an inner range, where
      the inner range is allowed to scroll within the outer range. Once a frame
      is defined, the inner range may be resized, but the outer range remains
      fixed unless rows or columns are added or deleted within the range.

    When this command is invoked, you will be prompted for the type of

      from the list by typing its first letter.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The options are <i>top</i>, <i>bottom</i>, <i>left</i>, <i>right</i>,
      <i>all</i>, and <i>unframe.</i> If you choose <i>top</i>, <i>bottom</i>,
      <i>left</i>, or <i>right,</i> you will be prompted for a range and number
      of rows/columns. The range may be omitted if the cell cursor is in a
      previously defined framed range, in which case that range's outer range
      will be used instead. The number of rows/columns will set or adjust the
      width of the corresponding side of the frame. If all of these widths are
      set to zero, the frame will be undefined (same as the unframe command).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you choose <i>all</i>, you will be prompted for an outer range and an
      inner range, in which case the inner range will scroll within the outer
      range, and any rows or columns outside of the inner range, but inside the
      outer range will be part of the ``frame'' that is to remain onscreen. The
      outer range may be omitted if the cell cursor is in a previously defined
      framed range, in which case the previously defined outer range will be
      used. However, if a single range is specified on the command line, while
      another range wholly contained within this range is highlighted, the
      specified range will be used as the outer range, and the highlighted range
      will be used as the inner range. If no range is specified on the command
      line, but a range is highlighted, and the highlighted range is wholly
      contained within a previously defined framed range, the highlighted range
      will be used as the inner range, and the previously defined outer range
      will be used as the outer range.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you choose <i>unframe,</i> you will be prompted for a range, and if the
      range is found in the list of frames, the frame will be deleted, and the
      framing will no longer be active (the specified range must be the outer
      range of the previously defined frame to be deleted). The range may be
      omitted if the cell cursor is in a previously defined framed range, in
      which case that range will be used by default.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Framed ranges may not be nested or overlapping. If you try to define a range

  Commands</a></h2>
A note is a cell or range of cells that can be jumped to quickly from another
  cell by creating a special link in that cell. The note may contain text
  explaining the contents of the cell containing the link, similar to a
  footnote, or it may simply be another part of the spreadsheet that is related
  to the cell in some way. When you press the `n' key, you will get a short
  prompt asking you whether you want to add or delete a note, or to ``show'' (by
  highlighting) which cells on the screen have attached notes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a cell with an attached note contains numeric data, it will be preceded with
  an ``*''. If color is available and turned on, the ``*'' will be displayed
  with color 4. Also, the note address will be displayed in curly braces on the
  top line, preceded by an ``*'', when the cell is current (e.g.
  <i>{*AC30:AE43}</i> or <i>{*note1}</i> for a named range). You may also use
  the <i>*s</i> (Note/Show) command to highlight all cells on the current screen
  with attached notes.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>*a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Add a note. This will bring up the addnote command in the

      to add the note. If you omit the note address or range, the currently
      highlighted range, if any, will be used. Otherwise, the current cell will

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Color_Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Color_Commands">Color
  Commands</a></h2>
Color may be enabled by setting the color option (``set color''), or by toggling
  it with ^TC (control-T followed by an uppercase C). If color is enabled, you
  may define up to eight color pairs, each consisting of a foreground color and
  a background color. Each of these colors may be defined by an expression which
  is evaluated at the same time the rest of the spreadsheet is evaluated. Color
  expressions may be simple, specifying only a foreground color and a background
  color, or they may be arbitrarily complex, causing the colors to change based
  upon other data in the spreadsheet, for example. Color ranges may then be
  defined using the <i>rC</i> command, with a color number (1-8) assigned to the
  range (see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some of the color numbers may have special meaning under certain circumstances,
  but may also be used explicitly at the same time. For example, color 1 is the
  default color pair if color is enabled but no color has been defined for a
  given cell. It is also the color used for the column and row labels and the
  top two lines of the display, which are used for prompts, input, error
  messages, etc. Color 2, while not explicitly used for all negative numbers,
  will be used for negative numbers in cells which have no other color defined
  when colorneg is turned on (``set colorneg'' or ^TN). This is because colorneg
  causes all cells with negative numbers to have their color number incremented
  by one (cycling back to color 1 if the cell is defined as using color 8).
  Color 3 is used for all cells with errors (ERROR or INVALID), if colorerr is
  set (``set colorerr'' or ^TE), regardless of which color they have been
  defined to use, or whether they have been defined to use any color at all.
  Color 4 is used to highlight the ``*'' which signifies that a cell has a note
  attached.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If two color ranges are nested or overlapping, any cell that is common to both
  will be displayed using the color of the most recently defined color range.
  You can list all color definitions and color ranges with the rS (show) command
  (see below).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>C</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command first prompts you for the color number you
      would like to define (or redefine). After selecting a number (1-8), you
      may enter an expression which defines the foreground and background
      colors. If the chosen color has previously been defined, the old
      definition will be presented for editing. The syntax of the color command
      is:</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">where <i>number</i> is the number of the color pair you
      want to define, and <i>expression</i> is the definition. If the expression
      is missing, the specified color number will be unset (it will revert to
      its default start-up colors). Unlike setting it explicitly to its original
      value, this will not cause the expression to be written to the file when

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Color expressions are exactly like any other numeric expression, and may contain
  any function or operator that is valid in any other numeric expression. There
  are, however special functions designed specifically for defining colors.
  These functions are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <br/>
     @black
    <br/>
     @red
    <br/>
     @green
    <br/>
     @yellow
    <br/>
     @blue
    <br/>
     @magenta
    <br/>
     @cyan
    <br/>
     @white</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although these function names are intended to reflect the color they produce,
  and use the same names as the curses colors, @yellow may appear as brown on
  many displays, especially those based on the VGA standard.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to special functions for specifying colors, there is also a special
  operator for combining two such colors into a single number which specifies
  both a foreground and a background color. This operator is the semicolon (;).
  For example, the command
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>color 1 = @white;@green</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will set the foreground color to white and the background color to green for any
  cell or range of cells defined to use color 1, or which have no color defined.
  If the semicolon operator is not used, and only one color is specified, that
  color will be used for the foreground, and the background will default to
  black.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although the above example is the easiest way to specify foreground and
  background colors, and will probably meet most people's needs, <i>sc</i>
  allows much more power and flexibility, should the need arise, due to the fact
  that any color can be specified by an expression. For example,
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>color 5 =
      B23&lt;E75?(@black;@cyan):(@white;@magenta)</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will cause all cells defined with color 5 to be displayed as black text on a
  cyan background if the numeric value in cell B23 is less than the numeric
  value in cell E75; otherwise, they will be displayed as white text on a
  magenta background. If you prefer to have the foreground and background colors
  dependent on different criteria, you could do something like this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>color 5 =
      (B23&lt;E75?@white:@cyan);(D5%2?@red:@blue)</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will cause the text color for color 5 to be either white or cyan, depending
  on the numeric values in cells B23 and E75, as in the previous example, and
  the background color to be either red or blue, depending on whether the
  numeric value in cell D5 is odd or even.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that although a color expression may contain any function which is valid in
  any other numeric expression, the @myrow and @mycol functions will always
  evaluate to 0. This is because a color expression is not tied to any
  particular cell, but is instead evaluated once, and the result used for all
  cells defined to use that color.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also note that if a color expression results in an error, the color will default
  to black text on a black background. If color 1 results in an error, color
  will be disabled so that you can see the input line to correct the error,
  after which color will need to be reenabled manually.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Default colors are in effect for all colors until defined otherwise. These
  default colors are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <br/>
     color 1 = @white;@blue
    <br/>
     color 2 = @red;@blue
    <br/>
     color 3 = @white;@red
    <br/>
     color 4 = @black;@yellow
    <br/>
     color 5 = @black;@cyan
    <br/>
     color 6 = @red;@cyan
    <br/>
     color 7 = @white;@black
    <br/>
     color 8 = @red;@black</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Abbreviations. You may set abbreviations to speed up the
      entry of repetitive data. Abbreviations work much like abbreviations in
      vi, except that when defining an abbreviation, both the abbreviation and
      the expanded text must be contained within quotes, separated by a single
      space. If more than one space separates the abbreviation from the expanded
      text, it will be included as part of the expanded text.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are three types of abbreviations available in sc. In the first type,
      all characters must be either alphanumeric or ``_''. In the second type,
      the last character must be alphanumeric or ``_'', but all other characters
      must not be alphanumeric or ``_''. Neither type may contain spaces. The
      third type of abbreviation is a single character, and must be alphanumeric
      or ``_''.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When using abbreviations, the first type must be at the beginning of the
      line, or must be preceded by any character which is not alphanumeric or
      ``_''. The second type must be at the beginning of the line, or must be
      preceded either by an alphanumeric character, ``_'', or a space. Single
      character abbreviations must be at the beginning of the line or preceded
      by a space.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Abbreviations will be automatically expanded as soon as the space bar or
      return key is pressed, or when pressing the ESC key at the end of the
      abbreviation to switch to edit mode. You can also force an abbreviation to
      be expanded by following it with a <i>^]</i>, which won't be inserted into
      the line. If you don't want an abbreviation to be expanded, you must
      either press <i>^V</i> twice or switch to edit mode and back again
      somewhere within the abbreviation (pressing <i>^V</i> twice also has the
      effect of switching to navigate mode and back again).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the string in the abbreviation command contains no spaces, the entire
      string will be looked up in the list of abbreviations, and if found, the
      definition will be displayed in the form of the original
      <i>abbreviation</i> command used to define it. When looking up an
      abbreviation in this manner, be sure to disable abbreviation expansion, as
      described above, or the results may not be what you expect.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the string is empty, a list of all abbreviations and their corresponding
      expanded text will be output to your pager. Note that abbreviations are
      not saved with the file. This allows each user to create his own file of
      abbreviations and either merge them in or include them in his own .scrc
      file, rather than force all users who access a file to use the same list
      of abbreviations.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Variable_Names"><a class="selflink" href="#Variable_Names">Variable
  Names</a></h2>
Normally, a variable name is just the name of a cell, such as <i>K20</i>. The
  value is the numeric or string value of the cell, according to context.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a cell's expression (formula) is copied to another location via <i>copy</i>
  or <i>range-copy</i>, variable references are by default offset by the amount
  the formula moved. This allows the new formula to work on new data. If cell
  references are not to change, you can either use the <i>@fixed</i> operator
  (see below), or one of the following variations on the cell name.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>K20</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">References cell <i>K20</i>; the reference changes when the
      formula is copied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$</b><i>K</i><b>$</b><i>20</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Always refers to cell <i>K20</i>; the reference stays fixed
      when the formula is copied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$</b><i>K20</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Keeps the column fixed at column K; the row is free to

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>K</i><b>$</b><i>20</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Similarly, this fixes the row and allows the column to
      vary.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These conventions also hold on defined ranges. Range references vary when
  formulas containing them are copied. If the range is defined with fixed
  variable references, the references do not change.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>@fixed</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To make a variable not change automatically when a cell
      moves, put the word <i>@fixed</i> in front of the reference, for example:

Numeric expressions used with the ``='' and <i>e</i> commands have a fairly
  conventional syntax. Terms may be constants, variable names, parenthesized
  expressions, and negated terms. Ranges may be operated upon with range
  functions such as sum (<i>@sum</i>()) and average (<i>@avg</i>()). Terms may
  be combined using binary operators.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Built-in_Range_Functions"><a class="selflink" href="#Built-in_Range_Functions">Built-in
  Range Functions</a></h2>
These functions return numeric values. The @sum, @prod, @avg, @count, @max,
  @min, and @stddev functions may take an optional second argument which is an
  expression that is to be evaluated for each cell in the specified range to
  determine which cells to include in the function. Only those cells for which
  the expression evaluates to true (non-zero) will be used in calculating the
  value of the function. Before evaluation for each cell, the expression is
  first converted as if it was being copied from the cell in the upper left-hand
  corner of the range into the cell under consideration, with all cell
  references adjusted accordingly. Because the parts of the expression that
  should remain fixed during the evaluation of the function may not necessarily
  be the same as those which should remain fixed during an actual copy
  operation, the rules for adjusting cell references during a copy operation are
  slightly different than normal. In particular, these rules differ in two
  different ways.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first difference is that the <i>@fixed</i> operator is ignored during a copy
  operation unless it is enclosed in parentheses. This is so that selected cells
  whose addresses should remain fixed during any given evaluation of a range
  function can be adjusted relative to the cell containing the range function
  when copied (the <i>$</i> prefix is still honored for these cells when
  copying). Enclosing the <i>@fixed</i> operator in parentheses will have the
  opposite effect. That is, it will cause cell references to be fixed while
  copying, while allowing them to be adjusted when the function is being
  evaluated, subject to any <i>$</i> prefixes present. Note that only the
  <i>@fixed</i> operator itself should be enclosed in parentheses for this to
  work properly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The second difference is that any references in the expression that refer to
  cells in the range in the first argument of the range function will have any
  <i>$</i> prefixes ignored, and the references will be treated instead as if
  they had the same <i>$</i> prefixes as the left side of the range argument.
  For example, if the left side of the range argument (the cell address on the
  left side of the colon) has a fixed row, but does not have a fixed column, any
  cell references that refer to cells in that range will also have a fixed row,
  but will not have a fixed column. This is so that if the range reference moves
  when copying, references to any cells in that range will also move
  accordingly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the test expression will be evaluated once for every cell in the
  range, which means that excessive use of these functions with the optional
  test expression, or the use of overly complex test expressions or with very
  large ranges can greatly slow down the recalculation of a spreadsheet, and may
  require turning off autocalc for speed, and then manually recalculating with
  the <i>@</i> command.

String expressions are made up of constant strings (characters surrounded by
  double quotation marks), variables (cell names, which refer to the cells's
  label strings or expressions), and string functions. Note that string
  expressions are only allowed when entering a cell's label string, not its

Re-evaluation of spreadsheet expressions is done by row or by column depending

  <i>iterations</i> times for each update if necessary, so forward references
  usually work as expected. See <i>set</i> above. If stability is not reached
  after ten iterations, a warning is printed. This is usually due to a long
  series of forward references, or to unstable cyclic references (for example,
  set <i>A0</i>'s expression to ``A0+1'').

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Programmable_Function_Keys"><a class="selflink" href="#Programmable_Function_Keys">Programmable
  Function Keys</a></h2>
Function keys can be used in <i>sc</i> if your terminal supports them, and they
  are programmable. To program the function keys, you use the <i>fkey</i>
  command. This command may be used in a <i>.scrc</i> file or a macro file, or
  it may be entered directly into <i>sc</i>'s command line. Defined function
  keys will be saved with the file. There is no shortcut, as there is with most
  commands, so the full command must be typed in. Pressing enter when not
  editing a line will start you off with a blank line for this purpose. The
  format of the <i>fkey</i> command is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>fkey</b> <i>n</i> = <i>&quot;command&quot;</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>n</i> is the function key number (n = 1 for F1, n = 2 for F2, etc.),
  and <i>command</i> is the command to be run. For example,
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>fkey 2 = &quot;merge
      \&quot;|~/scmacros/macro1\&quot;&quot;</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will run the macro called <i>macro1</i> located in a subdirectory of your home
  directory called <i>scmacros</i> when the F2 key is pressed. Note that
  embedded quotes must be escaped by a backslash. If you want to include the
  cell address of the current cell in the command line, you may do so by
  entering ``$$'' in its place in the command. For example,
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>fkey 5 = &quot;fmt $$ \&quot;^D%A\&quot;&quot;</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will cause the F5 key to format the current cell to display the full weekday
  name of the numeric date value stored there. The ^D is a CTRL-D character,
  which denotes a date format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although it may be overridden by the <i>fkey</i> command, the F1 key is
  predefined by default to execute <i>man sc.</i> Unlike the user-defined
  function keys, this definition will also work in edit, insert, replace, and
  navigate modes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To undefine a function key, merely define it as the empty string (&quot;&quot;).
  Undefining the F1 key will restore the default behavior.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Plugins"><a class="selflink" href="#Plugins">Plugins</a></h2>
There are three ways in which external programs can be used as plugins with
  <i>sc</i>. First, they can be used as external commands. When used as an
  external command, any command not recognized by <i>sc</i> will be searched for
  first in $HOME/.sc/plugins, and then in /usr/share/doc/sc/plugins. If found,
  it will be run with its standard input and standard output redirected back to
  <i>sc</i>. These are used to send commands to, and receive responses back from
  <i>sc</i> in the same way that advanced macros do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second and third ways that programs can be used as plugins with <i>sc</i>
  are to automatically convert files to and from <i>sc</i> format based on their
  extensions. In order to use them in this way, you must first associate a given
  extension to a corresponding plugin (for reading) or plugout (for writing)
  using the <i>plugin</i> and <i>plugout</i> commands. These commands should be
  placed in your <i>.scrc</i> file, and have the following syntax:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>plugin</b> <i>&quot;ext&quot;</i> =
      <i>&quot;programname&quot;</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>plugout</b> <i>&quot;ext&quot;</i> =
      <i>&quot;programname&quot;</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>ext</i> is the extension and <i>programname</i> is the name of the
  plugin program to be used for filenames with that extension. For input, the
  plugin merely reads the specified file, performs whatever conversion is
  necessary, and writes the resulting data to standard output. For output, the
  plugin writes <i>sc</i> commands to standard output and reads the replies from
  standard input in the same way that an advanced macro would, and then converts
  the data to the appropriate format and writes it to a file with the specified
  filename.
