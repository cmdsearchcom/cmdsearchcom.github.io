<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vim [options] [file ..] <br>
vim [options] - <br>
vim [options] -t tag <br>
vim [options] -q [errorfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ex gex <br>

rvim rview rgvim rgview</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Vim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi. It
can be used to edit all kinds of plain text. It is
especially useful for editing programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a lot of enhancements
above Vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers,
syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename
completion, on-line help, visual selec&acirc; <br>
tion, etc.. See &quot;:help vi_diff.txt&quot; for a summary
of the differences between Vim and Vi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While running Vim a lot of help
can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the
&quot;:help&quot; command. See the ON-LINE HELP section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most often Vim is started to
edit a single file with the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vim file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More generally Vim is started
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vim [options] [filelist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filelist is missing, the
editor will start with an empty buffer. Otherwise exactly
one out of the following four may be used to choose one or
more files to be edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file .. A list of filenames. The
first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.
The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the
buffer. You can get to <br>
the other files with the &quot;:next&quot; command. To edit
a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with
&quot;--&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The file to edit is read from
stdin. Commands are read from stderr, which should be a
TTY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t {tag} The file to edit and
the initial cursor position depends on a &quot;tag&quot;, a
sort of goto label. {tag} is looked up in the tags file, the
associated file becomes the cur&acirc; <br>
rent file and the associated command is executed. Mostly
this is used for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a
function name. The effect is that the file con&acirc; <br>
taining that function becomes the current file and the
cursor is positioned on the start of the function. See
&quot;:help tag-commands&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q [errorfile] <br>
Start in quickFix mode. The file [errorfile] is read and the
first error is displayed. If [errorfile] is omitted, the
filename is obtained from the &rsquo;errorfile&rsquo; <br>
option (defaults to &quot;AztecC.Err&quot; for the Amiga,
&quot;errors.err&quot; on other systems). Further errors can
be jumped to with the &quot;:cn&quot; command. See
&quot;:help quickfix&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vim behaves differently,
depending on the name of the command (the executable may
still be the same file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vim The &quot;normal&quot; way,
everything is default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ex Start in Ex mode. Go to
Normal mode with the &quot;:vi&quot; command. Can also be
done with the &quot;-e&quot; argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">view Start in read-only mode.
You will be protected from writing the files. Can also be
done with the &quot;-R&quot; argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gvim gview <br>
The GUI version. Starts a new window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gex Starts a new gvim window in
Ex mode. Can also be done with the &quot;-e&quot; argument
to gvim</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vimx Starts gvim in
&quot;Vi&quot; mode similar to &quot;vim&quot;, but with
additional features like xterm clipboard support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">evim eview <br>
The GUI version in easy mode. Starts a new window. Can also
be done with the &quot;-y&quot; argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rvim rview rgvim rgview <br>
Like the above, but with restrictions. It will not be
possible to start shell commands, or suspend Vim. Can also
be done with the &quot;-Z&quot; argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options may be given in any order, before or after
filenames. Options without an argument can be combined after
a single dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[num] For the first file the
cursor will be positioned on line &quot;num&quot;. If
&quot;num&quot; is missing, the cursor will be positioned on
the last line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/{pat} For the first file the
cursor will be positioned in the line with the first
occurrence of {pat}. See &quot;:help search-pattern&quot;
for the available search patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+{command}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c {command} <br>
{command} will be executed after the first file has been
read. {command} is interpreted as an Ex command. If the
{command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in <br>
double quotes (this depends on the shell that is used).
Example: Vim &quot;+set si&quot; main.c <br>
Note: You can use up to 10 &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-c&quot;
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S {file} {file} will be sourced
after the first file has been read. This is equivalent to -c
&quot;source {file}&quot;. {file} cannot start with
&rsquo;-&rsquo;. If {file} is omitted &quot;Ses&acirc; <br>
sion.vim&quot; is used (only works when -S is the last
argument).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cmd {command} <br>
Like using &quot;-c&quot;, but the command is executed just
before processing any vimrc file. You can use up to 10 of
these commands, independently from &quot;-c&quot;
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A If Vim has been compiled with
ARABIC support for editing right-to-left oriented files and
Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts Vim in Arabic
mode, i.e. &rsquo;ara&acirc; <br>
bic&rsquo; is set. Otherwise an error message is given and
Vim aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Binary mode. A few options
will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or
executable file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Compatible. Set the
&rsquo;compatible&rsquo; option. This will make Vim behave
mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Start in diff mode. There
should be two, three or four file name arguments. Vim will
open all the files and show differences between them. Works
like vimdiff(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d {device} Open {device} for
use as a terminal. Only on the Amiga. Example: &quot;-d
con:20/30/600/150&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Debugging. Go to debugging
mode when executing the first command from a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Start Vim in Ex mode, just
like the executable was called &quot;ex&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Start Vim in improved Ex
mode, just like the executable was called
&quot;exim&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Foreground. For the GUI
version, Vim will not fork and detach from the shell it was
started in. On the Amiga, Vim is not restarted to open a new
window. This <br>
option should be used when Vim is executed by a program that
will wait for the edit session to finish (e.g. mail). On the
Amiga the &quot;:sh&quot; and &quot;:!&quot; commands will
not <br>
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nofork Foreground. For the GUI
version, Vim will not fork and detach from the shell it was
started in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F If Vim has been compiled with
FKMAP support for editing right-to-left oriented files and
Farsi keyboard mapping, this option starts Vim in Farsi
mode, i.e. &rsquo;fkmap&rsquo; <br>
and &rsquo;rightleft&rsquo; are set. Otherwise an error
message is given and Vim aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g If Vim has been compiled with
GUI support, this option enables the GUI. If no GUI support
was compiled in, an error message is given and Vim
aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Give a bit of help about the
command line arguments and options. After this Vim
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H If Vim has been compiled with
RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left oriented files
and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts Vim in
Hebrew mode, i.e. <br>
&rsquo;hkmap&rsquo; and &rsquo;rightleft&rsquo; are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and Vim aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i {viminfo} <br>
When using the viminfo file is enabled, this option sets the
filename to use, instead of the default
&quot;~/.viminfo&quot;. This can also be used to skip the
use of the .vim&acirc; <br>
info file, by giving the name &quot;NONE&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Same as -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Lisp mode. Sets the
&rsquo;lisp&rsquo; and &rsquo;showmatch&rsquo; options
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Modifying files is disabled.
Resets the &rsquo;write&rsquo; option. You can still modify
the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Modifications not allowed.
The &rsquo;modifiable&rsquo; and &rsquo;write&rsquo; options
will be unset, so that changes are not allowed and files can
not be written. Note that these options <br>
can be set to enable making modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N No-compatible mode. Reset the
&rsquo;compatible&rsquo; option. This will make Vim behave a
bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc
file does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No swap file will be used.
Recovery after a crash will be impossible. Handy if you want
to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy). Can also
be done with <br>
&quot;:set uc=0&quot;. Can be undone with &quot;:set
uc=200&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nb Become an editor server for
NetBeans. See the docs for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o[N] Open N windows stacked.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O[N] Open N windows side by
side. When N is omitted, open one window for each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p[N] Open N tab pages. When N
is omitted, open one tab page for each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Read-only mode. The
&rsquo;readonly&rsquo; option will be set. You can still
edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidentally
overwriting a file. If you do want to <br>
overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command,
as in &quot;:w!&quot;. The -R option also implies the -n
option (see below). The &rsquo;readonly&rsquo; option can be
reset <br>
with &quot;:set noro&quot;. See &quot;:help
&rsquo;readonly&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r List swap files, with
information about using them for recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r {file} Recovery mode. The
swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session. The
swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file
with &quot;.swp&quot; appended. <br>
See &quot;:help recovery&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Silent mode. Only when
started as &quot;Ex&quot; or when the &quot;-e&quot; option
was given before the &quot;-s&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s {scriptin} <br>
The script file {scriptin} is read. The characters in the
file are interpreted as if you had typed them. The same can
be done with the command &quot;:source! <br>
{scriptin}&quot;. If the end of the file is reached before
the editor exits, further characters are read from the
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T {terminal} <br>
Tells Vim the name of the terminal you are using. Only
required when the automatic way doesn&rsquo;t work. Should
be a terminal known to Vim (builtin) or defined in the <br>
termcap or terminfo file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u {vimrc} Use the commands in
the file {vimrc} for initializations. All the other
initializations are skipped. Use this to edit a special kind
of files. It can also be used <br>
to skip all initializations by giving the name
&quot;NONE&quot;. See &quot;:help initialization&quot;
within vim for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U {gvimrc} Use the commands in
the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations. All the other GUI
initializations are skipped. It can also be used to skip all
GUI initializations by <br>
giving the name &quot;NONE&quot;. See &quot;:help
gui-init&quot; within vim for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[N] Verbose. Give messages
about which files are sourced and for reading and writing a
viminfo file. The optional number N is the value for
&rsquo;verbose&rsquo;. Default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Start Vim in Vi mode, just
like the executable was called &quot;vi&quot;. This only has
effect when the executable is called &quot;ex&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w {scriptout} <br>
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit Vim. This is useful if you want
to create a script file to be used with &quot;vim <br>
-s&quot; or &quot;:source!&quot;. If the {scriptout} file
exists, characters are appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W {scriptout} <br>
Like -w, but an existing file is overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Use encryption when writing
files. Will prompt for a crypt key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Don&rsquo;t connect to the X
server. Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the window
title and clipboard will not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Start Vim in easy mode, just
like the executable was called &quot;evim&quot; or
&quot;eview&quot;. Makes Vim behave like a click-and-type
editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Restricted mode. Works like
the executable starts with &quot;r&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Denotes the end of the
options. Arguments after this will be handled as a file
name. This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a
&rsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--echo-wid GTK GUI only: Echo
the Window ID on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Give a help message and
exit, just like &quot;-h&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--literal Take file name
arguments literally, do not expand wildcards. This has no
effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noplugin Skip loading plugins.
Implied by -u NONE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote Connect to a Vim server
and make it edit the files given in the rest of the
arguments. If no server is found a warning is given and the
files are edited in the cur&acirc; <br>
rent Vim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-expr {expr} <br>
Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the
result on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-send {keys} <br>
Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-silent <br>
As --remote, but without the warning when no server is
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-wait <br>
As --remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been
edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-wait-silent <br>

List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--servername {name} <br>
Use {name} as the server name. Used for the current Vim,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Most of Vim was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help
from others. See &quot;:help credits&quot; in Vim. <br>
Vim is based on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson, Tony
Andrews and G.R. (Fred) Walter. Although hardly any of the
original code remains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Probably. See &quot;:help todo&quot; for a list of known
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a number of things
that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact caused by
a too-faithful reproduction of Vi&rsquo;s behaviour. And if
you think other things are bugs <br>
&quot;because Vi does it differently&quot;, you should take
a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help
vi_diff.txt when in Vim). Also have a look at the
&rsquo;compatible&rsquo; and &rsquo;cpop&acirc; <br>
tions&rsquo; options.</p>
