<p>PERLPLAN9(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLPLAN9(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlplan9 - Plan 9-specific documentation for Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
These are a few notes describing features peculiar to Plan 9
Perl. As such, it is not intended to be a replacement for
the rest of the Perl 5 documentation (which is both copious
<br>
and excellent). If you have any questions to which you
can&rsquo;t find answers in these man pages, contact Luther
Huffman at lutherh@stratcom.com and we&rsquo;ll try to
answer them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoking Perl <br>
Perl is invoked from the command line as described in perl.
Most perl scripts, however, do have a first line such as
&quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. This is known as a
shebang (shell- <br>
bang) statement and tells the OS shell where to find the
perl interpreter. In Plan 9 Perl this statement should be
&quot;#!/bin/perl&quot; if you wish to be able to directly
invoke the <br>
script by its name. <br>
Alternatively, you may invoke perl with the command
&quot;Perl&quot; instead of &quot;perl&quot;. This will
produce Acme-friendly error messages of the form
&quot;filename:18&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some scripts, usually identified
with a *.PL extension, are self-configuring and are able to
correctly create their own shebang path from config
information located in Plan 9 <br>
Perl. These you won&rsquo;t need to be worried about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What&rsquo;s in Plan 9 Perl <br>
Although Plan 9 Perl currently only provides static loading,
it is built with a number of useful extensions. These
include Opcode, FileHandle, Fcntl, and POSIX. Expect to see
<br>
others (and DynaLoading!) in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What&rsquo;s not in Plan 9 Perl
<br>
As mentioned previously, dynamic loading isn&rsquo;t
currently available nor is MakeMaker. Both are high-priority
items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl5 Functions not currently
supported in Plan 9 Perl <br>
Some, such as &quot;chown&quot; and &quot;umask&quot;
aren&rsquo;t provided because the concept does not exist
within Plan 9. Others, such as some of the socket-related
functions, simply haven&rsquo;t been <br>
written yet. Many in the latter category may be supported in
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functions not currently
implemented include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chown, chroot, dbmclose,
dbmopen, getsockopt, <br>
setsockopt, recvmsg, sendmsg, getnetbyname, <br>
getnetbyaddr, getnetent, getprotoent, getservent, <br>
sethostent, setnetent, setprotoent, setservent, <br>
endservent, endnetent, endprotoent, umask</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There may be several other
functions that have undefined behavior so this list
shouldn&rsquo;t be considered complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signals in Plan 9 Perl <br>
For compatibility with perl scripts written for the Unix
environment, Plan 9 Perl uses the POSIX signal emulation
provided in Plan 9&rsquo;s ANSI POSIX Environment (APE).
Signal <br>
stacking isn&rsquo;t supported. The signals provided
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGILL,
SIGABRT, <br>
SIGFPE, SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, <br>
SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGCHLD, SIGCONT, <br>
SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPILING AND INSTALLING PERL ON
PLAN 9 <br>
WELCOME to Plan 9 Perl, brave soul!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a preliminary alpha
version of Plan 9 Perl. Still to be <br>
implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many perl commands
are <br>
missing or currently behave in an inscrutable manner. These
gaps will, <br>
with perseverance and a modicum of luck, be remedied in the
near <br>
future.To install this software:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Create the source directories
and libraries for perl by running the plan9/setup.rc command
(i.e., located in the plan9 subdirectory). Note: the setup
routine assumes that you <br>
haven&rsquo;t dearchived these files into /sys/src/cmd/perl.
After running setup.rc you may delete the copy of the source
you originally detarred, as source code has now been
installed <br>
in /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing perl
binaries for all architectures, run &quot;setup.rc
-a&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. After making sure that you
have adequate privileges to build system software, from
/sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately)
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to install perl
versions for all architectures (68020, mips, sparc and 386)
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk installall</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Wait. The build process will
take a *long* time because perl bootstraps itself. A 75MHz
Pentium, 16MB RAM machine takes roughly 30 minutes to build
the distribution from <br>
scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installing Perl Documentation on
Plan 9 <br>
This perl distribution comes with a tremendous amount of
documentation. To add these to the built-in manuals that
come with Plan 9, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust
version <br>
appropriately) run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk man</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To begin your reading, start
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a good introduction and
will direct you towards other man pages that may interest
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note: &quot;mk man&quot; may
produce some extraneous noise. Fear not.)</p>
