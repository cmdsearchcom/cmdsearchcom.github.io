perlplan9 - Plan 9-specific documentation for Perl
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
These are a few notes describing features peculiar to Plan 9 Perl. As such, it
  is not intended to be a replacement for the rest of the Perl 5 documentation
  (which is both copious and excellent). If you have any questions to which you
  can't find answers in these man pages, contact Luther Huffman at
  lutherh@stratcom.com and we'll try to answer them.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Invoking_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#Invoking_Perl">Invoking
  Perl</a></h2>
Perl is invoked from the command line as described in perl. Most perl scripts,
  however, do have a first line such as &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. This
  is known as a shebang (shell-bang) statement and tells the OS shell where to
  find the perl interpreter. In Plan 9 Perl this statement should be
  &quot;#!/bin/perl&quot; if you wish to be able to directly invoke the script
  by its name.
<br/>
 Alternatively, you may invoke perl with the command &quot;Perl&quot; instead of
  &quot;perl&quot;. This will produce Acme-friendly error messages of the form
  &quot;filename:18&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some scripts, usually identified with a *.PL extension, are self-configuring and
  are able to correctly create their own shebang path from config information
  located in Plan 9 Perl. These you won't need to be worried about.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What's_in_Plan_9_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#What's_in_Plan_9_Perl">What's
  in Plan 9 Perl</a></h2>
Although Plan 9 Perl currently only provides static loading, it is built with a
  number of useful extensions. These include Opcode, FileHandle, Fcntl, and
  POSIX. Expect to see others (and DynaLoading!) in the future.

  not in Plan 9 Perl</a></h2>
As mentioned previously, dynamic loading isn't currently available nor is
  MakeMaker. Both are high-priority items.

  Functions not currently supported in Plan 9 Perl</a></h2>
Some, such as &quot;chown&quot; and &quot;umask&quot; aren't provided because
  the concept does not exist within Plan 9. Others, such as some of the
  socket-related functions, simply haven't been written yet. Many in the latter
  category may be supported in the future.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The functions not currently implemented include:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    chown, chroot, dbmclose, dbmopen, getsockopt, 
    setsockopt, recvmsg, sendmsg, getnetbyname, 
    getnetbyaddr, getnetent, getprotoent, getservent, 
    sethostent, setnetent, setprotoent, setservent, 
    endservent, endnetent, endprotoent, umask
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There may be several other functions that have undefined behavior so this list
  shouldn't be considered complete.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Signals_in_Plan_9_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#Signals_in_Plan_9_Perl">Signals
  in Plan 9 Perl</a></h2>
For compatibility with perl scripts written for the Unix environment, Plan 9
  Perl uses the POSIX signal emulation provided in Plan 9's ANSI POSIX
  Environment (APE). Signal stacking isn't supported. The signals provided are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGABRT,
    SIGFPE, SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, 
    SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGCHLD, SIGCONT,
    SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU
</pre>

WELCOME to Plan 9 Perl, brave soul!
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   This is a preliminary alpha version of Plan 9 Perl. Still to be
implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many perl commands are
missing or currently behave in an inscrutable manner. These gaps will,
with perseverance and a modicum of luck, be remedied in the near
future.To install this software:
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
1. Create the source directories and libraries for perl by running the
  plan9/setup.rc command (i.e., located in the plan9 subdirectory). Note: the
  setup routine assumes that you haven't dearchived these files into
  /sys/src/cmd/perl. After running setup.rc you may delete the copy of the
  source you originally detarred, as source code has now been installed in
  /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing perl binaries for all
  architectures, run &quot;setup.rc -a&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. After making sure that you have adequate privileges to build system software,
  from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        mk install
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you wish to install perl versions for all architectures (68020, mips, sparc
  and 386) run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        mk installall
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. Wait. The build process will take a *long* time because perl bootstraps
  itself. A 75MHz Pentium, 16MB RAM machine takes roughly 30 minutes to build
  the distribution from scratch.

  Perl Documentation on Plan 9</a></h2>
This perl distribution comes with a tremendous amount of documentation. To add
  these to the built-in manuals that come with Plan 9, from
  /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        mk man
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To begin your reading, start with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        man perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a good introduction and will direct you towards other man pages that may
  interest you.

(Note: &quot;mk man&quot; may produce some extraneous noise. Fear not.)
