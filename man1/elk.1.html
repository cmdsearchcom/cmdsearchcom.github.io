<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Elk (Extension Language Kit) is a Scheme implementation
designed as a general extension language for applications
written in C or C++. Normally, Elk is linked with the
applica&acirc; <br>
tion it serves, but a stand-alone version of the Scheme
interpreter is installed as well (usually under the name
elk). This interpreter, together with the standard Scheme
<br>
toplevel, Elk can be used as an ordinary, stand-alone
implementation of the Scheme language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When called without the -l
option, Elk loads the standard &acirc;toplevel&acirc; to
start an interactive session. When called with -l file, the
contents of the specified file is loaded <br>
instead. If a &lsquo;-&rsquo; is given as a filename
argument, Elk loads from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -p load-path can be
used to override the standard load-path. The argument is a
colon-separated list of directories. If this option is not
present and the environment <br>
variable ELK_LOADPATH is defined, the value of this variable
is used to initialize the load-path. The value of
ELK_LOADPATH has the same format as the argument to the -p
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h KBytes option is used to
specify a non-standard heap size. The default heap size is
512 KBytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -i is specified,
symbols are mapped to lower case. Normally, Elk is
case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -g option causes the
interpreter to run the garbage collector each time memory is
allocated on the heap. This is useful for writers of
extensions who want to test the <br>
garbage collect behavior of an extension. Running Elk with
the -g option is likely to reveal GC-related bugs in
extensions (such as not properly protected local objects),
as it <br>
triggers a garbage collection each time an object is
allocated on the Scheme heap. A dot is written to standard
output each time a garbage collection is performed when -g
has <br>
been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When called with one or more -v
type (&lsquo;&lsquo;verbose&rsquo;&rsquo;) options, the
interpreter prints additional informational messages to
standard output, depending on the value of the type
argu&acirc; <br>
ment. If type is load, the linker command and options are
printed each time an object file is loaded; if type is init,
the names of extension initialization and finalization <br>
functions are printed as they are called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining args are put into
a list of strings, and the Scheme variable command-line-args
is bound to this list in the global environment. If
arguments could be interpreted <br>
as options, &lsquo;--&Acirc;&acute; can be used to indicate
the end of the options.</p>
