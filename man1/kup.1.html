<p>KUP(1) kernel.org KUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kup - kernel.org upload utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kup [global options] command [-- command...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This utility is used to upload files to kernel.org and other
systems using the same upload system (kup-server). Each
upload is required to have a PGP signature, and the server
<br>
will generate multiple compressed formats if the content
uploaded is intended to be compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, if the user has
content from a git(1) tree already on server, it is possible
to reproduce the content server-side, thereby reducing
bandwidth needs. The user still <br>
has to generate the content locally and sign it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
-b, --batch <br>
Instead of connecting to a remote host, output the protocol
content to standard output. The output from an arbitrary
number of kup invocations can be concatenated into a <br>
single batchfile and then sent to the server as a single
session, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat batchfile | ssh -a -x -k -T
[user@]host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --rsh, --ssh command <br>
Override the default command used to connect to the server.
The default is set by the environment variable KUP_RSH or if
that is not set, ssh -a -x -k -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --host [user@]host <br>
Override the default user and host to which to connect. The
default is set by the environment variable KUP_HOST or if
that is not set, kup.kernel.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
A series of commands can be specified on a single command
line, separated by a double dash argument (--).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases, PGP signatures are
detached signature files corresponding to the uncompressed
content. If a remote_path ends in .gz then gzip, bzip2 and
xz compressed files are <br>
generated on the server; otherwise the content is stored
uncompressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put local_file signature_file
remote_path <br>
Upload the file local_file signed with signature_file.
local_file can be compressed with gzip, bzip2 or xz; this
may reduce upload time. The content will be stored
com&acirc; <br>
pressed or uncompressed depending solely on the extension of
remote_path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put --tar remote_tree ref
signature_file remote_path <br>
Generate a tar archive file from ref ref of git tree
remote_tree (using git archive --format=tar) with signature
signature_file generated locally, and place it in <br>
remote_path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git archive has been found to be
relatively stable, so this command is relatively robust to
git version changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put --diff remote_tree ref1 ref2
signature_file remote_path <br>
Generate a patch file between refs ref1 and ref2 of git tree
remote_tree (using git diff-tree -p) with signature
signature_file generated locally, and place it in <br>
remote_path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of git diff-tree has
been found to vary between git versions, so successful use
of this command may require the same version of git locally
as on the server in <br>
order to produce a valid signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir remote_path <br>
Create a new directory on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv|move old_path new_path <br>
Move the file or directory old_path to new_path. For a file,
the .sign files are also moved, and for compressed files,
all the compression formats are moved together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln|link old_path new_path <br>
Hard link the file or directory old_path to new_path. For a
file, the .sign files are also linked, and for compressed
files, all the compression formats are linked <br>
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm|del|delete old_path <br>
Delete the file or directory old_path. For a file, the .sign
files are also deleted, and for compressed files, all the
compression formats are deleted together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls|dir path... <br>
Lists back the contents of one or more directories on the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATHNAME HANDLING <br>
Remote (server) pathnames all need to be absolute paths,
starting with a slash (/). The sole exception is new_path
for the mv and link commands, which if it is not absolute is
<br>
taken to be relative to the old_path minus the final
component. Similarly, if new_path ends in a slash then the
final component of old_path will be appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the put command, except when
--tar or --diff is specified, if the remote_path ends in a
slash then the final (filename) component of local_file will
be appended to the final <br>
pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
Kup checks the presence of $HOME/.kuprc and can load the
host and rsh parameters from the config file. The
environment variables KUP_HOST and KUP_RSH will override the
values set <br>
in this config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAMPLE $HOME/.kuprc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host = user@kup.kernel.org <br>
rsh = /usr/bin/ssh -a -x -k -T</p>
