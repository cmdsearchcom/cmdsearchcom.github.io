<b>kbookmarkmerger</b> is a program for merging a given set of bookmarks into
  the user's set of bookmarks; if the user doesn't have any bookmarks created
  yet, a new bookmark list is created and the given bookmarks are inserted into
  it. While doing this, <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> keeps track of which files were
  merged in a previous run already, so no bookmark will get installed to the
  user's bookmarks more than once. In case KDE is running while
  <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> is executed, the KDE bookmark subsystem will be
  informed of any changes to the user's bookmarks, so that all applications
  accessing that information (i.e.Konqueror) will pick the changes up instantly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The traditionally used approach to achieve something like this was to use
  carefully crafted skeleton home directories when creating a new user account,
  to provide the user with a standard set of bookmarks. The problem with this
  approach is that after the user account has been created, no new bookmarks can
  be propagated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This mechanism is useful for system administrators who want to propagate a
  bookmark pointing to a certain document (for instance, important notes about
  the system) to all users. Distributors might find it useful as well, for
  instance by augmenting the software packages they supply with bookmark files
  which <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> merges into the user's bookmark list when the
  package is installed. That way, documentation shipped with a software package
  is easily and visibly accessible right after the package has been installed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only parameter required by <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> is the name of a directory
  which shall be scanned for bookmark files. All files in the given directory
  will be considered for being merged into the user's setup. The files in the
  given directory should be valid XBEL files.

When determining whether a given bookmark file has been merged into the user's
  bookmarks already or not, <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> merely looks at the filename
  of the bookmark file - the contents are not checked at all. This means that
  changing a bookmark file which was already merged into a user's bookmarks will
  not trigger merging it once again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also note that in case a user modifies a bookmark which was merged into his
  setup, the original bookmark file will be left unmodified.
