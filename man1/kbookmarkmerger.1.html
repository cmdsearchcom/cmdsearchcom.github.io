<p>KBOOKMARKMERGER KDE User&rsquo;s Manual
KBOOKMARKMERGER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kbookmarkmerger - A program for merging a given set of
bookmarks into the user&rsquo;s list of bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kbookmarkmerger [Qt Options...] [KDE Options...]
{directory}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
kbookmarkmerger is a program for merging a given set of
bookmarks into the user&rsquo;s set of bookmarks; if the
user doesn&rsquo;t have any bookmarks created yet, a new
bookmark list is <br>
created and the given bookmarks are inserted into it. While
doing this, kbookmarkmerger keeps track of which files were
merged in a previous run already, so no bookmark will get
<br>
installed to the user&rsquo;s bookmarks more than once. In
case KDE is running while kbookmarkmerger is executed, the
KDE bookmark subsystem will be informed of any changes to
the <br>
user&rsquo;s bookmarks, so that all applications accessing
that information (i.e.Konqueror) will pick the changes up
instantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The traditionally used approach
to achieve something like this was to use carefully crafted
skeleton home directories when creating a new user account,
to provide the user with a <br>
standard set of bookmarks. The problem with this approach is
that after the user account has been created, no new
bookmarks can be propagated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mechanism is useful for
system administrators who want to propagate a bookmark
pointing to a certain document (for instance, important
notes about the system) to all users. <br>
Distributors might find it useful as well, for instance by
augmenting the software packages they supply with bookmark
files which kbookmarkmerger merges into the user&rsquo;s
bookmark <br>
list when the package is installed. That way, documentation
shipped with a software package is easily and visibly
accessible right after the package has been installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only parameter required by
kbookmarkmerger is the name of a directory which shall be
scanned for bookmark files. All files in the given directory
will be considered for being <br>
merged into the user&rsquo;s setup. The files in the given
directory should be valid XBEL files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
joe@hal9000:~&gt; kbookmarkmerger
/usr/local/extra-bookmarks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merges all bookmark files stored
in /usr/local/extra-bookmarks into joe&rsquo;s list of
bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
XBEL specification[2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
When determining whether a given bookmark file has been
merged into the user&rsquo;s bookmarks already or not,
kbookmarkmerger merely looks at the filename of the bookmark
file - the <br>
contents are not checked at all. This means that changing a
bookmark file which was already merged into a user&rsquo;s
bookmarks will not trigger merging it once again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that in case a user
modifies a bookmark which was merged into his setup, the
original bookmark file will be left unmodified.</p>
