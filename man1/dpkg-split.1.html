<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpkg-split - Debian package archive split/join tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpkg-split [option...] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dpkg-split splits Debian binary package files into smaller
parts and reassembles them again, to support the storage of
large package files on small media such as floppy disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can be operated manually
using the --split, --join and --info options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also has an automatic mode,
invoked using the --auto option, where it maintains a queue
of parts seen but not yet reassembled and reassembles a
package file when it has seen <br>
all of its parts. The --listq and --discard options allow
the management of the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All splitting, joining and
queueing operations produce informative messages on standard
output; these may safely be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
-s, --split complete-archive [prefix] <br>
Splits a single Debian binary package into several
parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parts are named
prefix.NofM.deb where N is the part number, starting at 1,
and M is the total number of parts (both in decimal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no prefix is supplied then
the complete-archive filename is taken, including directory,
with any trailing .deb removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --join part... <br>
Joins the parts of a package file together, reassembling the
original file as it was before it was split.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The part files given as
arguments must be all the parts of exactly the same original
binary file. Each part must occur exactly once in the
argument list, though the parts <br>
to not need to be listed in order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parts must of course all
have been generated with the same part size specified at
split time, which means that they must usually have been
generated by the same invo&acirc; <br>
cation of dpkg-split --split.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parts&rsquo; filenames are
not significant for the reassembly process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the output file is
called package_version_arch.deb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --info part... <br>
Prints information, in a human-readable format, about the
part file(s) specified. Arguments which are not binary
package parts produce a message saying so instead (but <br>
still on standard output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --auto -o complete-output
part <br>
Automatically queue parts and reassemble a package if
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The part specified is examined,
and compared with other parts of the same package (if any)
in the queue of packages file parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all parts of the package file
of which part is a part are available then the package is
reassembled and written to complete-output (which should not
usually already <br>
exist, though this is not an error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not then the part is copied
into the queue and complete-output is not created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If part is not a split binary
package part then dpkg-split will exit with status 1; if
some other trouble occurs then it will exit with status
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --output or -o option must
be supplied when using --auto. (If this were not mandatory
the calling program would not know what output file to
expect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --listq <br>
Lists the contents of the queue of packages to be
reassembled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each package file of which
parts are in the queue the output gives the name of the
package, the parts in the queue, and the total number of
bytes stored in the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --discard [package...] <br>
This discards parts from the queue of those waiting for the
remaining parts of their packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no package is specified then
the queue is cleared completely; if any are specified then
only parts of the relevant package(s) are deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show the usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--depotdir directory <br>
Specifies an alternative directory for the queue of parts
awaiting automatic reassembly. The default is
/var/lib/dpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --partsize kibibytes <br>
Specifies the maximum part size when splitting, in kibibytes
(1024 bytes). The default is 450 KiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output complete-output
<br>
Specifies the output file name for a reassembly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This overrides the default for a
manual reassembly (--join) and is mandatory for an automatic
queue-or-reassemble (--auto).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --npquiet <br>
When doing automatic queue-or-reassembly dpkg-split usually
prints a message if it is given a part that is not a binary
package part. This option suppresses this message, <br>
to allow programs such as dpkg to cope with both split and
unsplit packages without producing spurious messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--msdos <br>
Forces the output filenames generated by --split to be
msdos-compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mangles the prefix - either
the default derived from the input filename or the one
supplied as an argument: alphanumerics are lowercased, plus
signs are replaced by <br>
x&rsquo;s and all other characters are discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result is then truncated as
much as is necessary, and filenames of the form
prefixNofM.deb are generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The requested split, merge, or other command succeeded.
--info commands count as successful even if the files are
not binary package parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Only occurs with --auto and
indicates that the part file was not a binary package
part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Some kind of trouble happened,
such as a system call failure, a file that looked like a
package part file but was corrupted, a usage error or some
other problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/dpkg/parts <br>
The default queue directory for part files awaiting
automatic reassembly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filenames used in this
directory are in a format internal to dpkg-split and are
unlikely to be useful to other programs, and in any case the
filename format should not <br>
be relied upon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Full details of the packages in the queue are impossible to
get without digging into the queue directory yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no easy way to test
whether a file that may be a binary package part is one.</p>
