CuteSDR - a simple demodulation and spectrum display program
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Its primary purpose is for spawning custom applications or for educational use.
  It is NOT a full featured program as it is purposely kept simple in order for
  developers to more easily spin off their own applications. A further goal was
  to use only the stock functionality of Qt ie no libraries or special drivers.
  This limits CuteSDR to using only a network connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The application is compatible with the SDR-IP and NetSDR networked software
  defined radio receivers made by RFSPACE, Inc. of Atlanta, GA
<div class="Pp"></div>
Running with other receivers that have USB interfaces (such as the SDR-IQ) is
  made possible by the siqs_ftdi program.
