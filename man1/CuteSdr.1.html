<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
CuteSDR - a simple demodulation and spectrum display
program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Its primary purpose is for spawning custom applications or
for educational use. It is NOT a full featured program as it
is purposely kept simple in order for developers to more
<br>
easily spin off their own applications. A further goal was
to use only the stock functionality of Qt ie no libraries or
special drivers. This limits CuteSDR to using only a
net&acirc; <br>
work connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application is compatible
with the SDR-IP and NetSDR networked software defined radio
receivers made by RFSPACE, Inc. of Atlanta, GA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running with other receivers
that have USB interfaces (such as the SDR-IQ) is made
possible by the siqs_ftdi program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
CuteSDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Brings up the GUI application.
No command-line options, configuration via GUI menus.</p>
