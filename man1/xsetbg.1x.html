<p>XLOADIMAGE(1x) XLOADIMAGE(1x)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xloadimage, xsetbg, xview - load images into an X11 window
or onto the root window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xloadimage [global_options] {[image_options] image ...} <br>
xloadimage [global_options] [image_options] stdin &lt;
image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xloadimage displays images in an X11 window, loads them onto
the root window, or writes them into a file. Many image
types are recognized; use the -supported option to list <br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filename stdin is given,
xloadimage will read the image from standard input if this
capability is supported by the loader for that image type
(most types do support read&acirc; <br>
ing from stdin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the destination display
cannot support the number of colors in the image, the image
will be dithered (monochrome destination) or have its
colormap reduced (color destination) <br>
as appropriate. This can also be done forcibly with the
-halftone, -dither, and -colors options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A variety of image manipulations
can be specified, including gamma correction, brightening,
clipping, dithering, depth-reduction, rotation, and zooming.
Most of these manipula&acirc; <br>
tions have simple implementations; speed was opted for above
accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are viewing a large image
in a window, the initial window will be at most 90% of the
size of the display unless the window manager does not
correctly handle window size <br>
requests or if you&rsquo;ve used the -fullscreen option. You
may move the image around in the window by dragging with the
first mouse button. The cursor will indicate which
direc&acirc; <br>
tions you may drag, if any. You may exit the window by
typing &rsquo;q&rsquo; or &rsquo;^C&rsquo; when the keyboard
focus is on the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one image file is
specified on the command line, each image will be shown in
order (except if -merge or -goto are being used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A wide variety of common image
manipulations can be done by mixing and matching the
available options. See the section entitled HINTS FOR GOOD
IMAGE DISPLAYS for some ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -dump option causes an image
to be written to a file rather than displayed after
processing. This allows you to read an image, perform a
number of processing operations on <br>
it, and save the resultant image. This also allows
translation from any of the recognized image types into any
of the formats that support dumping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xsetbg is equivalent to
xloadimage -onroot -quiet and xview is equivalent to
xloadimage -view -verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCE CLASS <br>
Xloadimage uses the resource class name Xloadimage for
window managers which need this resource set. This name
changed in version 2.00 and 2.01; some previous versions
used the <br>
name XLoadImage (which was difficult to predict) or
xloadimage (which conflicted with class naming
conventions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
The following options affect the global operation of
xloadimage. They may be specified anywhere on the command
line. Additionally the -global option can be used to force
an <br>
image option to apply to all images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-border color <br>
This sets the background portion of the window which is not
covered by any images to be color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-configuration <br>
Displays the image path, image suffixes, and supported
filters which will be used when looking for and reading
images. These are loaded from ~/.xloadimagerc and
option&acirc; <br>
ally from a systemwide file (normally
/usr/lib/xloadimagerc). This replaces the -path option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-default <br>
Use the default root weave as the image. This option forces
-onroot. If -default is used alone, it is the same as
xsetroot with no arguments. If used in conjunction <br>
with -tile this option can be used to place images on the
default root weave (see EXAMPLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Talk to the X server in
synchronous mode. This is useful for debugging. If an X
error is seen while in this mode, a core will be dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display_name <br>
X11 display name to send the image(s) to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dump
image_type[,option[=value]] dump_file <br>
Rather than displaying the loaded and processed image, dump
it into an image file of the specified type. For a list of
image types that can be dumped, use the -supported <br>
option. Some image types have options that affect the format
of the file that&rsquo;s created. See DUMP OPTIONS below. An
image can be dumped in any supported dump format <br>
regardless of the original image type, so image file type
translation is possible using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fit Force image to use the
default visual and colormap. This is useful if you do not
want technicolor effects when the colormap focus is inside
the image window, but it may <br>
reduce the quality of the displayed image. This is on by
default if -onroot or -windowid is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fork Fork xloadimage. This
causes xloadimage to disassociate itself from the shell.
This option automatically turns on -quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fullscreen <br>
Use the entire screen to display images. If combined with
-onroot, the image will be zoomed to fill the entire
rootwindow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry WxH[{+-X}{+-}Y] <br>
This sets the size of the window onto which the images are
loaded to a different value than the size of the image. When
viewing an image in a window, this can be used to <br>
reduce the size of the destination window. When loading an
image onto the root window, this option controls the size of
the pixmap which will be loaded onto the root. <br>
If the size is smaller than that of the display, the image
will be replicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-goto image_name <br>
Forces the next image to be displayed to be the image named
image_name. This is useful for generating looped slideshows.
If more than one image of the same name as the <br>
target exists on the argument list, the first in the
argument list is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help [option ...] <br>
Give information on an option or list of options. If no
option is given, a simple interactive help facility is
invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-identify <br>
Identify the supplied images rather than display them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-install <br>
Forcibly install the image&rsquo;s colormap when the window
is focused. This violates ICCCM standards and only exists to
allow operation with naive window managers. Use this <br>
option only if your window manager does not install
colormaps properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list List the images which are
along the image path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-onroot Load image(s) onto the
root window instead of viewing in a window. This option
automatically sets the -fit option. This is the opposite of
-view. XSetbg has this <br>
option set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-path Displays miscellaneous
information about the program configuration. This option is
obsolete and has been replaced by -configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixmap Force the use of a
pixmap as backing-store. This is provided for servers where
backing-store is broken (such as some versions of the
AIXWindows server). It may improve <br>
scrolling performance on servers which provide
backing-store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-private <br>
Force the use of a private colormap. Normally colors are
allocated shared unless there are not enough colors
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet Forces xloadimage and
xview to be quiet. This is the default for xsetbg, but the
others like to whistle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-supported <br>
List the supported image types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-type type_name <br>
Forces xloadimage to try to load the image as a particular
file type rather than trying to guess. This often improves
load performance noticeably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Causes xloadimage to be talkative, telling you what kind of
image it&rsquo;s playing with and any special processing
that it has to do. This is the default for xview and <br>
xloadimage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print the version number and patchlevel of this version of
xloadimage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-view View image(s) in a window.
This is the opposite of -onroot and the default for xview
and xloadimage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-visual visual_name <br>
Force the use of a specific visual type to display an image.
Normally xloadimage tries to pick the best available image
for a particular image type. The available vis&acirc; <br>
ual types are: DirectColor, TrueColor, PseudoColor,
StaticColor, GrayScale, and StaticGray. Nonconflicting names
may be abbreviated and case is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-windowid hex_window_id <br>
Sets the background pixmap of a particular window ID. The
argument must be in hexadecimal and must be preceded by
&quot;0x&quot; (eg -windowid 0x40000b. This is intended for
set&acirc; <br>
ting the background pixmap of some servers which use
untagged virtual roots (eg HP-VUE), but can have other
interesting applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAGE OPTIONS <br>
The following options may precede each image. These options
are local to the image they precede.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-at X,Y <br>
Indicates coordinates to load the image at on the base
image. If this is an option to the first image, and the
-onroot option is specified, the image will be loaded at
<br>
the given location on the display background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background color <br>
Use color as the background color instead of the default
(usually white but this depends on the image type) if you
are transferring a monochrome image to a color display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-brighten percentage <br>
Specify a percentage multiplier for a color image&rsquo;s
colormap. A value of more than 100 will brighten an image,
one of less than 100 will darken it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-center <br>
Center the image on the base image loaded. If this is an
option to the first image, and the -onroot option is
specified, the image will be centered on the display
back&acirc; <br>
ground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clip X,Y,W,H <br>
Clip the image before loading it. X and Y define the
upper-left corner of the clip area, and W and H define the
extents of the area. A zero value for W or H will be <br>
interpreted as the remainder of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-colors n <br>
Specify the maximum number of colors to use in the image.
This is a way to forcibly reduce the depth of an image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delay secs <br>
Automatically advance to the next image after secs seconds.
You may want to use the -global switch with this command to
create a slideshow with multiple images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dither <br>
Dither a color image to monochrome using a Floyd-Steinberg
dithering algorithm. This happens by default when viewing
color images on a monochrome display. This is slower <br>
than -halftone and affects the image accuracy but usually
looks much better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foreground color <br>
Use color as the foreground color instead of black if you
are transferring a monochrome image to a color display. This
can also be used to invert the foreground and back&acirc;
<br>
ground colors of a monochrome image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma display_gamma <br>
Specify the gamma correction for the display. The default
value is 1.0, a typical display needs 2.0 to 2.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-global <br>
Force the following option to apply to all images rather
than one specific image. Local image options will
temporarily override any option specified with -global.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gray Convert an image to
grayscale. This is very useful when displaying colorful
images on servers with limited color capability. It can also
be used to convert a bitmap <br>
image into a grayscale image, although the resulting image
will be smaller than the original. The optional spelling
-grey may also be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-halftone <br>
Force halftone dithering of a color image when displaying on
a monochrome display. This option is ignored on monochrome
images. This dithering algorithm blows an image <br>
up by sixteen times; if you don&rsquo;t like this, the
-dither option will not blow the image up but will take
longer to process and will be less accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idelay secs <br>
This option is no longer supported due to the addition of
-global. The same functionality can be had with -delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-invert <br>
Inverts a monochrome image. This is shorthand for
-foreground white -background black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-merge Merge this image onto the
base image after local processing. The base image is
considered to be the first image specified or the last image
that was not preceded by <br>
-merge. If used in conjunction with -at and -clip, very
complex images can be built up. This option is on by default
for all images if the -onroot or -windowid options <br>
are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name image_name <br>
Force the next argument to be treated as an image name. This
is useful if the name of the image is -dither, for
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newoptions <br>
Reset globally-specified options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-normalize <br>
Normalize a color image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate degrees <br>
Rotate the image by degrees clockwise. The number must be a
multiple of 90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shrink <br>
Shrink an image down to fit on the display. This is
particularly useful with servers that do not support window
sizes larger than the physical screen (eg DECWINDOWS <br>
servers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smooth <br>
Smooth a color image. This reduces blockiness after zooming
an image up. If used on a monochrome image, nothing happens.
This option can take awhile to perform, espe&acirc; <br>
cially on large images. You may specify more than one
-smooth option per image, causing multiple iterations of the
smoothing algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tile Tile this image (after any
necessary merging or tiling) to create a fullscreen image.
This is usually used to create a large background image on
which to merge other <br>
images. -geometry can be used to set the new image size to
something other than -fullscreen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-title title <br>
Change the title of the image. This sets the title bar title
if displaying in a window or the NIFF file image title if
dumping the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xzoom percentage <br>
Zoom the X axis of an image by percentage. A number greater
than 100 will expand the image, one smaller will compress
it. A zero value will be ignored. This option, and <br>
the related -yzoom are useful for correcting the aspect
ratio of images to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yzoom percentage <br>
Zoom the Y axis of an image by percentage. See -xzoom for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zoom percentage <br>
Zoom both the X and Y axes by percentage. See -xzoom for
more information. Technically the percentage actually zoomed
is the square of the number supplied since the zoom <br>
is to both axes, but I opted for consistency instead of
accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To load the rasterfile &quot;my.image&quot; onto the
background and replicate it to fill the entire
background:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -onroot my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To center an image on the
default root background:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -default -tile
my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If using a monochrome display
and a color image you will probably want to dither the image
for a cleaner (and faster) display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -default -tile
-dither my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To load a monochrome image
&quot;my.image&quot; onto the background, using red as the
foreground color, replicate the image, and overlay
&quot;another.image&quot; onto it at coordinate (10,10):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -foreground red
my.image -at 10,10 another.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To center the rectangular region
from 10 to 110 along the X axis and from 10 to the height of
the image along the Y axis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -center -clip
10,10,100,0 my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To double the size of an
image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -zoom 200
my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To halve the size of an
image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -zoom 50 my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To brighten a dark image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -brighten 150
my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To darken a bright image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage -brighten 50
my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS FOR GOOD IMAGE DISPLAYS
<br>
Since images are likely to come from a variety of sources,
they may be in a variety of aspect ratios which may not be
supported by your display. The -xzoom and -yzoom options
<br>
can be used to change the aspect ratio of an image before
display. If you use these options, it is recommended that
you increase the size of one of the dimensions instead of
<br>
shrinking the other, since shrinking looses detail. For
instance, many GIF and G3 FAX images have an X:Y ratio of
about 2:1. You can correct this for viewing on a 1:1 display
<br>
with either -xzoom 50 or -yzoom 200 (reduce X axis to 50% of
its size and expand Y axis to 200% of its size,
respectively) but the latter should be used so no detail is
lost in <br>
the conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When zooming color images up you
can reduce blockiness with -smooth. For zooms of 300% or
more, I recommend two smoothing passes (although this can
take awhile to do on slow <br>
machines). There will be a noticeable improvement in the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can perform image processing
on a small portion of an image by loading the image more
than once and using the -merge, -at and -clip options. Load
the image, then merge it <br>
with a clipped, processed version of itself. To brighten a
100x100 rectangular portion of an image located at (50,50),
for instance, you could type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage my.image -merge -at
50,50 -clip 50,50,100,100 -brighten 150 my.image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using a display
with a small colormap to display colorful images, try using
the -gray option to convert to grayscale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATHS AND EXTENSIONS <br>
The file ~/.xloadimagerc (and optionally a system-wide file)
defines a number of configuration options that affect
xloadimage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file is split into three
section, the path section, the extension section, and the
filter section. The sections are identified by typing the
section name followed by an <br>
equals sign, eg &quot;path =&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path statement is used to
provide a set of search paths to use when looking for an
image of a specified name. Separate each path in the list by
whitespace (eg one or more <br>
spaces, tabs, or newlines). The path is searched in the
order it is specified. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path = ~/images
/usr/local/images ~fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will first look for the image
name you specified, then look for the name in ~/images (the
tilde is expanded to the value of $HOME), then in
/usr/local/images, then in user fred&rsquo;s <br>
home directory. This allows easy use of image
repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extension statement is used
to provide a set of default extensions to use when looking
for an image of a specified name. Separate each extension in
the list by whitespace. <br>
The extensions are searched in the order in which they are
specified. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extension = .gif .jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a file named
myimage.gif you could specify the name myimage and
xloadimage would append the .gif extension
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter statement is used to
describe filter programs, such as &quot;uncompress&quot;,
which are to be applied to image files automatically. You
specify one filter program and any num&acirc; <br>
ber of recognized extensions following the filter keyword.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter = uncompress .Z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifies that the program
uncompress should be used as a filter whenever an image file
has a .Z extension. By default filters are provided for
compressed (.Z) files and GNU zip <br>
(.gz) files. See the FILTERS section for more information on
defining your own filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any text on a line following a
hash-mark (#) is ignored; if you wish to use a hash-mark in
a path, extension, or filter you can escape it using a
backslash (.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to include
white-space in a filter program name, path, or extension you
can enclose the entire text in double-quotes. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter = &quot;gzip -cd&quot;
.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use backslash ( characters to
allow inclusion of double-quote marks or newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is a sample
~/.xloadimagerc file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># paths to look for images in
<br>
path = /usr/local/images # system image repository <br>
~/images # personal images <br>
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps # standard X bitmaps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># default extensions for images
<br>
extension = .csun .msun .sun .face .xbm .bm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># invoke GNU zip if a .z or .zip
extension is found <br>
filter = &quot;gzip -cd&quot; .z .zip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAGE TYPES <br>
Xloadimage currently supports many common and some uncommon
image types, and can create images in several formats. For a
complete list use the -supported option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUMPING IMAGES <br>
Several image dumpers are included that can be used to
create a new image after loading and processing. The NIFF
(Native Image File Format) is the simplest and creates
images <br>
that xloadimage can read the fastest; it is essentially a
copy of the internal image format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some image dumpers allow options
that affect the image output. These options are appended to
the image type following a comma and are separated by
commas. If a value is desired <br>
it can be specified following an equals-sign. For example,
to create a monochrome JPEG image file with a quality factor
of 80, you would use the following command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xloadimage image_name -dump
jpeg,quality=80,grayscale new_image.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option names can be abbreviated
but if the abbreviation is too short to be unique the option
which will be used is indeterminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTERS <br>
Xloadimage supports automatic filtering by recognizing file
extensions. By default &quot;compress&quot; and
&quot;gzip&quot; files are recognized and their names passed
to appropriate commands to <br>
decompress them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xloadimage distribution
includes a special &quot;smart&quot; uudecoder, called
uufilter that can be used to automatically uudecode files
for processing. Uufilter ignores extraneous <br>
lines in the file so it is particularly useful if the
uuencoded file was created by concatenating email or news
postings that had headers or line-break indicators
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make use of uufilter you can
add the following to your .xloadimagerc file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter = &quot;uufilter -s&quot;
.uu .uue <br>
The filter will be automatically invoked on any file with a
.uu or .uue extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a list of filters
automatically recognized by xloadimage use the
-configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED IMAGE OPTIONS <br>
The JPEG image dumper supports the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arithmetic <br>
Use arithmetic encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grayscale <br>
Force a monochrome (grayscale) image to be created given a
color image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nointerleave <br>
Create a non-interleaved file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optimize <br>
Enable entropy parameter optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quality Adjust the quality of
the image to be created. The default quality factor is 75;
lower values create poorer images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart interval <br>
Set the restart interval in MCU rows, or MCUs if
&rsquo;b&rsquo; follows the interval value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smooth smoothing_factor <br>
Set the smoothing factor. Value should be between 0 and 100,
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not familiar with the
meaning of these options you can ask the Independent JPEG
Group (IJG) via email at jpeg@cs.columbia.edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PBM image dumper supports
the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normal Dump a normal (ascii)
PBM/PPM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw Dump a RawBits format
PBM/PPM file. This is the default and results in
significantly smaller image files than when using
normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to dump a PGM
format file or a &quot;compact&quot; PBM format file
(sorry).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TIFF image dumper supports
the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compression <br>
Image data compression technique. Can be one of: none (no
compression), rle (CCITT RLE compression), g3fax (CCITT
Group 3 FAX compression), g4fax (CCITT Group 4 FAX
com&acirc; <br>
pression), lzw (Limpel-Ziv-Welsh compression, the default),
jpeg (JPEG compression), next (NeXT run-length compression),
rlew (CCITT RLEW compression), mac (Macintosh <br>
PackBits compression), packbits (same as mac), thunderscan
(ThunderScan compression).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xloadimage will save using the
MINISBLACK, MINISWHITE, COLORMAP, or RGB photometrics as
appropriate for its internal image format. There is no way
to specify a particular photo&acirc; <br>
metric or any other TIFF fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Zooming dithered images, especially downwards, is UGLY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Images can come in a variety of
aspect ratios. Xloadimage cannot detect what aspect ratio
the particular image being loaded has, nor the aspect ratio
of the destination display, <br>
so images with differing aspect ratios from the destination
display will appear distorted. See HINTS FOR GOOD IMAGE
DISPLAYS for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GIF format allows more than
one image to be stored in a single GIF file, but xloadimage
will only display the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only GIF87a format is
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the pseudonyms for
xloadimage, xview, is the same name as Sun uses for their
SunView-under-X package. This will be confusing if
you&rsquo;re one of those poor souls who has to <br>
use Sun&rsquo;s XView.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some window managers do not
correctly handle window size requests. In particular, many
versions of the twm window manager use the MaxSize hint
instead of the PSize hint, causing <br>
images which are larger than the screen to display in a
window larger than the screen, something which is normally
avoided. Some versions of twm also ignore the MaxSize
argu&acirc; <br>
ment&rsquo;s real function, to limit the maximum size of the
window, and allow the window to be resized larger than the
image. If this happens, xloadimage merely places the image
in <br>
the upper-left corner of the window and uses the
zero-value&rsquo;ed pixel for any space which is not covered
by the image. This behavior is less-than-graceful but so are
window man&acirc; <br>
agers which are cruel enough to ignore such details.</p>
