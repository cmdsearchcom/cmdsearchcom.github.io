<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
brsscla - BRSS-based BP convergence layer adapter (input and
output) task</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
brsscla local_hostname[:local_port_nbr][
first_duct_nbr_in_scope[ last_duct_nbr_in_scope]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
BRSS is the &quot;server&quot; side of the Bundle Relay
Service (BRS) convergence layer protocol for BP. It is
complemented by BRSC, the &quot;client&quot; side of the BRS
convergence layer <br>
protocol for BP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsscla is a background
&quot;daemon&quot; task that spawns two plus N threads: one
that handles BRSS client connections and spawns sockets for
continued data interchange with connected <br>
clients; one that handles BRSS protocol output by
transmitting over those spawned sockets to the associated
clients; and one input thread for each spawned socket, to
handle BRSS <br>
protocol input from the associated connected client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connection thread simply
accepts connections on a TCP socket bound to local_hostname
and local_port_nbr and spawns reception threads. The default
value for local_port_nbr, <br>
if omitted, is 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each reception thread receives
over the socket connection the node number of the connecting
client (in SDNV representation), followed by a 32-bit time
tag and a 160-bit HMAC-SHA1 <br>
digest of that time tag. The node number must be in the
range first_duct_nbr_in_scope through last_duct_nbr_in_scope
inclusive; when omitted, first_duct_nbr_in_scope defaults to
<br>
1 and last_duct_nbr_in_scope defaults to
first_duct_nbr_in_scope plus 255. The receiving thread also
checks the time tag, requiring that it differ from the
current time by no <br>
more than BRSTERM (default value 5) seconds. It then
recomputes the digest value using the HMAC-SHA1 key named
&quot;node_number.brs&quot; as recorded in the ION security
database (see <br>
ionsecrc(5)), requiring that the supplied and computed
digests be identical. If all registration conditions are
met, the receiving thread sends the client a countersign --
a <br>
similarly computed HMAC-SHA1 digest, for the time tag that
is 1 second later than the provided time tag -- to assure
the client of its own authenticity, then commences receiving
<br>
bundles over the connected socket. Each bundle received on
the connection is preceded by its length, a 32-bit unsigned
integer in network byte order. The received bundles are <br>
passed to the bundle protocol agent on the local ION
node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output thread extracts
bundles from the queues of bundles ready for transmission
via BRSS to remote bundle protocol agents, finds the
connected clients whose node numbers <br>
match the proximate receiver node numbers assigned to the
bundles by the routing daemons that enqueued them, and
transmits the bundles over the sockets to those clients.
Each <br>
transmitted bundle is preceded by its length, a 32-bit
unsigned integer in network byte order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that brsscla is a
&quot;promiscuous&quot; convergence layer daemon, able to
transmit bundles to any BRSS destination induct for which it
has received a connection. Its sole outduct&rsquo;s <br>
name is the name of the corresponding induct, rather than
the induct name of any single BRSS destination induct to
which the outduct might be dedicated, so scheme
configuration <br>
directives that cite this outduct must provide destination
induct IDs. For the BRS convergence-layer protocol,
destination induct IDs are simply the node numbers of
connected <br>
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsscla is spawned automatically
by bpadmin in response to the &rsquo;s&rsquo; (START)
command that starts operation of the Bundle Protocol, and it
is terminated by bpadmin in response to an <br>
&rsquo;x&rsquo; (STOP) command. brsscla can also be spawned
and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that
pertain specifically to the BRSS convergence layer
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; brsscla terminated normally, for reasons noted
in the ion.log file. If this termination was not commanded,
investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file
and <br>
use bpadmin to restart the BRSS protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1&quot; brsscla terminated
abnormally, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.
Investigate and solve the problem identified in the log
file, then use bpadmin to restart the BRSS <br>
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
No configuration files are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsscla can&rsquo;t attach to
BP. <br>
bpadmin has not yet initialized Bundle Protocol
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such brss induct. <br>
No BRSS induct with duct name matching local_hostname and
local_port_nbr has been added to the BP database. Use
bpadmin to stop the BRSS convergence-layer protocol, add the
<br>
induct, and then restart the BRSS protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLI task is already started for
this duct. <br>
Redundant initiation of brsscla.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such brss outduct. <br>
No BRSS outduct with duct name matching local_hostname and
local_port_nbr has been added to the BP database. Use
bpadmin to stop the BRSS convergence-layer protocol, add the
<br>
outduct, and then restart the BRSS protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t get IP address for
host <br>
Operating system error. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open TCP socket <br>
Operating system error -- unable to open TCP socket for
accepting connections. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t initialize socket
(note: must be root for port 80) <br>
Operating system error. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsscla can&rsquo;t create
sender thread <br>
Operating system error. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsscla can&rsquo;t create
access thread <br>
Operating system error. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSS.</p>
