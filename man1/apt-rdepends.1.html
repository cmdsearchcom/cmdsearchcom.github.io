<p>APT-RDEPENDS(1) APT-RDEPENDS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apt-rdepends - performs recursive dependency listings
similar to apt-cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apt-rdepends [options] [pkgs ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apt-rdepends searches through the APT cache to find package
dependencies. apt-rdepends knows how to emulate the result
of calling apt-cache with both depends and dotty
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, apt-rdepends shows a
listing of each dependency a package has. It will also look
at each of these fulfilling packages, and recursively lists
their dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --build-depends <br>
Show build dependencies instead of normal package
dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dotty <br>
dotty takes a list of packages on the command line and
generates output suitable for use by springgraph (1). The
result will be a set of nodes and edges representing the
<br>
relationships between the packages. By default the given
packages will trace out all dependent packages which can
produce a very large graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blue lines are pre-depends,
green lines are conflicts, yellow lines are suggests, orange
lines are recommends, red lines are replaces, and black
lines are depends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution, dotty cannot graph
larger sets of packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --print-state <br>
Shows the state of each dependency after each package
version. See --state-follow and --state-show for why this is
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reverse <br>
Shows the listings of each package that depends on a
package. Furthermore, it will look at these dependent
packages, and find their dependers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --follow=DEPENDS <br>
A comma-separated list of DEPENDS types to follow
recursively. By default, it only follows the Depends and
PreDepends types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible values for DEPENDS
are: Depends, PreDepends, Suggests, Recommends, Conflicts,
Replaces, and Obsoletes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In --build-depends mode, the
possible values are: Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Indep,
Build-Conflicts, Build-Conflicts-Indep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --show=DEPENDS <br>
A comma-separated list of DEPENDS types to show, when
displaying a listing. By default, it only shows the Depends
and PreDepends types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--state-follow=STATES <br>
--state-show=STATES <br>
These two options are similar to --follow and --show. They
both deal with the current state of a package. By default,
the value of STATES is Unknown, NotInstalled, <br>
UnPacked, HalfConfigured, HalfInstalled, ConfigFiles, and
Installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are useful, if you
only want to only look at the dependencies between the
Installed packages on your system. You can then call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-rdepends
--state-follow=Installed libfoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or if you want to only show the
packages installed on your system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-rdepends
--state-follow=Installed --state-show=Installed libfoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkgs The list of packages on
which to discover dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --vcg, --xvcg <br>
This option takes a list of packages on the command line and
generates output suitable for use by xvcg. The result will
be a set of nodes and edges representing the <br>
relationships between the packages. By default the given
packages will trace out all dependent packages which can
produce a very large graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blue lines are pre-depends,
green lines are conflicts, yellow lines are suggests, orange
lines are recommends, red lines are replaces, and black
lines are depends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --option=OPTION <br>
Set an APT Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary
configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
apt.conf(5), sources.list(5), apt-cache(8), AptPkg(3),
springgraph(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
apt-rdepends does not emulate apt-cache perfectly. It does
not display information about virtual packages, nor does it
know about virtual packages when it is in reverse <br>
dependency mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-rdepends also does not know
how to stop after a certain depth has been reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-rdepends cannot do reverse
build-dependencies. This is really difficult, since it would
have to load the whole cache into memory before discovering
which packages depend on <br>
others to build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt-rdepends exists. This
functionality should really reside in apt-cache itself.</p>
