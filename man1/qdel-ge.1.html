<p>QDEL(1) Sun Grid Engine User Commands QDEL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qdel - delete Sun Grid Engine jobs from queues</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
qdel [ -f ] [ -help ] [ -u wc_user_list ] [
wc_job_range_list ] [ -t task_id_range ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Qdel provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete
one or more jobs. A manager/operator can delete jobs
belonging to any user, while a regular user can only delete
his <br>
or her own jobs. If a manager wants to delete another
user&rsquo;s job, the manager can specify the job id. If the
manager is using a job name or pattern, he or she must also
specify <br>
the user&rsquo;s name via &quot;-u wc_user_list&quot;. A
&quot;qdel wc_job_name&quot; will delete only the jobs of
the calling user by default. Qdel deletes jobs in the order
in which their job identi&acirc; <br>
fiers are presented. Find additional information concerning
wc_user_list and wc_job_list in sge_types(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f Force deletion of job(s). The job(s) are deleted from the
list of jobs registered at sge_qmaster(8) even if the
sge_execd(8) controlling the job(s) does not respond to the
<br>
delete request sent by sge_qmaster(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users which are neither Sun Grid
Engine managers nor operators can only use the -f option
(for their own jobs) if the cluster configuration entry
qmaster_params contains <br>
the flag ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL (see sge_conf(5)). However,
behavior for administrative and non-administrative users
differs. Jobs are deleted from the Sun Grid Engine
data&acirc; <br>
base immediately in case of administrators. Otherwise, a
regular deletion is attempted first and a forced
cancellation is only executed if the regular deletion was
unsuc&acirc; <br>
cessful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally regular qdel
requests can result in a forced deletion of a job if
ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL_IF_UNKNOWN is set in the qmaster_params
(see sge_conf(5))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Prints a listing of all
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Deletes specified tasks of
array job. It means tasks created by qsub -t command. For
example after creating array job by command &quot;qsub -t
1-100 $SGE_ROOT/exam&acirc; <br>
ples/sleeper.sh&quot; it is possible to delete tasks 5-10
from job array by command &quot;qdel job_id -t 5-10&quot;.
All other tasks (1-4 and 11-100) will be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u wc_user_list <br>
Deletes only those jobs which were submitted by users
specified in the list of usernames. For managers it is
possible to use qdel -u &quot;*&quot; to delete all jobs of
all users. <br>
If a manager wants to delete a specific job of a user, he
has to specify the user and the job. If no job is specified
all jobs from that user are deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wc_job_range_list <br>
A list of jobs, which should be deleted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES <br>
SGE_ROOT Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
standard configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CELL If set, specifies the
default Sun Grid Engine cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine
cell qdel uses (in the order of precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the cell specified
in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the default cell,
i.e. default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
If set, specifies that debug information should be written
to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which debug
information is generated is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_QMASTER_PORT <br>
If set, specifies the tcp port on which sge_qmaster(8) is
expected to listen for communication requests. Most
installations will use a services map entry for the <br>
service &quot;sge_qmaster&quot; instead to define that
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/act_qmaster <br>
Sun Grid Engine master host file</p>
