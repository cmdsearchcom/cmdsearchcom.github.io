<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mf, inimf, mf-nowin - Metafont, a language for font and logo
design</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mf [options] [commands]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Metafont reads the program in the specified files and
outputs font rasters (in gf format) and font metrics (in tfm
format). The Metafont language is described in The
Meta&acirc; <br>
fontbook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like TeX, Metafont is normally
used with a large body of precompiled macros, and font
generation in particular requires the support of several
macro files. This version of Meta&acirc; <br>
font looks at its command line to see what name it was
called under. Both inimf and virmf are symlinks to the mf
executable. When called as inimf (or when the -ini option is
<br>
given) it can be used to precompile macros into a .base
file. When called as virmf it will use the plain base. When
called under any other name, Metafont will use that name as
<br>
the name of the base to use. For example, when called as mf
the mf base is used, which is identical to the plain base.
Other bases than plain are rarely used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands given on the
command line to the Metafont program are passed to it as the
first input line. (But it is often easier to type extended
arguments as the first input <br>
line, since UNIX shells tend to gobble up or misinterpret
Metafont&rsquo;s favorite symbols, like semicolons, unless
you quote them.) As described in The Metafontbook, that
first line <br>
should begin with a filename, a <br>
The normal usage is to say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mf
&rsquo;de=&lt;printengine&gt;; [mag=magstep(n);]&rsquo;
input font</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to start processing font.mf. The
single quotes are the best way of keeping the Unix shell
from misinterpreting the semicolons and from removing the
&nbsp;character, which is needed <br>
here to keep Metafont from thinking that you want to produce
a font called mode. (Or you can just say mf and give the
other stuff on the next line, without quotes.) Other
con&acirc; <br>
trol sequences, such as batchmode (for silent operation) can
also appear. The name font will be the
&lsquo;&lsquo;jobname&rsquo;&rsquo;, and is used in forming
output file names. If Metafont doesn&rsquo;t <br>
get a file name in the first line, the jobname is mfput. The
default extension, .mf, can be overridden by specifying an
extension explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A log of error messages goes
into the file jobname.log. The output files are jobname.tfm
and jobname.&lt;number&gt;gf, where &lt;number&gt; depends
on the resolution and magnification of <br>
the font. The mode in this example is shown generically as
&lt;printengine&gt;, a symbolic term for which the name of
an actual device or, most commonly, the name localfont (see
<br>
below) must be substituted. If the mode is not specified or
is not valid for your site, Metafont will default to proof
mode which produces large character images for use in font
<br>
design and refinement. Proof mode can be recognized by the
suffix .2602gf after the jobname. Examples of proof mode
output can be found in Computer Modern Typefaces (Volume E
<br>
of Computers and Typesetting). The system of magsteps is
identical to the system used by TeX, with values generally
in the range 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0. A listing of
<br>
gf numbers for 118-dpi, 240-dpi and 300-dpi fonts is shown
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAGSTEP 118 dpi 240 dpi 300 dpi
<br>
mag=magstep(0) 118 240 300 <br>
mag=magstep(0.5) 129 263 329 <br>
mag=magstep(1) 142 288 360 <br>
mag=magstep(2) 170 346 432 <br>
mag=magstep(3) 204 415 518 <br>
mag=magstep(4) 245 498 622 <br>
mag=magstep(5) 294 597 746</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Magnification can also be
specified not as a magstep but as an arbitrary value, such
as 1.315, to create special character sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before font production can
begin, it is necessary to set up the appropriate base files.
The minimum set of components for font production for a
given print-engine is the <br>
plain.mf macro file and the local mode_def file. The macros
in plain.mf can be studied in an appendix to the
Metafontbook; they were developed by Donald E. Knuth, and
this file <br>
should never be altered except when it is officially
upgraded. Each mode_def specification helps adapt fonts to a
particular print-engine. There is a regular discussion of
<br>
mode_defs in TUGboat, the journal of the TeX Users Group.
The local ones in use on this computer should be in
modes.mf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The e response to
Metafont&rsquo;s error-recovery mode invokes the system
default editor at the erroneous line of the source file.
There is an environment variable, MFEDIT, that over&acirc;
<br>
rides the default editor. It should contain a string with
&quot;%s&quot; indicating where the filename goes and
&quot;%d&quot; indicating where the decimal linenumber (if
any) goes. For example, <br>
an MFEDIT string for the vi editor can be set with the csh
command <br>
setenv MFEDIT &quot;vi +%d %s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A convenient file in the library
is null.mf, containing nothing. When mf can&rsquo;t find the
file it thinks you want to input, it keeps asking you for
another file name; responding <br>
&lsquo;null&rsquo; gets you out of the loop if you
don&rsquo;t want to input anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ONLINE GRAPHICS OUTPUT <br>
Metafont can use most modern displays, so you can see its
output without printing. Chapter 23 of The Metafontbook
describes what you can do. This implementation of Metafont
<br>
uses environment variables to determine which display device
you want to use. First it looks for a variable MFTERM, and
then for TERM. If it can&rsquo;t find either, you get no
<br>
online output. Otherwise, the value of the variable
determines the device to use: hp2627, sun (for old SunView),
tek, uniterm (for an Atari ST Tek 4014 emulator), xterm (for
<br>
either X10 or X11). Some of these devices may not be
supported in all Metafont executables; the choice is made at
compilation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems, there are two
Metafont binaries, mf and mf-nowin. On those systems the mf
binary supports graphics, while the mf-nowin binary does
not. The mf-nowin binary is <br>
used by scripts like mktexpk where graphics support is a
nuisance rather than something helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This version of Metafont understands the following command
line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-base base <br>
Use base as the name of the base to be used, instead of the
name by which Metafont was called or a %&amp; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file-line-error <br>
Print error messages in the form file:line:error which is
similar to the way many compilers format them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-file-line-error <br>
Disable printing error messages in the file:line:error
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file-line-error-style <br>
This is the old name of the -file-line-error option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-halt-on-error <br>
Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ini Be inimf, for dumping
bases; this is implicitly true if the program is called as
inimf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interaction mode <br>
Sets the interaction mode. The mode can be one of batchmode,
nonstopmode, scrollmode, and errorstopmode. The meaning of
these modes is the same as that of the corre&acirc; <br>
sponding commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jobname name <br>
Use name for the job name, instead of deriving it from the
name of the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kpathsea-debug bitmask <br>
Sets path searching debugging flags according to the
bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maketex fmt <br>
Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be mf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-maketex fmt <br>
Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be mf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-directory directory <br>
Write output files in directory instead of the current
directory. Look up input files in directory first, the along
the normal search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-parse-first-line <br>
If the first line of the main input file begins with %&amp;
parse it to look for a dump name or a -translate-file
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-parse-first-line <br>
Disable parsing of the first line of the main input
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-progname name <br>
Pretend to be program name. This affects both the format
used and the search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-recorder <br>
Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a trace of the
files opened for input and output in a file with extension
.fls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-translate-file tcxname <br>
Use the tcxname translation table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the &lsquo;Path
specifications&rsquo; node) for the details of how the
environment variables are use when searching. The kpsewhich
utility can be <br>
used to query the values of the variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
TEXMFOUTPUT is set, Metafont attempts to put its output
files in it, if they cannot be put in the current directory.
Again, see tex(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MFINPUTS <br>
Search path for input and openin files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MFEDIT Command template for
switching to editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MFTERM Determines the online
graphics display. If MFTERM is not set, and DISPLAY is set,
the Metafont window support for X is used. (DISPLAY must be
set to a valid X server <br>
specification, as usual.) If neither MFTERM nor DISPLAY is
set, TERM is used to guess the window support to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONT UTILITIES <br>
A number of utility programs are available. The following is
a partial list of available utilities and their purpose.
Consult your local Metafont guru for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gftopk Takes a gf file and
produces a more tightly packed pk font file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gftodvi Produces proof sheets
for fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gftype Displays the contents of
a gf file in mnemonics and/or images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pktype Mnemonically displays the
contents of a pk file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mft Formats a source file as
shown in Computer Modern Typefaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
mf.pool <br>
Encoded text of Metafont&rsquo;s messages.</p>

This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive. The complete
documentation for this version of Metafont can be found in
the info manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
On January 4, 1986 the &lsquo;&lsquo;final&rsquo;&rsquo; bug
in Metafont was discovered and removed. If an error still
lurks in the code, Donald E. Knuth promises to pay a
finder&rsquo;s fee which doubles <br>
every year to the first person who finds it. Happy
hunting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMENTS <br>
Warning: &lsquo;&lsquo;Type design can be hazardous to your
other interests. Once you get hooked, you will develop
intense feelings about letterforms; the medium will intrude
on the mes&acirc; <br>
sages that you read. And you will perpetually be thinking of
improvements to the fonts that you see everywhere,
especially those of your own design.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Metafont was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it
using his Web system for Pascal programs. It was originally
ported to Unix by Paul Richards at the University of <br>
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This page was mostly written
by Pierre MacKay.</p>
