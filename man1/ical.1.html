<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ical - A Hijri/Islamic calendar (and converter)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ical [--gregorian yyyymmdd] [--hijri yyyymmdd]
[--umm_alqura] [--fixed_view] [--dual] [--help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ical program is a Hijri/Islamic calendar displayer. It
utilizes and includes a Gregorian to Hijri (and vice-versa)
date converter. The application uses and offers multiple
<br>
calculation methods with not all of them agreeing at all
times. The reason for this multiplicity is due to not having
one agreed upon method and so various entities develop and
<br>
advocate their calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ical is able to comprehend and
calculate both pre-epoch or pre-Hijrah, denoted as
&quot;B.H&quot;, as well as post-epoch or post-Hijrah,
denoted as &quot;A.H&quot;, dates. ical also utilizes
Grego&acirc; <br>
rian&rsquo;s pre-epoch &quot;B.C&quot; and post-epoch
&quot;A.D&quot; dates and notes them per its output. When
entering pre-epoch years, negative numbers ought to be
utilized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ical when run without any
command-line options uses the host machine&rsquo;s Gregorian
date and converts it to Hijri to display that month&rsquo;s
view. Entries enclosed by [] denote exact <br>
day specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ical follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (&lsquo;-&rsquo;). A
summary of all options is noted below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show summary of options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --gregorian yyyymmdd <br>
Specify the Gregorian date to be converted where
&rsquo;y&rsquo; stands for year, &rsquo;m&rsquo; for month
and &rsquo;d&rsquo; for day</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hi, --hijri yyyymmdd <br>
Specify the Hijri date to be converted where &rsquo;y&rsquo;
stands for year, &rsquo;m&rsquo; for month and
&rsquo;d&rsquo; for day</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --umm_alqura <br>
Specify to use the Umm Al-Qura calculation method (used
mostly in Saudi Arabia)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fixed_view <br>
Show a fixed week view (ie. start on Sun and end on Sat)
else default to showing the preferred week view of the
resulting calendar (Gregorian starts on Sunday, Hijri <br>
starts on Saturday)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dual <br>
Show both converstion from and to calendar months
simultaneously</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND <br>
The Hijri calendar is used in most of the Arab world and is
the symbolic calendar of the Islamic faithed worldwide. This
calendar is known as the &quot;Hijri&quot; (based on the
word <br>
&quot;Hijrah&quot; - denoting migration in Arabic) to signal
Prophet Mohammed&rsquo;s (PBUH) migration from Makkah to
Medinah on Thursday, July 15, 622 AD (Julian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Islamic Hijri calendar is
strictly lunar (ie. moon-based) with twelve lunar months
which do not correspond or track their solar counterparts
(the Gregorian calendar is a <br>
solar or sun-based calendar). Lunar years and thus Hijri
years are, on average, about 354 days long resulting in a
Hijri year being roughly about 11 days shorter than its
Grego&acirc; <br>
rian counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is much discussion and
confusion regarding how best to track the Hijri calendar. A
great deal of that confusion is based on the fact that many
relay on a human moon sight&acirc; <br>
ing to denote the start (or end) of a month (each month of
the Hijri calendar starts when a new moon&rsquo;s crescent
is observed or is made visible at sunset) as opposed to
using an <br>
empirical mathematic certainty. The methods presented in
this application and its underlying ITL library are strictly
arithmetic in nature and do NOT take moon-phases into
con&acirc; <br>
sideration (in short, observational approximation is not
used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
There is currently no Umm Al-Qura support.</p>
