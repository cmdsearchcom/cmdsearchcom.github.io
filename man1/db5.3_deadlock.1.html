<p>DB5.3_DEADLOCK(1) General Commands Manual
DB5.3_DEADLOCK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_deadlock - Detect and abort deadlocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_deadlock [-Vv] [-a e | m | n | o | W | w | y] [-h
home] [-L file] [-t sec.usec]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_deadlock utility traverses the database
environment lock region, and aborts a lock request each time
it detects a deadlock or a lock request that has timed out.
By <br>
default, in the case of a deadlock, a random lock request is
chosen to be aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility should be run as a
background daemon, or the underlying Berkeley DB deadlock
detection interfaces should be called in some other way,
whenever there are multiple <br>
threads or processes accessing a database and at least one
of them is modifying it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a When a deadlock is detected, abort the locker:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m with the most locks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n with the fewest locks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o with the oldest lock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W with the most write locks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w with the fewest write
locks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y with the youngest lock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When lock or transaction
timeouts have been specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e abort any lock request that
has timed out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify a home directory for
the database environment; by default, the current working
directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Log the execution of the
db5.3_deadlock utility to the specified file in the
following format, where ### is the process ID, and the date
is the time the utility was <br>
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db_deadlock: ### Wed Jun 15
01:23:45 EDT 1995</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file will be removed if the
db5.3_deadlock utility exits gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Check the database
environment every sec seconds plus usec microseconds to see
if a process has been forced to wait for a lock; if one has,
review the database environ&acirc; <br>
ment lock structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Run in verbose mode,
generating messages each time the detector runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -t option is not
specified, db5.3_deadlock will run once and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_deadlock utility uses
a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option,
the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was
run in a directory con&acirc; <br>
taining a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db5.3_deadlock should always be given the chance to detach
<br>
from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause
db5.3_deadlock to release all environment resources and exit
cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_deadlock utility does
not attempt to create the Berkeley DB shared memory regions
if they do not already exist. The application which creates
the region should be <br>
started first, and then, once the region is created, the
db5.3_deadlock utility should be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DB_ENV-&gt;lock_detect
method is the underlying method used by the db_deadlock
utility. See the db_deadlock utility source code for an
example of using DB_ENV-&gt;lock_detect in a <br>
IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX) environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_deadlock utility exits
0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
