<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
detex - a filter to strip TeX commands from a .tex file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
detex [ -clnstw ] [ -e environment-list ] [ filename[.tex]
... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Detex (Version 2.6) reads each file in sequence, removes all
comments and TeX control sequences and writes the remainder
on the standard output. All text in math mode and dis&acirc;
<br>
play mode is removed. By default, detex follows input
commands. If a file cannot be opened, a warning message is
printed and the command is ignored. If the -n option is
used, <br>
no input or include commands will be processed. This allows
single file processing. If no input file is given on the
command line, detex reads from standard input. g i n {</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the magic sequence
&lsquo;&lsquo;dnt}&rsquo;&rsquo; appears in the text, o c u
m detex assumes it is dealing with LaTeX source and detex
recognizes additional constructs used in LaTeX. These <br>
include the include and includeonly commands. The -l option
can be used to force LaTeX mode and the -t option can be
used to force TeX mode regardless of input content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text in various environment
modes of LaTeX is ignored. The default modes are array,
eqnarray, equation, figure, mathmatica, picture, table and
verbatim. The -e option can be <br>
used to specify a comma separated environment-list of
environments to ignore. The list replaces the defaults so
specifying an empty list effectively causes no environments
to be <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option can be used in
LaTeX mode to have detex echo the arguments to <br>
Detex assumes the standard character classes are being used
for TeX. Detex allows white space between control sequences
and magic characters like &lsquo;{&rsquo; when recognizing
things <br>
like LaTeX environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -w flag is given, the
output is a word list, one &lsquo;word&rsquo; (string of two
or more letters and apostrophes beginning with a letter) per
line, and all other characters ignored. <br>
Without -w the output follows the original, with the
deletions mentioned above. Newline characters are preserved
where possible so that the lines of output match the input
as <br>
closely as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TEXINPUTS environment
variable is used to find input and include files. Like TeX,
it interprets a leading or trailing &lsquo;:&rsquo; as the
default TEXINPUTS. It does not support <br>
the &lsquo;//&rsquo; directory expansion magic sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detex now handles the basic TeX
ligatures as a special case, replacing the ligatures with
acceptable charater substitutes. This eliminates spelling
errors introduced by merely <br>
removing them. The ligatures are a, e, , <br>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that previous versions of
detex would replace control sequences with a space character
to prevent words from running together. However, this caused
accents in the middle of <br>
words to break words, generating &quot;spelling errors&quot;
that were not desirable. Therefore, the new version merely
removes these accents. The old functionality can be
essentially <br>
duplicated by using the -s option.</p>

tex(1L)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Nesting of input is allowed but the number of opened files
must not exceed the system&rsquo;s limit on the number of
simultaneously opened files. Detex ignores unrecognized
option <br>
characters after printing a warning message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Detex is not a complete TeX interpreter, so it can be
confused by some constructs. Most errors result in too much
rather than too little output. g i n {</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running LaTeX source without a
&lsquo;&lsquo;dnt}&rsquo;&rsquo; through detex may o c u m
produce errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suggestions for improvements are
(mildly) encouraged.</p>
