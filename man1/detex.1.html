detex - a filter to strip <i>TeX</i> commands from a .tex file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>detex</b> [ <b>-clnstw</b> ] [ <b>-e</b><i> environment-list</i> ] [
  <i>filename</i>[.tex] ... ]

<i>Detex</i> (Version 2.6) reads each file in sequence, removes all comments and
  <i>TeX</i> control sequences and writes the remainder on the standard output.
  All text in math mode and display mode is removed. By default, <i>detex</i>
  follows \input commands. If a file cannot be opened, a warning message is
  printed and the command is ignored. If the <b>-n</b> option is used, no \input
  or \include commands will be processed. This allows single file processing. If
  no input file is given on the command line, <i>detex</i> reads from standard
  input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the magic sequence ``\begin{document}'' appears in the text, <i>detex</i>
  assumes it is dealing with <i>LaTeX</i> source and <i>detex</i> recognizes
  additional constructs used in <i>LaTeX</i>. These include the \include and
  \includeonly commands. The <b>-l</b> option can be used to force <i>LaTeX</i>
  mode and the <b>-t</b> option can be used to force <i>TeX</i> mode regardless
  of input content.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Text in various environment modes of <i>LaTeX</i> is ignored. The default modes
  are array, eqnarray, equation, figure, mathmatica, picture, table and
  verbatim. The <b>-e</b> option can be used to specify a comma separated
  <i>environment-list</i> of environments to ignore. The list replaces the
  defaults so specifying an empty list effectively causes no environments to be
  ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-c</b> option can be used in <i>LaTeX</i> mode to have detex echo the
  arguments to \cite, \ref, and \pageref macros. This can be useful when sending
  the output to a style checker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Detex</i> assumes the standard character classes are being used for
  <i>TeX</i>. <i>Detex</i> allows white space between control sequences and
  magic characters like `{' when recognizing things like <i>LaTeX</i>
  environments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-w</b> flag is given, the output is a word list, one `word' (string of
  two or more letters and apostrophes beginning with a letter) per line, and all
  other characters ignored. Without <b>-w</b> the output follows the original,
  with the deletions mentioned above. Newline characters are preserved where
  possible so that the lines of output match the input as closely as possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The TEXINPUTS environment variable is used to find \input and \include files.
  Like <i>TeX</i>, it interprets a leading or trailing `:' as the default
  TEXINPUTS. It does <i>not</i> support the `//' directory expansion magic
  sequence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Detex now handles the basic <i>TeX</i> ligatures as a special case, replacing
  the ligatures with acceptable charater substitutes. This eliminates spelling
  errors introduced by merely removing them. The ligatures are \aa, \ae, \oe,
  \ss, \o, \l (and their upper-case equivalents). The special
  &quot;dotless&quot; characters \i and \j are also replaced with i and j
  respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that previous versions of <i>detex</i> would replace control sequences with
  a space character to prevent words from running together. However, this caused
  accents in the middle of words to break words, generating &quot;spelling
  errors&quot; that were not desirable. Therefore, the new version merely
  removes these accents. The old functionality can be essentially duplicated by
  using the <b>-s</b> option.

Nesting of \input is allowed but the number of opened files must not exceed the
  system's limit on the number of simultaneously opened files. <i>Detex</i>
  ignores unrecognized option characters after printing a warning message.

<i>Detex</i> is not a complete <i>TeX</i> interpreter, so it can be confused by
  some constructs. Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Running <i>LaTeX</i> source without a ``\begin{document}'' through <i>detex</i>
  may produce errors.

Suggestions for improvements are (mildly) encouraged.</div>
