<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
distccd - distributed C/C++ compiler server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
distccd --daemon [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
distccd is the server for the distcc(1) distributed
compiler. It accepts and runs compilation jobs for network
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc can run over either TCP
or a connection command such as ssh(1). TCP connections are
fast but relatively insecure. SSH connections are secure but
slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For SSH connections, distccd
must be installed on the volunteer but should not run as a
daemon -- it will be started over SSH as needed. SSH
connections have several advantages: <br>
neither the client nor server listens on any new ports;
compilations run with the privileges of the user that
requested them; unauthorized users cannot access the server;
and <br>
source and output is protected in transit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For TCP connections, distccd can
run either from an inetd-style program, or as a standalone
server. Standalone mode is recommended because it is
slightly more efficient and <br>
allows distccd to regulate the number of incoming jobs. The
--listen and --allow options can be used for simple IP-based
access control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc may be started either by
root or any other user. If run by root, it gives away
privileges and changes to the user specified by the --user
option, or the user called <br>
&quot;distcc&quot;, or the user called
&quot;nobody&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distccd does not have a
configuration file; it&rsquo;s behaviour is controlled only
by command-line options and requests from clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDALONE SERVER <br>
The recommended method for running distccd is as a
standalone server. distccd will listen for network
connections and fork several child processes to serve
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you installed distcc using a
packaged version you may be able to start the server using
the standard mechanism for your operating system, such
as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># service distcc start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start distccd as a standalone
service, run a command like this either as root or an
ordinary user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># distccd --daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING FROM INIT <br>
distccd may be run as a standalone daemon under the control
of another program like init(8) or daemontools. The
super-server starts distccd when the system boots, and
whenever <br>
it exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distccd should be started just
as for a standalone server, except that the --no-detach
option should be used so that the super-server can monitor
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to add distccd as a
process to Linux sysvinit, add this line to /etc/inittab</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">dscc:2345:respawn:/usr/local/bin/distccd
--verbose --no-detach --daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING FROM INETD <br>
distccd may be started from a network super-server such as
inetd or xinetd. In this case inetd listens for network
connections and invokes distccd when one arrives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is slightly less efficient
than running a standalone distccd daemon. distccd is not
able to regulate the number of concurrent jobs accepted, but
there may be an option in <br>
your inetd configuration to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For traditional Unix inetd, a
line like this can be added to /etc/inetd.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc stream tcp nowait.6000
root /usr/local/bin/distccd distccd --inetd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inetd imposes a limit on the
rate of connections to a service to protect against
accidental or intentional overuse. The default in Linux
NetKit inetd is 40 per minute, which is <br>
far too low for distccd. The .6000 option raises the limit
to 6000 per minute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINATING DISTCCD <br>
To shut down a standalone server, send a SIGTERM signal to
the parent process. The most reliable way to do this from a
script is to use the --pid-file option to record its <br>
process ID. Shutting down the server in this way should
allow any jobs currently in progress to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help Display summary usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Shows the daemon version and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --jobs JOBS <br>
Sets a limit on the number of jobs that can be accepted at
any time. By default this is set to two greater than the
number of CPUs on the machine, to allow for some pro&acirc;
<br>
cesses being blocked on network IO. (Daemon mode only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --nice NICENESS <br>
Makes the daemon more nice about giving up the CPU to other
tasks on the machine. NICENESS is an increment to the
current priority of the process. The range of priori&acirc;
<br>
ties depends on the operating system but is typically 0 to
20. By default the niceness is increased by 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --port PORT <br>
Set the TCP port to listen on, rather than the default of
3632. (Daemon mode only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listen ADDRESS <br>
Instructs the distccd daemon to listen on the IP address
ADDRESS. This can be useful for access control on dual-homed
hosts. (Daemon mode only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pid-file FILE <br>
Save daemon process id to file FILE. (Daemon mode only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user USER <br>
If distccd gets executed as root, change to user USER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --allow IPADDR[/MASK] <br>
Instructs distccd to accept connections from the IP address
IPADDR. A CIDR mask length can be supplied optionally after
a trailing slash, e.g. 192.168.0.0/24, in which <br>
case addresses that match in the most significant MASK bits
will be allowed. If no --allow options are specified,
distccd will exit immediately! Unauthorized connections <br>
are rejected by closing the TCP connection immediately. A
warning is logged on the server but nothing is sent to the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--job-lifetime SECONDS <br>
Kills a distccd job if it runs for more than SECONDS
seconds. This prevents denial of service from clients that
don&rsquo;t properly disconnect and compilers that fail to
termi&acirc; <br>
nate. By default this is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-detach <br>
Do not detach from the shell that started the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-fork <br>
Don&rsquo;t fork children for each connection, to allow
attaching gdb. Don&rsquo;t use this if you don&rsquo;t
understand it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file FILE <br>
Send messages to file FILE instead of syslog. Logging
directly to a file is significantly faster than going via
syslog and is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-level LEVEL <br>
Set the minimum severity of error that will be included in
the log file. Useful if you only want to see error messages
rather than an entry for each connection. LEVEL <br>
can be any of the standard syslog levels, and in particular
critical, error, warning, notice, info, or debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-stderr <br>
Send log messages to stderr, rather than to a file or
syslog. This is mainly intended for use in debugging. Do not
use in inetd mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Include debug messages in log. Equivalent to
--log-level=debug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wizard <br>
Turn on all options appropriate for starting distccd under
gdb: run as a daemon, log verbosely to stderr, and do not
detach or fork. For wizards only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stats <br>
Turn on the statistics HTTP server. By default it is off.
(Daemon mode only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stats-port PORT <br>
Set the TCP port to listen on for HTTP requests, rather than
the default of 3633. (Daemon mode only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inetd <br>
Serve a client connected to stdin/stdout. As the name
suggests, this option should be used when distccd is run
from within a super-server like inetd. distccd assumes <br>
inetd mode when stdin is a socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon <br>
Bind and listen on a socket, rather than running from inetd.
This is used for standalone mode. distccd assumes daemon
mode at startup if stdin is a tty, so --daemon <br>
should be explicitly specified when starting distccd from a
script or in a non-interactive ssh connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--zeroconf <br>
Register the availability of this distccd server using Avahi
Zeroconf DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD). This allows distcc
clients on the local network to access this <br>
distccd server without explicitly listing its host name or
IP address in their distcc host list: the distcc clients can
just use &quot;+zeroconf&quot; in their distcc host lists.
<br>
This option is only available if distccd was compiled with
Avahi support enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCH PATHS <br>
distcc can pass either a relative or an absolute name for
the compiler to distccd. If distcc is given an explicit
absolute compiler filename, that name is used verbatim on
both <br>
the client and server. If the compiler name is not an
absolute path, or if the client is used in masquerade mode,
then the server&rsquo;s PATH is searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distccd inherits its search path
from its parent process. By default distccd tries to remove
directories that seem to contain distccd masquerade links,
to guard against inadver&acirc; <br>
tent recursion. The DISTCCD_PATH environment variable may be
used to set the path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The search path is logged when
--verbose is given. In case of confusion, check the
logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When distccd is run over ssh,
the $HOME/.ssh/environment file may be useful in setting the
path. See ssh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
distccd logs messages to syslog&rsquo;s daemon facility by
default, which normally writes to /var/log/daemon or
/var/log/messages. Log messages can be sent to a different
file using <br>
the --log-file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DISTCC_CMDLIST <br>
If the environment variable DISTCC_CMDLIST is set, load a
list of supported commands from the file named by
DISTCC_CMDLIST, and refuse to serve any command whose last
<br>
DISTCC_CMDLIST_MATCHWORDS last words do not match those of a
command in that list. See the comments in src/serve.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_CMDLIST_NUMWORDS <br>
The number of words, from the end of the command, to match.
The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCCD_PATH <br>
When starting distccd, if this value is set it will be used
unaltered for the command-execution PATH. The code that
normally tries to remove masquerade directories from <br>
the path is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_SAVE_TEMPS <br>
If set to 1, temporary files are not deleted after use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that DISTCC_LOG does not
affect the log destination for the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT <br>
On Linux, turn on the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT socket option.
Defaults to on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Directory for temporary
files such as preprocessor output. By default /tmp/ is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
IP-based access control is not secure against attackers able
to spoof TCP connections, and cannot discriminate different
users on a client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP connections are not secure
against attackers able to observe or modify network
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because ccache does not cache
compilation from .i files, it is not useful to call it from
distccd.</p>
