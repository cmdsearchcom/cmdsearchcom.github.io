<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mupmate - user interface for Mup music publisher</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mupmate [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
You can create a Mup file using any ordinary text editor. On
Windows, Notepad is a typical choice; on Linux, editors like
vim and emacs are commonly used. But if you prefer to <br>
be able to edit, display, and play from a single integrated
and more graphical interface, a helper program called
&quot;mupmate&quot; is provided. Mupmate is currently
supported on Win&acirc; <br>
dows, Apple Mac OS-X, and Linux. However, since the source
code is available, and it is based on the
cross&acirc;platform FLTK toolkit, it can probably be made
to run on any system <br>
supported by FLTK fairly easily. If you prefer to use the
Mup program directly rather than via mupmate, you can. The
Mupmate program just helps lead you through some of the <br>
steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have installed Mup and
Mupmate on Windows, double clicking a .mup file in Windows
explorer will run Mupmate on that file. Or, you can run
Mupmate by going to the Start <br>
menu, and choosing Programs, then Arkkra, and then Mupmate.
If you would like an icon on the desktop, you can create one
by right clicking the Mupmate choice in the Arkkra menu,
<br>
choosing &quot;copy&quot;, right clicking somewhere on the
desktop, and choosing &quot;paste.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, you can just type the
mupmate command, optionally followed by the name of a Mup
input file. Or you can add mupmate to your favorite window
manager&rsquo;s menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Mac OS-X, you can
double&acirc;click on the MupMate.app in Finder. You should
also be able to double&acirc;click any file with a .mup
suffix, which should then run Mupmate on that file. <br>
For setting paths in the Preferences, several
&quot;magic&quot; variables are set automatically, if you
have not already set them to something else. $APPL is set to
the top of the appli&acirc; <br>
cation directory hierarchy. $RSRC is effectively set to
$APPL/MupMate.app/Contents/Resources. $HOME is set to your
home directory. $SUPP is set to your applications support
<br>
folder (which is typically $HOME/Library/Application
Support). $DOCS is set to your document folder (which is
typically $HOME/Documents).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mupmate provides five top level
menus: File, Edit, Run, Config, and Help. The File menu
provides commands for opening new files and saving the file
you are working on, as well <br>
as exit the program. The Edit menu provides the kinds of
things you would expect in a editor: commands to find a
pattern, or find and replace; to select text; to copy, cut,
and <br>
paste; to go to a specific line; and to undo the previous
operation, if you make a mistake or change you mind. The Run
menu lets you set runtime options, and then run the Mup <br>
program on your input in various ways. You can either just
generate a PostScript or MIDI file, or display the
PostScript or play the MIDI. The Config menu lets you
specify what <br>
application program you want to use to view PostScript files
and which you want to use to play MIDI files, and well as
specify locations for other Mup files. Mupmate will try to
<br>
find reasonable default values, but you may want to check
that they are what you want, and tweak them if they
aren&rsquo;t. For paths, you can include environment
variables to be <br>
expanded, by giving their name preceded by a dollar sign. A
tilde by itself will be expanded to your home directory,
whereas a tilde followed by the name of a user will be <br>
expanded to that user&rsquo;s home directory. The Help menu
lets you browse the Mup User&rsquo;s Guide, view some
startup hints, view the Mup license, or see the current
version number of <br>
Mup and Mupmate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Mupmate is currently only supported on Microsoft Windows,
Apple Mac OS-X, and Linux or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mupmate does not directly
provide a print facility. Almost any PostScript viewer
already provides this ability, so you can simply select
&quot;Display&quot; from the Run menu and use the <br>
viewer&rsquo;s print capabilities. Alternately you can use
the &quot;Write PostScript File&quot; from the Run menu and
then print the resulting file.</p>
