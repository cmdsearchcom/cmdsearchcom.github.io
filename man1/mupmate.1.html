You can create a Mup file using any ordinary text editor. On Windows, Notepad is
  a typical choice; on Linux, editors like vim and emacs are commonly used. But
  if you prefer to be able to edit, display, and play from a single integrated
  and more graphical interface, a helper program called &quot;mupmate&quot; is
  provided. Mupmate is currently supported on Windows, Apple Mac OS-X, and
  Linux. However, since the source code is available, and it is based on the
  cross&#x2010;platform FLTK toolkit, it can probably be made to run on any
  system supported by FLTK fairly easily. If you prefer to use the Mup program
  directly rather than via mupmate, you can. The Mupmate program just helps lead
  you through some of the steps.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you have installed Mup and Mupmate on Windows, double clicking a .mup file
  in Windows explorer will run Mupmate on that file. Or, you can run Mupmate by
  going to the Start menu, and choosing Programs, then Arkkra, and then Mupmate.
  If you would like an icon on the desktop, you can create one by right clicking
  the Mupmate choice in the Arkkra menu, choosing &quot;copy&quot;, right
  clicking somewhere on the desktop, and choosing &quot;paste.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Linux, you can just type the mupmate command, optionally followed by the name
  of a Mup input file. Or you can add mupmate to your favorite window manager's
  menus.

On Mac OS-X, you can double&#x2010;click on the MupMate.app in Finder. You
  should also be able to double&#x2010;click any file with a .mup suffix, which
  should then run Mupmate on that file. For setting paths in the Preferences,
  several &quot;magic&quot; variables are set automatically, if you have not
  already set them to something else. $APPL is set to the top of the application
  directory hierarchy. $RSRC is effectively set to
  $APPL/MupMate.app/Contents/Resources. $HOME is set to your home directory.
  $SUPP is set to your applications support folder (which is typically
  $HOME/Library/Application Support). $DOCS is set to your document folder
  (which is typically $HOME/Documents).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mupmate provides five top level menus: File, Edit, Run, Config, and Help. The
  File menu provides commands for opening new files and saving the file you are
  working on, as well as exit the program. The Edit menu provides the kinds of
  things you would expect in a editor: commands to find a pattern, or find and
  replace; to select text; to copy, cut, and paste; to go to a specific line;
  and to undo the previous operation, if you make a mistake or change you mind.
  The Run menu lets you set runtime options, and then run the Mup program on
  your input in various ways. You can either just generate a PostScript or MIDI
  file, or display the PostScript or play the MIDI. The Config menu lets you
  specify what application program you want to use to view PostScript files and
  which you want to use to play MIDI files, and well as specify locations for
  other Mup files. Mupmate will try to find reasonable default values, but you
  may want to check that they are what you want, and tweak them if they aren't.
  For paths, you can include environment variables to be expanded, by giving
  their name preceded by a dollar sign. A tilde by itself will be expanded to
  your home directory, whereas a tilde followed by the name of a user will be
  expanded to that user's home directory. The Help menu lets you browse the Mup
  User's Guide, view some startup hints, view the Mup license, or see the
  current version number of Mup and Mupmate.

Mupmate is currently only supported on Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS-X, and
  Linux or similar.

Mupmate does not directly provide a print facility. Almost any PostScript viewer
  already provides this ability, so you can simply select &quot;Display&quot;
  from the Run menu and use the viewer's print capabilities. Alternately you can
  use the &quot;Write PostScript File&quot; from the Run menu and then print the
  resulting file.</div>
