<p>pal(1) General Commands Manual pal(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pal - calendar with events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pal [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pal is a command&acirc;line calendar utility. It displays a
cal(1)&acirc;like calender and events specified in text
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are provided by pal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d date <br>
Show events on the given date. Valid formats for date
include: dd, mmdd, yyyymmdd, &rsquo;yesterday&rsquo;,
&rsquo;today&rsquo;, &rsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;, &rsquo;n days
away&rsquo;, &rsquo;n days ago&rsquo;, first two letters of
<br>
weekday, &rsquo;next &rsquo; followed by first two letters
of weekday, &rsquo;last &rsquo; followed by first two
letters of weekday, &rsquo;1 Jan 2000&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jan 1
2000&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r n Display events occurring in
the next n days (counting today). By default, n is 0 and no
events are displayed. For example, using -r 1 makes pal
display events occurring <br>
today. If -d is used too, the range is relative to date
instead of the current date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r p-n Display a list of events
occurring in the past p days (not counting today) and the
next n days (counting today). For example -r 1-1 will show
yesterday&rsquo;s and today&rsquo;s <br>
events. If -d is used too, the range is relative to date
instead of the current date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s regex <br>
Search for any occurrences of an event matching the regular
expression (regex) occurring in the range of dates specified
with -r. This command searches both the event <br>
description and the type of event (specified at the top of a
calendar file). This search is case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x n Expunge events that are n
or more days old if they do not occur again in the future.
pal will not expunge events from the calendars loaded from
/usr/share/pal; even if <br>
you are root and you have added events to the calendars that
are not recurring. When -x is used with -v, the events that
are expunged will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c n Display a calendar with n
lines (default: 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Load file instead of ~/.pal/pal.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username <br>
Load /home/username/.pal/pal.conf instead of
~/.pal/pal.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p palfile <br>
Override the .pal files loaded from pal.conf. This will only
load palfile. For convenience, if palfile is a relative
path, pal looks for the file relative from ~/.pal/, <br>
if not found, it tries relative to /usr/share/pal/, if not
found it tries relative to your current directory. (This
behavior might change in the future.) Using an abso&acirc;
<br>
lute path will work as you expect it to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Manage events interactively.
Events can be added, modified and deleted with this
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color <br>
Force use of colors, regardless of terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocolor <br>
Do not use colors, regardless of terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mail Generates output readable
by sendmail by adding &quot;From:&quot; and
&quot;Subject:&quot; fields and forcing --nocolor. For
example, you could mail yourself a reminder of the upcoming
<br>
events in the next week with pal --mail -r 7 | sendmail
username. Note: For the calendar to appear correctly, make
sure your email client is using a fixed width font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--html Generates a HTML calendar
suitable for display on a web page. It does not generate a
complete HTML document so that you can add your
website&rsquo;s header and footer around <br>
the calendar. The number of months shown on the calendar can
be adjusted with -c. You will need to use Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) to change how the calendar appears; <br>
if you do not use a style sheet, the calendar will not have
any borders. See /usr/share/doc/pal/example.css for an
example style. SECURITY NOTE: If you set up pal so it <br>
is being executed server&acirc;side, it is recommended that
you do not allow web page visitors to directly change the
parameters sent to pal. Allowing users to pass strange <br>
parameters (such as extremely long ones) can be a security
risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--latex <br>
Generates a LaTeX source for a calendar that can be used to
generate a printer&acirc;friendly DVI (run &quot;pal --latex
&gt; file.tex; latex file.tex&quot;), PostScript or PDF (run
&quot;pal <br>
--latex &gt; file.tex; pdflatex file.tex&quot;). The number
of months shown on the calendar can be adjusted with -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENT DESCRIPTIONS <br>
Years since year YYYY <br>
pal will replace !YYYY! (where YYYY is a year) with the
current year minus YYYY. This feature is particularly useful
for birthdays. For example, the event text for a
birth&acirc; <br>
day could be: John Doe was born on this day in 1990. He is
!1990! years old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sort by time <br>
If events have a time in the event description, pal will
sort these events by time. The time in the event description
must be of the format h:mm or hh:mm (where hh is 0-23). <br>
If an event has more than one time in the event description,
pal will sort the event by the first time. Events that do
not have times in them are shown before all the events <br>
that do have times. Events without times are sorted in the
order that they are loaded in pal.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE FORMATS <br>
Unless -f or -u is used, pal looks for (or tries to create
if it doesn&rsquo;t exist) a configuration file named
~/.pal/pal.conf. pal.conf contains settings for pal and a
list other <br>
files that contain events to be displayed on the calendar.
The file formats for pal.conf and the event files are
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pal.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file filename [ (color) ] <br>
Loads an event file named filename. If filename isn&rsquo;t
found in ~/.pal, pal will look for it in /usr/share/pal. The
color parameter is optional, it will display the <br>
events in the file with the given color. Valid colors:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file_hide filename [ (color) ]
<br>
Loads an event file name filename. These events are not
indicated in the calendar that is printed, but they are
displayed when the -r argument is used. If filename <br>
isn&rsquo;t found in ~/.pal, pal will look for it in
/usr/share/pal. The color parameter is optional, it will
display the events in the file with the given color. Valid
<br>
colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
white</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">event_color color <br>
The default color used for events. Valid colors: black, red,
green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">week_start_monday <br>
If this keyword is defined, the calendar weeks start on
Monday instead of Sunday.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date_fmt string <br>
Changes how dates are displayed when the -r -d or -s
arguments are used. string can be a date format string that
follows the format used by strftime(3). Type man <br>
strftime for more information. string is set to %a %e %b %Y
by default (example: Sun 8 Aug 2010).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reverse_order <br>
Display all event listings in descending order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hide_event_type <br>
Hide the event type (shown in before a &rsquo;:&rsquo;) when
listing events. The event type is defined at the top of the
file that the event is found in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cal_on_bottom <br>
Display calendar at the end of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_columns <br>
Display calendar in one column instead of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compact_list <br>
List events that are shown when using -r in a more compact
form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compact_date_fmt <br>
Format for the date displayed when compact_list is used. See
date_fmt for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default_range range <br>
If you get tired of always using -r, you can set the default
value for -r here. See the information on -r above to see
possible values for range. Note: Remember that <br>
this will affect what is displayed when -d and -s are used
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Event Files <br>
Event files are ASCII or UTF-8 text files (usually with a
.pal ending) that define events for pal to show. Example
event files can be found in /usr/share/pal. The first line
<br>
in these files indicate settings that apply to all of the
events in the file. The first line starts with two
characters that should be used in the calendar that pal
displays. <br>
A longer description of the kinds of events in the file
follows the two characters. This description will be
displayed when the -r argument is used. All other lines in
the <br>
file are in the format date event. date defines when the
event occurs and event is a string that describes the event.
Below is a description of the different strings that <br>
can be used with date:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Events that occur only once <br>
Use the format yyyymmdd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daily events <br>
The format DAILY can be used for an event that happens every
day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weekly events <br>
The format MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT and SUN can be used
for an event that happens every week.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monthly events <br>
Use the format 000000dd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annual events <br>
Use the format 0000mmdd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annual: Events that occur on the
Nth day of a month. <br>
Use the format *mmnd. Where d is the day (1 = Sunday, 7 =
Saturday). Example: *1023 (10=Oct; 2=&quot;second&quot;;
3=Tuesday ==&gt; Second Tuesday in October, every year).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monthly: Events that occur on
the Nth day of a month. <br>
Use the format *00nd. Where d is the day (1 = Sunday, 7 =
Saturday). Example: *0023 (2=&quot;second&quot;; 3=Tuesday
==&gt; Second Tuesday of every month).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annual: Events that occur on a
certain last day of a month <br>
Use the format *mmLd. Example: *10L3 (10=Oct; L=Last;
3=Tuesday ==&gt; Last Tuesday in October). This is useful
for some holidays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monthly: Events that occur on a
certain last day of a month <br>
Use the format *00Ld. Example: *00L3 (3=Tuesday ==&gt; Last
Tuesday of every month).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Todo events <br>
The format TODO can be used for an event that always happens
on the day that you run pal. This enables you to use pal to
keep track of items in your todo list(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Easter related events <br>
Use the format Easter for Easter Sunday. Use the format
Easter+nnn for events that occur nnn days after Easter. Use
the format Easter&acirc;nnn for events that occur nnn <br>
days before easter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recurring events with start and
end dates <br>
If a recurring event has a starting date and an ending date,
you can use the date format DATE:START:END where DATE is a
recurring date format above. START and END are <br>
dates in the yyyymmdd format that specify the starting and
ending date of the recurring event. START and END dates are
inclusive. For example, if an event happens <br>
every Wednesday in October 2010, you could use this format:
WED:20101001:20101031</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bi-weekly, Bi-annual, etc.
events <br>
If a recurring event does only occurs every Nth occurence,
you can add a /N to the event of the date string for that
event. A start date must be specified. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, a bi-monthly event that occurs on the first of the
month can be specified as 00000001/2:20000101.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNATIONALIZATION AND
LOCALIZATION <br>
The calendar files that pal uses must be ASCII encoded or
UTF-8 encoded text files (ASCII is a subset of UTF-8). UTF-8
enables the calendar files to work on any system
regard&acirc; <br>
less of the default encoding scheme. When pal prints text,
it converts the UTF-8 characters into the local encoding for
your system. If pal does not display international
char&acirc; <br>
acters and you are using a UTF-8 calendar file, check to
make sure that your locale is set correctly. You can see
your locale settings by running &quot;locale&quot;. You can
see the <br>
character set that pal is using for output by running pal
with &quot;-v&quot;. If pal does not have a translation for
your language and you are interested in creating a
translation, see <br>
the po/README file that is distributed with the source code
for pal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.pal/pal.conf: Contains configuration information for pal
and a list of .pal text files that contain events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/pal.conf: This pal.conf
file is copied to ~/.pal/pal.conf when a user runs pal for
the first time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/pal: Contains several
calendar files for pal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Bugs may be reported via http://palcal.sourceforge.net/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
strftime(3), cal(1), regex(7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMILAR PROGRAMS <br>
pal is similar to BSD&rsquo;s calendar program and
GNU&rsquo;s more complex gcal program.</p>
