<p>XDEVIEW(1) General Commands Manual XDEVIEW(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xdeview - a powerful decoder for binary files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xdeview [Xt options] [-- options] [file(s)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
XDeview is a smart decoder for attachments that you have
received in encoded form via electronic mail or from the
usenet. It is similar to the standard uudecode(1) command,
yet <br>
with more comfort and flexibility. XDeview supports the
uuencoding, xxencoding, Base64 and BinHex encoding methods,
and is able to handle split-files (which have been sent in
<br>
multiple parts) as well as multiple files at once, thus
greatly simplifying the decoding process. Usually, you will
not have to manually edit files to prepare them for
decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t really need a
graphical frontend for these kinds of jobs, have a look at
uudeview(1) and uuenview(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After invoking the program, it
will scan all the given files for encoded data. If any of
them were directories, they will be recursively dived into.
You don&rsquo;t need to give files <br>
on the command line; you can also select files later from
within the program. After completing the initial scan, you
will be presented with a list of files that seem like they
<br>
can be decoded properly. You can then pick files
individually for decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
There&rsquo;s no real need to set options on the command
line; they can also be set from within the program. Note
that options must be preceded by a double-hyphen
&rsquo;--&rsquo;, otherwise they <br>
might be mistaken for display options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Sets the program into
desperate mode. It will then offer you to decode incomplete
files. This is useful if you are missing the last part of a
50-parts posting, but in most <br>
cases the desperately-decoded files will simply be corrupt
and unusable. The degree of usefulness of an incomplete file
depends on the file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Uses fast mode for file
scanning. The program assumes that each input file holds at
most one part, which is usually true for files in a news
spool directory. This option <br>
breaks decoding of input files with multiple articles. Also,
certain sanity checks are disabled, probably causing
erroneous files to be presented for decoding. Sometimes <br>
you&rsquo;ll get error messages when decoding, sometimes
you&rsquo;ll just receive invalid files. Don&rsquo;t use -f
if you can&rsquo;t live with these problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Gives the OK to overwrite
files already there on decoding. The default is to prompt
the user whether to overwrite, rename or skip the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Disables verbosity. Normally,
the program prints some status messages while reading the
input files, which can be very helpful if something should
go wrong. Use if these <br>
messages disturb you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p path <br>
Sets the path where decoded files shall be written to. This
must be a valid pathname, or you&rsquo;ll get errors when
trying to decode anything. Defaults to the current working
<br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b This changes xdeview&rsquo;s
policy of finding a part number on a subject line and may
only be needed in some rare cases when part numbers are
found in () parentheses as well as <br>
in [] brackets, for example in a series of multi-part
postings. By default, xdeview uses the numbers found in ()
parentheses first. But if this number indicates the <br>
file&rsquo;s number in the series and the part number is
given in [] brackets, use this parameters to make the
program read the other number first. This does not affect
decoding <br>
of files with only one or neither type of brackets. If you
prefer, you can also use the option as -b[]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Read &quot;minus
smartness&quot;. This option turns off automatic part number
detection from the subject line. Try this option if xdeview
fails to parse the subject line correctly <br>
and makes errors at guessing part numbers, resulting in
incorrect ordering of the parts. With this option, parts are
always put together sequentially (so the parts must be <br>
correctly ordered in the input file). Note: The correct part
number found in proper MIME files is still evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Use plaintext messages.
Usually, XDeview only presents encoded data for decoding.
With this option set, text parts from MIME messages and
non-encoded messages are also <br>
offered. Plaintext messages frequently don&rsquo;t have an
associated filename, so they&rsquo;re assigned a unique name
from a sequential four-digit number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIN MENU <br>
The main window of xdeview is composed of six main elements.
At the top is the Menu Bar. Centered is the File List, which
lists all the files that have been detected in the <br>
encoded data and are ready for decoding. Left of the File
List is the Status List, which describes the status of each
file. Usually, this list will show &quot;OK&quot; for all
files, as <br>
display of erroneous files is normally suppressed. On the
right is a bunch of short-cut buttons with the most
heavily-used functions. At the bottom of the window is the
Save <br>
Path entry field, and the status bar. Each of these items
will be described individually in the following text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU BAR <br>
File Menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load ... <br>
Loads encoded files. These files are then scanned for
encoded data and files; these files are added to the File
List. You can also select directories, which are <br>
then recursively descended into</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encode Encode file(s), storing
the encoded data on disk, sending them via email, or posting
them to newsgroups. See below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Helpers <br>
Xdeview reads information from your .mailcap and .mime.types
to perform the appropriate default action when you hit the
&quot;Execute&quot; button. In this dialogue, you can <br>
configure the locations of these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save Setup <br>
Saves all current options, the input and output file paths
etc. into the .xdeviewrc file in your home directory. This
file is automatically read upon startup, so <br>
the saved settings will be set by default in future
sessions. The resource file is actually a Tcl script which
you can edit with any editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit Exits the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
Set various options that modify the behaviour of the
program. Note that most options only catch for files read
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fast Scanning <br>
Sets fast scanning mode. The program will then assume that
all input files contain at most one encoded part (as it is
true with files from a news spool). The scan&acirc; <br>
ning engine will be sped up because it does not have to read
each input file completely but stops scanning after encoded
data has been found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The decoder has to disable some
safety options in fast mode, so certain problems with the
file will only be detected when finally decoding the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Overwrite <br>
When decoding a file which is already present in the target
directory, the user will be asked whether the file shall be
overwritten. By enabling this option, target <br>
files will be overwritten without asking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Desperate Mode <br>
Usually, you will only be presented files to which all parts
have been found. Enabling Desperate Mode, you&rsquo;ll also
get to see the other files as well, with an <br>
appropriate description of the problem in the Status List.
In desperate mode, the decoder will also try to detect short
Base64 files outside of MIME messages. This <br>
is normally disabled, because these desperate tries to find
Base64 encoding may cause misdetection of encoded data,
again resulting in invalid files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose Mode <br>
Opens a separate text box to which additional messages will
be written while scanning the input files. These messages
are extremely helpful for finding out what <br>
went wrong if files cannot be decoded properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternate Bracket Policy <br>
Changes the heuristics by which the decoder tries to extract
a part number from the subject line. The algorithm usually
gives numbers in braces () higher priority <br>
than numbers in brackets []. If both kinds of brackets are
present, and their use is conflicting (for example if both
the part number and a series number are <br>
given), then you may have to explicitely select the bracket
policy. If this option is false (default), then the
&quot;part number&quot; is taken from the braces (),
otherwise <br>
from the brackets [].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumb Mode <br>
Disables automatic part number detection by parsing the
subject line. Use if xdeview fails to pick up the correct
part numbers. Note that with the option set, the <br>
parts must be correctly ordered in the input files. Also,
missing parts will not be detected this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handle Text Files <br>
Usually, XDeview only presents encoded data for decoding.
With this option set, text parts from MIME messages and
non-encoded messages are also offered. Plaintext <br>
messages frequently don&rsquo;t have an associated filename,
so they&rsquo;re assigned a unique name from a sequential
four-digit number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto Info <br>
Opens up the information window whenever you click on a file
in the File List.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove Input Files <br>
With this option set, input files are removed if any file
was successfully decoded from them. Use with care! UUDeview
only checks if any data was decoded from an <br>
input file, but does not care about any other contents of
that input file, or whether a file also held an incomplete
attachment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME Compliance <br>
Be more strict when reading MIME input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decode Decode the selected
file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename Rename the selected
file(s), for example if the filename conflicts with existing
files, or if the name doesn&rsquo;t meet system
limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decode All <br>
Decode all files currently visible in the File List.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info Displays available info on
the currently selected file (if more than one file is
selected, only info for the first will be displayed). This
is the zeroeth part of <br>
a file, if available, or the header of the first part up to
the beginning of encoded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute <br>
Runs an external program with the currently selected file. A
program is selected by first looking at the Content-Type of
the message, if available, then by checking <br>
the file&rsquo;s extension. The appropriate information is
read from your .mailcap and .mime.types files (although the
handling of information in .mailcap files is cur&acirc; <br>
rently incomplete). If no matching type is found, a dialog
box pops up where you can enter any command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List Text File <br>
This is for the rare cases when a text file has been sent
through the net in encoded form. Use this action only when
you know the file in question is in fact a text <br>
file, otherwise you&rsquo;ll get a load of trash on the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About A short message from the
Author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">License <br>
Displays the license under which xdeview is distributed, the
GPL. Read it, or you&rsquo;ll hear from my lawyers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE LIST <br>
The File List is a list box displaying all the files that
have been picked up while scanning the encoded data. These
files are ready for decoding, previewing or anything. The
<br>
list can be scrolled using the scrollbar on the right of the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual files can be selected
simply by clicking on them. Multiple files can be selected
by holding down the CTRL key and clicking on the individual
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS LIST <br>
The Status Lists notes the corresponding status for each
file in the File List, Usually, you&rsquo;ll just see
&quot;OK&quot; here; otherwise, an error message is shown
describing why the file <br>
cannot be decoded properly. There are the following
states:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK All parts of the file have
been found, and the encoded data looks correct on first
sight. There are certain problems that might only appear
when decoding the file, but <br>
usually everything is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incomplete <br>
This file is missing one or more parts. If you decode this
file, the output data will be corrupt and usually
unusable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No Begin <br>
The file doesn&rsquo;t have a beginning. The decoded file
will be most certainly corrupt and unusable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No End No end was found on the
file. This usually means that one or more parts at the end
are missing. The degree of usefulness of a decoded file
depends on the file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error A previous attempt to
decode the file has failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHORT-CUT BUTTONS <br>
The buttons on the right side of the window are short-cuts
for the menu items. Read the discussion of the Main Menu
items above for an explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAVE PATH <br>
This is the path where decoded files will be written to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS <br>
A short message what the program is currently doing or what
it expects you to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCODING MENU <br>
When encoding files (&quot;Encode&quot; from the
&quot;File&quot; menu), a large dialog box opens where you
can set various options for the file. If you selected
multiple files for encoding, a sta&acirc; <br>
tus line at the top displays the number of files left. The
dialog itself stays open until all files have been
handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename <br>
The current file to encode. You cannot edit this field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send As <br>
The file name by which the file will be sent. Defaults to
the filename stripped of all directory information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Subject <br>
When mailing or posting, this text will be used as subject.
The filename and part numbers are added automatically, so
you can choose to leave this line empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines per File <br>
Sets the number of encoded lines per part. Bigger files will
be automatically split into multiple parts. Use if you are
posting files to a newsgroup, or if the recipient&rsquo;s
<br>
system cannot handle large files. A good splitting size is
1000 lines. &quot;0&quot; lines means not to split.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... Encoding <br>
Selects the encoding method to use. If you wonder which
one&rsquo;s the best, you might find a clue in my article
&quot;Introduction to Decoding&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File In (Path) <br>
Sets a directory where to encode the file to. The encoding
will go to files with the same base name as the original
file, but with extensions of .001, .002 (depending on <br>
the number of necessary parts as enforced by the &quot;Lines
per File&quot; setting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Email To <br>
Give a comma-separated list of email addresses. This option
might be disabled if your system does not allow sending of
emails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Post To <br>
Here you can enter a comma-separated list of newsgroups to
which the file should be posted. This option might be
disabled if your system does not support posting news.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NNTP Server <br>
This field only appears on some systems, in the case that a
news host is needed, but none was configured at
compile-time. If this field does appear, you must enter a
valid <br>
host name here in order for posting to work. If you
don&rsquo;t want to post the file anyway, don&rsquo;t worry
about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK Performs the selected
action(s) on this file and skips to the next one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK to All <br>
Uses these settings for each file in question (does not
prompt you for the other files), thus sending all files at
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next Does not encode the file
and skips to the next one (sorry, there&rsquo;s no button to
skip backwards).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cancel Cancels encoding and
returns to the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP FILE <br>
If it exists, the file .xdeviewrc in your home directory
will be executed in the Tcl interpreter during program
initialization. It must be a valid Tcl program, which you
can use <br>
to set certain options by default. For the Tcl-illaterate:
variables can be set using the following syntax: <br>
set var_name value <br>
The following variables (options) can be set (look at the
text above for an explanation of what they&rsquo;re
doing)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OptionFast <br>
If set to 1, use fast scanning mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OptionBracket <br>
If set to 1, use the alternate bracket policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OptionOverwrite <br>
If set to 1, assume it&rsquo;s Ok to overwrite files without
asking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OptionDesperate <br>
If set to 1, switch into desperate mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OptionVerbose <br>
If set to 1, print progress messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveFilePath <br>
This is a string variable with the default Save Path, where
you want decoded files to go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EncodeMaxLines <br>
Maximum number of lines per file for encoding. &quot;0&quot;
for unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EncodeEncoding <br>
Default encoding to use. &quot;0&quot; for UUencoding,
&quot;1&quot; for XXencoding and &quot;2&quot; for Base64
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NNTPServer <br>
The address of your NNTP server (only needed on some
systems). Can also be set (preferredly) in your environment
variable NNTPSERVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME MESSGAGES <br>
If you have enabled verbose mode, progress messages will
appear in an own text window titled Runtime Messages. The
messages generated during the scanning phase are extremely
<br>
helpful in tracing what the program does, and can be used to
figure out the reason why files cannot be decoded, if you
understand them. This section explains how to interpret <br>
them. Understanding this section is not necessary to operate
the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, there are
&quot;Loading&quot; messages, which begin with the string
&quot;Loaded&quot;. Each line should feature the following
items:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source File <br>
The first item is the source file from which a part was
loaded. Many parts can be detected within a single file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject Line <br>
The complete subject is reproduced in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Identifier <br>
The program derives a unique identification for this thread
from the subject line, for grouping articles that look like
they belong to the same file. The result of this <br>
algorithm is presented in braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename <br>
If a filename was detected on the subject line or within the
data (for example, on a begin line, or as part of the
Content-Type information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Part Number <br>
The part number derived from the subject line, or, in the
case of properly MIME-formatted messages, from the
&quot;part&quot; information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Begin/End <br>
If a &quot;begin&quot; or &quot;end&quot; token was
detected, it is printed here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding Type <br>
If encoded data was detected within this part, either
&quot;UUdata&quot;, &quot;Base64&quot;, &quot;XXdata&quot;
or &quot;Binhex&quot; is printed here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More messages are printed after
scanning has completed. A single line will be printed for
each group of articles. The contents of this line are best
understood by looking at an <br>
example. Here is one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Found &rsquo;mailfile.gz&rsquo;
State 16 UUData Parts begin 1 2 3 4 5 end 6 OK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This indicates that the file
mailfile.gz has been found. The file was uuencoded
(&quot;UUData&quot;) and consists of 6 parts. The
&quot;begin&quot; token was found in the first part, and the
&quot;end&quot; <br>
token was found in the sixth part. Because it looks like
everything&rsquo;s there, this file is tagged as being
&quot;OK&quot;. The State is a set of bits, where the
following values may be <br>
or&rsquo;ed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Missing Part</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 No Begin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 No End</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 No encoded data found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 File looks Ok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32 An error occured during
decoding of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 File was successfully
decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If you cannot execute xdeview, and it reports something like
&quot;command not found&quot;, but are sure that the file
itself can be found, check the reference to the main file
uuwish at <br>
the top of the file.</p>
