<i>XDeview</i> is a smart decoder for attachments that you have received in
  encoded form via electronic mail or from the usenet. It is similar to the
  standard <b>uudecode</b>(1) command, yet with more comfort and flexibility.
  <i>XDeview</i> supports the <i>uuencoding, xxencoding, Base64</i> and
  <i>BinHex</i> encoding methods, and is able to handle split-files (which have
  been sent in multiple parts) as well as multiple files at once, thus greatly
  simplifying the decoding process. Usually, you will not have to manually edit
  files to prepare them for decoding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you don't really need a graphical frontend for these kinds of jobs, have a
  look at <b>uudeview</b>(1) and <b>uuenview</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
After invoking the program, it will scan all the given files for encoded data.
  If any of them were directories, they will be recursively dived into. You
  don't need to give files on the command line; you can also select files later
  from within the program. After completing the initial scan, you will be
  presented with a list of files that seem like they can be decoded properly.
  You can then pick files individually for decoding.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
There's no real need to set options on the command line; they can also be set
  from within the program. Note that options must be preceded by a double-hyphen
  '--', otherwise they might be mistaken for display options.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the program into desperate mode. It will then offer
      you to decode incomplete files. This is useful if you are missing the last
      part of a 50-parts posting, but in most cases the desperately-decoded
      files will simply be corrupt and unusable. The degree of usefulness of an
      incomplete file depends on the file type.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Uses fast mode for file scanning. The program assumes that
      each input file holds at most one part, which is usually true for files in
      a news spool directory. This option <b>breaks decoding</b> of input files
      with multiple articles. Also, certain sanity checks are disabled, probably
      causing erroneous files to be presented for decoding. Sometimes you'll get
      error messages when decoding, sometimes you'll just receive invalid files.
      Don't use <b>-f</b> if you can't live with these problems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Gives the OK to overwrite files already there on decoding.
      The default is to prompt the user whether to overwrite, rename or skip the
      file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disables verbosity. Normally, the program prints some
      status messages while reading the input files, which can be very helpful
      if something should go wrong. Use if these messages disturb you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p path</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the path where decoded files shall be written to. This
      must be a valid pathname, or you'll get errors when trying to decode
      anything. Defaults to the current working directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This changes <i>xdeview's</i> policy of finding a part
      number on a subject line and may only be needed in some rare cases when
      part numbers are found in () parentheses as well as in [] brackets, for
      example in a series of multi-part postings. By default, <i>xdeview</i>
      uses the numbers found in () parentheses first. But if this number
      indicates the file's number in the series and the part number is given in
      [] brackets, use this parameters to make the program read the other number
      first. This does not affect decoding of files with only one or neither
      type of brackets. If you prefer, you can also use the option as
      <b>-b[]</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Read &quot;minus smartness&quot;. This option turns off
      automatic part number detection from the subject line. Try this option if
      <i>xdeview</i> fails to parse the subject line correctly and makes errors
      at guessing part numbers, resulting in incorrect ordering of the parts.
      With this option, parts are always put together sequentially (so the parts
      must be correctly ordered in the input file). <b>Note:</b> The correct
      part number found in proper <i>MIME</i> files is still evaluated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use plaintext messages. Usually, XDeview only presents
      encoded data for decoding. With this option set, text parts from
      <i>MIME</i> messages and non-encoded messages are also offered. Plaintext
      messages frequently don't have an associated filename, so they're assigned
      a unique name from a sequential four-digit number.</dd>

The main window of <i>xdeview</i> is composed of six main elements. At the top
  is the <i>Menu Bar.</i> Centered is the <i>File List,</i> which lists all the
  files that have been detected in the encoded data and are ready for decoding.
  Left of the File List is the <i>Status List,</i> which describes the status of
  each file. Usually, this list will show &quot;OK&quot; for all files, as
  display of erroneous files is normally suppressed. On the right is a bunch of
  short-cut buttons with the most heavily-used functions. At the bottom of the
  window is the <i>Save Path</i> entry field, and the status bar. Each of these
  items will be described individually in the following text.

      Base64 files outside of MIME messages. This is normally disabled, because
      these desperate tries to find Base64 encoding may cause misdetection of

      numbers in braces () higher priority than numbers in brackets []. If both
      kinds of brackets are present, and their use is conflicting (for example
      if both the part number and a series number are given), then you may have
      to explicitely select the bracket policy. If this option is false
      (default), then the &quot;part number&quot; is taken from the braces (),
      otherwise from the brackets [].</dd>

First, there are &quot;Loading&quot; messages, which begin with the string
  &quot;Loaded&quot;. Each line should feature the following items:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Source File</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The first item is the source file from which a part was
      loaded. Many parts can be detected within a single file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Subject Line</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The complete subject is reproduced in single quotes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Identifier</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The program derives a unique identification for this thread
      from the subject line, for grouping articles that look like they belong to
      the same file. The result of this algorithm is presented in braces.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Filename</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a filename was detected on the subject line or within
      the data (for example, on a begin line, or as part of the Content-Type
      information).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Part Number</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The part number derived from the subject line, or, in the
      case of properly MIME-formatted messages, from the &quot;part&quot;
      information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Begin/End</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a &quot;begin&quot; or &quot;end&quot; token was
      detected, it is printed here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Encoding Type</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If encoded data was detected within this part, either
      &quot;UUdata&quot;, &quot;Base64&quot;, &quot;XXdata&quot; or
      &quot;Binhex&quot; is printed here.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
More messages are printed after scanning has completed. A single line will be
  printed for each group of articles. The contents of this line are best
  understood by looking at an example. Here is one:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Found 'mailfile.gz' State 16 UUData Parts begin 1 2 3 4 5 end 6 OK</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This indicates that the file <i>mailfile.gz</i> has been found. The file was
  uuencoded (&quot;UUData&quot;) and consists of 6 parts. The &quot;begin&quot;
  token was found in the first part, and the &quot;end&quot; token was found in
  the sixth part. Because it looks like everything's there, this file is tagged
  as being &quot;OK&quot;. The <i>State</i> is a set of bits, where the
  following values may be or'ed:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Missing Part</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No Begin</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>4</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No End</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>8</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No encoded data found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>16</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">File looks Ok</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>32</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An error occured during decoding of the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>64</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">File was successfully decoded.</dd>

If you cannot execute <i>xdeview,</i> and it reports something like
  &quot;command not found&quot;, but are sure that the file itself can be found,
  check the reference to the main file <i>uuwish</i> at the top of the file.
