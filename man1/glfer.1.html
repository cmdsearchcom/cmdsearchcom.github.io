<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
glfer - spectrogram display and QRSS keyer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
glfer [OPTIONS] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
glfer is a program that displays the power spectrum of a
signal as a function of time in a format known as a
waterfall display; this is also called a spectrogram. The
horizontal <br>
axis represents time. The time scale depends on the sample
rate and the number of points per FFT. The vertical axis
represents frequency, from DC to the Nyquist frequency (half
<br>
the sample rate). The estimated power of the input signal is
indicated by the color; the spectrogram window has an
automatic gain control (AGC) that ensures always the maximum
<br>
visual contrast and which, in the current version, cannot be
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resizing the main window in the
horizontal direction just changes the length of the time
scale; resizing it in the vertical direction enlarges the
portion of spectrum shown in <br>
the window. The entire spectrum can be seen by scrolling the
spectrogram window using the scrollbar on the right. Moving
the mouse pointer on the spectrogram window shows the <br>
frequency corresponding to the pointer position and the
signal power at that frequency on the status line at the
bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first time glfer is run it
will ask to select a control port (serial or parallel) for
the TX keying functions; if the mouse is connected to the
serial port be sure NOT to <br>
select its serial port for controlling the TX otherwise the
system may hang. All the settings can be saved to a
configuration file; in this case they will be automatically
<br>
loaded when glfer is launched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the program
must be run as root (or suid root) to gain access to the
transmitter control (parallel or serial) port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may have to use a separate
mixer program to adjust the input volume and to enable the
desired input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECTRAL ESTIMATORS <br>
glfer can use several different spectral estimators to
compute the input signal power spectrum:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Periodogram <br>
the &quot;classical&quot; periodogram, which is obtained as
the squared amplitude of the discrete Fourier transform,
after tapering the data with a &quot;window function&quot;
selectable among the <br>
Hanning, Blackman, Gaussian, Welch, Bartlett, Rectangular,
Hamming and Kaiser types. As usual, the FFT number of points
and the overlap between data blocks can be freely
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multitaper method <br>
The multitaper method is a weighted combination of
periodograms computed with different windows, all belonging
to the same family and having certain peculiar
properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method was described by
David J. Thomson in &quot;Spectrum Estimation and Harmonic
Analysis&quot;, Proc. IEEE, vol.70, Sep. 1982. Besides the
FFT size and overlap, it is possible to <br>
change also a relative bandwidth parameter and the number of
windows to use for the analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method requires more CPU
power than the first one, due to the fact that several FFTs
are performed on the same block of data, using different
windows. The resulting spectrum <br>
is similar to a classical periodogram, but with much less
variance (i.e. less variation in the background noise
[speckle]). Performances are also similar to the
periodogram, <br>
maybe it makes detection of QRSS signals a little easier,
but this doesn&rsquo;t means they are always more
readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">High performance ARMA <br>
The (so called) &quot;high performance&quot; ARMA model
assumes that the input signal is composed only of white
noise plus a certain number of sinusoids and tries to
extract the relevant <br>
parameters (sinusoids frequency and strenght) from the
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference article for this
implementation is &quot;Spectral An Overdetermined Rational
Model Equation Approach&quot;, by James A. Cadzow, Proc.
IEEE, vol.70, Sep. 1982.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At present this method is still
experimental. There are two parameters that can be varied: t
is the number of samples used for computing the samples
autocorrelation and p_e is <br>
the order of the AR model. This latter must be less than t,
and both number should be fairly small in order not to
overload the CPU. The number of sinusoids is estimated
autimat&acirc; <br>
ically from the samples autocorrelation. Use the default
numbers as a starting point and experiment! Unfortunately
this spectral estimator performs poorly with non-white noise
<br>
(as we have usually in the RX audio, due to the IF filters)
and high noise levels. On the other hand it provides a very
good visual SNR with signals not buried in the noise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LMP <br>
This method is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --device FILE <br>
use FILE as audio device (default: /dev/dsp)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --file FILENAME <br>
take audio input from FILENAME (WAV format)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sample_rate RATE <br>
set audio sample rate to RATE Hertz (default: 8000)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n N number of points per FFT to
N (preferably a power of 2, default: 1024)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print the help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
display the version of glfer and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.glferrc <br>
User startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There was some report of problems in the audio acquisition
routine, it seems that some audio card/driver don&rsquo;t
work well with select; this needs further investigation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
Maybe the Spectrogram should scroll as in other programs,
all the picture moving right to left</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jason decoder (in progress)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrogram speed independent of
FFT size</p>
