<b>glfer</b> [ <i>OPTIONS</i>] ...
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>glfer</b> is a program that displays the power spectrum of a signal as a
  function of time in a format known as a waterfall display; this is also called
  a <b>spectrogram.</b> The horizontal axis represents time. The time scale
  depends on the sample rate and the number of points per FFT. The vertical axis
  represents frequency, from DC to the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate).
  The estimated power of the input signal is indicated by the color; the
  spectrogram window has an automatic gain control (AGC) that ensures always the
  maximum visual contrast and which, in the current version, cannot be disabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Resizing the main window in the horizontal direction just changes the length of
  the time scale; resizing it in the vertical direction enlarges the portion of
  spectrum shown in the window. The entire spectrum can be seen by scrolling the
  spectrogram window using the scrollbar on the right. Moving the mouse pointer
  on the spectrogram window shows the frequency corresponding to the pointer
  position and the signal power at that frequency on the status line at the
  bottom.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first time glfer is run it will ask to select a control port (serial or
  parallel) for the TX keying functions; if the mouse is connected to the serial
  port be sure NOT to select its serial port for controlling the TX otherwise
  the system may hang. All the settings can be saved to a configuration file; in
  this case they will be automatically loaded when glfer is launched.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that the program must be run as root (or suid root) to gain access
  to the transmitter control (parallel or serial) port.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may have to use a separate mixer program to adjust the input volume and to
  enable the desired input.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SPECTRAL_ESTIMATORS"><a class="selflink" href="#SPECTRAL_ESTIMATORS">SPECTRAL
  ESTIMATORS</a></h1>
<i>glfer</i> can use several different spectral estimators to compute the input
  signal power spectrum:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Periodogram"><a class="selflink" href="#Periodogram">Periodogram</a></h2>
the &quot;classical&quot; periodogram, which is obtained as the squared
  amplitude of the discrete Fourier transform, after tapering the data with a
  &quot;window function&quot; selectable among the Hanning, Blackman, Gaussian,
  Welch, Bartlett, Rectangular, Hamming and Kaiser types. As usual, the FFT
  number of points and the overlap between data blocks can be freely changed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Multitaper_method"><a class="selflink" href="#Multitaper_method">Multitaper
  method</a></h2>
The multitaper method is a weighted combination of periodograms computed with
  different windows, all belonging to the same family and having certain
  peculiar properties.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This method was described by David J. Thomson in &quot;Spectrum Estimation and
  Harmonic Analysis&quot;, Proc. IEEE, vol.70, Sep. 1982. Besides the FFT size
  and overlap, it is possible to change also a relative bandwidth parameter and
  the number of windows to use for the analysis.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This method requires more CPU power than the first one, due to the fact that
  several FFTs are performed on the same block of data, using different windows.
  The resulting spectrum is similar to a classical periodogram, but with much
  less variance (i.e. less variation in the background noise [speckle]).
  Performances are also similar to the periodogram, maybe it makes detection of
  QRSS signals a little easier, but this doesn't means they are always more
  readable.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="High_performance_ARMA"><a class="selflink" href="#High_performance_ARMA">High
  performance ARMA</a></h2>
The (so called) &quot;high performance&quot; ARMA model assumes that the input
  signal is composed only of white noise plus a certain number of sinusoids and
  tries to extract the relevant parameters (sinusoids frequency and strenght)
  from the data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reference article for this implementation is &quot;Spectral An Overdetermined
  Rational Model Equation Approach&quot;, by James A. Cadzow, Proc. IEEE,
  vol.70, Sep. 1982.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At present this method is still experimental. There are two parameters that can
  be varied: t is the number of samples used for computing the samples
  autocorrelation and p_e is the order of the AR model. This latter must be less
  than t, and both number should be fairly small in order not to overload the
  CPU. The number of sinusoids is estimated autimatically from the samples
  autocorrelation. Use the default numbers as a starting point and experiment!
  Unfortunately this spectral estimator performs poorly with non-white noise (as
  we have usually in the RX audio, due to the IF filters) and high noise levels.
  On the other hand it provides a very good visual SNR with signals not buried
  in the noise
